For example, go ahead and grab our iPhone 7 marketing wallpapers, from the Apple website. In addition, Apple used what appears to be amorphous droplets in a variety of colors to highlight the iPhone 7, but neglected to put them in the iOS 10 GM. Thankfully, with the release of iOS 10.2 beta 1, the wallpapers are now included. If you do not have a dev account and the latest beta, you will be waiting for the images. Additionally, these wallpapers appear to be available only for iPhone 7, so this might be your only chance to get your hands on them if you don‚Äôt have the latest device. iOS 10.2 beta 1 droplets wallpapers You can download variations of this wallpapers in¬†yellow,¬†red,¬†and¬†blue. According to 9to5Mac, the wallpapers¬†were extracted directly from the beta. The large, square files should make for great wallpapers on iPhone or iPad. If you ever have a great set of images, wallpaper tips/tricks, or want to stay in touch, find me on Twitter @jim_gresham. Follow along for fresh finds. Often my conversations with iDB readers, lead to great Wallpapers of the Week posts. Live droplet wallpapers Thanks to a tip from Twitter, @jazielbaca, you can also have these wallpapers set as Live wallpapers on devices with 3D Touch. Using the app Black Lite ‚Äì Live Wallpapers, you can download live versions of these wallpapers in yellow, red, blue, and green. ¬†The app prompts users to download the Live wallpaper to Camera Roll. Then, from the Photos or Settings app, set the image as a Live wallpaper. Like the stock Live wallpapers, simply 3D Touch the image to animate! The images¬†are not quite photo quality, but we have been frequently asked how to make these animate on iOS devices. Thanks for the tip!

Also, am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt care about having a Live photo as a wallpaper? Y2J: Keeper of the List I don‚Äôt care about Live Photos either, especially since they don‚Äôt do anything on the home screen.

A press release touting Bell Fibe TV as the first Canadian TV service available on Apple TV as an app made us think, for a moment, Bell was untethering its subscription TV service from its network, making the TV service available nationwide to anyone with an Apple TV box. That‚Äôs not the case however. While Fibe TV is now available on Apple TV, it‚Äôs only for existing or new Bell customers who are also Apple fans, so that they can have their music, photos, games, favourite apps ‚Äì and TV ‚Äì all together in one place. Customers who want to use the Fibe TV app still must have the Fibe TV set top box/DVR as their primary gateway to Fibe and then they can use their Apple TV box or boxes as a secondary device with the app, said Nicolas Poitras, vice-president of Bell Residential Service, in an interview. ‚ÄúYou need a Fibe TV subscription and right now that requires a Bell Fibe Internet service (with unlimited Internet) and a Bell Fibe TV service, so once you‚Äôve got those two things, you can use Apple TV to access our services,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúApple TV will be a great secondary device.‚Äù Customers can watch live TV and access on-demand titles through the Fibe app and fourth-generation Apple TV box on any of their Apple smart phones or tablets, too. Before the end of the year, Bell will allow customers to watch shows recorded on the main DVR ‚Äì with full pause, rewind and fast-forward capabilities. Customers can also use the app to see trending shows, set recordings and some limited Siri functionality (‚ÄúSiri, find me Big Bang Theory‚Äù) is coming, too. However, Bell‚Äôs re-start feature, where viewers can join a show already in progress and start over at the beginning, is not yet ready to be used via the app and won‚Äôt be until some time in 2017. When asked whether or not Bell considered making a Fibe TV subscription a completely stand alone app in the Apple world available to all Canadians regardless of their broadband provider, which could perhaps pull in more paying customers who are cord-cutters or cord-nevers who watch YouTube, Netflix and other content through their Apple TV and broadband connection only, Poitras said it‚Äôs not something customers are asking for, nor is the company ready for. (Ed note: There would be some significant technical, copyright and regulatory hurdles in the way of that, too.) ‚ÄúApple TV will be a great secondary device.‚Äù ‚Äì Nicolas Poitras, Bell Canada ‚ÄúAt this point in time, we feel as though consumers do want a full fledged service,‚Äù he added, noting that as long as Fibe TV is being run by Bell on the Bell network, the company can guarantee quality of signal ‚Äì something it can‚Äôt do if the video were just riding over the open internet. Poitras would not comment on how many of its Fibe TV customers they believe have an Apple TV device or if the company is working on an app for other environments such as Roku or PlayStation. ‚ÄúThe Apple TV as a box is definitely the most widespread in Canada,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIts CPU power really allows us to bring the Fibe TV presence to a whole new level. ‚ÄúWe think there is a lot we can do with Apple and they‚Äôre the partner we are focused on now,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe think anyone who has an Apple TV will seriously consider Fibe simply because they are avid users of Apple products and use them a lot and if they can expand the amount of content that‚Äôs accessible on their box, we think there‚Äôs a large number of people who will be interested in that‚Ä¶ Apple fans are quite loyal to the brand.‚Äù The Fibe app on Apple TV is also only available to Bell customers in Ontario and Quebec and will come to Bell's Atlantic region next eyar.

No iPhone SE Refresh in 2017, Analyst Claims GO Apple plans to extend the current iPhone SE's lifecycle Nov 5, 2016 22:44 GMT ¬†¬∑¬† By Andrei Vlad ¬†¬∑¬† Share:¬† The small but powerful iPhone SE is aimed at fans loyal to the first smartphones launched, hence the reduced-size display. Unveiled back in March, the iPhone SE did pretty well on the market, otherwise we can't see a reason for Apple to want to prolong the phone's lifecycle. Obviously, Apple is not going to confirm any of its iPhone plans for next year, but one well-connected analyst might have it right this time. According to Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is not going to release a new iPhone SE model next year, so we're only going to see the next-generation iPhone. The reason behind Apple's decision may have something to do with the fact that the launch of a smaller, more affordable iPhone SE could reduce sales of the iPhone 8 considerably. However, Kuo mentions that Apple is unlikely to launch a new iPhone SE model in the second fiscal quarter of 2017, which ends in March. Still, that doesn't mean that Apple couldn't launch it later next year. Apparently, Apple's decision to cut out the iPhone SE next year is a direct result of the lower gross margin guidance than the company expected for the first fiscal quarter of 2017. Apple iPhone SE During the latest conference call, Apple has announced that it forecasts gross margins between 38 percent and 38.5 percent until the end of 2016, slightly lower than the company's expectations. The Cupertino-based phone maker was expecting gross margins of more than 39 percent, but apparently failed to deliver. Kuo believes that Apple will be able to ship between 40 million and 50 million iPhone units for the current quarter, about 1.2 million units less compared to last year. For the second quarter of 2017, Kuo forecasts total iPhone shipments volume to amount to about 35-40 million units, just 400k units shy of the amount shipped last year. ¬† CHECK OUT THE GALLERY ¬†(2 Images) #iPhone SE#Apple iPhone#next-gen iPhone#iPhone 6 SE#iPhone 8 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related ¬†¬∑¬† Hot right now ¬†¬∑¬† Latest news Despite Rumors, Apple Might Not Launch a 5-Inch iPhone 8 Version in 2017 Apple Could Launch a 5.0-inch iPhone 8, Report Claims Apple to Skip iPhone 8 and 9, Launch 2017 Model as ‚ÄúiPhone 10,‚Äù Analyst Says Why Some iPhone 7 Models Are Faster than Others and How to Tell If Yours Is Slow OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE Salix Xfce 14.2 Live Edition Released, It's Based on Xfce 4.12 & Slackware 14.2 2 photos ¬†¬† Apple iPhone SE new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Donald Trump‚Äôs 45% Tariff on China Exports Could Backfire Against the iPhone more on: Apple i softpedia¬Æ ¬† ¬†¬†Like 202K ¬†¬†¬†+1 56K ¬† ¬†¬†Follow 13K ¬© 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Picture by Prashant Mitra Ranchi, Nov. 5: Ageless arghya is meeting new-age Facetime at a Bariatu home in Ranchi this Chhath. Former RIMS radiology head of the department Dr Chandra Mohan (61) and his wife Kumud (57), a professor at Manrakhan Mahto BEd College, are celebrating Chhath with their children Neeraj and Neha, both techies working in the US, through Facetime, a videotelephony feature developed by Apple, on their iPhones. "We are separated by oceans but together online," smiled Kumud, busy with Chhath preparations. "Thanks to the fact that our children work far away, we've become tech savvy." "We shared nahay khay rituals yesterday on Facetime with them and did the same with kharna today," an excited Dr Mohan said. "We will also set up tripods with our two iPhones carefully near the water tank inside our residence when my wife offers arghya on Sunday evening and Monday morning." Kumud started observing Chhath in 1989, when Neeraj and Neha, now 35 and 32, were schoolkids. Now, Neeraj is working with Credit Suisse in North Carolina, while Neha is with Apple Inc. in California. The siblings try to come home every year and stay from Diwali to Chhath, but sometimes, like this year, professional commitments keep both away. But, the Mohans are pretty happy with Facetime that glues them together despite the distance. Last year, Neeraj could not come to Ranchi but Neha could, the parents recalled. "Neha arranged online viewing for Neeraj, our daughter-in-law Archana and grandson Aadit. It was great fun," Kumud said. "For us, it is like cutting the huge distance between the two continents and bringing our children home," Dr Mohan added. But, the time zones will be mighty different, the parents said. "I will offer the evening arghya on Sunday around 5pm, Indian Standard Time. It will be 7.30am for my son Neeraj at North Carolina and 4.30am for my daughter Neha at California. And, my Monday morning arghya time will be Sunday evening time for both of them. Still, the big thing is they can watch me do the rituals and we can we all together as family," Kumud said. Asked whether they fear network glitches during Facetime, which is very common in Ranchi, Kumud said: "Fortunately, I have not come across such troubles. And because it is Chhath, I am sure the sun god and Chhathi maiya will take care of the arrangements so that my children do not miss out on any ritual." "It is god's blessing that they are well settled, so when official compulsions keep them away, we understand," said Dr Mohan. "But, they will be on the screen at home only," smiled Kumud. ¬†More stories in Front Page Delhi schools to stay shut for 3 days as air pollution worsens AAP, Congress playing politics over missing JNU student: BJP 2 soldiers killed, 5 injured in Pakistani firing along LoC ¬† Parliament must accept Brexit vote was legitimate: UK PM May May seeks to boost trade ties with India Garden where ban blooms Baagon mein bahaar hai, Barack?

Mobile 6 0 0 November 5, 2016 No New Apple iPhone SE Release In March 2017, Only iPad Air 3 & iPad Pro 2? Venus Montalbo The latest Apple rumor mill churns out the possibility of a simultaneous release for the iPad Pro 2 and iPad Air 3 next year. Meanwhile, Apple fans might not see a new iPhone SE, at least, during the first quarter of 2017. Apple‚Äôs small-form factor iPhone SE has not even celebrated its first birthday yet but specs and release rumors about its next-generation model are already going around online. The iPhone SE was first introduced March of this year and with the usual annual upgrades for mobile devices, some speculations are now suggesting that a new version of the 4-inch iPhone could be set for release around the same time next year. DBS Designing, a YouTube channel, has even made an iPhone SE concept video, which shows the Apple phone with a full-screen display and highly-advanced specs. Watch it below. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCulFBveiaw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> However, if the recent claim of analyst Ming-chi Kuo is to be believed, as cited by Apple Insider, the updated version of the iPhone SE will not get a March 2017 release as Apple wants to further increase gross margins and protect the latest flagship devices from more in-house competition. ‚ÄúIn a note to investors obtained by AppleInsider on Friday, Kuo says Apple will prolong iPhone SE‚Äôs lifecycle beyond the usual one year rotation in a bid to boost gross margins and minimize cannibalization of high-end flagships like the iPhone 7,‚Äù the report explained. A new iPhone SE may not arrive early next year but tech enthusiasts can still look forward to other rumored Apple devices ‚Äî the two updated versions of iPads in particular. The March 2017 launch timeframe also pops up when talking about the rumored release of the next-gen iOS slates with the latest grapevines telling us that both the iPad Air 3 and iPad Pro 2 could take the spotlight during an Apple event taking place before the first quarter of 2017 ends. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Going over the iPad Pro‚Äôs release history, the very first model (12.9-inch Retina display) was revealed September 2015 and its 9.7-inch variant arrived six months later. The tech industry, looking forward to the next upgrade, unsurprisingly expected an iPad Pro 2 debut at Apple‚Äôs September 2016 event. But unfortunately, it did not mention any new iPad, thus, making the release speculations for iPad Pro 2 shift now to a March 2017 launch. Moreover, PC Advisor explained why there might be a need for the Cupertino-based tech to wait for early 2017 before releasing any upgraded version of the iPad Pro, especially if they are planning to use a more advanced chipset. ‚ÄúThe current A9X chip ‚Äì which is used by both iPad Pro models ‚Äì is based on the 16nm FinFET process, the same used by the new generation of graphics cards from nVidia and AMD. In order to produce a chip with significantly faster performance without high power consumption, Apple will have to wait until chip manufacturers are ready to move down to 10nm, which is rumoured to be late in 2016.‚Äù As for the iPad Air 3, the waiting game for this Apple tablet has actually been a lot longer, as original release predictions for it were traced back to October 2015. But, according to recent reports, the iPad Air 3 is purportedly going to be the final model to be released for the iPad Air series and it will also be unveiled in March 2017 together with the iPad Pro 2. However, MacWorld brought up that a simultaneous release of these two iPads could pose a marketing debacle for Apple, especially if both will have the same screen size. ‚ÄúHaving a brand-new (presumably 9.7-inch) iPad Air alongside new iPad Pros of the same screen size would be confusing for customers, and it‚Äôs hard to see how Apple would differentiate the two,‚Äù the post noted.

The Inquisitr will continue to keep you in the loop for more updates about Apple‚Äôs upcoming devices. Meanwhile, make sure to take all the release speculations circulating online with a pinch of salt as we wait for official announcements from the iPhone maker.

By Gary Jones / Published 5th November 2016 SAMSUNG The Samsung Gear S3 release date price has been confirmed Samsung unveiled its latest tech timepiece at the IFA tech show in September, coming in two styles and including a wave of new features such as water resistant design, in-built GPS and the ability to make contactless payments. The Samsung Gear S3 release date in the US has been set for later in November and now the tech company has revealed the full price of their new device. The South Korean company will be selling their new smartwatch with a ¬£349 price tag, a big rise over the current Apple Watch Series 1. The Apple Watch Series 1 starts from ¬£269 for the 38mm case, and ¬£299 42mm case, although there is a big difference between it and the Apple Watch 2. Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch in pictures Wednesday, 31st August 2016 SAMSUNG has revealed its new Gear S3 Classic and Frontier smartwatches 1 / 5 DAILY STAR ONLINE/DAVE SNELLING Samsung's new Gear S3 Classic and Frontier smartwatch While it boasts the same dual-core processor as the Apple Watch Series 2, the entry-level wearable is not waterproof to 50 metres, nor does it have an in-built GPS. There's also Samsung's iconic rotating bezel, which allows users to navigate the apps and messages on the 1.3inch circular AMOLED display, and a 4-day battery life. Samsung Gear S3 is also compatible with any smartphone running Android 4.4 KitKat or higher, with 1.5GB of RAM.

The Hennepin County medical examiner identified them as 49-year-old Alan Lee Josephson and 56-year-old Lynn Marie Josephson. The Apple Valley Police Department says examination of the crime scene and information from both autopsies indicate that Alan Josephson fatally shot Lynn Josephson in the head and then shot himself.

The company, called Uncourage, has announced a new keychain named the Uncourage Plug. The accessory comes with a simple keychain and a 3.5mm headphone connector that plugs into the headphone adapter that ships with the iPhone 7. From there, it just dangles until you‚Äôre ready again to plug the adapter into your iPhone and strap on your headphones. Apple made the controversial decision in September to announce a new iPhone without a headphone jack. During the presentation where it unveiled the iPhone 7, Apple said that its smartphone wouldn‚Äôt offer a headphone jack. The move was criticized by many who believed the headphone jack would be a critical feature for years to come. MORE: 12 Cheap Earbuds (Under $20) Ranked from Best to Worst Apple, however, argued against such claims, saying that it had the ‚Äúcourage‚Äù to make the decision. In fact, Apple used the term ‚Äúcourage‚Äù on several occasions during the presentation to make its argument. Before long, it became a meme on social media sites. This is the world in which we live: a place where we need to buy a $6 accessory for another accessory to listen to music with another accessory. Uncourage might be on to something. The headphone adapter that ships with the iPhone 7 is a diminutive accessory that has a Lightning connector on one end and a headphone jack port on the other. Tossing it in a packed bag will likely make it go missing and given its size, it‚Äôs not hard to leave it behind at the coffee shop or at home. If you can get into the habit of actually plugging it into Uncourage‚Äôs keychain accessory, however, it might stick it out with you over the long haul. The very idea that you need to pay $6 for an accessory that will help you remember another accessory might annoy some. But alas, this is the world in which we live: a place where we need to buy a $6 accessory for another accessory just to listen to music with another accessory.

In our chest of delights this time around are the latest MacBook Pro, Nintendo's new console, and a smartphone from Huawei. As always, these are not reviews, partly because some of these items are months away from hitting retailers' shelves. The ratings relate only to how much I'd like to try each item. Apple Crunch Apple has unveiled a redesigned MacBook Pro, giving the company's core laptop its first full refresh in a few years. The design has metal on all sides, along with a Force Touch trackpad double the size of previous versions. There's a customizable OLED touch strip above the keyboard that responds to gestures and taps -- a demo indicated one might use it for fast access to various emoji or for secondary controls within an app. It essentially replaces function keys, but with far more purpose and control. To the side of the Touch Bar is the second-generation Touch ID module for fingerprint authentication. Naturally, it's the thinnest, lightest MacBook Pro ever, because Apple and hyperbole are tighter than Velcro and fabric. The display is 67 percent brighter and displays 25 percent more colors, though apparently somehow eats less power than before. The battery apparently lasts up to 10 hours on a single charge. For connectivity, there are four Thunderbolt USB Type-C ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack, which Apple clearly displayed great courage to include. However, there are no HDMI, USB or Thunderbolt ports, or any memory card slots. The Type-C ports are all you get -- even if, thankfully, there are three more than in the previous MacBook. I'm sure it's shinier and prettier and smarter and thinner and faster than ever, and that's well and good. Aside from the compelling Touch Bar, though, there's not a lot to get truly thrilled about. Excising regular USB ports mean you'll need adaptors to connect many of your peripherals (including your iPhone). I'm honestly just waiting for Apple to fit an operating system and processing power into an eye implant √† la Black Mirror. Rating: 4 out of 5 Yawning Emojis Switching Things Up Regular readers will note I am a lifelong lover of games, and particularly Nintendo. I remember how excited I was as a 6-year-old to unwrap my Super Nintendo on Christmas morning. I've devoted many, many hours to Super Mario World and my favorite game of all time, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, in the quarter century since. The Wii U didn't much excite me, except for the tremendous Super Mario Maker. However, the latest Nintendo offering, Nintendo Switch, offers a look at a new future for console gaming. Switch is a hybrid system that, when nestled into its dock, connects to a television. So far, so traditional. However, when you lift Switch out of said dock, it instantly transforms into a portable gaming system with a high-definition display. The device has two detachable Joy-Con controllers, with one connected to each side. These can stay separate, connect with an accessory to become a more traditional controller, or be used as individual controllers for some multiplayer games. Switch also will support a standalone pro controller. Switch uses GameCard cartridges instead of discs, which suggests the system may not be backward-compatible with Wii or Wii U games. Gamers can connect multiple Switch systems for local multiplayer play. It seems like Switch is designed to replace both the Wii U and the 3DS, which is curious, since Nintendo's handheld systems have performed well for some time. Even with such scant details (the Switch doesn't go on sale until March), Switch is an utterly compelling console. It looks like it's going to hit the right balance between casual and more passionate gamers that the Wii and Wii U consoles never were able to find. Plus, there's that wonderful IP in Mario, Zelda, and so many other titles. I truly can't wait to get my hands on one, and then proceed to lose easily in a game of Mario Kart. Rating: 5 out of 5 1-Ups Nothing but Screen I've made no bones about being someone who's probably an iOS lifer at this point, but if anything were to push me into switching smartphone teams, it'd be something like the Mi Mix Android phablet. It seems a little larger than I'd like, with a 6.4-inch screen, but that's almost entirely screen real estate -- the display takes up 91.3 percent of the body. It looks gorgeous, almost like the pure glass phone of Jony Ive's dreams. It's not quite that, though, as the rear and side buttons are made of ceramic. Ultrasound takes the place of a proximity sensor, which is neat, and the Mi Mix houses 4 GB of RAM, 128 GB of storage, and uses the same Snapdragon processor as Google Pixel. There's a rear 16-megapixel camera -- though weirdly, the front-facing camera is at the bottom of the phone to account for all of that screen space. Again, the design is spectacular. It's probably the best-looking smartphone I've seen since the iPhone 6. It's a shame that you'll likely need to pay a premium to import one from China, when Xiaomi really could have something on its hands were it to take this globally. I'd absolutely be tempted to get it, even if I am bound to my contract for another year. Rating: 5 out of 5 Bezel Killers Kris Holt is a writer and editor based in Montreal.

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre in for New, 289 comments I come from the future of ports, where everything is wonderful and terrible by Dieter Bohn@backlon Nov 5, 2016, 1:22pm EDT share tweet Linkedin There has been more talk of dongles now that Apple has gone and done it: excised all ports on the new MacBook Pros except one: USB-C. It is good and right to be unhappy that there aren‚Äôt any standard USB-A ports, MagSafe, or SD card slots on these new MacBook Pros. If that gives you serious pause, I am with you and don‚Äôt have any easy answers beyond ‚Äúbuy the dongles and deal with them.‚Äù Lucky for you, yesterday Apple relented a bit and slashed the prices on many of its adapters. I have been using USB-C for a year now, on the non-Pro MacBook, so I thought I should share some of my experiences. And I want to tell you that the #donglelife (yes, it‚Äôs a hashtag) is not all that horrible for me, day to day. That‚Äôs in large part because I am smack in the center of Apple‚Äôs target market: I don‚Äôt need to plug stuff beyond power into my computer all that often, so when I do it‚Äôs not too big a hassle to use a dongle. And much to my surprise, I don‚Äôt miss MagSafe as much as I expected to. If I were a photographer or video director who needs to use SD cards constantly and who already has a cache of hard drives that require different ports, it might be a different story. When USB-C works, it‚Äôs magical I feel strange defending dongles, because you can and should count me among the people who think that removing the headphone port from the iPhone 7 was a user-hostile mistake. But for me, the big difference between needing dongles for your laptop and needing dongles for your phone is that you usually carry your laptop around in a bag, which has pockets that can carry dongles. I should also point out that I am a USB-C partisan. The dream of this single port was and always has been that you will be able to stop carrying around a different cable for every. damn. gadget. you. own. We do not live in that world yet, but I‚Äôve experienced bits and pieces of it and I genuinely think a little pain now is worth it for that better future. Apple's right to force the issue on USB-C. Good on them for dropping prices. Wish it was on iPhone. Same plug for phone, laptop is GREAT.‚Äî Dieter Bohn (@backlon) November 4, 2016 When I sit down at my desk, I plug a single cable in to charge my MacBook, drive my display, and connect up to the USB Hub built into my monitor. Yes, this requires a dongle, but as soon as I upgrade to a USB-C (or Thunderbolt 3, depending!) monitor, it won‚Äôt. Of course, another reason I like USB-C is that I can use the same cable to charge my laptop and my phone (a Google Pixel). That‚Äôs not something iPhone users can say. In fact, one of the big differences between the dongle on the iPhone 7 and the USB-C dongles is that USB-C is a common standard used by most computer companies ‚Äî you can find it on Android phones, on Windows PCs, on tablets, and on Chromebooks. You can find it, in fact, on nearly everything except the iPhone. That‚Äôs not to say that I don‚Äôt think that the Lightning connector is superior to USB-C (it is), but as a standard for an ecosystem, USB-C isn‚Äôt dependent on Apple‚Äôs permission. So long-term, I think USB-C is going to make our computing lives better. And in the short term, you are likely going to have small ‚ÄúAHA‚Äù moments where you can plug in a single cable and have neat stuff happen. I really do think that Apple made the right decision to aggressively push the industry forward into this future ‚Äî although I would have put an SD card slot in there were I designing the MacBook Pro. I also wouldn‚Äôt tell you you‚Äôre wrong if you said it should have included a traditional USB-A port, but I am not personally enraged by it. All is not well in dongleland Assuming that we get past this interim period, a single port for everything sounds great! However, the pain of these ports is bigger than just having to use dongles. USB-C is an industry standard and, like all industry standards, it sometimes gets implemented by fools and fly-by-night outfits. I want to tell you that everything is going to be okay, but let‚Äôs take a tour through some of what‚Äôs going on in the world of USB-C right now. Poorly constructed USB-C cables can sometimes allow connected devices to draw too much power and damage your gadgets (it happened to me). And even when that‚Äôs not the case, poorly constructed USB-C cables can cause weird bugs that you wouldn‚Äôt expect when it comes to inter-device communication (this, too, happened to me!). Some users have also found that simply charging can be finicky ‚Äî you might plug in only to discover that the amperage isn‚Äôt powerful enough or the wire is poorly made or the device itself doesn‚Äôt adhere to the standard like it ought to. I‚Äôve also tried a bunch of different USB-C docks and hubs ‚Äî my Amazon purchase history is a gallery of sorrow and misspent dollars. To a one, these multi-port hubs have been flaky and unreliable ‚Äî usually when it comes to their SD card slots. Others have had better luck, but a year after the release of the MacBook we‚Äôre still waiting for the One True Hub that will really cover the bases for most people. Happily, all of Apple‚Äôs adapters have performed excellently ‚Äî the company just doesn‚Äôt offer an all-in-one solution, so I end up carrying two or three different dongles just in case. Bottom line: buy from vendors you trust. If for some reason you can‚Äôt, look hard for those ineffectual USB Implementers Forum logos that theoretically denote safe cables. Amazon is trying to crack down on bad cables, too. But still, even today the surest way to know if a cable is safe is to look for a review from one heroic Google engineer (seriously). So that all sounds awful. And we‚Äôre not done yet: Technically, the ports on the new MacBook Pro are both USB-C and Thunderbolt 3. Both protocols work using the same connector. That seems fine, but we‚Äôre facing a situation where the connectors look the same but don‚Äôt necessarily operate the same. For example, Nilay Patel tried plugging his DisplayPort monitor into a USB-C to Thunderbolt adapter. See, Thunderbolt uses the same connector as Mini DisplayPort, but his adapter didn‚Äôt support DisplayPort, it only supported Thunderbolt. The best part is that the Thunderbolt 2 dongle Apple gave me doesn‚Äôt actually drive mini displayport so this didn‚Äôt work https://t.co/bF6Q7ilTmi‚Äî nilay patel (@reckless) October 31, 2016 On top of that, even on a brand-new MacBook Pro, identical-looking ports will offer different throughput, depending on which side you happen to plug in on. It can get even worse, as Stephen Foksett explains: Consider a simple USB-C HDMI adapter: It could implement HDMI over USB 3.0 or it could use Alternate Mode (native) HDMI. It could also use HDMI ‚Äúmultiplexed‚Äù with Thunderbolt Alternate Mode or even (theoretically) implement HDMI over Thunderbolt using an off-board graphics chip! Of these options, only the newest computers, like the MacBook Pro, would support all three. Can you imagine the consumer confusion when they purchase a ‚ÄúUSB-C HDMI adapter‚Äù only to find that it doesn‚Äôt work with their MacBook or Pixel or whatever? I feel like this Apple support article headline, of all support article headlines, should actually start with "So," https://t.co/r2JWWjKROd‚Äî nilay patel (@reckless) November 5, 2016 At this point I know what you‚Äôre thinking: USB-C is not ready for prime time. Even if you accept that we all have to use dongles for the next few years, it‚Äôs still insane that Apple is foisting this confusing and potentially dangerous connector on people. And I would agree with you, but the only way we‚Äôre going to figure this single-connector situation out is to start figuring it out by using it, buying them, and finding what works. ‚ÄúCan you imagine the consumer confusion?‚Äù And, again, the irony is that this ‚ÄúApple is correct to foist the future on everybody right now, before we‚Äôre totally ready‚Äù stance is particularly rich coming from me, a guy who thinks Apple should have left the 3.5mm headphone jack in the iPhone. I‚Äôve watched in amazement (and, I will admit, no small amount of Schadenfreude) as people who vigorously defended the decision to remove a standard, common port on the iPhone are bemoaning the fact that Apple did exactly that on the MacBook. I have exactly the opposite opinion, though. With the iPhone 7, Apple removed a standard port and replaced it with a demand that we use wireless audio. Apple is effectively asking everybody to either use a proprietary solution (A W1-blessed Bluetooth headset or Lightning audio) or solution that is in many ways not as good (Bluetooth audio without Apple‚Äôs fancy W1 chip). And there‚Äôs no guarantee the prices will come down on either of those things anytime soon. I‚Äôm still waiting for the One True Dongle Compare that to the switch to USB-C. Here, the entire industry is lining up behind a common standard that will work across all devices and be relatively cheap. It‚Äôs unproven, yes, but everybody who makes a circuit board is motivated to get it right. It‚Äôs not so much removing a standard port as it is replacing an old standard with a new standard. Having lived with some of the worst of USB-C for a year, I think that for most users the pain of this switchover is going to be briefer and smaller than they might expect. I do wish that Apple would either create or bless the One True USB-C Dongle, something with a few ports and a reliable SD card slot. Carrying one dongle is embarrassing, carrying three (as I do) is downright ridiculous. It gets much, much trickier for pro users ‚Äî the very people who need a new, powerful MacBook the most. For them, I think Apple‚Äôs reduced prices on adapters is a boon, but it‚Äôs going to take a while to see if Apple forces the rest of the industry to make USB-C and Thunderbolt peripherals more quickly. Given how many Windows computers and Android devices are moving to it alongside the MacBook, I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic. Should have put an SD card slot in, though. And put a USB dongle in the box.

She likes the ability it gives her to write on the screen during presentations, and to hold video conferences, but the special feature she values most about her new computer is that it comes with a DomenicNadal. Marko Georgiev/Staff photographer North Jersey publisher Lynda Brennan speaks with Gregg Carline, left, and Dominic Nadal, right, of Microsoft at Westfield Plaza in Paramus. Nadal is the business support specialist at the Microsoft retail store in Paramus, and when Brennan came to the store looking to buy a new computer, she ended up with a package that includes technical support in the form of up to one hour a day of Nadal's time. JIM ALCORN/SPECIAL TO THE RECORD Mudit Gupta, co-owner of the iStore by St. Moritz in Englewood, heads up savvy text suppor alongside Jamie Hwang, right. ‚ÄúI work by myself for the most part - kind of in a little vacuum - and when I hit a roadblock I need to be able to go out and ask somebody something,‚Äù Brennan said. When she encounters a glitch working on her website, or with a PowerPoint presentation, ‚Äúinstead of being up all night trying to figure it out, I simply shoot Domenic an email, let him know that I am going to be coming by that afternoon, and the problem is solved,‚Äù she said. When a business is too small to have an information technology department, or a computer help desk, who can they call when a laptop freezes up, data disappears into the cloud, or a web page won't load? Small business tech support has become a growing marketing niche for tech titans such as Microsoft and Apple, and retailers such as Best Buy and Staples. While lots of private companies provide tech support for business clients, these retail stores are reaching out to the smallest of small businesses, often one-person shops that run their companies on a single laptop or cellphone. Entrepreneurs also are turning to the Small Business Administration, and universities and community colleges for workshops and classes that address their technology needs. ‚ÄúPeople who are in their own businesses have to fill every role,‚Äù said Bernadette Tiernan, executive director of the William Paterson University School of Continuing and Professional Education. ‚ÄúSo they're not only the CEO and the president and the founder, but they're also the accountant and the head of the finance department and the head of marketing and human resources, and in their spare time they empty the wastebaskets and go out and do sales,‚Äù she said. The School of Continuing and Professional Education offers courses for people who want to master skills such as the QuickBooks accounting program, or learn how to harness social media to promote their business. ‚ÄúI've found small business owners are really quick learners and highly motivated,‚Äù Tiernan said. ‚ÄúThere's not a lot of time to make mistakes‚Äù when someone is starting a business, she said. Tiernan and the School of Continuing and Professional Education works with the university's Small Business Development Center to develop tech-related courses needed by entrepreneurs. Kate Muldoon, regional director of the center, said the center also works one-on-one with people who need help growing their businesses, in addition to offering courses on in-demand subjects such as website development, or data backups. The center also connects companies with consultants who can solve tech emergencies, such as the one experienced by a Paterson business that couldn't access its stored data. The problems the center addresses can be as critical as emergency data retrieval, or more basic, Muldoon said. ‚ÄúSometimes it's as simple as helping them set up an email address for their business,‚Äù she said. Microsoft, Apple, Best Buy and Staples all offer various levels of tech support for small business for a monthly or yearly fee that can range from under $30 a month to more than $100, depending on the level of service. Microsoft and Apple offer business customers the option of leasing their phones, laptops, or tablets, for a monthly fee. Brennan, a math teacher in New York state for more than 20 years, who lives in Rockland County, and publishes the Math MileMarkers education books that aid in teaching the core curriculum, said she was happy to learn she could lease rather than pay the full cost for the Surface Pro device. After making several visits to the Microsoft store to investigate buying a new computer, a salesperson suggested she speak with Nadal. ‚ÄúLynda told me 'I need to be able to conference with people; I need to be able to send documents; I need to have a file structure,' ‚Äù Nadal said. He recommended Microsoft's Office 365 small business premium package, which, with the equipment lease, costs about $93 a month. ‚ÄúI'm entitled to one hour per day and there are certain periods of the year when I take advantage of one hour per day,‚Äù Brennan said. ‚ÄúIt's an amazing deal because without it honestly I would have had to hire somebody to do a lot of things.‚Äù Other types of small business clients Nadal has worked with include physical therapists who use their tablets to take notes about patients, and landscapers and contractors who need to show renderings to clients. ‚ÄúIt's really about being a technical adviser to these companies,‚Äù said GreggCarline, business sales specialist at the Paramus Microsoft store. ‚ÄúMost folks that come in know their business inside and out, but the gap they need filled is the technology.‚Äù Having retail stores has enabled Microsoft to connect directly with small business owners, Carline said. Before Microsoft had a retail operation, ‚Äúthere really wasn't a place for small entrepreneurs or mid-market accounts to go with tech problems,‚Äù he said. While business customers can get tech support at Apple retail stores, the company also refers them to Apple Authorized Service Providers such as the iStore by St. Moritz in Englewood. Mudit Gupta, co-owner of that store and previous owner of the Essex Computers iStore on Route 17, said demand for business support is growing so rapidly that he recently opened a second store, in Union Square in Manhattan. ‚ÄúWe can sell the equipment, install it, network it, service it, and offer in-house and on-site training,‚Äù Gupta said. The store has business clients ranging from mom-and-pop companies to Fortune 100 companies in New Jersey that primarily use PCs and Windows, and have their own IT departments for those machines, but need support for Macs and other Apple products used in certain departments, such as marketing or graphics. It also has non-business, consumer clients, who bring their personal iPhones or laptops in for repair. Business clients can buy a block of time - the rate for 25 hours is $3,875, or $155 an hour, that doesn't expire until all of the hours are used up - that can be used for troubleshooting or training. Gupta said he and his employees have worked with caterers who use their laptops to store menus and contracts, doctors who use iPads for patient notes and prescriptions, realtors, lawyers, auto dealerships and photographers. Photographers, in particular, often turn to the store for repairs of their discontinued Mac Tower computers - favored by photo studios for their multiple hard drives and video cards - that Apple stores no longer repair. Music DJ's also tend to need emergency tech support. ‚ÄúThey will say, 'My entire music is on this and now the laptop is not working and I have a gig tonight,' ‚Äù Gupta said.

According to Forbes, the iOS 10.1.1 update is relatively simple and addresses a bug in the operating system that would erase medical data associated with the ‚ÄúHealth‚Äù app, which users often use to track miles, heart rate, and other items. This data can be exported to medical professionals or simply be used to track progress with exercise and overall health. ‚ÄúWeighing in at just 70MB (size varies slightly depending on device), iOS 10.1.1 has no security patches and just a single line description: ‚ÄòThis update fixes bugs including an issue where Health data could not be viewed for some users,'‚Äù Forbes reported. The site goes on to note that iOS 10.1.1 not only makes it possible to track health data again, but it will bring back all missing health data that was lost with the last iOS update. iOS 10.1.1 fixes a so-called ‚Äúserious‚Äù bug in the operating system. [Image by Kim White/Getty Images] What if you have not yet updated your iOS to iOS 10, much less the latest iOS 10.1.1? Mac Rumors explains the reasons you may want to go ahead and do the upgrade to iOS 10.1.1 (i.e. the latest version of iOS 10). ‚ÄúiOS 10 is a major update that includes features like a redesigned Lock screen experience, a revamped Messages app with a full App Store, a Siri SDK for developers, new looks and features for Maps and Apple Music, and tons more. Make sure to check out our iOS 10 roundup for details. ‚Äú Mac Rumors also notes that software upgrades ‚Äì namely iOS 10.1.1 ‚Äì will prevent you from being able to downgrade to previous iOS 10 versions, including iOS 10.0.2 and iOS 10.0.3. So if you upgrade to iOS 10.1.1, you must be certain you want to have the latest software upgrade because you will be stuck with it. Forbes goes into a bit more detail on whether the typical iOS user should upgrade to iOS 10.1.1. The same goes for those who are using jailbroken iOS versions, though it reports that there is no jailbreak yet available for iOS 10. ‚ÄúConsequently if you‚Äôre hanging back on iOS 9 to enjoy your jailbroken device, it goes without saying that you should not update to iOS 10.1.1,‚Äù Forbes suggests. If you are expecting further updates with the iOS 10.1.1 update, Forbes suggests you do not hold your breath. This is the latest of many updates to be released after iOS 10 officially launched. iOS 10.1.1 fixes a bug that had deleted all health data stored on iPhone and other iOS devices. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] ‚ÄúAs for the release notes implying there are other fixes beside the Health update, nothing has been explicitly stated by Apple and I haven‚Äôt been able to find any from my investigations to date,‚Äù the website said. ‚ÄúThat aside iOS 10.1.1 appears to do nothing else of value. It has no security updates and no new features Apple is willing to declare. Consequently, while problems with iOS 10.1.1 remain isolated, there is no good reason to take the risk. Especially with Apple‚Äôs sketchy reliability record with iOS updates in recent years.‚Äù While Forbes is not suggesting that the typical user upgrade to iOS 10.1.1, it did break news in the announcement that a beta of iOS 10.2 is now available for users. It suggests that while iOS 10.1.1 did not break new ground in its update, the iOS 10.2 beta 1 could offer a few new features sure to set the iOS world on fire ‚Äì new emojis and new wallpaper options. As for why there are so many updates, the report above is correct in noting that Apple has missed the mark with updates for iOS in recent years, with iOS 10 being no different. Owning a variety of mobile devices from an iPad to an iPhone, I have held off on the updates for that very reason. Once Apple gets iOS 10 out to the masses without bugs, it may be worth an upgrade to iOS 10.1.1 or a later version. But for now, you may want to give Apple a bit more time to work out the kinks.

Photo app Ever removed its spammy SMS feature after Apple banned it Posted Nov 1, 2016 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden), Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Genetics startup Genos wants to pay you for your DNA¬†data Score one for the consumer against the indefatigable force of growth hacking. Ever, the photo storage app that we called out in September for spamming SMS contact lists¬†(it rebranded from¬†Everalbum shortly after), has found its way back into Apple‚Äôs App Store after getting temporarily banned for its practices. Ever has had a lot of negative feedback ‚Äî and even a couple of lawsuits ‚Äî over how it leads you into sharing your contacts with it, and then subsequently messaging them with its marketing. Despite that ‚Äî or rather, largely due to¬†that ‚Äî the app has been on a popularity tear. In the last month, it has consistently ranked No. 1¬†or within the top 10¬†among all Productivity apps in both the Android and¬†iOS¬†U.S.¬†app stores, according to App Annie figures. screen-shot-2016-11-01-at-3-16-32-pm screen-shot-2016-11-01-at-3-17-24-pm ¬†View Slideshow Previous Next Exit In Apple‚Äôs iTunes App store, however, there‚Äôs been a blip: it disappeared, along with its billing function, used by paying¬†‚ÄúPlus‚Äù¬†users ($9.99/month) or those who want to purchase physical photo books (which start at $19.99). From what we understand, this was squarely down to how it misled users into providing access to their contacts list and then spamming them to use the app. According to a number of consumer complaints, Ever (then Everalbum) had duped them into spamming their friends with invites to try the service. The app‚Äôs user interface used a variety of techniques to get users to agree to this invite spam. This included a¬†tricky button that heavily emphasized the option to ‚Äúget free storage,‚Äù which then prompted you to let the app¬†access your contacts). The following¬†screen would show all your contacts checked by default, while the option to ‚ÄúDeselect All‚Äù was grayed out to make it less obvious. But it‚Äôs unclear whether users were just confused about what they were agreeing to, or if Ever had actually used different, and less transparent, onboarding flows at other times. The end result, however, was that many of Ever‚Äôs users felt they had been tricked into sending out SMS spam. In addition, Ever also sent out¬†a number of different and misleading SMS text messages that implied your friend had given you access to view photos in their album, or threatened a link would expire if you didn‚Äôt click it soon. But users hadn‚Äôt necessarily shared albums ‚Äî they were just navigating their way through the set-up process. Apple removed the app from its iTunes App Store for its bad behavior ‚Äî specifically SMS spam and for being misleading. It was only allowed back in when the ‚Äúinvite via text‚Äù feature was removed. Google, however, never took any action, despite its recent claims of clamping down on apps that try to manipulate their rankings.¬† In the new version of Ever, now back on the App Store, the app no longer prompts you to sign up your friends, and it has a much clearer interface for its in-app upgrades: img_0997 img_0998 img_0996_2 img_0999 ¬†View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Now, the options for starting a free trial are clearly labeled, and the trial only begins after you enter your TouchID and confirm your commitment to the subscription terms ($11.99/mo after the trial period.) When testing, however, we found¬†a new problem: after choosing to upgrade, but then cancelling before you continued¬†to the trial, the TouchID prompt kept popping up. We had to hit ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù on its repeated prompts to get it to go away for good. This could be a bug with the new app, or a new means of confusing the user ‚Äî it‚Äôs unclear. (The new app does appear buggy, though ‚Äî the album sharing button wasn‚Äôt working during tests, for instance.) However, when sharing photos (or presumably, an album), you have to explicitly type in a contact‚Äôs name or select from your ‚Äúrecents.‚Äù The app doesn‚Äôt indicate it‚Äôs¬†sending a text on your behalf, but at least only the recipient ‚Äî and not your entire address book ‚Äî is being bothered.

 iPhone sales haven't bottomed out yet, says the most accurate Apple analyst Kif Leswing Nov. 5, 2016, 11:46 AM 5,163 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Apple's iPhone, the company's most important product, has seen three straight quarters of sales declines on an annual basis. Most analysts expect the iPhone to grow slightly year-over-year in the quarter ending in December, thanks to strong demand in the United States for the iPhone 7 Plus. But that doesn't mean the iPhone's skid is over.¬† KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is predicting that Apple will continue to see iPhone sales decline over the first half of next year.¬† "We forecast total shipment volume of iPhones will decline YoY [year-over-year] in 1H17 due to weak demand in China, slow shipment volume of 4.7‚Äù iPhones in 1Q17, and the lack of a new iPhone SE in 2Q17," he wrote in a note distributed to clients on Friday seen by Business Insider. "We estimate 1Q17 iPhone shipment volume of 40-50mn units, lower than the 51.2mn units in 1Q16," Kuo wrote. "We forecast total iPhone shipment volume will reach 35-40mn units and fall YoY in 2Q17, lower than the 40.4mn units in 2Q16." A hard bargain¬† Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Kuo also writes that he's hearing that Apple is pushing its suppliers, iPhone component makers, to cut its prices. This has been a recurring complaint from Apple suppliers over the past six months. Apple's operating¬†margin has¬†been falling and it is currently the lowest it has been in seven years.¬† So Apple looks to strengthen its profitability¬†by leaning on its suppliers to give it better prices on¬†parts like screen panels, RAM, and other internal components.¬† "We believe iPhone component makers have been facing significant pressure from Apple (US) to cut prices. The price reductions may begin in November or December 2016, likely dragging down bottom lines within the supply chain," Kuo wrote. One thing that will help Apple's bottom line: it's unlikely to launch a new low-cost iPhone SE in 2017, Kuo said.¬† Suppliers that can be easily replaced, like those that make the screen panels for iPhones, have weak bargaining power. The head of Sharp, a Foxconn subsidiary that provides screens for Apple, recently discussed the iPhone 8 in a public¬†speech.¬† However, some suppliers, like Samsung, are in a stronger position, and may even raise their¬†prices, says Kuo. TSMC is also unlikely to be affected by Apple's pricing pressure. Still, increased profitability only means so much when overall sales are dropping.¬†Apple has to be hoping that its next iPhone is a stunner and sells well.¬† EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

(Associated Press file) Print Email NerdWallet, special to cleveland.com By NerdWallet, special to cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author on November 05, 2016 at 10:33 AM, updated November 05, 2016 at 10:34 AM comments With huge sales and steep savings at nearly every retailer,¬†Black Friday¬†‚Äî the day after Thanksgiving ‚Äî has long been touted as one of the best times of the year for buying just about anything. But it's not all discounts and deals on the 2016 post-Turkey Day shopping bonanza. Use this guide to determine what you should purchase and what you should skip on Nov. 25 to ensure you're getting only the best bargains. Buy: Previous models of Apple products Traditionally, major retail stores such as Best Buy, Target and Wal-Mart discount Apple products each year on Black Friday, and previous-generation models usually see the most dramatic deals. These offers may include price cuts, free gift cards with purchase or a combination of both. This year, look for deals on MacBooks, iMacs, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and Apple TVs. Last year, for instance,¬†Target¬†devoted almost an entire page of the bull's-eye retailer's¬†2015 Black Friday ad¬†to Apple. Shoppers scored a free Target gift card when they bought any iPad Mini, iPad Air or Apple Watch. There was also a 20% discount on all iPods. Skip: Toys Toys are one of the seasonal purchase staples, but you might want to think twice before picking them up on Black Friday. Historically, it's best to wait until closer to Christmas to purchase dolls, action figures and the like. You may run the risk that¬†certain items will sell out, but you may also be able to find¬†bigger savings on what's left. Last year, in the final days before Christmas, toys were on sale at Kmart, Wal-Mart and Big Lots, to name a few. Shoppers bought one toy and got a second toy at 50% off on Monster High dolls and accessories, Fisher-Price preschool toys and Block Tech playsets, as well as activity and science sets. ¬ª MORE:¬†Full list of 2016 Black Friday store hours Buy: Gaming system bundles Black Friday is for gamers just as much as it is for shoppers. This year, look for savings on video games and video game systems from retailers such as Best Buy, Target, Wal-Mart and GameStop. You'll find particularly great offers on gaming bundles. Traditionally, these include the game console plus a combination of games and accessories. Last year, video game retailer¬†GameStop¬†took $50 off both the Xbox One 500GB Gears of War Ultimate Bundle and the PlayStation 4 500GB Uncharted Collection Bundle. Skip: Christmas decorations You've likely seen the blowout post-Christmas clearance sales every year on Dec. 26 as you made your way to the store to return that gift that missed the mark. The absolute best time to buy Christmas decorations, wrapping paper, tinsel and other seasonal trimmings is right after Christmas (for obvious reasons). But if you need these items before the holiday, don't buy them on Black Friday. Sure, you'll see plenty of deals on artificial trees and rolls of wrapping paper, especially at home and craft stores, but retailers are more eager to slash prices the closer it gets to Christmas. Buy: Electronics (TVs, tablets and smartphones) Electronics deals are a Black Friday staple, and for many consumers, that means shopping for a new TV, tablet or smartphone. In 2015, Target offered an impressive $249.99 deal on a 55-inch Westinghouse LED TV. Over at¬†Staples, tablets were all the rage. Shoppers could save up to 25% on select iPad models. Staples also dropped the price of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite 7-inch down to $79.99 (regularly $139.99). No matter where you choose to spend your Black Friday (or your Thanksgiving), you're almost guaranteed to find TV and tablet doorbusters. Another electronics deal to keep an eye out for: smartphones. Verizon offered $100 off the retail price of select Android smartphones last year. ¬ª MORE:¬†Black Friday 2016 ad leaks Skip: Bedding You've got the entertainment center covered, but you should hesitate¬†before stocking¬†up on supplies to refresh the look¬†of your bedroom this Black Friday. The lowest prices on bedding and linens have been known to appear in January during what are called "white sales," so hold off until then if you can. January 2016 white sales took place at Macy's, Pottery Barn, Nordstrom and more. Buy: Video games, CDs, DVDs If you're in need of some affordable stocking stuffers, look no further than the video game, CD, DVD and Blu-ray department at most major retailers this Black Friday. You'll find films and gaming titles deeply discounted from their original prices. In 2015, for example,¬†Best Buy¬†offered select Blu-ray titles for $9.99 each and up to 70 CD titles for $6.99 each.¬†Wal-Mart¬†had certain video games for $25 each and a selection of special-buy DVD titles for just $1.96 apiece. Skip: Outdoor essentials You won't see too many grills or patio furniture sets plastered on the front pages of Black Friday ads this year. That's because, not surprisingly, outdoor products and patio furniture are deeply discounted immediately after summer ends. If you didn't pick up these products at the close of this summer, wait until Labor Day sales roll around next year. Can't wait until then? Another viable option is the Spring Black Friday Sale that home improvement store Lowe's usually holds each year. Buy: Home appliances No secret here. Black Friday is well-known for its offers of huge savings on washers, dryers, refrigerators and kitchen appliances. Look for similar deep discounts again this year. Last year at¬†Sears, the Kenmore 4.3-cubic-foot washer and 7.3-cubic-foot dryer were on sale for $799.98 for the pair. That's a 57% discount. Best Buy took $1,500 off the price of a Samsung 28.2-cubic-foot 4-Door French Door Smart Refrigerator, bringing it down to $2,099.99. If you're in the market for smaller appliances such as coffee makers, mixers, blenders or vacuum cleaners, expect deals this year from department stores such as¬†Kohl's,¬†J.C. Penney¬†and¬†Macy's. Skip: Winter clothing Fall and winter clothing generally isn't the best value on Black Friday. Jeans, for instance, see better sales in¬†October, and retailers frequently offer big clearance sales on jackets when winter gives way to spring. Of course, if you need something to keep you warm before then, you'll be able to find some bargains this Black Friday. Year after year, Macy's and J.C. Penney have offered doorbuster deals on women's boots. In the past, select pairs have been just $19.99 each. Buy: Travel deals Whether it's hotel rooms, ski lift tickets or airfare, you can expect big deals on travel this Black Friday and Cyber Monday (Nov. 28). Check for deals from online travel sites like Expedia and major airlines alike. Note: In the past, most of these promotions were available for a very limited time. Skip: Mail-in rebates If you want to avoid some of the hassle related to Black Friday shopping, resist deals that require a mail-in rebate. Unless you're disciplined enough to fill out the form and wait to receive the rebate, you could end up paying more than you intended. And even if you do follow through with rebate, you'll have to shell out a higher price at the register before getting some of your money back. Always read the fine print; some kitchen appliances, electronics and other popular items may require you to fill out a mail-in rebate to achieve the advertised price. At¬†Kohl's, for example, some small kitchen appliances were available for $7.99 last year ‚Äî but that was after a $12 mail-in rebate. Buy: Online doorbusters Finally, for the ultimate combination of convenience and savings, spring for online doorbusters this year. Plenty of big box retailers are bringing their doorbusters online this Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Office Depot and OfficeMax, for instance, will be closed on Thanksgiving Day 2016, but deals will be available online starting at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on the holiday.

Galaxy S7 Edge Vs. iPhone 7: Which Phone Has The Best Specs, Features? By Karen Tumbokon On 11/05/16 AT 11:03 AM Close Yes, smartphone users, despite coverage of the Note 7 recall and the iPhone 7's lack of a headphone jack, there are other smartphones out there. Last month LG released the LG V20, a phone featuring a replaceable battery, enhance audio features and manual camera controls for video. While Apple and Samsung continue to be the stars of the shows, LG is making headlines with the V20. We‚Äôve decided to compare LG V20 Vs. Galaxy S7 Edge Vs. iPhone 7 to see which phone has the best specs, features, etc. LG V20 Features, Specs, Price - While Apple and Samsung continue to be the stars of the shows, LG is making headlines with the V20. We‚Äôve decided to compare LG V20 Vs. Galaxy S7 Edge Vs. iPhone 7 to see which phone has the best specs, features, etc. Photo: LG ¬† LG V20 Specs: The LG V20 sports a 5.7-inch display, dual-cameras, an additional always-on display, great battery life and runs Android 7.0 Nougat. For charging the V20 uses USB-C, featuring a speaker and a headphone jack on each side of the charging port. On the back of the V20 you‚Äôll see a fingerprint reader that also acts as a power button, and a dual-camera setup. Because the V20 has a second display, the V20 is larger than the Galaxy S7 Edge and iPhone 7, measuring at 159.78.1 x 78.1 x 7.6mm which can be challenging to hold with one hand. Though if you‚Äôre already used to using a larger phone, you‚Äôll be comfortable using the LG V20. The V20 ships with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of memory, 64GB of storage which expands up to 2TB through microSD and has a 3,200mAh battery. The V20 also offers two camera lenses. One camera lens has an 8-megapixel 135-degree ultra-wide angle lens, while the other camera lens has a 16-megapixel wide-angle shooter. The front of the V20 has a 120-degree lens wide-angle camera with 5 megapixels. LG V20 Features: Besides being one of the first phones to feature Android Nougat, the V20 features a 32-bit Quad DC, which is made by ESS Technology. It supports all kinds of formats, including FLAC, AIFF and Apple Lossless. There‚Äôs also an HD audio recorded that captures ‚Äústudio quality audio‚Äù from different miss built into the phone. What this means for you, is there will be less noise and better sound quality. LG claims that the V20 claims a 50 percent reduction of ambient noise levels. The V20 also brings back the secondary screen, but this time¬†it has more brightness, plus a new ‚Äúsignature feature.‚Äù Similar to the Galaxy Note, the V20 screen can show a word or phrase when not in use, and you can create wallpaper theme. It also features a removable battery, as well as the option to manually control the video camera. LG V20 Price: For $800 depending on where you buy it, the V20 is priced to compete with some of the best phones on the market right now, including the Galaxy S7 Edge and iPhone 7. Galaxy S7 Edge Specs, Features, Price While Apple and Samsung continue to be the stars of the shows, LG is making headlines with the V20. We‚Äôve decided to compare LG V20 Vs. Galaxy S7 Edge Vs. iPhone 7 to see which phone has the best specs, features, etc. Photo: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Specs:¬†The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is arguably one of the best smartphones Samsung has ever made. The S7 Edge‚Äôs Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440) screen packs in 534 pixels per inch and is beautiful. he S7 Edge is powered by Qualcomm‚Äôs high-performance Snapdragon 820 octa-core processor. It also has 4GB of RAM. Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow runs smoothly on the Galaxy S7 Edge, even Samsung‚Äôs TouchWiz doesn‚Äôt slow it down. If you‚Äôre a fan of gaming, you‚Äôll want to go with the S7 Edge. The graphics chip is 64% faster than the S6, the phone which ran 3D games like Modern Combat and GT Racing 2. Most devices can‚Äôt handle 3D games but the S7 Edge can. Galaxy S7 Edge Features: The S7 Edge also has an ‚Äúalways on display,‚Äù which shows what time it is, calendar and other widgets on the screen. That makes it easier to catch the news, sports scores and get shortcuts to specific tasks (like texting your friends). The S7 Edge includes a 3,600mAh battery that can last for an entire day, putting it ahead of the iPhone 7 and LG V20. With the included Fast Charger, the S7 Edge can make it through a busy work day. The S7 Edge has the same cameras as the S7, which is 12-megapixels on the back with optical image stabilization and 5 megapixels on the front. The S7 Edge lets you capture more meaning you can include more people in a group selfie. Both camera lenses also have an f/1.7 aperture, which brings in more light than any other smartphone. This means the S7 Edge can take better pictures at night especially in dimly lit locations. Just like the iPhone 7, the S7 Edge lets you unlock the device with your fingerprint, just press the home button and leave your fingerprint on it. The recognition is faster than the iPhone 7‚Äô Touch ID sensor, but it‚Äôs still pretty close. The S7 Edge has a microSD card slot integrated into its SIM card tray. Getting a microSD card to expand storage is a must especially if you want to download tons of apps, music, photos and videos. The S7 Edge can take microSD cards up to 2TB. Other great features about the S7 Edge is its water-resistant, which means it can be submerged in up to five feet of water for close to 30 minutes. While the S7 Edge is a little bit more extra, you at least get a big screen, long battery life and beautiful design. Galaxy S7 Edge Price:¬†The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is also priced at $700 depending on where you buy it. You can buy the Galaxy S7 Edge for $699.99 from Best Buy. If you buy from Samsung directly it will cost $769.99. iPhone 7 Specs, Features Price While Apple and Samsung continue to be the stars of the shows, LG is making headlines with the V20. We‚Äôve decided to compare LG V20 Vs. Galaxy S7 Edge Vs. iPhone 7 to see which phone has the best specs, features, etc. Photo: Apple iPhone 7 Features: Apple announced the iPhone 7 at its press event in September. As expected, the iPhone 7 looks similar to the iPhone 6, though it has a camera bump. One of the most significant design change was the two new color choices, which come in Jet Black and a matte black aka Black. Apple also released a Gold, Silver and Rose Gold model. As rumored, Apple removed the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of wireless headphones - though it does come¬†with an adapter for existing headphones. Fans of wireless headphones won‚Äôt mind, but owners of wired headphones will need to carry a 3.5mm Lightning adapter which could be a deal breaker. Apple redesigned the home button on the iPhone 7, making it force sensitive just like the trackpads used in recent MacBook laptops. The camera in the iPhone 7 has been upgraded with optical image stabilization and a brighter f/1.8 lens. iPhone 7 Specs: The iPhone 7 also comes with a new A10 Fusion processor that‚Äôs 40 percent faster than the iPhone 6. Apple also says that the new iPhone 7 has the ‚Äúlongest battery life ever of an iPhone,‚Äù making it a more powerful device than the Galaxy S7 Edge. When it comes to storage between the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 Edge it‚Äôs a pretty close tie. The iPhone 7 is available 32, 128 and 256GB variants, while the Galaxy S7 Edge comes in 32GB or 64GB build. The Galaxy S7 also has a MicroSD slot, which might put the Galaxy ahead of the iPhone 7, especially since MicroSD cards are cheap. Related Stories Specs Comparison For Huawei Mate 9 And iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Price: You can buy the iPhone 7 from Apple for $650. It‚Äôs always a close race when comparing the iPhone 7, LG V20 and the Galaxy S7 Edge. Though the iPhone 7 is cheaper and more powerful, the Galaxy S7 Edge offers a headphone jack and a bigger display. Sometimes it just comes down to brand loyalty¬†and what operating system you're used to.¬†So if you‚Äôre an Android user, you‚Äôll want to go with the Galaxy S7 Edge. If you‚Äôre upset Apple removed the headphone jack, that‚Äôll make it even easier for you to want to buy the S7 Edge or LG V20. However, if you‚Äôre thinking about switching to iOS and you want a powerful phone that‚Äôs easy to use, you‚Äôll want to buy the iPhone 7. The Galaxy S7 Edge is technically the winner, but it really depends on what you‚Äôre willing to spend and what features you can and cannot live without.¬† ‚Äã Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

It was meant to be a slightly more affordable model for those still wanting a 4-inch display, but avoided being seen as a cheap, entry-level device like the iPhone 5c was. Unfortunately, if you‚Äôre among the users that the iPhone SE appealed to, it looks like Apple has no plans for a refresh in the first half of 2017. This news comes from Ming-Chi Kuo, the KGI Securities analyst with one of the best track records when it comes predicting Apple‚Äôs future plans. In his latest note to investors, Kuo writes that the Cupertino company will extend the iPhone SE‚Äôs lifecycle beyond the usual one-year, and instead focus on maintaining profit margins as worldwide shipment numbers of iPhones decline in the first part of 2017. SlashGear‚Äôs iPhone SE review The analyst say that the cause of declining iPhone shipments will primarily be caused by a weakening demand in China, low shipments of 4.7-inch models, and the lack of refreshed iPhone SE in the second quarter of 2017. To make up for these lower shipment numbers, Kuo says that Apple will focus on maintaining iPhone profits by pressuring component makers to lower their prices, in turn reducing supply chain costs, some as soon as November and December. It‚Äôs worth noting, however, that Kuo‚Äôs prediction on an updated iPhone SE is only through the second quarter of 2017. While it may be unlikely, especially with Apple focusing on the ‚ÄúiPhone 8‚Äù by that time, but an iPhone SE refresh could still come later in the year.

 Samsung's culture needs to change if it wants to survive Steve Kovach Nov. 5, 2016, 10:00 AM 44,607 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP Samsung is a company that hates to fail. That may seem obvious (who actually revels in failure?), but most companies don't react to setbacks the way Samsung does. The best example? That famous story from 1995 where the company‚Äôs chairman set 150,000 defective phones ablaze in a giant bonfire in front of Samsung‚Äôs factory in Gumi, South Korea with thousands of employees watching. The demonstration doubled as a dire warning: Don‚Äôt let it happen again. Two decades later, with Samsung reeling from the damage of its¬†defective Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, employees are bracing for another bonfire. Only this time insiders expect Samsung to burn¬†a lot more than faulty electronic devices.¬† It's almost certain that the¬†playbook that transformed¬†Samsung into a consumer electronics powerhouse¬†will get substantial revisions.¬† And as Samsung prepares for its annual executive reorganization ‚Äî a yearly purging of the top ranks that's coming up in a few weeks ‚Äî it‚Äôs likely we‚Äôll see a lot of heads roll, especially at the top. This wasn‚Äôt just any screwup. It was one that erased billions from Samsung‚Äôs market cap and gave Apple and Google an opportunity to reap the rewards from those fed up with the Samsung brand. Lockdown Internally, Samsung is on lockdown. Even people I normally talk to within the company have been unusually tight lipped as the investigation continues into what exactly caused the Galaxy Note 7 to explode. The theory among those I have spoken to seems to be that Samsung is withholding all the information it can until the annual reorganization happens. Then the healing can begin. To recap:¬†After weeks of reports that the Note 7 devices overheated or exploded, causing dozens of injuries and the evacuation of a Southwest Airlines flight, Samsung made the decision last month to recall the phone and cancel the Note 7 line for good. A separate product¬†recall¬†involving washing machines that have injured consumers when the lids flew off has¬†further tarnished¬†Samsung's reputation.¬† One person close to Samsung told me the company's electronics¬†group is currently reevaluating everything from marketing to design to engineering to make sure nothing like this ever happens again. That means changes in leadership as well as in culture.¬† Samsung built its brand by being first to market with the coolest and newest technologies, from smartphones to televisions. The company¬†released 6 smart watches in the year before Apple released the Apple Watch, and Samsung is regularly¬†among the first to showcase slick new breeds of televisions like curved OLED displays. But that strategy now looks¬†like a liability. As Bloomberg reported , Samsung‚Äôs rush to beat Apple‚Äôs iPhone 7 could‚Äôve been one of the reasons why the Note 7 turned out to be defective. Normally, Samsung would‚Äôve solved the Note 7 problem and moved on by now, this person told me. But in this case, the company is slowing down and evaluating everything in its product development cycle.¬† Given the urgency under which Samsung has operated for so long, this deliberate pace investigating the matter may well¬†represent¬†the first sign of a major culture shift.¬† A Samsung Galaxy Note 7 that exploded. AP If we don't change, we don't survive The stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher. Samsung appears to be aware that it could suffer the same fate as other former industry leaders like Nokia and BlackBerry unless things drastically change. People I‚Äôve spoken were optimistic that the Note 7 crisis could be the catalyst the company needed to change how things work at the company. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt change, we don‚Äôt survive,‚Äù another¬†person close to Samsung told me. And, for the first time, insiders are getting the sense that things actually are changing. Part of that change, it seems, is to make sure products are fully baked before releasing them to the public. Moving quickly is admirable, especially in the tech world, but not at the expense of making a product that‚Äôs safe to use. Samsung learned a hard lesson. Now it‚Äôs getting ready for a change. The change won't be easy. The culture of urgency is deeply entrenched¬†in the company and broadly diffused across disparate operations that¬†include everything from the production of semiconductors to batteries. It's¬†especially important going into 2017. Before the Note 7 turned out to be a dud, Samsung was gearing up for its next major flagship device that should launch early next year. Unfortunately, those plans have been tainted by the Note 7, and Samsung will have to rethink how it pitches the phone to the public. The device is said to be another radical transformation in design, according to early rumors, and I‚Äôve been told to expect some impressive new products throughout the year. (Sorry, I wish I had more details than that.) But if Samsung wants those devices to be successful, it‚Äôll have to prove that it‚Äôs learned its lesson and has the processes in place to make sure all future products are safe.

It‚Äôs a clever move, if a little frustrating. However it's also one that doesn‚Äôt gel with the rest of Apple‚Äôs product line-up. By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 08:20, Mon, Nov 7, 2016 | UPDATED: 08:58, Mon, Nov 7, 2016 Apple unveiled its redesigned MacBook Pro last month. The new laptop sports a svelte unibody design inspired by the lightweight 12-inch MacBook, and showcases Apple‚Äôs first foray into multi-touch input with its macOS desktop operating system. But the redesigned MacBook Pro reveal has not been without its controversies ‚Äì not least because the new Apple laptop comes with a hefty new price tag. Apple has also chosen to abandon the plethora of ports it included with the previous MacBook Pro model, including two Thunderbolt 2.0 ports, two USB 3.0 ports, a HDMI and SDXC card reader. Instead, the new MacBook Pro carries four Thunderbolt 3 ports. These versatile ports are fully-compatible with the USB Type-C standard, and can be used to charge the device, as well as data transfer, video input and output. GETTYThunderbolt 3 and USB-C are undoubtedly versatile ‚Äì but has Apple jumped the gun? EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSWhen it came to ports, the MacBook Pro used to be Apple's no-compromise laptop Apple‚Äôs ever-growing arsenal of adapters means MacBook Pro owners can also use the Thunderbolt 3 port to connect to ethernet, USB A, Digital AV and VGA. There‚Äôs no doubt USB Type-C is more flexible than the single-use ports it has replaced on the previous MacBook Pro, and as soon as it becomes the industry-standard ‚Äì the configuration will make even more sense. USB-C is not currently the universal standard it will undoubtedly become Unfortunately, USB-C is not currently the universal standard it will undoubtedly become in the coming years. Even Apple itself has not fully committed to the multipurpose USB connector. The company bundles its latest smartphones, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, with a Lightning-to-USB A charging cable. That‚Äôs clearly an admission that most users are not yet onboard with the new USB standard. It also means MacBook Pro owners who want to charge or sync their new iPhone to the laptop over a wired connection will require a ¬£25 USB-C to Lightning cable or a ¬£19 USB-C to USB adapter. APPLEThe Apple Store is being populated with an ever-growing number of dongles It‚Äôs one of a number of inconsistencies that runs throughout Apple‚Äôs product line-up at the moment. Last year, customers who bought the latest iPhone and MacBook were able to connect the two devices without the need for a dongle. Those same customers were also able to use their Apple EarPod headphones across the MacBook Pro and iPhone. Today, that also requires an adapter. Although the MacBook Pro carries a 3.5mm headphone port, the latest iteration of the iPhone does not. Apple said the decision to drop this ageing technology took ‚Äúcourage‚Äù and will accelerate the development of wireless headphones ‚Äì where it sees the future of personal audio. APPLEApple has completely committed to Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C ‚Äì on the MacBook at least iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus also comes bundled with a pair of Lightning-connected headphones. Using Lightning over the traditional 3.5mm connector has a number of benefits, which Apple took time to highlight on-stage during the announcement of the smartphones. Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller used the JBL Reflect Aware headphones to demonstrate the power of the Lightning port. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs light weight, it‚Äôs affordable, provides active noise cancellation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn fact, with an app on your iPhone it‚Äôs adaptive and you can adjust how much exterior noise you want to let in or not and it does it all without batteries and charging ‚Äì because it works directly over that Lightning connector, simply not possible in just an analog cord.‚Äù EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSJBL's lighting-enabled headphones combine a lightweight design with active noise cancellation He‚Äôs right.¬†Express.co.uk¬†has tested the JBL Reflect Aware headphones and they provide awesome, customisable noise-cancellation without any of the bulk associated with the technology. However, these same benefits can be achieved with USB Type-C. In fact, JBL makes a pair of Reflect Aware headphones with a USB Type-C port instead of the Lightning. Unlike the Apple EarPods bundled with the iPhone 7, these are compatible with the MacBook Pro. Not only that, they benefit from the versatility of the port. MacBook Pro owners would be able to pick which of the four Thunderbolt 3 ports they wanted to dedicate to each function at any one time.¬† As someone who has had to uncomfortably contort both a MagSafe connector and 3.5mm headphone connection on the previous-generation MacBook Pro in various conference halls, aeroplane seats, and coffee shops ‚Äì this seems like another obvious win for USB Type-C. APPLEPorts aside, the headline feature on the new MacBook Pro is the Touch Bar Apple MacBook Pro 2016 Launch Event Thu, October 27, 2016 Apple is holding its third product launch of 2016, and has unveiled three new MacBook Pros and a major update to Apple TV. Play slideshow GETTY 1 of 18 Apple MacBook Pro 2016 Launch Event If the iPhone 7 is destined to only have one port ‚Äì surely it makes sense to ensure that port is the most versatile and open standard possible? Except that going all-in with USB-C on the iPhone, in the same way Apple has committed with the MacBook, would cut-off a nice revenue stream for the company.¬† Apple charges manufacturers a licence-fee to use its proprietary Lightning connector in their wired headphones. As a result only a few manufacturers ‚Äì including Philips and JBL ‚Äì have released compatible products since the MFi (Made for iPhone/iPad/iPod) specifications were released, back in June 2014. Apple used to market its products with the tagline ‚ÄúIt Just Works.‚Äù Unfortunately, the painful transition period between USB to USB-C as a mainstream standard, coupled with a few inconsistencies between products in the current line-up, means that for many customers this will no longer be the case. At least not without a few ¬£20 dongles, that is.

In English –ù–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º ’Ä’°’µ’•÷Ä’•’∂ Full version November 5, 2016 - 16:49 AMT SHARE Apple unlikely to refresh iPhone SE in March 2017, Kuo says As Apple faces pressure to maintain high gross margins amidst flagging iPhone sales, well-connected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggests the company will not apply an annual refresh cycle to its affordable, small form-factor iPhone SE handset, AppleInsider reports. In a note to investors obtained by AppleInsider on Friday, November 4, Kuo says Apple will prolong iPhone SE's lifecycle beyond the usual one year rotation in a bid to boost gross margins and minimize cannibalization of high-end flagships like the iPhone 7. Specifically, Kuo says a new iPhone SE model is unlikely to launch in the second fiscal quarter of 2017, which for Apple ends in March. The 4-inch iPhone variant debuted this year on March 31, leaving some to speculate that a next-generation version with updated internals would see release at roughly the same time in 2017. Kuo does not mention plans beyond the second quarter, meaning a refresh might land later in the year. The supposed decision to hold off on an iPhone SE revamp owes in part to lower than expected gross margin guidance for the current first fiscal quarter of 2017. During Apple's most recent quarterly earning conference call, the company said it anticipates gross margins between 38 percent and 38.5 percent for the three-month period ending in December, below consensus of more than 39 percent and down from 40.1 percent in 2015. Along with nixing an immediate iPhone SE update, Apple is taking other steps to goose profits. In particular, the Cupertino tech giant has been putting pressure on component manufacturers to reduce prices, a measure that effectively reduces supply chain costs, Kuo says. Major suppliers of key components, like Samsung and TSMC, have bargaining power and are unlikely to be impacted by the belt-tightening, but smaller producers could see calls for price cuts arrive in November and December, AppleInsider says. That being said, Samsung might raise prices for 3GB DRAM and 3D NAND flash as those components remain in short supply. Kuo forecasts iPhone shipment volumes of 40 million to 50 million units for the current quarter, down year-over-year from 51.2 million units, on conservative sell-through for 4.7-inch iPhones and weakening demand in China. Looking ahead, he estimates total iPhone shipment volume to reach 35 million to 40 million units in the second quarter of 2017, down from 40.4 million units at the same time last year.

The new touch-sensitive control bar, a second display that will display different controls based on the program you're using, is silky smooth, beautiful to behold and incredibly easy to use. What I'm not at all sure about, however, is how much I'll love the control bar once it's no longer in front of me. There are two models with the Touch Bar, a 13-inch and a 15-inch one, which cost at least $300 more than the model without it. (The Touch Bar itself isn't the only difference; the more expensive models also have better processors, more ports and other upgrades.) When you're in front of these machines, it's hard not to be wowed. Both are impressive to look at, with their huge trackpads and bright screens. Both have Touch ID's fingerprint sensor built into the power button, which works as snappily as on the iPhone. related advertisement video MacBook Pro Touch Bar ¬† Apple also provided me with a 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar to review, and I found the keyboard very pleasant to type on. I use a 12-inch MacBook myself as my usual laptop, and found that I liked the keyboard on the new MacBook Pro much better than on my own machine. Both use the same, slimmer "butterfly" technology that Apple introduced with the MacBook in 2015, which cuts down on bulk but can also feel too shallow to some users. Apple improved the design on the MacBook Pro by making the keys feel like they're traveling a little more deeply into the keyboard. Even in the short time I've had the computer, it feels more powerful and impressive than its predecessors. If you're upgrading from an older MacBook Pro, this will feel like an upgrade: the screen is brighter, the performance is noticeably better and the computers themselves are lighter. Not bad, as a total package. But the focus of this new line really is the Touch Bar. It changes depending on what program you're using. For example, if you're using Safari, the bar may feature your favorite sites. I have nothing bad to say about it -- apart from the fact that it may require some creative ergonomics to use comfortably. The display on the Touch Bar is impressive, particularly when showing off color much more vibrantly than you'd expect from that tiny strip. Apple's made it easy and intuitive to customize. I'm a person who likes physical, clicky buttons, but even I have to admit that the added functionality of the adaptable software controls on the Touch Bar is intriguing. Not all of the Touch Bar controls are necessarily timesavers. For example, some observers of Thursday's event remarked that the Touch Bar adds steps in Photoshop. But some of the controls do save you having to go through annoying drop-down menus, instead putting them at your fingertips. Being able to customize the Touch Bar is a huge perk for often-used functions. For example, if you have an abnormal devotion to flagging messages, or if you're an "Archive" person instead of a "Trash" person in Mail (or vice-versa) you can add those quick shortcuts right to your keyboard through the Touch Bar. In other programs, it gives you finer, more visceral control -- you can slide through a spectrum to get just the right shade in Photos, or hit just the right decibel level in iTunes without making your finger do a jackhammer impression on your volume keys. And, in any case, the Touch Bar controls are about intuition -- not necessarily about saving time for power users who've memorized all of the keyboard shortcuts, but for making various features more available to the average user. With zero training, I knew exactly how to use the Touch Bar. That's not nothing. So, in a vacuum, these are really exciting and excellent computers. In the real world, they are still excellent -- but there are other things to consider. Price is a big one. The MacBook Pro line has always been Apple's premium line, and that's never been more apparent. The new entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar is $1,500. If you want the Touch Bar, you have to pay at least $1800. If you wanted, you could spend about $4800 on a fully tricked-out 15-inch MacBook Pro with all the bells, whistles and software that Apple offers. That's not insignificant. There's also the fact that Apple is really pushing its users into new technology -- which means we're going to have a transition period here. While the MacBook Pro fixes one of users' greatest laments about the MacBook -- the MacBook has a single USB-C port; the new MacBook Pros have four -- people will still need to use adapters for most of their accessories. Which, quite frankly, can be annoying. I personally have forgotten adapters on business trips before, making my job unnecessarily harder. (In my case, I need an adapter for my digital voice recorder. Your mileage may vary.) That problem won't last forever; USB-C is likely to become the new standard. But that isn't the case now, and prospective buyers should know they're going to have to wait for an adapter-free existence. Transition periods can be annoying like that. Even the Touch Bar itself, while an intriguing addition that gives an honestly wonderful experience, will take some time to get used to. And if developers other than Apple don't embrace the technology and add some tricks of their own, a worst-case scenario could see the Touch Bar going down in history as a great missed opportunity: a piece of tech that was interesting, but never lived up to its full potential. That grim picture of the Touch Bar's future is not a prediction, by any means. It could easily become second nature to swipe, tap and slide at the top of my keyboard. I sort of hope it does, because it's a lot of fun in the demos. But it will take me -- and, likely, most other Mac users -- some time to figure out just how to make the Touch Bar personally useful to justify the MacBook Pro's price tag for all but the most faithful Mac users. That hurdle may prove a hard one for Apple to overcome, and it will have to make a strong case to users and developers to get all of us to jump it.

Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Nov 5, 2016 at 7:23AM Image source: Flickr user Michael Candelori.¬† If there's one thing that can be said about the election process in 2016, it's that it's been unique. In just a matter of days we're going to find out whether the United States will be run by the first female president ever, or the first career businessman with no prior political or military background. As the campaigns of both Hillary Clinton on the Democratic side and Donald Trump on the Republican side have pressed on, we've learned in greater detail where they stand on key issues. One of those issues that the American public has really pushed into the spotlight over the past year has been legal corporate tax shelters. Donald Trump's corporate tax repatriation plan By "legal corporate tax shelters" I mean the practice by which U.S. corporations are choosing not to repatriate profits earned in overseas markets because they would pay an exceptionally high tax rate on that income if they did. The U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35% trails only the United Arab Emirates and Chad. Because U.S. corporate income tax rates are so high relative to other developed countries, U.S. corporations now have nearly $2.5 trillion in profits stashed in overseas markets, based on a new report from Capital Economics. Comparatively, this figure has doubled since 2008, and it's up more than six-fold since 2002 when income stashed overseas accounted for less than $400 billion. Image source: Getty Images. There's seemingly little incentive for companies to repatriate this cash at up to a 35% tax rate, but a languishing U.S. economy that's struggling to grow GDP at more than 1% per quarter could certainly use a capital and reinvestment infusion. Donald Trump believes he has a plan that could fix both problems. Donald Trump, if elected, has proposed lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from 35% in an effort to put more money into the hands of businesses so they can hire, innovate, and expand. More importantly, he's advocated for a special corporate tax repatriation holiday rate whereby corporations with money stashed overseas would be able to pay a tax rate of just 10% on that income in order to bring it back into the United States. This cash could be a big boon to some of the largest U.S. multinational companies. Trump's tax plan would really benefit these large U.S. multinationals There are, in particular, five companies that would stand to benefit the most, since they alone account for more than a sixth of the nearly $2.5 trillion estimate in cash held overseas. Microsoft It may not be thought of as the poster child for corporate income tax avoidance, but software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has nearly $110 billion in profits parked overseas. Could you imagine what would happen if it were able to repatriate this cash at a special 10% rate and was left with nearly $99 billion in cash! Image source: Microsoft. For starters, Microsoft could wipe out every cent of the nearly $76 billion it currently has in debt and wind up with more than $20 billion to spare. It could also easily pay out a $10 a share special dividend, or even better, consider increasing its annual payout by $1 per share, per year, to increase its dividend yield to more than 4%. Though its smartest move might be to use that cash as an impetus to make earnings-accretive acquisitions. Microsoft is in the process of acquiring professional social network LinkedIn¬†for $26.2 billion, and it could certainly benefit by using its overseas cash to bolster its social and cloud-computing offerings in the coming years. General Electric The only other U.S. multinational with more than $100 billion in cash being held in overseas markets is conglomerate General Electric (NYSE:GE). If it were able to repatriate its cash under Trump's proposal, it would have a little more than $90 billion left over. Image source: General Electric. General Electric has always been an opportunistic company, which means the addition of $90 billion would likely results in substantial M&A activity. Over just the past month and change GE has acquired two 3D printing companies for $1.4 billion and wind turbine parts maker LM Wind Power for $1.65 billion. There are also rumblings on the Street that GE could take a bigger role in the oil industry and has been taking a close look at Baker Hughes. It's possible that shareholders could benefit with a dividend hike, but GE would likely look to M&A if it were to repatriate its overseas cash pile. Apple If tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has any issues, cash is not one of them. Following its recently released third-quarter report, Apple now has $237.6 billion in cash, albeit it also has a record $75.4 billion in debt on its balance sheet, too. Based on Capital Economics' data (which was released prior to Apple's Q3 report), Apple has $91.5 billion in cash overseas. Image source: Apple. Assuming Trump's repatriation holiday rate were to prevail, Apple would walk away with about $82 billion in cash. This would be more than enough to completely wipe out its debt. Not known as much of an acquirer, Apple could use its repatriated capital as a means to buy back more stock and increase its dividend payout to shareholders. Apple could consider getting aggressive and repurchasing up to 10% of its outstanding common stock, or it could probably even double its annual dividend, pushing its forward yield to almost 4%. Pfizer U.S. drug giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) also has a lot of cash tied up in overseas markets. According to Capital Economics, Pfizer has about $80 billion in cash overseas, which would leave it somewhere near $72 billion if a 10% repatriation holiday rate were enacted. Image source: Getty Images. There's a lot Pfizer could do with access to an extra $72 billion in the United States. For starters, it could consider making a serious dent in the $44 billion in debt on its balance sheet, or boost its $1.20 annual payout to push its yield well above 5%. However, the more likely scenario is Pfizer using the capital to reinvest in its organic research and development, as well as (you guessed it) more M&A. Pfizer purchased Hospira for its biosimilar and injectable drug portfolio in 2015, and in 2016 it's acquired Anacor Pharmaceuticals for its experimental non-steroidal eczema product, and Medivation for its oncology blockbuster Xtandi (which was co-developed by Astellas Pharma). Inorganic growth is a big part of Pfizer's long-term growth strategy, and its repatriated cash could be a means to that end. IBM Finally, software giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) has more than $65 billion in cash sitting in overseas markets. If Big Blue were able to repatriate its overseas cash at a special 10% rate, it would gain access to about $60 billion that could be used in the United States. Image source: IBM. It's quite likely that IBM would use at least some of its cash to boost its shareholder yield. It's no secret that IBM was late to the cloud-computing party, and it's looked to cut costs and boost shareholder yield to thank shareholders who are sticking by the tech giant's long-term business transformation. IBM could very easily repurchase 10% to 15% of its outstanding common stock, or push its yield north of 5% to appease long-term shareholders. Another possibility is IBM could buy its way to cloud-computing growth with its repatriated cash. IBM has been mostly dinking and dunking its way to inorganic growth, however a $60 billion cash infusion in the U.S. could change that strategy. It's important that readers understand these are hypothetical scenarios of what these companies could do with their overseas cash if it were repatriated; and that these scenarios are wholly dependent on both Donald Trump being elected as president, and him being able to get his corporate tax holiday rate implemented by Congress. These are some big "what if's" that should be taken into consideration when analyzing the future of any of these companies.

Pundits have been writing obituaries for the personal computer for years now, but Apple and Microsoft just showed that the consumer tech workhorse is still alive and kicking. Souped-up PCs wowed reviewers at dueling product launches held by the companies last week. Microsoft showed off the Surface Studio, a "massive, gorgeous, $3,000 desktop PC" with a touch-enabled screen that artists and designers can lay flat like a drafting table. Apple's new MacBook Pro, meanwhile, replaces the top row of keys with a touch screen that displays handy shortcuts for whatever app is being used. The launches prove that the Microsoft-Apple rivalry is also "alive and well," said Hayley Tsukayama at The Washington Post. A few years ago, Microsoft's consumer products felt like an afterthought; the company notably missed out on the mobile revolution with its failed Windows Phone. But if the initial reactions to the Surface Studio are any indication, Microsoft may be beating Apple at its own design game. Who knew tech enthusiasts in 2016 would be drooling over a desktop? "It's like we're in some kind of weird time warp," said Bob O'Donnell at Recode. Thirty-five years after the first PC came to market, we are witnessing something "more like a PC renaissance than a PC extinction." The tablet market, which has never approached the size of the PC market, has been shrinking for three years now; sales of smartwatches are also tanking. Meanwhile, even though global PC sales have been declining since their peak in 2011, "U.S. PC shipments have actually turned around recently, and are now on a modestly increasing growth curve." Still, PCs will never generate the same kind of excitement they once did, said Walt Mossberg at The Verge. That's because the PC "has become the furniture of our digital lives." You don't want to go without one, but you don't need to replace it every year and you "don't expect revolutionary new features when you do." Apple and Microsoft are nevertheless smart to boot up their PC efforts, said Dan Gallagher at The Wall Street Journal. With nearly 200 million desktops sold globally this year, "a market still exists that tech companies can ill afford to ignore." The Mac alone pulls in nearly $23 billion in annual revenue for Apple ‚Äî a tally that would make it 123rd on the Fortune 500 if it were a stand-alone business. Sales of Microsoft's line of Surface devices are up nearly a third over last year. Apple and Microsoft's latest designs reflect the fact that "desktops and laptops are increasingly becoming more useful as professional tools than consumer gadgets," said Lisa Eadicicco at Time. "We used to use our home computers for everything from checking email to surfing the web to listening to music." Now most people have moved on to smartphones and tablets for those activities. That partly explains why these new machines are so expensive (the new MacBook Pro starts at $1,799). "Those price tags are tough for an everyday user to justify, but professionals might see the machines as an investment if they're making money by using them."

It‚Äôs also made its LG-made 4K and 5K display cheaper in an additional move to appease customers. To recap, Apple faced a massive backlash when it unveiled the revamped MacBook Pros with only 2 or 4 USB-C Thunderbolt slots, getting rid of legacy ports like the MagSafe connector, SD card reader, and USB-A slot in the process. The brand later explained why it chose to do so to a certain extent and promised to make the transition easier for everyone. The new cut in costs is meant for just that. Apple chose to shed some light on the move in a statement, saying that it recognizes most pro users rely on legacy connectors and face a tough transition. The company is looking to help them make the move and accelerate the growth of the new standards as well. Also Read: Apple to drop prices, adopt OLED panels for future MacBooks The new rates are valid till the end of the year and are applicable on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals, in addition to USB-C adapters and cables. Customers can now snap up accessories like the USB-C to USB Adapter for $9 (down from $19) and SanDisk USB-C SD card reader for $49 (down from $29). Apple is also dishing out a deep discount on its new LG UltraFine Display. The 21.5-inch 4K version is currently selling at $524, a steep $175 fall from its initial $699.95 cost. The 27-inch 5K version will come out in December at $974, another huge $325 decline from its original $1299.95 value. The special rates are set to be around till the end of 2016.

In its ever-escalating war against connectivity ports, Apple‚Äôs latest computers do away with the SD card port, a full-size USB port, and the HDMI port. Instead, you‚Äôll need a dongle to convert those ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù connectors, as Apple put it on Friday, into the new, smaller USB-C port. ‚ÄúWe recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition,‚Äù the company said in a statement, without acknowledging that Apple‚Äôs newest iPhone, released just last month, is one such ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù device ‚Äì without a dongle (or a different cable, sold separately), you can‚Äôt connect Apple‚Äôs new smartphone to Apple‚Äôs new laptop. ‚ÄúWe want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem.‚Äù That help will be a decent discount on the price of the dongles ‚Äì it calls them adapters ‚Äì until the end of this year. The most popular one is likely to be the USB to USB-C adapter ‚Äì which will be $9, down from $19. For connecting iPhones (both new and old), you‚Äôll need a $19 Lightning to USB dongle ‚Äì although you could use an old Lightning to USB cable if you bought the USB to USB-C adapter. Keeping up? Dongle spaghetti It‚Äôs an acknowledgement that Apple‚Äôs pro users aren‚Äôt exactly thrilled with the latest offering from the company considered to offer the gold standard in laptops. The bigger issue here, and one that was expertly discussed in a Medium post by technology journalist Owen Williams, is what many see as a muddle at the heart of Apple‚Äôs newest products. For a company that rightly prides itself on creating products that ‚Äújust work‚Äù, it‚Äôs literally descended into something of a tangled mess. Apple has, Mr Williams argued, created computers that lack a core selling point. For pro users, the types that use their Macs for graphic design and video editing, the new range only serves to take away functionality existing Macbooks provide. If you‚Äôre not a pro user, that‚Äôs fine. But along with Apple‚Äôs announcement of new hardware came the news that the prices were going up. Dramatically so, if you‚Äôre living in Brexit Britain. (Though Apple certainly isn‚Äôt alone there. Marmite, anyone?) Those factors combined mean the dongle issue, one Apple might have got away with in the past, has caused added frustration to the faithful who had been waiting for a serious Macbook upgrade for some time. Dongles get lost, forgotten and broken. They‚Äôre an added source of vulnerability when it comes to things accidentally being pulled out when uploading some data, corrupting the lot. The Macbook future, at least for a short while, is a rag-tag spaghetti junction of dongles strewn across a desk or stuffed into a bag. In offices around the world, inboxes will fill with passive aggressive requests for ‚Äúwhoever took my iPhone dongle‚Äù to ‚Äúplease put it back where you found it, no questions asked‚Äù. And when something doesn‚Äôt work, you‚Äôll now need to ascertain: is it the device that‚Äôs broken? Or the cable? Or the port? Or the dongle? Competitors moving in But hold up. Apple has form here, and history mostly proves them right. Where Apple goes, others normally follow. Earlier Macbook models already did away with ethernet ports and the CD/DVD drive ‚Äì a move which seemed absurd at the time, but I‚Äôd argue Apple was ultimately exonerated. When was the last time you put a CD into your computer? So in time, the accessories we use every day will become USB-C as standard, no question about that, and the dongles will no longer be needed. But in the short term, Apple is left with a product that that no longer caters to either end of the market. Data suggests schools, parents and bosses are looking to Google‚Äôs cheaper Chromebooks, which this year began outselling MacBooks. And if we‚Äôre looking at MacBooks as being as part of the bigger Apple planet, we‚Äôre left with a company that appears to be behind in many areas. Its iPhone is still king, but sales have been in decline. Apple doesn‚Äôt have any virtual reality hardware. It doesn‚Äôt have any augmented reality hardware. Or a car ‚Äì autonomous, electric or otherwise. In artificial intelligence, Apple‚Äôs Siri is considered to be the least smart of the mainstream smart assistants, and unlike Google and Amazon, it can‚Äôt yet be found in a family-friendly home device. Tim Cook appears to be throwing money at the problem(s). Spending on research and development has ballooned in the past three years, though Mr Cook is staying typically mum about what exactly the company is working on ‚Äì only to tell worried investors that his company has the ‚Äústrongest pipeline that we‚Äôve ever had and we‚Äôre really confident about the things in it‚Äù. Only an idiot would write off Apple and its future. I don‚Äôt intend to be that idiot. Apple wasn‚Äôt the first to market with the smartphone, not even close, but it went on to define the industry and produce the most profitable piece of technology ever made. It could do that again and again in these new areas. As the world‚Äôs richest company, it has time and resources on its side.

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung) Share Written by Christopher Groskopf November 05, 2016 Let‚Äôs say, for the sake of argument, that you‚Äôre an Apple fan. You‚Äôve got a Mac, an iPhone, an Apple TV, and at least one Airport router. You even bought that overhyped watch. If you own those five devices, and use the software that Apple provides for each, then you‚Äôve agreed at least 30 contracts, totaling more than 100,000 words of legal documentation. That‚Äôs longer than either The Hobbit or the first Harry Potter book. Offline, signing a contract is something we know we should take seriously. You may use lawyers to review the details or read it through carefully yourself. A bad contract can prevent you from getting a refund for shoddy work, or lock you into an paying for a service that you‚Äôve cancelled. You probably file the signed paper away in an old-fashioned filing cabinet. However, if you‚Äôre like most people, you probably don‚Äôt read any of the contracts you agree to online, much less save them. You may not even think of those ubiquitous ‚ÄúI agree‚Äù buttons as being anything like signing a contract, but legally your click is the same as your signature. To get a better sense of just how pervasive software contracts have become, Quartz collected data on the most beloved technology company of them all: Apple. We haven‚Äôt singled out Apple because their contracts are particularly bad, but rather because they produce so many products and almost every one comes with its own contract. The legal section of Apple‚Äôs website lists more than 100 contracts. They cover everything from the operating system for the Apple Watch to the defunct Cards app for iOS. Most of these contracts say similar things: You don‚Äôt own the software. Apple isn‚Äôt liable if it fails or blows up. You can‚Äôt hack it or change how it works. However, each contract is also slightly different from the others and, unless you‚Äôve carefully read all of them, you almost certainly aren‚Äôt aware of those differences. The terms for iTunes, for example, allow the company to suspend access to books or music you‚Äôve already paid for. They also stipulate that you can‚Äôt burn your iTunes music to a CD more than seven times. Software can only be used on an ‚ÄúApple-branded computer.‚Äù For example, if you work on a Windows PC or use an Android phone there‚Äôs no guarantee that you can read your ebooks there. They‚Äôre also not guaranteed to work at all if Apple were ever to go out of business. ¬†A heavy internet user could easily have agreed to a million or more words of contracts.¬† Quartz reviewed 100,000 words of Apple legalese, and the company‚Äôs contracts are no worse than any other tech company. Tech giants, like Google and Microsoft have contracts that are significantly more wordy and hard to understand. And unlike Amazon, AirBnb, Adobe, Buzzfeed, Microsoft, Instagram, Slack, Tinder and WeChat, Apple does not include a consumer-hostile ‚Äúbinding arbitration‚Äù clause, which would block their customers from ever taking them to court. Let‚Äôs say, that after reading this article you decide to read the contracts for your Apple products and stash them in a digital file. That wouldn‚Äôt be enough to ensure you really know what you‚Äôve agreed too. At least 15 of Apple‚Äôs contracts have been revised in 2016. Most changes are effective immediately, with or without notice. It‚Äôs impossible to know how frequently Apple makes changes, because old versions are not kept online. The company did not respond to an email requesting information on how frequently changes are made. If you count those revisions individually, then Apple fans have probably agreed to several hundred-thousand words of contracts‚Äîclose to the length of the entire Lord of the Rings series, or a couple volumes of George R. R. Martin‚Äôs loquacious Game of Thrones. And that‚Äôs just Apple. Virtually every other tech company follows the same pattern. Long-time internet users could easily have agreed to a million or more words of contracts. So what is an Apple fan, or any internet user, to do? Most of us would rather sign the contracts than abstain from modern life. It‚Äôs important to know, however, that these contracts have an impact. They can demolish your ownership rights or restrict your freedom of speech. Acknowledging their absurdity is an essential first step. Putting pressure on lawmakers and companies to rein in the most blatant abuses of digital contracts may be next. Quartz is making available the full dataset of Apple contracts created for this story. These data were made by collecting US legal documents from Apple‚Äôs site, truncating them to only the English-language pages, and then performing simple page and word counts. No effort was made to standardize font sizes or account for other peculiarities of the source documents. All data is as of Sept. 30, 2016.

Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Nov 5, 2016 at 7:23AM Image source: Flickr user Michael Candelori.¬† If there's one thing that can be said about the election process in 2016, it's that it's been unique. In just a matter of days we're going to find out whether the United States will be run by the first female president ever, or the first career businessman with no prior political or military background. As the campaigns of both Hillary Clinton on the Democratic side and Donald Trump on the Republican side have pressed on, we've learned in greater detail where they stand on key issues. One of those issues that the American public has really pushed into the spotlight over the past year has been legal corporate tax shelters. Donald Trump's corporate tax repatriation plan By "legal corporate tax shelters" I mean the practice by which U.S. corporations are choosing not to repatriate profits earned in overseas markets because they would pay an exceptionally high tax rate on that income if they did. The U.S. corporate income tax rate of 35% trails only the United Arab Emirates and Chad. Because U.S. corporate income tax rates are so high relative to other developed countries, U.S. corporations now have nearly $2.5 trillion in profits stashed in overseas markets, based on a new report from Capital Economics. Comparatively, this figure has doubled since 2008, and it's up more than six-fold since 2002 when income stashed overseas accounted for less than $400 billion. Image source: Getty Images. There's seemingly little incentive for companies to repatriate this cash at up to a 35% tax rate, but a languishing U.S. economy that's struggling to grow GDP at more than 1% per quarter could certainly use a capital and reinvestment infusion. Donald Trump believes he has a plan that could fix both problems. Donald Trump, if elected, has proposed lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from 35% in an effort to put more money into the hands of businesses so they can hire, innovate, and expand. More importantly, he's advocated for a special corporate tax repatriation holiday rate whereby corporations with money stashed overseas would be able to pay a tax rate of just 10% on that income in order to bring it back into the United States. This cash could be a big boon to some of the largest U.S. multinational companies. Trump's tax plan would really benefit these large U.S. multinationals There are, in particular, five companies that would stand to benefit the most, since they alone account for more than a sixth of the nearly $2.5 trillion estimate in cash held overseas. Microsoft It may not be thought of as the poster child for corporate income tax avoidance, but software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has nearly $110 billion in profits parked overseas. Could you imagine what would happen if it were able to repatriate this cash at a special 10% rate and was left with nearly $99 billion in cash! Image source: Microsoft. For starters, Microsoft could wipe out every cent of the nearly $76 billion it currently has in debt and wind up with more than $20 billion to spare. It could also easily pay out a $10 a share special dividend, or even better, consider increasing its annual payout by $1 per share, per year, to increase its dividend yield to more than 4%. Though its smartest move might be to use that cash as an impetus to make earnings-accretive acquisitions. Microsoft is in the process of acquiring professional social network LinkedIn¬†for $26.2 billion, and it could certainly benefit by using its overseas cash to bolster its social and cloud-computing offerings in the coming years. General Electric The only other U.S. multinational with more than $100 billion in cash being held in overseas markets is conglomerate General Electric (NYSE:GE). If it were able to repatriate its cash under Trump's proposal, it would have a little more than $90 billion left over. Image source: General Electric. General Electric has always been an opportunistic company, which means the addition of $90 billion would likely results in substantial M&A activity. Over just the past month and change GE has acquired two 3D printing companies for $1.4 billion and wind turbine parts maker LM Wind Power for $1.65 billion. There are also rumblings on the Street that GE could take a bigger role in the oil industry and has been taking a close look at Baker Hughes. It's possible that shareholders could benefit with a dividend hike, but GE would likely look to M&A if it were to repatriate its overseas cash pile. Apple If tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has any issues, cash is not one of them. Following its recently released third-quarter report, Apple now has $237.6 billion in cash, albeit it also has a record $75.4 billion in debt on its balance sheet, too. Based on Capital Economics' data (which was released prior to Apple's Q3 report), Apple has $91.5 billion in cash overseas. Image source: Apple. Assuming Trump's repatriation holiday rate were to prevail, Apple would walk away with about $82 billion in cash. This would be more than enough to completely wipe out its debt. Not known as much of an acquirer, Apple could use its repatriated capital as a means to buy back more stock and increase its dividend payout to shareholders. Apple could consider getting aggressive and repurchasing up to 10% of its outstanding common stock, or it could probably even double its annual dividend, pushing its forward yield to almost 4%. Pfizer U.S. drug giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) also has a lot of cash tied up in overseas markets. According to Capital Economics, Pfizer has about $80 billion in cash overseas, which would leave it somewhere near $72 billion if a 10% repatriation holiday rate were enacted. Image source: Getty Images. There's a lot Pfizer could do with access to an extra $72 billion in the United States. For starters, it could consider making a serious dent in the $44 billion in debt on its balance sheet, or boost its $1.20 annual payout to push its yield well above 5%. However, the more likely scenario is Pfizer using the capital to reinvest in its organic research and development, as well as (you guessed it) more M&A. Pfizer purchased Hospira for its biosimilar and injectable drug portfolio in 2015, and in 2016 it's acquired Anacor Pharmaceuticals for its experimental non-steroidal eczema product, and Medivation for its oncology blockbuster Xtandi (which was co-developed by Astellas Pharma). Inorganic growth is a big part of Pfizer's long-term growth strategy, and its repatriated cash could be a means to that end. IBM Finally, software giant IBM (NYSE:IBM) has more than $65 billion in cash sitting in overseas markets. If Big Blue were able to repatriate its overseas cash at a special 10% rate, it would gain access to about $60 billion that could be used in the United States. Image source: IBM. It's quite likely that IBM would use at least some of its cash to boost its shareholder yield. It's no secret that IBM was late to the cloud-computing party, and it's looked to cut costs and boost shareholder yield to thank shareholders who are sticking by the tech giant's long-term business transformation. IBM could very easily repurchase 10% to 15% of its outstanding common stock, or push its yield north of 5% to appease long-term shareholders. Another possibility is IBM could buy its way to cloud-computing growth with its repatriated cash. IBM has been mostly dinking and dunking its way to inorganic growth, however a $60 billion cash infusion in the U.S. could change that strategy. It's important that readers understand these are hypothetical scenarios of what these companies could do with their overseas cash if it were repatriated; and that these scenarios are wholly dependent on both Donald Trump being elected as president, and him being able to get his corporate tax holiday rate implemented by Congress. These are some big "what if's" that should be taken into consideration when analyzing the future of any of these companies.

CNET 05/11/2016 Sean Hollister ¬© Provided by CNET James Martin/CNET On a cloudy day this May, in the dull fluorescent light of a plain white Google conference room, Rafa Camargo, Richard Wooldridge and Blaise Bertrand told CNET their plan to disrupt the phone market. Ara, a Lego-like phone with modular parts, would let buyers snap on a better camera, additional batteries or any other creative hardware a developer might dream up. It was set to be the first phone entirely designed by Google, the three men claimed. Then the Ara project was abruptly shelved. But now, all three of those men work for Building 8 -- a secretive new division of Facebook. There, they've been joined by an impressive list of heavy hitters that reads like a who's who of the tech world: Motorola, Tesla, Apple and Amazon, in addition to that contingent of Google ex-pats. So what, exactly, is this superteam of designers, engineers and manufacturing experts working on? Nobody outside of Menlo Park knows for sure, but the hires -- and at least one under-the-radar acquisition -- seem to indicate two things: it's mobile, and it may be modular. Whatever it turns out to be, building hardware at this scale represents a major shift for Facebook. The company's first attempt at hardware -- a 2013 joint venture with HTC that became known as the " Facebook phone" -- was a fiasco, discounted to 99 cents mere weeks after its debut. Since then, though, the company has doubled down, first with its $2 billion purchase of VR headset maker Oculus in 2014, and now with what appears to be a far more ambitious hardware endeavor with Building 8.¬† What's Building 8? ¬© Reuters Building 8 isn't an actual building; Facebook's Menlo Park offices are numbered 10 through 20. (Building 20 not pictured.) Originally, it sounded like Building 8 was a skunkworks where Facebook could prototype a whole bunch of new technologies -- like 360-degree video cameras -- and figure out the fastest way to get them into consumers' hands, usually through partnerships. That's what Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer suggested to the The Wall Street Journal, and it's what was widely assumed when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced he'd hired Regina Dugan to lead Building 8. Dugan is the former head of both the US Department of Defense's DARPA research arm, and Google's Advanced Technologies and Projects (ATAP) research lab. Zuckerberg suggested, in an April 2016 blog post, that Building 8 would pursue "augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence, connectivity and other important areas" -- which sounds pretty sciencey, to be sure. But the division's job postings and recent hires tell a slightly different story -- beginning with the Building 8 mission statement you'll find at the top of each job post. Here's the mission statement in full: Building 8 brings together world-class experts to develop and ship groundbreaking products at the intersection of hardware, software, and content. We have a clear mandate to ship products at scale. In particular, seemingly impossible products that define new categories that advance Facebook's mission of connecting the world. The B8 team will apply DARPA-style breakthrough development at the intersection of ambitious science and product development. It will operate on aggressive, fixed timelines, with extensive use of partnerships in universities, small and large businesses. Building 8 is all about shipping hardware, it seems. And could "seemingly impossible products" include an ambitious modular phone like Ara? Facebook didn't reply to a request for comment.¬† Phone experts wanted CNET analyzed nearly 50 Facebook job postings, past and present, and dug through dozens of employee profiles on LinkedIn to see the big picture. It soon became clear: Facebook isn't just building a lab in hopes of spinning out a few new startup companies. Instead, Facebook is hiring over a dozen different heads of what appear to be a dozen distinct departments within Building 8 -- including industrial design, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, device software, applications and services, manufacturing, supply chain and even customer service. Many of those heads of product are being asked to hire their own teams from scratch. In other words, Facebook appears to be building an organization that could conceptualize, design, produce, ship and sell hardware, and even deal with customers after the fact. (Who needs customer service and return policies for prototypes?) Only two of Facebook's new department heads are devoted to "skunkworks" and "partnerships," respectively, and few of the job postings ask for experience across the wide range of disciplines you might expect for a research lab. But many of them ask for people with mobile experience -- Android in particular. For instance, this posting for a lead electrical engineering systems architect specifically asks for experience with mobile processors, antennas and thermal design, and these two for a camera software engineer and a kernel software engineer each require five years of experience working with mobile processors and an "understanding of Android Frameworks." The heads of product software, product engineering and hardware each need experience leading teams that have brought "smart phone (Android, iOS) and/or consumer electronics" to market. There are also strong hints that the new head of software applications and services will be tasked with developing Android apps for the hardware Building 8 will make. Two other jobs specifically mention Facebook's intent to build "compelling consumer-facing products on the Android platform," and yet another hints that Facebook may sell accessories to go along with its products. Key talent According to their LinkedIn profiles, many of Building 8's recent hires reinforce the idea that Facebook is pursuing hardware in a big way: -¬†Nathan Kelly, Building 8's new head of global supply chain, previously helped build supply chains for Sonos, Tesla, HP/Palm, Microsoft and Sony Ericsson, according to his LinkedIn profile. -¬†Rich Heley, the new head of manufacturing, spent a decade at Apple figuring out how to mass produce aluminum enclosures for the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Mac -- all the way back to the first MacBook Pro -- then spent three years at Tesla, finishing as VP of product technology. -¬†Furhan Zafar previously directed the supply chain for Motorola's Moto Maker -- an effort that let buyers pick different phone backs and different accent colors for their phone's buttons and grills before they shipped to customers. -¬†Tim McCune, Building 8's new head of systems engineering, spent 17 years at Motorola and a brief stint at Apple as well. -¬†Richard Wooldridge, the new COO of Building 8, wasn't just the logistics behind Google's modular Ara handset -- he also spent four years leading the global supply chain at Motorola, including Moto's effort to build a factory in the US for the first Moto X phone. -¬†Rafa Camargo, Building 8's new head of product engineering, led development on Google's Ara phone, after a year and a half at Amazon's Lab126 hardware group working on the Amazon Fire Phone and 13 years at Motorola on such iconic projects as the Droid, Razr, even the StarTAC flip phone. -¬†Viresh Rustagi, the new head of device software at Building 8, was the head of software for Google's Ara as well -- after a two-year-plus stint managing a software dev team for Amazon's Kindle Fire tablets and set-top boxes, and 12 years working on software for mobile processors at Broadcom. -¬†Blaise Bertrand, Facebook's new head of creative, spent three years designing for Motorola and 12 at noted design firm IDEO, in addition to seven months at Google ATAP working on the Ara phone. These high-level execs are just the start. Building 8 has also snapped up a number of former Apple employees, including an executive recruiter, and is currently hiring three other recruiters and a recruiting manager to expand its collection of talent. It's also worth noting that, for now, all of these hardware efforts appear to be separate from the ones inside Facebook proper: the company already had its own VP of hardware and supply chain to help build its data centers and networking infrastructure. Oculus, the Facebook virtual-reality subsidiary, has its own separate hardware team too, plus its own research arm based in Seattle. Will Google's modular phone live on? Even if Facebook just hired four key members of the Google Ara team to lead its manufacturing and supply chain efforts, and even if it has a number of other mobile experts on the payroll, we can't say for sure they'll be working on a phone. All of Facebook's new expertise could go towards anything else that uses mobile processors, radios and the Android OS -- such as headsets, tablets, watches, smart home and other internet-of-things devices. Or something entirely new. And even if it is a phone, it isn't necessarily a modular one. Having failed to convince Google, the team may have given up on that idea. But perhaps not: In September, one month after the Ara team jumped ship, Building 8 bought a hardware startup called Nascent Objects -- which just so happened to be developing a modular consumer electronics platform, too. At the time of the acquisition, Building 8's Dugan implied that Nascent's tech would be used for fast prototyping: "Imagine designing, building and delivering a hardware product in just weeks. Instead of months, or even years," Dugan wrote on her Facebook page. "Together, we hope to create hardware at a speed that's more like software." But perhaps Dugan meant that Nascent's modular tech could help consumers build their own hardware -- the same idea behind the Ara modular phone. Back in May, in that Google conference room, the ambition behind Ara was huge. "We want to create a hardware ecosystem on the scale of the software app ecosystem," said Camargo. Wooldridge promised his team would provide hardware and technical support, and help indie hardware designers get their snap-on modules certified by federal regulatory agencies, so that even a "bedroom student" could add a new feature to their phone. Bertrand explained how fashionable it could be, and how attractive for big brands, to have decorative phone pieces that a user could change on the fly. Now, they're all together again, inside a company that -- unlike Google -- wouldn't be disrupting its own business by competing with existing Android hardware partners. (Facebook is a must-have app on more than a billion people's phones, but the company doesn't make any mobile hardware yet.) Plus, they're leading a division with access to "hundreds of millions of dollars" over the next few years, according to Zuckerberg. The ultimate pivot It's possible that Facebook's hardware ambitions never see the light of day. Consider Apple's secretive Project Titan program, which reportedly staffed up and spent millions on a self-driving car initiative that, so far, has only produced several rounds of layoffs and strategy changes. Reportedly. But it seems, at least, that Facebook is following the same path as its arch-rival, Snapchat. Until a few months ago, Snapchat's social app was its only product. But the company recently rebranded itself as a camera company and surprised the world with Spectacles, a Snapchat-specific hardware product it had developed in secret (after stealthily hiring its own group of wearable tech experts). Facebook has a bigger user base than Snapchat, more money and more hardware experts. If the company unveils its own phone -- or mobile accessory -- in the next year or two, it wouldn't be too surprising.

Try this tool By: Rohit Arora Updated: Saturday, November 5, 2016, 15:33 [IST] Artificial Intelligence and Chat Bots are considered to be the next big thing. These two technologies are supposed to provide support or sometimes control everything around us, be it cars, lights, TVs, mobile apps, services, and other electronic devices. And we are not talking about distant future, it's already happening around us. Big names like Google, Apple, Facebook, etc. are implementing them in their new products, for instance- the latest Google Pixel handsets are backed by AI tool Google Assistant, Apple Siri is already quite popular and Facebook is also using chat bots in its Messenger app. SEE ALSO: Reliance Jio's Quest for Better and Smarter Smartphone Experience: 5 Promising Things to Know The day is not far when everyone will have a personal bot offering its services to manage their entire digital life and make things much easier for them. Having said that, there's a great demand for young minds who can think out of the box and create bots to execute digital tasks seamlessly. This is where Gupshup, a cross-channel bot platform offers its services. SEE ALSO: Here are 5 Tricks To Get Better Google Search Results The company claims that it used by over 30,000 developers building services that process over 4 billion messages per month and over 150 billion cumulative. The platform has recently unveiled two bot building tools to create chatbots on its platform, a 'Flow Bot Builder' and a 'Template Bot Builder' using which even non coders can build chat bots. Let's find out how it works. Create Bots with drag and drop The talking point of the new platform is that it doesn't ask for coding skills. Users can use the simple drag-and-drop tools and pre-selected menus to create bots. Flow Bot Builder As per company, the Flow Bot builder makes the process entirely code free. Using a graphical, easy-to-use, web-based interface, users simply design the conversational flow for the bot. The company has also cited an example, where a business analyst can quickly define the navigation flow with a series of menu choices. Flow Bot Builder makes it simple to create a variety of engaging chat bots, from informative to entertaining, without entering a single line of code. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Template Bot Builder Talking about the Template Bot Builder, the company says that it gives entrepreneurs and small business owners the ability to capitalize on the exponential growth of chatbots using pre-defined templates. These templates are fully customizable to fit their audience and brand. For example, a restaurant owner can use a pre-defined bot template that already has food browsing and ordering functionality coded in it. Serves the need of SMBs and individual coders The new tool combines the company's existing IDE Bot Builder (a tool for technical developers) to cater the needs of everyone from enterprises and small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to individual bot fans across the globe. We believe this platform can come handy for young minds and SME's who wants to create something new but often find themselves handicapped when it comes to building bots. These tools can help them create new bots, which have become quite crucial for online ventures in India and world. Let us know about your views regarding this new platform in the comments.

Full Site Menu Forget the start-up garage myth. We need golden triangles and super clusters 10 days ago / World Economic Forum LONDON - One of the most powerful myths surrounding technology entrepreneurs is that of their journeys beginning in a humble garage. The founders of Amazon, Apple, Dell, Disney, Google and Microsoft have all made this claim. Hewlett Packard really does have roots in a garage ‚Äì at 367 Addison Avenue, Palo Alto. HP‚Äôs first product, the HP200A audio oscillator, was manufactured there in 1939 and used to test sound equipment. Yet, like many other entrepreneurial stories, its origins actually lay in a research university. This early hit for HP ‚Äì eight were sold to Disney for its production of Fantasia ‚Äì did not just magically emerge from the imagination of Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard working in the latter‚Äôs Stanford garage. It can be traced back to Hewlett‚Äôs Master‚Äôs thesis at Stanford University, where he enjoyed access to cutting-edge technology, fellow enthusiasts and the guidance of legendary electrical engineer Fred Terman, one of the entrepreneurs‚Äô lecturers. If you visit 367 Addison Avenue, a plaque marking the ‚Äúbirthplace of Silicon Valley‚Äù will greet you - denoting the origin of the greatest tech cluster of them all. And it is clusters, not garages, that accelerate innovation. It is clusters that bring together start-ups, established corporates, specialist and aligned businesses, and, very importantly, research-intensive universities. Steve Wozniak disavows the garage myth around Apple ‚Äì perhaps a product of his co-founder Steve Jobs‚Äô ‚Äúreality distortion field‚Äù. The Homebrew Computer Club connected Jobs and Wozniak to a network of fellow enthusiasts ‚Äì many with access to university computing and engineering facilities. Jobs‚Äô course in calligraphy at Reed College inspired him to build Apple‚Äôs personal computers with beautiful typefaces and design. Time and again it is access to the brains, equipment and collaborative environment of research universities that spurs on great innovations and high-growth companies. This is seen in most of the high-growth vibrant technology clusters around the world. New York‚Äôs cluster of fast moving firms, including Buzzfeed, Foursquare and Tumblr, working at the interface of technology and media, are sucking in talent and taking advantage of collaboration with the city‚Äôs universities. In Bangalore, where the International Institute of Information Technology cultivates brilliant computer scientists, specialist firms in high tech services and outsourcing, such as InfoSys and Wipro, are clustering and growing fast. The same dynamic is at work in cities such as Berlin and Tel Aviv, and it is especially apparent in London. Such is the intensity of world-class universities, tech-savvy consumers, start-ups, availability of finance and culture, that London can more fairly be described as a ‚Äòsupercluster‚Äô, or cluster of clusters. These intense concentrations of innovation in and around universities are forging ahead in artificial intelligence, fintech, medtech, life sciences, design and fashion. Whatever the consequences for Britain post-Brexit, London is likely to continue to be a magnet for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs and tech-savvy consumers cluster in London In AI, bright young entrepreneurs such as Rob Bishop and Zehan Wang, who met as students at Imperial College London, found the community, mentorship and resources that connect academia and business. Their machine learning visual processing firm Magic Pony was recently sold to Twitter for $150 million. Bishop and Wang plan to stay in London to help develop Twitter‚Äôs global AI R&D centre. Their success came soon after Microsoft bought another London AI spinout, Swiftkey, for $250 million. The AI clusters emerging around universities in London, Oxford and Cambridge are connecting in what is being called the ‚Äògolden triangle‚Äô. Amazon, Apple and Google have invested hundreds of millions in Cambridge and Oxford AI startups such as Evi, Vocal IQ and Deepmind.One lab, 75 companies Universities, historically the quiet heart of clusters, are playing a more active and assertive role. Harvard‚Äôs innovation lab has helped more than 75 companies get off the ground since 2011. Imperial Incubator has seen scores of spin-outs connected to Imperial College agglomerate and grow on campus. In less than a decade ‚Äì from the basement rather than a garage of an academic building ‚Äì Imperial Incubator firms have attracted more than $1 billion in investment. Major corporations are developing their ability to replicate and engage with the collaborative innovation of universities. In the UK, the drug company, GSK, and telecoms company, BT, are creating their own clusters, encouraging universities to engage with them. Since its 2014 launch, Microsoft Garage ‚Äì there‚Äôs the word again ‚Äì allows its staff to work with academic-like freedom on projects unrelated to their core roles. Staffers and student interns collaborate across the 114,000-strong workforce. Failure is encouraged, but so is rapid adoption of new features and ideas that come out of the Garage. Vastly different areas of expertise mix, just like at the best universities. Ambitious projects are nurtured. As the Microsoft Garage motto commands, ‚ÄúDo epic s‚Äît‚Äù, expressing the same sentiment, if not the exact language, of great universities. Successful technology businesses can be fantastic myth-makers. Many have stories of questionable veracity, typically involving that perennial of start-up lore: the modest garage. In reality, however, their ideas frequently originate in university laboratories and lecture rooms. Those ideas turn into innovations in clusters, within which universities play vital roles, including the provision of spaces and facilities for start-ups.

(Apple) Share Written by Mike Murphy November 05, 2016 Perhaps it was the lack of ports that did it for you. Or maybe it was the removal of the MagSafe power connector. Or maybe it was the weird mini-touchscreen that replaced the function keys for an extra $300. Or maybe you just think Apple is boring now. Whatever the reason, it seems that the new MacBook Pro, announced last week, has been somewhat underwhelming critics and prospective buyers. While the computers are as well-built as any Apple product in recent memory, they seem to be needlessly minimalistic and expensive, removing all the ports, bar four USB-C ports that don‚Äôt connect to any legacy Apple products, or even the company‚Äôs newest smartphones without buying more cables. They also feature a thin touchscreen that is likely frustrating to use if you‚Äôre blind, and last year‚Äôs processors. If any of these factors are causing you to reconsider your relationship with Apple‚Äôs laptops, this guide is for you. Quartz has complied a list of Windows laptops to consider, as well as Windows programs, to replace the MacBook-shaped hole in your life. Windows laptops There was a time when Apple was really the only company that seemed to be able to pull off well-designed laptops. But in recent years, some of the largest Windows computer manufacturers have shown that they too can produce some great designs, and Windows 10, Microsoft‚Äôs latest operating system, is actually not terrible. Here‚Äôs a few computers that longtime Mac users may want to consider over the new MacBook Pro: Ones that look like MacBooks ASUS ZenBook (ASUS) The ASUS line of laptops have been getting decent reviews, and the UX303UA model looks like a slightly more angular MacBook Pro. For $900, you get a 13-inch machine with the same basic specs as the new MacBook Pros (an Intel Core i5 processor and a 256 GB solid-state hard drive) as well as decent battery life and a touchscreen. And it comes in rose gold. The UX390UA model, which ASUS is also calling the ZenBook 3, happens to look just like a MacBook, as well, except that it comes in a nifty shade of blue: (ASUS) HP EliteBook Folio. From a distance, it would be very easy to mistake this for a MacBook, were it not for the rather large HP logo just below the screen. The Verge called it a ‚Äúbeautifully designed laptop‚Äù (although gave it an underwhelming 6/10 review). For $1,000, you get a 128 GB solid-state hard drive and 8 GB of RAM, but you also get a touchscreen that folds down 180 degrees (for some reason), a biometric infrared eye scanner (like the one in the exploding Samsung Note 7), and a computer that is apparently drop- and dust-proof. HP Envy 13 (HP) CNET said HP‚Äôs other MacBook clone was one of computers that ushered in an era where ‚Äúquality became affordable‚Äù in Windows computers. This $850 machine has the same basic specs as the EliteBook Folio, without the touchscreen. HP Spectre (HP) HP‚Äôs super-thin flagship laptop, which the company says was built with ‚Äúartisan materials and striking craftsmanship,‚Äù looks rather like a MacBook designed in the 1980s: Replace the silver for black and gold, and you get the Spectre. The computer has a 13.3-inch touchscreen, a battery that can last all day, 8 GB of memory, a 256 GB solid-state hard drive, and will set you back about $1,200. Microsoft Surface Book Microsoft‚Äôs first homemade laptop got a specs refresh just last week and is definitely a different machine from the MacBook Pro, even if it looks quite similar. It features a zany bendy hinge, a detachable touchscreen, and works with a stylus so you can draw circles on the screen to your heart‚Äôs content. For $1,500, you get the pen, 8 GB of memory, and a 128 GB hard drive. There are lots of upgrade options, all the way up to a $3,200 machine with a 1 TB hard drive and 16 GB of memory, if that‚Äôs something you feel you need. Ones that look like something different Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga (Lenovo) Lenovo‚Äôs ThinkPad design, which dates back to when IBM still produced these laptops, has been around for decades. But this machine features a high-resolution 14-inch touchscreen that folds back to turn it into a tablet. It also has a fingerprint reader, and iffy battery life, according to The Verge. For $1,400, you get a 128 GB hard drive, 8 GB of memory, and that weird little red nub mouse thing that‚Äôs been on every ThinkPad computer ever. Lenovo Yoga 900 (Lenovo) Much like the other Lenovo Yoga on this list, this thin touchscreen laptop can contort itself into a tablet setup, but this one comes in a striking shade of bright orange, and doesn‚Äôt have the weird nubby mouse. For $1,150, you get a 13.3-inch screen, 8 GB of memory, and a 256 GB hard drive. (There‚Äôs also a newer 910 model that costs about $200 more for roughly the same specs and does not come in the same shade of orange, sadly.) Dell XPS 13 (Dell) Many publications, including The Verge, Wirecutter, and PC World, have called Dell‚Äôs laptop the ‚Äúbest‚Äù Windows computer out there. The screen is wonderfully sharp, and almost seems to bleed onto the edges of the device, as there‚Äôs almost no bezel around it. The body is a combination of aluminum and carbon fiber, and would not look out of place in a Christopher Nolan Batman film. The XPS 13 starts at a measly $800, and for that you get Intel‚Äôs newest processors, 4 GB of memory and 128 GB of storage. For $1,150, you can get the specs to match the MacBook Pro. Dude, you might be getting a Dell. Razer Blade Stealth (Razer) Gaming-computer company Razer has made some impressive laptops in recent years that are powerful enough to play some of the most processor-heavy video games on the market‚Äîsomething Apple has never striven to do. The Blade Stealth kind of looks like a metal version of the old plastic MacBooks, and for $1,600, you get the newest Intel chips, a 4K touchscreen, 512 GB of storage, and a whole bunch of ports. But you‚Äôd also be supporting a company that has recently made some very questionable marketing decisions. Replacements for Apple apps One of macOS‚Äôs main selling points over the years has been the suite of (relatively) simple-to-use and often free software that comes bundled with Mac computers. There aren‚Äôt direct correlations on Windows, but here are a few programs that could replicate some of the most-used Apple apps: iTunes. There aren‚Äôt a whole lot of decent music management programs out there in 2016 (and even iTunes isn‚Äôt all that great), but you can use iTunes on Windows machines if you‚Äôre sticking with your iPhone. If, however, you want a clean break from Apple, Google‚Äôs music management service, Google Play Music, is pretty great. Follow these instructions, and Google‚Äôs music manager will trawl through your computer and upload all the music on your hard drive for free, up to 50,000 songs. There‚Äôs also always Windows Media Player, but that‚Äôs never really been a great choice. Photos. Windows comes with a built-in ability to manage photos, but if you want something a bit more powerful, you can subscribe to Adobe Lightroom for $10 per month. Otherwise, again, Google offers a powerful free solution, called Google Photos. There are Android and iOS apps, as well as a website that lets you upload and catalogue every photo you‚Äôve ever taken, and search them using regular words. You can search for your photos of ‚Äúcats‚Äù or ‚Äútaxi‚Äù or ‚Äúfood‚Äù or ‚ÄúFrance,‚Äù and it‚Äôll find all the photos that fit that description using AI. Google Photos also allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos and videos in HD, though not the full resolution of the photo. Yahoo‚Äôs Flickr offers a similar service, with 1 TB of photo-storing space for free. iWork (Pages, Numbers, Keynote). This one should be pretty easy to replace: For office productivity software, the unsurprising choice is Microsoft Office. You can buy a home edition online for about $120, or subscribe to Office 365 for about $70 per year, which gives you access to your documents in the cloud (with 1 TB of storage), and auto-updating desktop apps. There are also far cheaper options out there, such as Google Docs, whose web apps work about 90% as well as their Microsoft or Apple counterparts. GarageBand. This is one small area where the Mac ecosystem really shines, as there aren‚Äôt many great inexpensive replacements on Windows. You could get an emulator to try to run the Mac program on a Windows computer, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that. If you‚Äôre just looking for a simple voice recording tool, there are options like Audacity, which works exceedingly well for what it does. For more complex projects, there‚Äôs the open-source LMMS, which is maintained by a group of engineers for free. Stagelight 3, which looks very similar to GarageBand, costs $10 for the basic software, or $50 for the full package. There‚Äôs also more professional software like Abelton Live, which ranges from $100 to over $700. iMovie. Similar to Garageband, there aren‚Äôt any direct correlations between Windows and Mac for hobbyist movie-makers. Microsoft does make a program called Movie Maker that is not wholly unlike iMovie, but a version for Windows 10 hasn‚Äôt officially been released yet. There are free options like avidemux and the VSDC video editor. If you want something with the utility of iMovie, you‚Äôre likely going to have to pay for software like Adobe Premiere, which you can purchase as part of a $20-a-month or $50-a-month subscription bundle from Adobe.

The analyst also expects sales to drop for the second consecutive year. Slowing sales are being attributed to weak demand in China, slow shipment volume of 4.7‚Äù iPhones in 1Q17, and the lack of a new iPhone SE in 2Q17. 1. We are conservative about the sell-through of the 4.7‚Äù iPhone and Apple‚Äôs market share in China. As such, we estimate 1Q17 iPhone shipment volume of 40-50mn units, lower than the 51.2mn units in 1Q16. 2. Shipment volume in 2Q16 came in higher than expected thanks to upbeat demand for the iPhone SE. However, in order to keep gross margin at a high level and to avoid cannibalization of high-end models, we do not expect Apple to launch an upgraded iPhone SE in 2Q17. Without contribution from a new model, we forecast total iPhone shipment volume will reach 35-40mn units and fall YoY in 2Q17, lower than the 40.4mn units in 2Q16. Apple will reportedly put the squeeze on suppliers to maintain margins. 1. For those with weak bargaining power, such as FPCB and panel-related makers, the price cut is inevitable given fierce competition due to numerous suppliers and generally low capacity utilization in 1H17. We note that most iPhone suppliers fall into this category. 2. However, a select few suppliers that have stronger bargaining power with Apple may even be able to raise prices. Take Samsung (KR) for example, the company is the main supplier of 3GB DRAM and 3D NAND flash. As DRAM and NAND flash will likely remain in short supply in 1Q17F, we believe Samsung is unlikely to surrender to the pressure, and may even raise its product prices. 3. TSMC (2330 TT, NT$184.5, N) is one of very few suppliers that won‚Äôt be affected by Apple‚Äôs pricing pressure as its production capacity was pre-booked. It would be very costly if Apple was to switch to a new supplier. Let us know if you were waiting for a new 4-inch iPhone. Do you think Apple should update the iPhone SE?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Prep Football: Silverado wraps up Desert Sky League title as Taylor sets record Friday Nov¬†4,¬†2016¬†at¬†12:01¬†AM Nov¬†5,¬†2016¬†at¬†12:34¬†AM Jacob Sundstrom Staff Writer @DPSundstrom APPLE VALLEY ‚Äî Silverado entered its final regular season game with a chance to grab sole possession of the Desert Sky League title. Levi Taylor quickly turned it into a coronation. The Hawks routed Granite Hills 61-12 on Friday to win their eighth game in a row and snatch back the DSL title after winning it last in 2014, when Taylor‚Äôs brother, Sam, played quarterback. So it‚Äôs fitting that Levi matched another one of his brother‚Äôs accomplishments by throwing for seven touchdowns to tie the school record. He also ran for a touchdown. Taylor also set the school record for passing yards with 423. That surpasses the 413 yard mark set by Jeff Perry. All in all it was a big night for the Silverado offense as the Hawks amassed 649 total yards against the Cougars. They led 48-6 at halftime and forced a running clock at the start of the fourth quarter. That follows a trend the Hawks have been riding all season long. Silverado lost its first two games to Apple Valley and Serrano, then got its offense together after switching Dionzae Nolan to running back. ‚ÄúThe defense will switch themselves according to how you‚Äôre going to play offense that game,‚Äù said Taylor. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre one dimensional and only passing the ball they‚Äôre just going to run cover four the whole game and there‚Äôs nothing you can do against that. The running game definitely set up the passing game. It all goes hand in hand.‚Äù Before the season began, Silverado head coach Rafael Ginorio saw the potential in this group to do something special. It was just a matter of how quickly the Hawks grew up. As it turns out, pretty quickly. ‚ÄúOur offense just clicked,‚Äù said Ginorio. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotten better every week and that‚Äôs really what we‚Äôve been preaching and so far that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening. Going into the playoffs we‚Äôve got a lot of momentum and we‚Äôre excited. And we feel like we‚Äôve got a lot more to go.‚Äù Taylor and his teammates haven‚Äôt been shy about bringing up the playoffs all season in the locker room. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ecstatic, everybody‚Äôs excited,‚Äù said Taylor. ‚ÄúEvery week we count down the weeks until the state championship. That‚Äôs why you hear us in there chanting ‚Äòsix weeks.‚Äô ‚Äù Given the wave Silverado rode to a DSL championship, a deep run in Division 9 isn‚Äôt out of the question. The Hawks will open up the postseason at Hawk Stadium on Nov. 11. They‚Äôll find out their opponent when playoff draws are released Sunday morning. Granite Hills finishes 1-9 in Alex Gonzalez‚Äôs second season at the helm, but the young coach likes the direction his team is headed. ‚ÄúI thought we made tremendous progress. It‚Äôs just terrible that it ended this way because we‚Äôve been in so many of our games where as last year it was like this every week,‚Äù said Gonzalez. ‚ÄúI think it was great to see us competitive in so many games.‚Äù Granite Hills quarterback Austin Shriver threw for 180 yards and a pair of touchdowns. The Cougars scored on their second drive of the game to cut Silverado‚Äôs lead to 7-6 but never got closer than that. They eventually scored their second touchdown in the fourth quarter with the game well out of reach. Both Trevon Clark and Daniel Dexter had big receiving games for the Hawks. Clark caught five passes for 146 yards and a touchdown while Dexter pulled in five catches, four of which went for TDs, for 156 yards.

X Athenry gets ready to march in support of Apple Locals attempt to reassure company in face of legal objections to ‚Ç¨850m data centre Sat, Nov 5, 2016, 05:50 Some locals fear Apple may lose patience and pull the plug. Photograph: Bode Marks/EPA ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Apple will on Monday launch its attempt to speed up a High Court bid by three objectors to block or delay its proposed ‚Ç¨850 million data centre near Athenry in Co Galway. Local residents and business owners will not be represented at the court hearing. Many of them will have their say in public tomorrow, however, with a planned march through the centre of the town in support of Apple. The two local and one not-so-local objectors are trying to block Apple‚Äôs planning permission on environmental grounds, as the law permits them to do. Many residents of Athenry, however, are desperate for the jobs and investment. They also understandably covet the prestige that comes with a project funded by the world‚Äôs most famous company in their struggling town. Locals will congregate shortly before midday in the church car park on Sunday, marching into the town centre. The Athenry for Apple support group insists that most of the town is behind the project. If the group is correct, then there will surely be a large turnout. No matter how many show up, the march will have no influence over the High Court, as it assesses whether to subject the Apple project to a full judicial review. A large turnout would, however, send a clear message to Apple that the town remains largely behind the company‚Äôs plan. Some locals fear Apple may lose patience and pull the plug. At this stage, this seems unlikely, as the company appears to be fully prepared for a six month delay, provided it can get the matter moved to the fast-track Commercial Court. Feelings are running high in the town, and local politicians including Fine Gael TD Ciaran Cannon have tried to calm things, while maintaining suppport for Apple. The objectors are fully entitled to utilise all legal avenues available. ADVERTISEMENT The dispute, however proper, draws attention to the frequent difficulties and delays many companies experience getting large infrastructural projects over the line in Ireland. If Apple is vanquished, it will be a source of major embarrassment for the Government, and for Athenry. ¬† ¬† ¬† Topics: Cantillon Ciaran Cannon High Court Apple Athenry AboutCantillon A man with a profound understanding of how money is made and lost, Kerry-born economist Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734) is a fitting namesake for this long-running column.

Apple has 106% of smartphone industry¬†profits? Whoa! Apple has 106% of smartphone industry¬†profits? As per BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long, Apple accounted for 103.6 per cent of all smartphone profits in Q3 By: Tech Desk | Published:November 5, 2016 12:01 pm Apple accounted for 103.6 per cent of all smartphone industry operating profits in Q3. (Source: Reuters) While there is a lot of talk about how Apple‚Äôs momentum is slowing down, there seems to be one area where it is way ahead of the competition and that is profits. In fact, one analyst thinks Apple has more than 100 per cent of smartphone industry profits in Q3. As per BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long, Apple accounted for 103.6 per cent of all smartphone industry operating profits in Q3. The number is above cent per cent because other vendors are losing money. Thus Apple ends up with ‚Äúmore smartphone profit than the industry netted overall‚Äù. For the year-earlier period, Apple grabbed 90 per cent of smartphone profits, Long said, highlighting how others had fallen of the cliff when it came to profits. In fact, the number 2 in profits is Korean tech giant Samsung with a mere 0.9 per cent share. Long said everyone from LG to HTC had lost money in the quarter. The analyst was of the opinion that Samsung, which had lost some market share because of the Note 7 fiasco, will end up ceding more ground to Apple in the near future. However, according to BMO estimates, Samsung still had 21.7 per cent of the smartphone market based on units sold in Q3, followed by Apple (13.2 per cent) and Huawei (9.7 per cent). Apple launched the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus in September this year at a crucial time for the company when its overall revenue has fallen thanks to slowing iPhone sales, which has become the star product in its portfolio. However, most analysts expect the iPhone 8 to come with major design changes and spark better upgrade than the 7 series. ¬© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaChill sets in early: Oppn moves to corner Govt, PM Modi hits back, says his decision troubles them IndiaKadak like my chai, rich don‚Äôt like it: PM Modi on demonetisation IndiaNo regrets, but govt addressing inconvenience, says Venkaiah Naidu IndiaPakistan says seven of its troops killed in Indian fire at LoC IndiaPanama Papers: 415 Indians under scanner as probe widens EntertainmentIn Bigg Boss 10, Bani is the most selfish contestant: Navin Prakash opens up after eviction EntertainmentKoffee With Karan 5: Twinkle Khanna's shocking revelations on the KJo's show EntertainmentITA Awards 2016: Mouni Roy, Shabbir Ahluwalia emerge big winners, see pics, video EntertainmentSalman Khan is spoiling nephew Ahil and Arpita Khan Sharma has proof, see pics Must Read SportsIndia vs England: Slow to adopt, now learning on the job SportsBCCI gets Lodha approval to pay Rajasthan players SportsRanji Trophy 2016: More brain than brawn TechnologyDemonetisation: Now, a tool to find ATMs with money across India TechnologySamsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 model numbers leaked TechnologyDemonetisation effect: Here's how to sign-up for Paytm, Mobikwik and use the e-wallets  Guru Nanak Jayanti 2016: India celebrates Gurpurab with great fanfare Nov 15: Latest News US President-elect Donald Trump could return Iraq war boosters to¬†power Punjabis react to Trump‚Äôs decision to deport illegal immigrants: ‚ÄòMay affect economy, hit unscrupulous travel¬†agents‚Äô Securities and Exchange Commission Chair leaving at end of Obama¬†administration INLD hits out at Congress, BJP for¬†‚Äòdoublespeak‚Äô Punjab, Haryana should resolve SYL issue amicably: BJP union minister Narendra Singh¬†Tomar ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Gigastone Urges Customers to Be on the Lookout for Fake Products and Confirms Its Entire Range of iOS Flash Drives Are Apple MFi Approved LOS ANGELES, Nov. 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ ‚Äî¬†Gigastone, the Leading Global Mobile Technology Accessory Brand announced today; that in light of the recent torrent of press, relating to Apple claims regarding counterfeit Apple products, it feels it is important to reiterate that its entire range of iOS Flash Drive and Flash Drive Reader products, are Apple MFi Approved. Gigastone wants to assist customers with strategies to prevent purchasing fake substandard products. ¬†¬†¬† Photo ‚Äì¬†http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161104/436491 Gigastone Micro SD Flash Memory In much the same way customers are being duped into purchasing Apple products that are not the real thing, many other leading brands are suffering the same fate. For example, those same customers are being duped into believing that certain products that bear the MFi logo and appear to be Apple approved, are in actual fact cheap reproductions. Apple has a stringent program whereby manufacturers of Apple mobile technology accessories, can submit their products and receive the coveted ‚ÄúMade for iDevices,‚Äù MFi approval. The process maintains that certified Apple accessories bearing the MFi mark, meet the high standards required to be associated with the high quality authentic Apple products. ¬†¬† Harold Katz, Gigastone Chief Marketing Officer commented, ‚ÄúMany mobile technology accessories available online, claiming to be MFi approved, are not and don‚Äôt meet the exacting standards required for MFi approval.‚Äù He went on to elaborate, ‚ÄúCompanies like Gigastone expend huge effort, ensuring that its products are of a high quality and meet and exceed industry standards. Maintaining these standards can make it more difficult for quality conscious suppliers, like Gigastone, to effectively compete in some situations. The end result is that the real loser is the customer, who is left with a substandard product that many times does not work.‚Äù Gigastone urges all customers to take the time to investigate the authenticity of products prior to their purchases;¬† Visit the suppliers site to ensure that the product in question exists. Ask the supplier for referral to authorized vendors. ¬† Google the product and review the results for signs of questionable suppliers. Search product reviews for customers that have suffered at the hands of dubious suppliers. If the price of the same product varies greatly when searching on Google Shopping, it is more likely that the cheaper products may be fake. Be aware that large Online Retailers list both their own product lines as well as 3rd party vendor products, not necessarily authenticated by the site being visited. Ask the seller if the product is authentic and if the approval marks it bears are genuine. ¬†¬† This is a global issue across all product lines and Gigastone urges customers to make a stand, in an effort to ensure that products offered by suppliers are authentic. ¬† Gigastone distributes a full range of memory products as well as mobile technology accessories, including the Gigastone iOS Flash Drives. The iFlashdrives come in a number of configurations to meet the needs of the Apple iPhone and iPad users. The Gigastone iFlashDrive software allows users to:¬†¬† Backup iPhone data from your device to the external memory of the Gigastone iPhone Flash Drives. Backup can be done automatically. (Photos/Contacts/Calendar) iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox and Facebook Album data can be moved to the external Gigastone IOs Flash Drive. ¬†¬† The data is secured by Touch ID Security and/or Encryption. All photos, movies and data is accessible from the iPhone or iPad without having to move the data from the external iOS Flash Drive to a iDevice. The Gigastone iOS Flash Drives have both Lightning and USB adapters or removable MicroSD cards, so backed up data can easily be moved to any computer without the need for the iDevice. Data can also be copied from a computer to the iOS Flash Drive and accessed from an iPhone or iPad.¬† The full Gigastone i-FlashDrive range can be viewed on the Gigastone Web Site. ¬† About Gigastone Gigastone is the leading global mobile accessory brand, specializing in state-of-the-art, high-end mobile peripherals and technology.

The lack of refresh comes as Apple attempts to maintain high margins on its high-end iPhone models, Kuo said in a new research note. Kuo forecasts that total shipment volume of iPhones will decline in the first half of 2017 due to tepid demand in China, slow shipment volume of 4.7-inch iPhones and the lack of an iPhone SE refresh in the second quarter of the year. Kuo argues that shipment volume came in higher in the first half of 2016 due to "upbeat demand for the iPhone SE." Instead, Kuo believes Apple will exert pressure on its iPhone component makers to drop prices in an effort to maintain its margins. He expects suppliers to begin price reductions on components in either November or December of this year. However, Kuo notes that not all suppliers will cut prices.¬†Most iPhone component makers, like those that make the device's panels, have weak bargaining positions with Apple due to fierce competition amongst suppliers. Some suppliers, like Samsung, are the main supplier of certain components for iPhones and have stronger bargaining positions than Apple. Kuo believes Samsung may even raise its prices. And finally, Kuo says there are a few suppliers like TSMC that are unlikely to be affected by Apple's attempt to maintain its margins. Overall, Kuo forecasts that iPhone shipment volume will drop year-over-year in the second quarter of 2017, sitting between 35 to 40 million, less than last year's 40.4 million in the second quarter of 2016. Apple introduced the iPhone SE in March 2016, packing in many of the iPhone 6s' features and component into a 4-inch frame similar to that of the iPhone 5s. It's unclear what kind of upgrade schedule Apple will adopt for the device, but it's internals are powerful enough to remain a capable phone for a couple of years.

They can't continue to expect to maintain high margins. The consumer electronics market does rise and fall and you need to be willing to ride those waves. If you attempt to maintain those high margins even when the market falls you end up with cheap products at expensive prices and that is where Apple is now. And that's where companies start going down hill.

fake Apple products rampant online, Gigastone reaffirms entire range of iOS flash drives are MFi approved News provided by Gigastone Nov 05, 2016, 00:02 ET Share this article LOS ANGELES, Nov. 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --¬†Gigastone, the Leading Global Mobile Technology Accessory Brand announced today; that in light of the recent torrent of press, relating to Apple claims regarding counterfeit Apple products, it feels it is important to reiterate that its entire range of iOS Flash Drive and Flash Drive Reader products, are Apple MFi Approved. Gigastone wants to assist customers with strategies to prevent purchasing fake substandard products. ¬†¬†¬† Photo -¬†http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161104/436491 Gigastone Micro SD Flash Memory In much the same way customers are being duped into purchasing Apple products that are not the real thing, many other leading brands are suffering the same fate. For example, those same customers are being duped into believing that certain products that bear the MFi logo and appear to be Apple approved, are in actual fact cheap reproductions. Apple has a stringent program whereby manufacturers of Apple mobile technology accessories, can submit their products and receive the coveted "Made for iDevices," MFi approval. The process maintains that certified Apple accessories bearing the MFi mark, meet the high standards required to be associated with the high quality authentic Apple products. ¬†¬† Harold Katz, Gigastone Chief Marketing Officer commented, "Many mobile technology accessories available online, claiming to be MFi approved, are not and don't meet the exacting standards required for MFi approval." He went on to elaborate, "Companies like Gigastone expend huge effort, ensuring that its products are of a high quality and meet and exceed industry standards. Maintaining these standards can make it more difficult for quality conscious suppliers, like Gigastone, to effectively compete in some situations. The end result is that the real loser is the customer, who is left with a substandard product that many times does not work." Gigastone urges all customers to take the time to investigate the authenticity of products prior to their purchases;¬† Visit the suppliers site to ensure that the product in question exists. Ask the supplier for referral to authorized vendors. ¬† Google the product and review the results for signs of questionable suppliers. Search product reviews for customers that have suffered at the hands of dubious suppliers. If the price of the same product varies greatly when searching on Google Shopping, it is more likely that the cheaper products may be fake. Be aware that large Online Retailers list both their own product lines as well as 3rd party vendor products, not necessarily authenticated by the site being visited. Ask the seller if the product is authentic and if the approval marks it bears are genuine. ¬†¬† This is a global issue across all product lines and Gigastone urges customers to make a stand, in an effort to ensure that products offered by suppliers are authentic. ¬† Gigastone distributes a full range of memory products as well as mobile technology accessories, including the Gigastone iOS Flash Drives. The iFlashdrives come in a number of configurations to meet the needs of the Apple iPhone and iPad users. The Gigastone iFlashDrive software allows users to:¬†¬† Backup iPhone data from your device to the external memory of the Gigastone iPhone Flash Drives. Backup can be done automatically.

Apple certainly had the time to build extensive support for the new API while waiting for the new Pros to ship. That‚Äôs a total of 23 Apple apps that live in the /Applications root folder with Touch Bar support as of the current macOS 10.12.1 build. The following apps have no Touch Bar integration as far as I could tell; App Store, Automator, Chess, Dashboard, Dictionary, DVD Player, Font Book, Image Capture, Photo Booth and Stickies. I expect all of Apple‚Äôs apps to flesh out their Touch Bar integrations in future macOS update.

By Nick Hastings ‚Äî November 4, 2016 9:41 AM Subscribe to this topic Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital¬†Trends This week, Microsoft came¬†out swinging by introducing the Surface Studio, Microsoft‚Äôs first¬†all-in-one desktop. The flexible, powerful PC¬†promises to be a game changer for creative minds across the world, and provides some staunch competition for Apple‚Äôs flagship computer, the iMac.¬†Since comparisons are inevitable, we thought we‚Äôd stay a step ahead and place the two side-by-side. Which computer‚Äôs hardware is more powerful? Which boasts the superior design? Let‚Äôs find out. Related:¬†Can Dell‚Äôs best all-in-one challenge Microsoft‚Äôs new Surface Studio? Surface Studio iMac (2016) Display & Dimensions 28-inch PixelSense touch 21.5-inch Retina 4K or 27-inch Retina 5k Processor 6th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 6th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 (27-Inch) or 5th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 (21.5-inch) Operating System Windows 10 Pro MacOS Sierra GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M 2GB or 980M 4GB Intel HD Graphics¬†6000 up to AMD Radeon R9 M395 4GB RAM 8GB, 16GB, or 32GB 8GB,¬†configurable up to 32GB Hard drive 1TB or 2TB rapid hybrid¬†drive 1TB hard drive or 2TB fusion drive; configurable up to 3TB fusion drive or 1TB¬†SSD Ports USB 3.0 (x4), Mini Displayport, Ethernet, SD card reader USB 3.0 (x4), Thunderbolt (x2), gigabit Ethernet,¬†SDXC card slot Wireless 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, Xbox Wireless built-in 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0 Cameras 5.0MP front-facing 1080p with Windows Hello support FaceTime HD camera; supports full¬†native¬†resolution Speakers Stereo 2.1 with Dolby Audio Premium Stereo speakers Microphones Dual microphones Dual microphones Price $2,999+ $1,099+ Availability Available for pre-order now, ships December 15. Available now DT review Hands-on N/A Hardware The Surface Studio is packing Intel 6th-generation Core quad-core processors. Apple‚Äôs iMac packs similar in the 27-inch¬†model, but the 21.5-inch model has a 5th-generation Intel Core i5 quad, with optional upgrade to Core i7. That means the smaller iMac is slower, but given the substantial size gap, that‚Äôs not too much of an issue. Both computers include high-end graphics cards (assuming you have the 27-inch iMac) that can be beefed up to 4GB of GDDR5 memory. The Studio‚Äôs Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M is newer and quicker than the¬†AMD Radeon R9 cards¬†in the iMac, however. And if you really want to boost your graphics, you can buy a GTX 980M for the Surface Studio. Display The Retina display on the¬†27-inch iMac is a thing of beauty. The 5K model features 5,120 x 2,880-pixel resolution with support for millions of colors, powered by an AMD Radeon R9 graphics card that can be beefed up to an M395X with 4GB of memory. Even considering¬†the UHD¬†beauty of the iMac, though, the Surface Studio is no slouch. Its 28-inch, PixelSense touch display features a 4,500 x 3,000-pixel resolution, meaning that the Studio‚Äôs screen houses about 13.5 million pixels. With 10-point multitouch, the screen can separately identify eight fingers and two thumbs ‚Äî simultaneously. For reference, most modern smartphones feature 2-point multi touch systems. The Surface Studio boasts an unusual 3:2 aspect ratio, which was implemented to support the pixel density, clocking in at an incredible 192 ppi. The screen‚Äôs sharpness is largely in service to color; more specifically, Windows has a built-in feature allowing the user to switch between color spaces, including DCI-P3 and sRGB. It‚Äôs a neat feature that allows artists and designers to preview their work under different parameters.¬†The Surface Studio also includes¬†the Surface Pen and the new Surface Dial, tools designed to improve the¬†computer‚Äôs¬†touch-screen experience and design accessibility; we‚Äôll go into that a bit later on. In the end, both displays look great. The iMac is sharper, but the Surface Studio‚Äôs color is excellent, and the ability to switch color gamuts through the touch of an on-screen button is great for creative professionals. Connectivity and features Both computers offer four USB-3 ports, Ethernet ports, and SD card readers. The iMac, unsurprisingly, is outfitted with dual Thunderbolt 2 ports, while the Surface Studio includes a mini-DisplayPort ‚Äî though, we‚Äôre not sure why you‚Äôd want to use any other screen. Each computer is also outfitted with¬†802.11ac Wi-Fi connectivity and Bluetooth 4.0. The Surface also includes native Xbox Wireless, a reflection of Microsoft‚Äôs Play Anywhere initiative. The Surface‚Äôs native camera is superior to the iMac‚Äôs, though not by much. The Windows Hello sign-in camera can automatically recognize your face and automatically sign you into your computer. It‚Äôs not a new feature, but a welcome one all the same. The Studio‚Äôs camera supports 1080p, while the FaceTime HD camera is limited to 720p. Design Here‚Äôs where Microsoft justifies the astronomical price tag that they‚Äôve affixed to the Surface Studio. The Studio is built for art, whether you‚Äôre a graphic designer or an architect. The massive 28-inch touchscreen is mounted on a Zero Gravity Hinge, which allows the display to be shifted up and down, or from your face to your desk. Placing the computer in ‚Äúdesign mode‚Äù ‚Äî with the screen tilted back ‚Äî allows the user to take full advantage of the Surface Pen and the Surface Dial. The hockey-puck-shaped Dial looks innocent enough, but it really shines when plopped onto the screen itself. It clicks and spins ‚Äî with haptic feedback, so you can feel any changes as they happen ‚Äî and when you place it onto the display, touch-sensitive menus will automatically pop up around the dial. For instance, turning the dial while drawing might change the color of your digital pencils or the size of your digital brush. The Surface Pen offers the same functionality here as it does on popular tablets such as the Surface Pro 4, providing¬†the user with a diverse set of touch-based tools. The Studio also comes with the new Surface Ergonomic Keyboard, an oddly-shaped thing that continues Microsoft‚Äôs pattern of keyboards split down the middle. Built for a more comfortable typing experience, it‚Äôs got a wrist pad made of synthetic suede, and two space bars. The iMac is also gorgeous, though. There‚Äôs nothing new here from a design perspective, but Apple‚Äôs products continue to get thinner and more capable with every build. The machine‚Äôs curved, silver body becomes¬†5-millimeters thick at the edges of the display, and the Retina panel measures just 1.4-millimeters thick across the screen. The iMac ships with Apple‚Äôs standard Magic Mouse and Keyboard. Availability and price The Surface Studio is available for pre-order now, and hits shelves on December 15. The Studio comes in three flavors¬†‚Äî¬†$2,999, $3,499, and $4,199.¬†The $2,999 version includes a Core i5 processor, while the other two are outfitted with a Core i7. Choosing a more expensive option will also net you more RAM and more storage space.¬†The Surface Studio is an investment, and it‚Äôs meant for creative minds that will use the Pen, Dial, and all the bells and whistles. The iMac is available now, and prices range from $1,099 (for the 21.5-inch model) to $2,299 (for the 27-inch Retina display model). Additional configurations and updated components will cost you extra. Conclusion If you‚Äôre serious about investing in a computer ‚Äî¬†especially if you‚Äôre an artist, a designer, or anything similar ‚Äî you should go with the Surface Studio. On the other hand, if you‚Äôre not looking to sacrifice your kids‚Äô Christmas presents in order to finance your new computer, check out the iMac. It‚Äôs still an awesome piece of technology,¬†one that can be nearly as capable with the right configuration. All things considered, most people will find that the iMac is a better fit, simply because the Surface Studio‚Äôs price is justified largely¬†by its bevy of creative tools and features. Those that don‚Äôt need the Surface Dial and Pen shouldn‚Äôt shell out¬†a few thousand dollars extra, as the Studio is a specialist‚Äôs tool, not a simple everyday PC.

Blog Support Store Developer Get Involved Archive Switching from macOS: Hardware This is part 4 of an ongoing ‚ÄúSwitching from macOS‚Äù series. Yesterday I wrote about elementary OS for Creative Work. In the Apple world, you have one choice for hardware: whatever Apple makes. With elementary OS, your options are far more vast; you can get anything from a tiny thin low-power notebook to massive powerful workstation and use elementary OS. Existing Mac hardware The simplest option if you are switching from macOS, however, is to use your existing Mac hardware. Apple‚Äôs modern MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, iMac, and Mac Pro are all Intel-based computers and should work well with elementary OS. Avi Romanoff, an elementary contributor has written up a guide for installing elementary OS on a Mac. Dedicated Vendors If you are looking for new hardware and Apple‚Äôs latest doesn‚Äôt interest you, there are several companies shipping great computers with elementary OS out of the box. Tuxedo sells several machines with elementary OS, and their InfinityBook is probably the closest to a MacBook Air or Pro: thin, light, aluminum, and backlit. It comes in 13‚Äù and 15‚Äù options which both look great. Another option is Slimbook, who offers a couple of similarly thin, light, aluminum models that can ship with elementary OS out of the box. Obsidian PC has several models as with an elementary OS option as well. Likely to Work Well There has been an uptick in recent years of companies making and shipping computers with Linux-based OSes out of the box. System76 is probably the biggest and most popular of these; I‚Äôd be comfortable recommending any of their laptops or desktops for an elementary OS user. Because elementary OS is Ubuntu based and System76 fanatically supports Ubuntu (with hardware selection, firmware development, and driver tweaks specifically designed to work perfectly with Ubuntu), it works great. Other companies ship and support Linux-based OSes around the world like Dell, Entroware, and many others. If they‚Äôre excited about supporting Linux and support Ubuntu or Ubuntu-based OSes, elementary OS should work as well. General Hardware Suggestions If you‚Äôre wanting or willing to spend the time researching several companies or even building your own computer to run elementary OS, there are a number of guidelines we recommend you follow. Modern 64-bit Intel-based processors (Core i3, i5, and i7) and Intel HD graphics are your best bet. While NVIDIA and AMD may have Linux drivers, they can be more hit or miss than Intel. We recommend at least 1 GB of RAM, but realistically 4 GB is a good minimum for a modern computer, and more is always better. Some WiFi cards can be hit or miss; again, Intel is typically your best bet, but if it works with Ubuntu or more broadly, Linux, it should work perfectly in elementary OS. Otherwise, if you‚Äôre unsure about specific hardware support, searching if it works with Ubuntu is a good bet. Since elementary OS is based on the same core and hardware stack as Ubuntu, hardware support is almost identical. You can see all of our official hardware recommendations at our Installation Guide. Tomorrow I‚Äôll be back with another post in the series, so stop back by! elementary os linux macos 12 notes cassidyjames Nov 4th, 2016 Open in app Facebook Tweet Mail Permalink shanesemler liked this awesomekalphill liked this veerarjunsingh liked this volpedellenevi-blog liked this piratefache liked this lodedespues liked this alperslog liked this wholocked-shurtugal liked this irohust liked this manere liked this akzel liked this lord-mt liked this elementaryos posted this Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus

Ordinarily, this would be the perfect time to go get a new laptop. But not in 2016. See, although Intel announced its new line of Kaby Lake processors back in August, we won‚Äôt see a lot of the new processors in laptops until next year. The new processors promise all sorts of improvements over the current Skylake versions, but even if you don‚Äôt care about better 4K video playback, you probably do care about saving money. Which is why you should slowly back away from the Amazon cart, set down the 1-click order button, and wait. DON‚ÄôT MISS:¬†The worst thing about Apple‚Äôs new MacBook Pro in two amazing pictures Kaby Lake is the seventh generation of Intel‚Äôs Core processors. On paper, it‚Äôs not that much of an upgrade over the Skylake chips that came before. It runs on the same-sized 14nm process, using a mostly-similar architecture to the Skylake chips, so there aren‚Äôt any giant improvements in battery life or processing power for general-use applications. But where the new chips should be much better is for specific things like 4K video playback or VR. Intel has started to tailor its silicon to the kinds of intensive tasks that currently tax the processor. It‚Äôs the same thing that processor manufacturers have been doing for the last few years for smartphones: rather than just increase overall processing power, Qualcomm, Samsung and Apple have customized their chips so that they‚Äôre much better at a specific task. Intel is claiming that you‚Äôll get nearly double the battery life when streaming 4K video off YouTube, which is a huge improvement. Other battery-intensive tasks, like general web browsing, also get a double-digit efficiency boost. So, for the same-size laptop with the same battery, you‚Äôll be getting hours more battery life if you wait for a Kaby Lake chip. Gaming is another good example. The beefy quad-core Kaby Lake processors, which won‚Äôt launch until early next year, will have the latest version of Intel‚Äôs Iris graphics. We don‚Äôt know a ton about it, but we‚Äôve seen demos of thin-and-light laptops running graphically intensive games like¬†Overwatch¬†at a decent FPS. The big question is if the best Iris graphics will be able to handle basic AR or VR tasks. If they can pull that off, it will mean serious graphics performance in a thin laptop with low power draw. So when will be a good time to buy a laptop? The basic, low-power Kaby Lake chips are already out, but we‚Äôll have to wait until sometime early next year for the high-power, quad-core laptop processors that you find in the MacBook Pro or Surface Book. You can expect all the big-name laptop manufacturers to debut laptops packing Kaby Lake, so a few demos at the Consumer Electronics Show in January is a good guess. Even if you don‚Äôt care about any of the graphics or efficiency improvements, it‚Äôs probably worth waiting until the new year to buy a new laptop. With Kaby Lake computers coming out, the perfectly capable Skylake PCs will be going on sale anyway. Couple those sales with the post-Christmas discounts, and you could be picking up serious PCs for a lot less money than right now. All you have to do is wait.

Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. As 2016 starts to close and we start investing with a head toward 2017, one of the most obvious plays in the market is ... well, one of the most obvious plays of at least the past couple of decades: tech stocks. Source: magicatwork via Flickr But as we've seen thanks to big momentum moves by the likes ofTwitter Inc(NYSE:TWTR),Amazon.com, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMZN),Netflix, Inc.(NASDAQ:NFLX) and more, dabbling in single-name tech stocks can be perilous. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it - that's what the aggressive allocation of your portfolio is for. But it does mean that if you're looking to get broad exposure to tech stocks, you would do well to also invest in one or two of the best exchange-traded funds that focus on the space. ETFs are a great solution for trying to invest in anything from whole sectors to industries to trends like the internet of things or artificial intelligence. That's because they grant you exposure to a number of players, meaning you don't have to necessarily guess the one or two best stocks in the space. And the best ETFs allow you to do this for next to nothing in annual expenses. The 10 Best ETFs on the Planet As we turn the clock forward to 2017, here's a look at five of the best ETFs that invest in tech stocks. Best ETFs That Invest in Tech Stocks: Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) Expenses: 0.14% If you're looking to invest in any sector, the first place to look should be State Street Global Advisors' Select Sector SPDR funds. That's not to say they're always the best, but more often than not, they provide strong performance for cheap, and they're about as liquid as you can ask for. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK) is the largest tech ETF on the planet at just about $13 billion in assets. And its holdings list is a who's who of big tech, including Apple Inc.(NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) andAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). XLK's performance has outdone most of its broad-based tech peers over the long run, and the ETF is among the cheapest you can buy at just 14 basis points. But no investor should jump in unless they're OK with the fund's ... well, its weight problem. Apple makes up roughly 14% of the fund, and Microsoft makes up another 10%. All told, the top five companies represented in XLK - the four above, plus AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) - make up almost half the weight. That means as they go - for the most part - XLK goes. That has its advantages in that all of these companies are extremely well-heeled, cash-rich firms that can weather a market blow or two, whether it's AAPL shelling out more dividends or buybacks, or FB buying out a couple new companies for growth. It has its disadvantages in that the concentration in mega-caps, as well as exposure really only to blue chips, isn't necessarily the most conducive to rapid price appreciation. You can read more about the XLK ETF here. Best ETFs That Invest in Tech Stocks: VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) Expenses: 0.35% (includes 6-basis-point fee waiver) Sometimes, the best money to be made in technology isn't in the consumer-facing side, but the comparatively boring internals. For instance, semiconductors. When you think of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), you almost assuredly think of PCs - the declining industry that's hampering Intel. What you should be thinking, though, is that Intel's solutions also power everything from digital storage to point-of-sales systems to, more recently, driverless automotion via a partnership with BMW and Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY). Or let's get really meta and consider Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM), a foundry that serves other semiconductor firms, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO). And from time to time, even Intel actually outsources its chipset manufacturing to TSM. These are the companies that will power just about every emerging technology on the planet, and that's advantageous to investors because it reduces the risk of investing directly in the more risky front-facing technologies that could flop hard if their gambles are wrong. In short, if a company like AMD powers a number of virtual reality technologies, then it's a much safer bet than trying to pick which VR company will get it right. What Stocks Will Win the 2016 Election? The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) is a concentrated fund of just 26 holdings, and it's overweight TSM and INTC at about 15% each. But it covers most of the biggest players across the globe, making it a faithful play in the semiconductor space. You can read more about the SMH ETF here. ADVERTISEMENT Best ETFs That Invest in Tech Stocks: iShares Exponential Technologies ETF (XT) Expenses: 0.47% If investing in slower-growth blue-chips isn't your thing, the iShares Exponential Technologies ETF (NYSEARCA:XT) very well might be. While iShares touts a few reasons to buy, the most important is this: "The fund's index uses a unique evaluation process to identify companies developing and/or leveraging promising technologies." In other words, XT is trying to get out in front of the crowd. Thus, you're going to see a number of emerging technologies represented, such as 3D printing and artificial intelligence, not to mention a few other tech avenues that might have been around for a while already, but are really starting to come into their own. Take a look at the top holdings. AMD products are used in everything from drones to medical imaging.Exelixis, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXEL) is actually a biotechnology company whose developing treatments are focused on ailments from thyroid cancer to tumors. MercadoLibre Inc (NASDAQ:MELI) is a Latin-American e-commerce platform. Yes, you can practically guarantee that several of XT's holdings are destined for the scrapyard, as not every emerging technology actually emerges, and some that do don't do so right away. Heck, the tech world has given virtual reality the ol' college try several times over the past decade. But that's OK. XT also differs from XLK in that it's equally weighted, rather than market-cap weighted, so currently none of the ETF's 189 holdings accounts for more than 1.57% of the fund. Thus, total failures are mitigated. You can read more about the XT ETF here. Best ETFs That Invest in Tech Stocks: PureFunds ETFx HealthTech ETF (IMED) Expenses: 0.75% Everywhere you look, you'll find some gaudy predictions about the future of healthcare technology. For instance ... Grand View Research sees global healthcare firms investing $410 billion in software, services and internet of things-connected devices in 2022. Evaluate Ltd. is projecting a $477.5 billion market in medtech by 2020. Research and Markets expects the global healthcare analytics market to explode from $8.48 billion in 2015 to $23.8 billion by 2020. Long story short: Technology is increasingly encroaching into the healthcare space, and there's a lot of money to be made there. The PureFunds ETFx HealthTech ETF (NASDAQ:IMED) is one of a scant few ways to invest broadly in this trend. IMED focuses on three specific areas: healthcare informatics, medical instruments and medical devices. That results in holdings like Quality Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:QSII), which deals in things such as electronic health records and interoperability solutions for both medical and dental practices, or medical device company ICU Medical, Incorporated (NASDAQ:ICUI), which boasts products such as MicroClave for infusion therapy and hemodynamic monitoring systems. The 10 Best Vanguard Funds to Buy for 2016 IMED is a small fund, at just more than $2 million in assets, and the 0.75% expense ratio is far from cheap, but this is one of the best ETF plays on the blossoming healthcare tech market.

Many people have almost completely phased out their use of cash, and that's thanks to - and benefiting - the fintech space. The fintech space is awfully broad and combines new and old technologies alike. If you've swiped a credit card at a retail store or a restaurant in your life ... well, a fintech company is powering that. But naturally, the space is filled with slightly newer financial technologies as well. There's PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL), which not only is an increasingly popular online payment option, but has expanded to acceptance in brick-and-mortar stores, too. And there's LendingTree Inc(NASDAQ:TREE), the online exchange that hooks up both individuals and businesses with potential lenders. The Global X FinTech Thematic ETF (NASDAQ:FINX) invests in 29 such companies, featuring consumer-facing names such as PayPal and Square Inc (NYSE:SQ), as well as companies like SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSNC), which powers complex functions such as trading and accounting for financial firms. Like IMED, FINX is hardly cheap, but it's a targeted play on a couple of burgeoning tech industries.

By: Prajith Sabbani Updated: Saturday, November 5, 2016, 11:25 [IST] If there‚Äôs one thing that stops Android loyalists from switching to Apple iPhones, it has to be the limited customizability that they offer. While the iPhones, for most of the part ‚Äújust work‚Äù like Steve Jobs has always said, a few users, for the tech enthusiasts they are, like to dig deeper and customise their smartphones to their own liking. And for that, Apple users can jailbreak their iPhones to unleash its untapped potential. SEE ALSO: These 5 Changes in Apple iPhone 8 Will Surprise You for Sure [iPhone 8 Leaks For the uninitiated, Jailbreaking is nothing but getting rid of all the hardware restrictions Apple lays on its iOS devices. Once it's done, you can customise your smartphone to look the way you want it to look but not how Apple wants it to look. SEE ALSO: Can I Delete My WhatsApp Account Permanently, What Will Happen if I Managed to Do So? This brings us to the question, is it a good idea to jailbreak your Apple iPhone? Well, that‚Äôs a tricky question to answer. We will list a few advantages followed by some disadvantages of jailbreaking your iPhone which will eventually make it easier for you to decide if you should choose to jailbreak your iDevice or not. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Download apps from anywhere While there are plenty of apps available on the Apple App Store which most of the times serve the purpose, jailbreaking your iPhone will allow you to download apps from multiple other sources (like Cydia ‚Äî essentially an App Store-like source with illegitimate apps) which you can‚Äôt download otherwise. Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals More customisation Jailbreaking gives your iPhone, the power to do things which can‚Äôt be done¬†with the default iOS. What this means is that you can run themes, add new skins, customise the Control Center, and a lot more. The possibilities are just endless, all it takes is a little research and a little patience to get more control over the looks and feels. But, what about the software updates? Enough about the pros, let‚Äôs talk about a few downsides. The first major disadvantage is the fact that you won‚Äôt be able to upgrade to the latest iOS as soon as it releases. You‚Äôll have to wait until the jailbreak community releases a jailbroken iOS update, which may take months after the official iOS launch or may never see the light of the day. ¬† ¬† Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Is there anything else to worry about? Well, yes! There are a lot of other things you‚Äôll have to worry about. Firstly, jailbreaking your iPhones voids the Apple‚Äôs warranty. Meaning, in case if something goes wrong with your iPhone while it's being jailbroken or it has been jailbroken already, it won‚Äôt be eligible for assistance from any of the Apple stores. Additionally, your iPhone will become vulnerable to malicious attacks from hackers. As a matter of fact, jailbreaking itself is hacking your smartphone to remove the hardware restrictions.¬† Finally, should I jailbreak my iPhone or not? Well, we‚Äôve already made it clear what one will get and lose on jailbreaking the iPhone. Now, the onus of taking this decision entirely rests on you and your preferences. That said, one thing is for sure, if you care for security and privacy more than anything else, you‚Äôd definitely want to stay away from jailbreaking your iPhone.¬† Click Here for New Smartphones Best Online Deals Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Money flows like water in Apple Valley amid Measure V/W battle Friday Nov¬†4,¬†2016¬†at¬†5:51¬†PM Nov¬†4,¬†2016¬†at¬†6:03¬†PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY ‚Äî The most contentious ballot issue Apple Valley voters face in Tuesday's election is that of competing measures revolving around the takeover attempt of Liberty Utilities. An aggressive war of words playing out on social media, in mailboxes, in Council chambers, over the airwaves and between epistles sent by lawyers has divided a community in the drawn-out run-up to Nov. 8. But the campaign finances of Measures V and W tell two stories ‚Äî one of a company fighting for its very existence and another of an advocacy group positioning itself as a scrappy underdog locked in a fierce battle with a corporate titan. To date, Liberty Utilities has funded Measure V to the tune of $250,000, according to campaign contribution documents. In October alone, the water company doled out $100,000, which helped fuel more than $113,000 in campaign expenditures. Should Measure V pass, a vote of the town's residents would be required before Apple Valley could issue bond debt to fund the purchase of Liberty‚Äôs water system. Beyond that, similar votes would be required prior to any issuance of bond debt in excess of $10 million. Such a future would create a unique situation, according to Mayor Pro Tem Scott Nassif, who recently said Apple Valley would be the only municipality in California ‚Äúthat would have a provision on borrowing debt regardless of the revenues.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis was put in place not to protect the ratepayers of Apple Valley,‚Äù Nassif said, ‚Äúbut to put roadblocks in front of the Council.‚Äù As such, proponents of the town-sponsored Measure W liken their fight to a battle of biblical proportions in that that they‚Äôre ‚Äúcompeting with Goliath,‚Äù arguably because¬†campaign contributions to H2OWN ‚Äî Our Water Now, Measure W‚Äôs advocacy group ‚Äî pale in comparison to what Liberty has put toward Apple Valley residents Pat and Chuck Hanson's Measure V. H2OWN raised just over $18,000, campaign finance records show.¬†Much of that amount came from two $5,000 contributions made by Burrtec Waste Industries, a company the Town Council awarded a 50-year ground lease for land at the Victor Valley Materials Recovery Facility during the Oct. 25 Council meeting. The lease grants Burrtec use of nearly eight acres of MRF land to develop an expanded materials diversion and recycling facility, according to town documents. The lease will bring the town more than $46,000 in annual revenues. But Town Council candidate Bryen Wright said the move suggests a ‚Äúpay-to-play‚Äù scenario. ‚ÄúThe timing and impact of these contributions are highly suspect,‚Äù Wright said, ‚Äúand suggest a Town Council whose decisions can be purchased for the right price. I strongly encourage the Measure W committee to immediately return these contributions, and for there to be an investigation into the Town‚Äôs dealings with Burrtec in the weeks leading up to this Council vote.‚Äù Wright‚Äôs stance, however, constituted little more than a grab for attention by a first-time candidate, according to H2OWN‚Äôs Pat Orr, who said the group was ‚Äúhappy‚Äù to receive Burrtec‚Äôs initial contribution after soliciting the company. ‚ÄúWe were pleasantly surprised when a second contribution showed up, along with others after our continued pleas for help to fight cash-rich Liberty,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI personally am not aware of any contract deal or extension granted to Burrtec by the town. The Council doesn't usually consult me on their planned agenda items. ‚Äú... and despite what Mr. Wright believes, no one from the W campaign has or will benefit from Measure W campaign activities. How stupid is Burrtec that they would send us money after their deal is done, and what do they get out of cheaper water in Apple Valley? Understand pay to play before you throw the term around would be my advice to the novice Mr. Wright.‚Äù Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin added that the expansion of the facility has been in the works for nearly two years. ‚ÄúThe governing entity is a Joint Powers Authority that also includes the City of Victorville and the Mojave Desert Integrated Waste Management JPA, each of which also had to approve the item,‚Äù Martin said. Meanwhile, expenditures show an even greater disparity between the Right to Vote on Debt and H2OWN campaigns ‚Äî more than $337,000 to just $12,179.66, respectively ‚Äî and H2OWN‚Äôs strategy looks similar to a grassroots effort as a result. ‚ÄúWe decided at the outset we would do what we could as resources became available,‚Äù Orr told the Daily Press. ‚ÄúEarly on we realized that every Liberty water bill was an ad for W. Residents are really angry about the rates, the surcharges and foreign ownership. We ‚Äòfeel‚Äô the community spreading our message for us.‚Äù An active social media presence bolstered that message‚Äôs proliferation; however, language inherent in H2OWN‚Äôs message, which recently referred to claims made by Measure V supporters as ‚Äúbovine feces‚Äù on Facebook, has met criticism. During the Oct. 25 Town Council meeting, after calling the Council‚Äôs resolution to support Measure W a ‚Äúself-serving‚Äù form of advocacy, Measure V proponent Diana Carloni took aim at a another H2OWN Facebook post. ‚ÄúLet your campaign committee take the laboring order to advocate (for Measure W),‚Äù Carloni told the Council. ‚ÄúThat is their job. And tell them sneering is not complimentary to their cause.‚Äù Carloni‚Äôs comment referenced H2OWN‚Äôs Oct. 13 post in which the group encouraged supporters to visit Town Council candidate Larry Cusack‚Äôs booth at the Happy Trails Chili Cook Off ‚Äî a booth the group shared with the incumbent ‚Äî and ‚Äúsneer at the Yes On V people.‚Äù When asked to respond to the post during a candidate forum, Cusack said he does not condone the ‚Äúsneering‚Äù aspect of the post, adding, ‚ÄúI just support our Measure W that the Town Council has put forward.‚Äù Meanwhile, the Town Council has also come under fire for paying more than $50,000 for ballot-measure services,¬†voting to include Measure W on the ballot,¬†and advocating for its passage via ‚Äúan illegal use of taxpayer funds‚Äù¬†‚Äî a claim the town contends is false. Former Town Councilor and Apple Valley Citizens Right to Vote on Debt campaign co-chair Peter Allan called Measure W a ‚Äúdeceptive effort‚Äù to undermine Measure V. ‚ÄúInstead of respecting local citizens, the Town of Apple Valley, Measure W‚Äôs true proponents, has spent more than $1.6 million taxpayer dollars without once seeking voter approval,‚Äù Allan said. ‚ÄúInstead of telling voters how much they want to borrow and asking for support, the politicians spent more taxpayer dollars to create Measure W.‚Äù Measure V proponents include money spent by the town on acquisition ‚Äî just over $1.5 million since 2011, according to a previous Daily Press report ‚Äî in the discussion because without the town‚Äôs eminent-domain action against Liberty, it‚Äôs likely neither measure would exist. ‚ÄúAs a result,‚Äù Allan continued, ‚Äúlocal citizens, led by Pat Hanson, along with the Inland Empire Taxpayers Association, myself and others, have mounted an effective grassroots campaign to guarantee people the right to vote. Measure V holds government accountable for wasteful spending and that is why so many residents have walked precincts, posted signs and shared information with their neighbors.‚Äù In response, the town said its citizens ‚Äúhave spoken very loudly‚Äù in opposition to Measure V, as well as "for¬†relief from years of escalating water rates that outpace our neighbors by as much as 45 percent.‚Äù "The lack of local control, lack of responsiveness and accountability of the private owners to ratepayer concerns, and rejection of our offers to buy the water system left us with eminent domain as the only legal step available to the Council, acting on behalf of the citizens," the statement read. "If Liberty and its predecessors had acted fairly and in good faith, we likely would not be in this position.‚Äù Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS ¬† Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media ¬† Apple cuts adapter prices after MacBook outcry By Ethan Baron / November 4, 2016 at 4:32 PM Apple giveth, Apple taketh away, and Apple giveth again. The Cupertino firm riled up the tech-savvy masses¬†by removing standard ports from the new MacBook Pro laptops, forcing many buyers to load up on adapters so they could use peripheral devices with their shiny, and pricey, new computers. Even the new iPhone 7‚Äôs power cord doesn‚Äôt work with the new MacBook Pros, which have no SD card slot, or ports for HDMI, standard USB or VGA. Those laptops feature USB-C ports ‚Äî called by Apple ‚Äúa next-generation industry standard‚Äù ‚Äî for connection of phones, hard drives, displays and power cables. That means owners of the new MacBook¬†Pros need new cables or adapters for virtually any device they‚Äôd want to connect to their laptop. On Friday, Apple announced deep discounts on adapters. The price of a¬†USB-C to traditional USB adapter dropped to $9 from $19, for example. The USB-C charging cables, however, remain at the same price. Cutting adapter prices may help soothe an irritated market,¬†but the company will lose much of what appear to be hefty markups on its adapters. Analyst Wing Lam of IHS told the Wall Street Journal that he estimates that the USB-C to Lightning cable ‚Äî priced now at $19 instead of $25 ‚Äî costs about $2.50 to make. ¬† Photo: The Apple logo¬†(AFP PHOTO/GABRIELLE LURIE/Getty Images) ¬† Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr ¬† Tags: adapters, Apple, iPhone, MacBook, usb-c ¬† More Posts in 1 Petition for electoral college coup against Trump gets more than 1 million signatures November 10, 2016 ¬† Apple now selling pre-owned iPhones from online store November 9, 2016 ¬† Google‚Äôs driving app ‚ÄòAndroid Auto‚Äô now works as free standalone on phones November 8, 2016 ¬† ¬† ¬† Share this Post Tweet ¬† ¬† ¬† man The new Pro is a big middle finger to the Mac user base. ¬† ¬† About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter GMSV ¬† ¬† Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat ¬† Popular Posts Is activist investor Starboard looking to run at Hewlett‚Ä¶ Petition for electoral college coup against Trump gets more‚Ä¶ Surveillance, encryption concerns in the wake of Donald‚Ä¶ Social media and the election through the eyes of Donald‚Ä¶ Wolverton: Competition stumps Amazon Echo, Google Home ¬† ¬† Archives Archives Select Month November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005 ¬† Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Education WordPress Theme by Copyright ¬© 2016 Bay Area News Group.

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem Apple temporarily cuts prices on all USB-C cables and accessories First- and third-party accessories may be necessary for MacBook Pro buyers. by Andrew Cunningham - Nov 5, 2016 1:00 am UTC Login to bookmark 299 Enlarge / The 13-inch MacBook Pro's two Thunderbolt 3 ports. Andrew Cunningham Apple is offering an olive branch to new MacBook and MacBook Pro buyers annoyed that their old stuff won't work with their new laptops. The company is discounting most of the USB-C cables, dongles, and accessories it sells in its online and retail stores. The downside? The discounts only last from now until the end of the year, and prices will presumably go back up after that. The USB-C to USB adapter goes from $19 to $9; the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter drops from $49 to $29; the USB-C to Lightning cable goes from $25 to $19 for one-meter cables and from $35 to $29 for two-meter cables; both the HDMI and VGA versions of Apple's multi-port dongles drop from¬†$69 to $49; and SanDisk's Extreme Pro SD card reader drops from $49 to $29. All other third-party USB-C cables and peripherals will be discounted by about 25 percent. The only excluded products are Apple's USB-C power adapters and the USB-C charge cables sold for use with those¬†power adapters. The temporary price cuts won't completely compensate for the annoyance of having to use dongles in the first place, but they'll help. They may also dissuade buyers from hopping on Amazon and buying cheaper but potentially faulty or non-certified cables and accessories (plenty of perfectly good accessories are out there, too, but finding the rose among thorns isn't easy). It would be great to see some of these price cuts become permanent in the new year. Expand full story Reader comments 299 You must login or create an account to comment.

We‚Äôve known a sequel would arrive for some time, and if you live in the states you will be able to purchase the Samsung Gear S3 beginning on November 18. We still don‚Äôt live in a wearable world, but devices like the Apple Watch and Samsung Gear S3 are bringing us a little closer to that reality. They are two wearables that actually do things a bit different and both certainly stand out in the crowd. The Samsung Gear S3 is definitely the swankiest smartwatch not running iOS or Android, and while it‚Äôs a little pricey, it is well worth the dough. The Samsung Gear S3 will be the second smartwatch to run Tizen. While it shares plenty of similarities with its predecessor some things have changed this time around. The display is now 1.3-inches and features Gorilla Glass SR+ whereas the previous model had a 1.2-inch display. The resolution stays the same although the pixel density is a bit better on the old model due to the smaller display. On the inside of the Samsung Gear S3, you will find 768MB of RAM which is an increase and well above the usual 512MB we find under the hood of most wearables. GPS and MST are now standard as well along with the usual suspects like NFC, wireless charging, and a heart-rate monitor. The battery is noticeably larger at 380mAh compared to 250mAh juice box found on the S2. It is said to provide around 4-days of juice depending on your usage. There are several software tweaks as well, but it‚Äôs essentially the same model as last year‚Ä¶ just better. Samsung may have had their hands full with the Note 7 recall, but the Gear S3 release should help fatten their pockets back up. The Samsung Gear S3 will be available in two flavors with the Frontier model and Classic although the Frontier has a variant with LTE connectivity. It‚Äôs also more rugged than the Classic model. The Samsung Gear S3 will be available to purchase in the U.S. on November 18th with pre-orders beginning on November 6th. If you want to roll with AT&T, you can pre-order one now for $249 and up or $49.99 on a new 2-year agreement. Pricing for other shops should follow suit and will become available when pre-orders begin.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish India To Buy Cellebrite‚Äôs iPhone Hacking Technology By Tyler Lee on 11/04/2016 17:17 PST You might recall that earlier this year after a bit of back and forth between Apple and the US government, another company had to be brought into unlock the iPhone that Apple had refused to. The company in question is Israel-based company Cellebrite who was reportedly paid $1 million by the FBI to ‚Äúhack‚Äù the iPhone to access the information on it. Now it seems that Cellebrite has managed to get the attention of the Indian government who has reportedly struck a deal with the company to buy their technology. So what does the Indian government plan to do with the tech? Basically they plan to use the technology to help law enforcement agencies around the world unlock high-security devices, like the iPhone. According to a senior Forensic Science Laboratory official, ‚ÄúWe are likely to have the technology within a month or so. India will become a global hub for cases where law enforcement is unable to break into phones.‚Äù As 9to5Mac points out, it is unclear if the Indian government will be buying the exclusive rights to the technology, and how they plan to make it available to other governments. That being said, Apple and other companies typically try to improve their security with every update, so it is unclear how effective Cellebrite‚Äôs technology will be in the next few years.

Having to use a dongle to connect peripherals to a new device isn't awesome. It's even less awesome when you have to pay for those little connectors. Lots of MacBook Pro users will inevitably deal with this issue as Apple's new laptop only has USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports. Cupertino has apparently heard all the complaints about this and it's taking action. Don't get too excited: the company isn't going to ship adapters with its new MacBook Pro for free like many have wished, but it is dropping the price of dongles. The Verge reports that all of Apple's USB-C adapters and some of its USB-C cables are now $6 to $20 cheaper. USB-C charging cables, meanwhile, are not getting a discount. //Related Articles MacBook Pro 2016: Should You Upgrade? "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition," the tech giant said, according to the report. "We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables." Here's a list of the new prices, according to The Verge: USB-C to traditional USB adapter ‚Äì now $9 (previously $19) Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter ‚Äì now $29 (previously $49) USB-C to Lightning cable (1 meter) ‚Äì now $19 (previously $25) USB-C to Lightning cable (2 meters) ‚Äì now $29 (previously $35) Multiport adapter with HDMI, USB, and USB-C - now $49 (previously $69) Multiport adapter with VGA, USB, and USB-C ‚Äì now $49 (previously $69) Apple is also dropping the price of all third-party USB-C peripherals it sells by about 25 percent.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 4, 2016 at 5:45PM When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its latest 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro computers, there were some potential buyers who were completely put off by the prices. The base model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar runs $1,799, and the base 15-inch MacBook Pro runs a cool $2,399. Apple's new MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.¬† These are clearly high-priced, premium systems. However, there's a difference between an overpriced product and an expensive one. The former is a product that doesn't deliver the value that its price tag suggests, while the latter is simply a product with a high price. And the latest MacBook Pro computers, although¬†expensive, are not really overpriced.¬† Head-to-head:¬†Spectre x360 vs.¬†13-inch MacBook Pro To give you a sense of the value offered by the 13-inch MacBook Pro (with Touch Bar), I'll compare it with HP's (NYSE:HPQ) premium Windows-based Spectre x360 laptop. (A similar comparison should be possible for the 15-inch MacBook Pro and a suitable Windows-based alternative.) The latter has gotten very good reviews, with Laptop Magazine calling it "the convertible laptop to beat." In the table below, I've put the specifications of a "maxed-out" Spectre x360 side by side with a similarly configured 13-inch MacBook Pro, pulled from HP's and Apple's respective websites -- and for some of the MacBook Pro details, AnandTech: ¬† Spectre x360¬† 13-inch MacBook Pro w/Touch Bar¬† Processor Core i7-7500U Core i7-6567U Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel Iris Graphics 550 Display 1920 x 1080 IPS, touch-enabled 2560 x 1600 IPS, non-touch Memory 16GB LPDDR3-1600 16GB LPDDR3-2133 Storage 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD 512GB PCIe-based SSD Expansion ports 2x USB Type-C, 1 USB 3.1 Gen 1, 1 headphone/microphone combo 4x Thunderbolt 3 ports Wireless connectivity 802.11ac (2x2) and Bluetooth 4.0 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 Trackpad HP Imagepad Force Touch trackpad Battery capacity 57.8 Wh 49.2 Wh Weight 2.85 lbs 3.02 lbs Price (as configured) $1,299 $2,499 Source: HP, Apple, AnandTech. There's no beating around the bush -- the HP system is about half as expensive as the MacBook Pro system. However, if we walk through each of these specifications and closely compare the two systems, it becomes clear that, at the very least, the premium that Apple charges is directly related to component costs. Let's do just that. The tricky processor comparison First, let's look at the processor and graphics technologies in each system. Although the Apple system uses an older sixth-generation Core processor while the HP uses a newer seventh-generation Core processor, the chip inside of the MacBook is faster. The processor architectures of the i7-7500U and i7-6567U are identical, meaning that, at a given frequency, these two chips will perform the same. The main advantage of the seventh-generation Core processors is that they are built on a newer version of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) 14-nanometer process, which should allow the seventh-generation Core processors to run at higher speeds than the sixth-generation Core processors, all else being equal. The 6567U has two processor cores that run at 3.3GHz base and can turbo to 3.6GHz. The 7500U has two processor cores that run at 2.7GHz, but can turbo to 3.5GHz.¬†It's likely, then, that in CPU tasks, it's a wash between these two. In terms of graphics architecture, once again, the sixth-generation Core and seventh-generation Core processors are virtually the same. However, the chip inside of the MacBook Pro uses Intel's higher-performance Iris graphics -- more graphics cores, dedicated eDRAM memory built into the chip package -- so I would expect that in graphics tasks, the MacBook Pro chip will have a clear edge in graphics tasks over the chip inside of the Spectre x360. The trade-off that Apple is likely making by using a chip with Iris graphics is that it's certainly more expensive to manufacture than a similar chip without Iris graphics. The size of the main processor is larger, and the Iris parts include a fairly large on-package memory manufactured in Intel's 22-nanometer logic process.¬† Intel almost certainly charges more for chips that cost more to make, adding to Apple's bill-of-materials costs relative to HP's.¬† The display comparison Moving beyond the processor, the HP system has a 1920-by-1080 resolution IPS display, while the MacBook Pro has a higher resolution 2560-by-1600 resolution IPS display. The display on the MacBook should be sharper. The comparison doesn't end there, though. The display on the MacBook Pro supports the much wider DCI-P3 color gamut, while tests performed by NotebookCheck show that the display on the HP fails to fully cover even the narrower sRGB color gamut. Finally, per NotebookCheck, the average brightness of the display found on the Spectre x360 is 318.6 nits. The site found the average brightness on the new 13-inch MacBook Pro display to be 563.6 nits. Apple's machine has a sharper, brighter, and more colorful display. HP's, on the other hand, supports touch input while Apple's doesn't.¬† Comparing everything else As far as memory and storage go, both have 16GB of LPDDR3 memory and 512GB of storage. However, it's worth pointing out that the MacBook Pro, as configured, uses faster 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory while the Spectre uses slower 1600MHz LPDDR3. 9to5Mac also points out, citing Computer World, that the new MacBook Pro systems are around "two years ahead of most of its competition" in terms of solid-state drive speeds. The MacBook Pro is slightly heavier, but they're both in roughly the same weight class. The Apple system uses a Force Touch trackpad, while HP's system uses what it dubs an HP Imagepad. And finally, the MacBook includes an OLED touch bar with Touch ID support, while HP's system doesn't. Distinguishing price from value Apple's new MacBook is clearly an expensive system, but across the board, it appears to offer more features and better performance than the newest Spectre x360 -- a top Windows notebook. This isn't an attempt to disparage HP's Spectre x360 -- it has received extremely positive reviews from many reputable outlets, and is frankly a very attractive Windows-based machine. The point of this comparison is to show that Apple crams in a lot of things here and there that might not individually mean much to potential customers, but ultimately serve to enhance the user experience. Engineering often consists of making smart trade-offs that balance cool features against cost structure. Apple's new MacBook computers traded off price in order to build extremely feature-rich products. HP, on the other hand, did what it could within a system that it could sell for $1,300, which, frankly, is quite high for a consumer Windows-based notebook.¬† We'll get a better idea of how receptive customers are to Apple's choices vis-a-vis the new MacBook Pro computers when the company reports its financial results in January.¬† Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

In the process, it ignored those customers who preferred the smaller iPhone form factor. Then, earlier this year, it fixed that mistake by launching an iPhone SE smartphone that‚Äôs as big as the iPhone 5s, but sports iPhone 6s-like hardware. It‚Äôs likely that the 4-inch iPhone will not go away as long as there‚Äôs a market for it, and Apple may have to release upgraded versions in the coming years. One of the best things Apple could do with the handset is to increase the size of the display without modifying its dimensions. DON‚ÄôT MISS: The best MacBook Pro alternatives now that Apple ruined everything How would that be possible? Well, Apple‚Äôs iPhone 8 series is rumored to ditch the home button, which will be relocated under the display, complete with Touch ID functionality and every other feature associated with it. By removing the physical home button, Apple can go for an all-screen design on its iPhones, and significantly increase display real estate. Bezels would either disappear completely, or they‚Äôd be greatly reduced, just like on the Xiaomi Mi Mix to make room for more screen space. Considering Apple‚Äôs endeavor to go for a design uniformity across products, it would make sense to see an updated iPhone SE version ship with a slightly larger screen in the same body. On the other hand, the iPhone SE does ship without 3D Touch¬†support, so it‚Äôs not a faithful miniaturized version of the iPhone 6s. Costs concerns are likely to blame, as Apple is also looking to make money on the smallest and cheapest iPhone in its lineup. Meanwhile, DBS Designing imagined an iPhone SE concept that features an all-screen design. Sure, the handset they envision comes with absurd specs that will never be part of any iPhone SE upgrade coming in the near future. But what is exciting is the idea of having an all-screen iPhone SE successor in the future. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Cp2f6-fSxa8oxgBCxcIAA Tags: Apple, iPhone 7, iPhone 8, iPhone SE Via: Concept Phones Source: YouTube Older StoryPrevious Newer StoryNext Trending Best Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here‚Äôs what changed 11 paid iPhone apps on sale for free today The 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2 Download the new iPhone wallpapers before Apple officially releases them Related Articles Apple believes a touchscreen iMac would make for a horrible user experience How Donald Trump's tax plan might save Apple billions of dollars 11 paid iPhone apps on sale for free today BGR Store Certified Ethical Hacker Bootcamp The Black Friday Mac Bundle 2.0 Pay What You Want: White Hat Hacker 2017 Bundle TrapTap Speed Trap Indicator View Comments Hubs Apple Apple believes a touchscreen iMac would make for a horrible user experience How Donald Trump's tax plan might save Apple billions of dollars Android Leaks suggest next year's OnePlus 4 will be the Android phone to beat 51 brand new emoji may hit your iPhone next year Mobile Leaks suggest next year's OnePlus 4 will be the Android phone to beat It looks like the Galaxy S8 will add one of Apple's core iPhone 7 features Retail Samsung shares Black Friday deals early: TVs, phones, smartwatches and more Best Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here's what changed FOLLOW BGR Like BGR on Facebook Follow @BGR on Twitter BGR on Google Plus Follow BGR on LinkedIn BGR ON TWITTER Jonathan S.

Macs & Mac OS X | 04 Nov 2016 | Listen¬† | Print¬† | Comment (28) Responding to Complaints, Apple Drops Adapter and Monitor Prices by Josh Centers Many Apple fans have been irked by how the new line of MacBook Pro laptops offers only Thunderbolt 3 ports (which are backward compatible with USB-C). To connect to existing peripherals, users will require one or more adapters, such as those for USB-A, DisplayPort, HDMI, Ethernet, and even older implementations of Thunderbolt. See ‚ÄúExplaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between‚Äù (3 November 2016) for a thorough explanation. Apple doesn‚Äôt get any points for thinking ahead, but happily, the company does appear to be responding to the waves of criticism. According to the Loop, Apple is dropping prices on many of its adapters through the end of 2016. Affected products include: USB-C to USB Adapter: from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter: from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m): from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning Cable (2m): from $35 to $29 USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter: from $69 to $49 USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter: from $69 to $49 Apple is also discounting other USB-C products sold in the company‚Äôs online store, such as the SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C Reader, which drops from $49 to $29. If you purchased any of these adapters in the past 14 days ‚Äî Apple‚Äôs return window ‚Äî the company may automatically credit you for the difference in price; Adam Engst got email from Apple about that after the initial publication of this article. If you don‚Äôt hear from Apple in a few days, I recommend calling them and asking for a partial refund. I did that and obtained a $30 refund for my USB-C to USB Adapter and my Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter. MacRumors reports that Apple has also cut the price of the LG UltraFine 5K Display, which it developed with LG, from $1299 to $974 until the end of 2016. Also, Apple slashed the price of the LG UltraFine 4K Display from $699 to $524. The 5K Display isn‚Äôt yet available for sale but should launch in December 2016. Apple could have avoided the entire hullaballoo by including an adapter or two in the box with new MacBook Pros or giving customers the option to receive the adapter of their choice for free when ordering. Instead, Apple came off as trying to nickel-and-dime its most eager customers, who were already spending significant sums on the company‚Äôs latest gear. And even still, dropping the prices only through the end of 2016 seems stingy, given that Apple‚Äôs adapters and cables are almost always the most expensive by far. ¬† READERS LIKE YOU!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Mike¬†¬†2016-11-04 20:48 The one cable that absolutely should have been in there is the Type C to type A adapter, but a USB-C lightening cable should also have been included. As it stands if you buy a laptop and a Magic Mouse you have to pay another $9 just to be able to charge it. I also wish they had a MagSafe to TB3 adapter, as the MagSafes weren't cheap and still work well. Maybe someone else will be able to pull that off with a shallow rough port that it could stay plugged in. Reply dbrugger¬†¬† 2016-11-04 21:27 Quite frankly, Apple has stopped being Apple for the last two machine re-dos, dropping things and adding things as if they were Microsoft software. Waiting for a new laptop, I feel betrayed and that Apple is changing for the sake of changing without any very real innovation. I'm on the search for old refurbished models that have what I want and need. Too bad! Reply Simon¬†¬† 2016-11-05 04:12 Unfortunately I have to agree. As sad as it is. Reply Reinard Schmitz ¬†¬†2016-11-05 05:15 Yep. Sadly I've to agree. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc¬†¬†2016-11-08 21:01 Me too. Apple long since lost sight of their customers. In my book the trend began with OS X Lion, which bleached the color, and thus much of the utility (ease of use) out of the Finder window side bar. They only made the problem worse with OS X 10.10 Yosemite, when even more color, depth and usability bled away from the UI. A year from now most the noise over the Thunderbolt 3 ports will have subsided as people adapt to the change. The expense of that adaptation, however, will not be forgotten and it is likely to drive up sales of used Macs. I recently got a good price on eBay for a unibody MacBook Pro, a line which, not coincidentally, is still user serviceable. I replaced the HDD with a comparably sized SSD for about $150 - and it connects to all my gear. As for using adaptors, well, I got used to that problem while servicing MacBook Airs and 11" MacBook Pros, all of which have been short on ports from their inception. I've got Thunderbolt to this and that in my gadget bag. Now I'll have to add TB 3 to this and that. I'm just glad they didn't limit the number of ports any more radically than they did with the new MacBook Pros. Given the precedent set by the MacBook, it could have been worse. Of course, Apple thinks everything can and should be done in the cloud now. But the cloud, particularly iCloud, is far from reliable and even less secure. But, hey, Apple couldn't care less how their imperfect solutions affect actual users. It's their policy and they're sticking with it. Longterm my biggest concern for Apple is their unwillingness to develop a touch-screen PC. Because to do so, of course, would be to admit that Microsoft had a better idea. As far as technology trends go, this is a big one and Apple is ignoring it. Sure, a touch-screen Mac, particularly a laptop, would cut into iPad sales. But touch-screen Windows PCs are going to be shading Apple big time going forward. Adding a few bells and whistles, like the Touch Bar, to the MacBook Pro will not make up the difference. Microsoft ads for the Surface Pro may be obnoxious, but they are on point nonetheless. Touch-screen PCs are not a fad, like Netbooks, that Apple can safely dismiss. They are the future, a future in which Apple is unwilling to participate. And now that Microsoft has introduced their touch-screen desktop computer, the Surface Studio, with a hinge mount that declines to emulate a drawing table (like a Wacom Cintiq), with a Surface Pen and Surface Dial, a high resolution 28" screen that matches the color gamut of the Cintiq, it won't be long before graphics professionals begin to look beyond their iMacs. As it is now you can use a Cintiq with your iMac if you're got room on your desk for the setup, but the Surface Studio will have a much smaller footprint, combining the utility of a capable computer with a large, adjustable, graphics tablet‚Äîat half the price. Certainly things aren't going to change overnight, but to my mind the writing is on the wall. Apple's executives are far to insular, cut off from the every day working world of their users. Who would have thought, a decade ago, that Microsoft would be leading Apple in innovation? Reply Simon¬†¬† 2016-11-09 05:20 I'm actually very happy they are refusing to do a touch-screen Mac. One of Steve's strongest suits was recognizing what not to do and knowing when to stay simple. Apple's stance on this issue would have been the same under Steve and I'm very happy about that. No matter how many shiny ads MS puts out and no matter how much consumers think everything has to converge up to the point where your car is also your fridge. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc¬†¬†2016-11-09 05:03 Glib remarks about cars and fridges don't enhance your argument. It's not about what consumers think, it's about what they buy. If they don't buy Macs, Apple is in trouble. QED. As for what Steve would like or what he would do, he didn't like the idea of a small iPad or a big iPhone, but Apple is selling them both now. He didn't like dabbling in the enterprise, but Apple is working with IBM and Cisco to expand their footprint in business. Supposing that Steve would like what you like is, well, supply your own synonym for foolish. Personally, I don't need or want a touch-screen computer. But what I want is less than insignificant. Nonetheless, I see the market moving to touch-screen PCs and Apple missing the boat. We're not talking fads here. As I mentioned, Apple made a small iPad when the market favored small tablets and they made large iPhones when the market was going that way. And they are moving into the enterprise to expand their role in business. Ultimately, whether or not to make a touch-screen Mac should be a rational business decision, not one guided by pride, vanity or sentiment. As for simplicity, there's nothing simple about using two devices to do the work of one. Nor is there anything simple about Apple's multi-device, multi-OS market strategy these days. What, pray tell, is simple about iCloud? What's simple about all those Apple apps in your dock? Simplicity is a them trotted out when it suits Apple's purposes and ignored when it does not. It's a red herring‚Äîat best. There's nothing simple about Apple. Reply Simon¬†¬† 2016-11-09 05:29 Pride or vanity has nothing to do with it at all. Bottom line is macOS has been heavily optimized for mouse/KB. It would need substantial changes to make it touch friendly. I want Apple to focus that energy on making sure it remains the best OS for mouse/KB. I don't want them to focus on adding something solely because supposedly many consumers are interested in that. Many consumers are also interested in Windows or McD. So what? Ignoring that crowd is not a problem as long as you remain more interested in product quality than in market share. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc¬†¬†2016-11-09 13:17 I see. It's all about what you want. Thanks for the heads up. Reply dave nuss¬†¬† 2016-11-04 21:47 Hi! I've seen this price reduction mentioned on several sites today but not mentioned and no email from Apple about those of us that forked over for new MBPs and dongles in the first minutes after the Hello Again... Do we get automagic refunds? ... I see Adam called and got some refund so I went to Apple Chat and after some time got the same. Sad they didn't just automatically apply the credits, but I guess that's how they build up that cash pile. Thanks for reporting this! Reply Adam Engst¬†¬† 2016-11-05 11:55 Josh was the one who called, but we also ordered an adapter last week, but I just got email from Apple saying they were refunding me automatically. I'll add that to the article. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc¬†¬†2016-11-08 19:25 Of course not. They're not going to give away money. If you snooze, you lose. Reply Michel Hedley¬†¬†2016-11-05 02:34 These expensive Apple connectors are not well designed. They are prone to breaking at the plug end. For all of Apple's prowess in design, Apple can't seem to design peripherals that are fit for purpose and make them rugged enough for every day use. Reply Simon¬†¬† 2016-11-05 04:34 I'm really surprised by this move. Apple used to be very good at anticipating customer reaction. Now they come out a few days after the big launch and essentially declare they got the pricing all wrong. Has their marketing been taken over by a bunch of clowns? What have these guys been doing for the past months? Josh is absolutely right in his final paragraph. They could have handled this so much better. When did Apple become so bad at this game? Reply James¬†¬†2016-11-06 10:31 They haven't admitted the pricing is wrong. They have TEMPORARILY lowered the price in the hopes that people shut the hell up about it and get it out of the mainstream news. Same goes with the 5K Display. How convenient. They've lowered the price on items that you can't even use for another 3 to 5 weeks. By the time the MBPro actually ships, the price on these adapters and the 5K Display will go back up. Reply Simon¬†¬† 2016-11-05 04:35 So what can be inferred form this surprising move? Only days ago their propagandists were trying to spread this claim that early order numbers had been awesome like never before. Had the uptake indeed been that astronomical, would Apple leadership be willing to give up one cent of profit from all these de facto required adapters? A guess would be orders are either low or they're worried they won't be selling enough new MBPs with all the bad press they're getting - much of which is related to the many dongles required and their ludicrous pricing. Reply Simon¬†¬† 2016-11-05 04:32 It's also interesting to see they were forced to do this in connection with the new MacBook Pro. This is the segment where there are a lot of pro users. People using their Macs for actual work, where productivity counts. People who are knowledgable about performance and technlology. People you can't just sway by releasing a fancy feel good campaign celebrating a new pink or gold color. It seems they're a bit drunk with their success in selling expensive status symbols to teenagers in China. I'm surprised they obviously didn't realize they cannot sell to the pro crowd like they do to those people. Reply George Wade¬†¬†2016-11-05 12:12 OTOH ‚Äì foreseeing the problem requires a certain amount of guesswork; while just going ahead with delivery of the product results in marketplace demand for what is actually needed in the way of adapters, accessories and cables. Do we demand that Apple use Artificial Intelligence to get a better match ! Reply Adam Engst¬†¬† 2016-11-06 10:36 Determining that people would be unhappy about not being able to use any existing peripherals without buying extra dongles doesn't take an advanced degree. :-) Reply Scott M.¬†¬† 2016-11-08 03:05 Especially considering they did realize that people were going to be pissed about the lack of a headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and thus smartly included an adapter in the box with the iPhone 7 rather than nickel and diming people by forcing them to buy that adapter. I supposed, however, that it could be argued that Apple had advanced warning since the idea of Apple killing the headphone jack had been "leaked" for at least a year before the iPhone 7 was released. Thus, Apple could not avoid hearing all the people complaining about the killing of the headphone jack before they actually did it. There was no such "advanced warning" for the all USB-C fiasco for Apple, at least as far as I can tell (I don't watch all the Apple rumors and such like you might...I only saw one article that suggested it might be possible, but not that it was really a leak). One would think, however, that there is one senior/high level executive (any lower level drone likely would be ignored/steamrolled) that should have been able to put two coherent thoughts together to extrapolate that there might be a similar reaction to having to buy a "dongle" in order to use a run of the mill USB device with their new top of the line "Pro" laptop as there was to the idea of buy a "dongle" to use with their expensive headphones for a new iPhone. But, then maybe I am expecting too much of Apple senior executives these days. And their "sale" on "dongles" does not help their image too much in my opinion. As someone else said, it kind of smacks of "here, have a discount...now we hope everyone will forget about it and we can go back to nickel and diming you". To me, the smart thing would have to just give all purchasers of new MacBook Pros (with the USB-C ports) at least 1 free USB-C to USB-A "dongle" with their order. Either just add it to the order for free automatically or included it in the box (after all, most of the new MBPs have not shipped yet). And for anyone who already got it, just ship them a free one (or refund them the full price if they ordered one). After all, while not every one needs Ethernet or used an external monitor or needs a Firewire "dongle", etc, I would argue that the vast majority of people at least use a flash drive or external drive or even use a USB printer. So, I would expect the vast majority of people make use of at least one USB-A device on a regular basis. Of all the "miscues" that I believe they made with the new MBPs, this was the most unforgivable. And I even put this above Jony Ive's infatuation with form over function and his incessant need to make all Apple devices thinner just for that sake of making them thinner and sexier (I will stop there before I get my "rant on"). Reply Dennis B. Swaney¬†¬†2016-11-07 19:56 Those dongles are still excessively overpriced: none should cost more than $4.99 which would still give Apple several 100s percent profit. Reply Brian S¬†¬† 2016-11-07 20:22 I'm curious why Apple dropped the monitor prices. It doesn't appear related to the dongle fiasco. Reply Steve L'Heureux¬†¬†2016-11-07 20:53 I have to say I feel Apple is entirely out of touch with it's older users. I'm 60 and have been with them since 1989. With as much as they charge for their gear, to keep Nickle and Diming us after they keep changing ports year after year is Fu**king pissing me off. I'm disgusted. I'm steering my clients to buy the older refurbs right now. Is it time for Phil Schiller to retire? Who the hell is driving the Apple Bus right now anyway??!! I have to think Steve J would be turning over in his grave right now. Geez, Apple is now even ceding control to Graphics creation to Microsoft with it's Surface Pro!! WTF??!! Who the hell is minding the Store??! Mr. Cook, are you paying attention????? Reply Curtis Wilcox¬†¬† 2016-11-08 17:34 What do you mean, changing ports year-after-year? Before USB-C, what was the last change to a Mac connector? I think it was MagSafe 2 replacing MagSafe and that was four years ago, not that recently. That's also when MBPs dropped built-in Ethernet, which I do miss (I don't miss the optical drive). Replacing USB 2 with USB 3, no downside. Replacing Thunderbolt with Thunderbolt 2, no downside. Replacing Mini DisplayPort with Thunderbolt, no downside. Roughly eight years ago, Mini DisplayPort replaced all their other video connectors, pretty much guaranteeing you'd need a dongle to connect to an external display (until they added HDMI to MBPs). But it also cleared out the mish-mash of different connectors on different models; they had DVI, Mini-DVI, and Micro-DVI on different laptop models all in the same time frame! Mini DisplayPort didn't eliminate "dongle hell" but it did make it more sane. Steve Jobs is the one who dropped all preceding connectors in favor of USB (for which there was not much adoption yet) and floppy drives on the original iMac, his is not a name to invoke when criticizing the forward-looking decision to go all-in on Thunderbolt 3/USB-C. Reply Openreels¬†¬† 2016-11-07 23:23 Nothing new here, Apple's been changing interfaces on us for decades! At least when they introduced TBolt as THE ONE interface they also had a display with breakouts built in. Unfortunately it took quite some time for 3rd parties to bring out alternatives that were badly needed. That could happen again, but at least USB-C has big potential for the long-term (assuming anyone can understand it). Guess I don't need to keep the old ADC video adapter cable any longer, or that crazy non-standard power cord... Reply dbrugger¬†¬† 2016-11-08 13:31 Price reductions don't make it. Put back what you took off so I don't need the adaptors. Then Apple will have made it right. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc¬†¬†2016-11-09 15:28 The price of dongles is probably a side show for Apple. And, though I was surprised by the port configuration of the new MacBook Pro, I think there is method to their madness. They no longer have to worry about which ports to include in their ever slimming laptops. The simple fact is that Thunderbolt 3/USB-C will serve every currently popular port, from video through USB to Thunderbolt, FireWire and Ethernet‚Äîand memory card readers. Not only that, you can charge external devices or the Mac itself from any of the ports, though I suspect there are some unspoken caveats on that score. With the right adaptor (or hub) you can connect any legacy tech you own. That's quite a coup when you step back and think about it for a minute (or two). The MacBook Pro is now essentially universal. It means the customer doesn't have to worry about which model has which ports. Get a Mac and customize it as you like, with the adaptors for the ports you need. It's a new and rather shocking concept. But it will make sense in the long run. That said, as Josh suggested, Apple could have handled things better. Clearly the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. But that's nothing new in Apple's security obsessed, vertical silo organization. In fact, it's the norm and is't only surprising when they don't muck something up. Does anyone remember how OS X 10.10 Yosemite did a face plant right out the door? Meanwhile, if they had included an adaptor with the new Macs it would inevitably have been the wrong adaptor for some people. The new meme is about you choosing the adaptors you need. A credit toward an adaptor purchase at the Apple Store might have been nice, but it would almost certainly have been too much for some people and not enough for others. I suspect consternation over the new port alignment was factored into Apple's sales projections. Though I suspect many people enthusiastically ordering a new MBP didn't realize what they were getting into. Apple undoubtedly expected flack over some of their decisions. And just as undoubtedly they expect such flack to subside as people get used to the new reality‚Äîas they always do when Apple changes things up. And they expect (or hope) that the luster and charm of the Touch Bar will balance things out a bit. But there are a lot of other questions to be answered. Almost lost in all the hoopla over ports and adaptors is the larger size and Force Touch capability of the MacBook Pro trackpad. That, too, will take some getting used to. It's too soon to tell if the new keyboard, not including the Touch Bar, will be a plus or a minus. The keyboard on the MacBook was not all that well received. Is this one like that one? And, frankly, the Apple Wireless keyboard on which I'm typing this comment is the best Mac keyboard I've ever used‚Äîand I've used them all at one time or another. It's comparable to the keyboard on most Mac laptops up till now. Then there's touch ID. Does that mean you cannot start the new MBP with a password? At least on an iPhone you have a choice in how to set it up. And just how good are those new speakers? Does it matter? We won't know till we hear them. Will the 16GB limitation on RAM be an issue? Some people think so. How can you have a "pro" computer these days with only 16GB of RAM?. This was probably a matter of heat dissipation, though there are two new low profile, supposedly quiet fans to cool thing down. There are some cool videos about the MacBook Pro on the Apple web site, http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/, along with some rah-rah explanations of all the new features, of which there are many. I think spending some time studying what Apple has to say about its new Mac will calm the jitters some people are having about it. It did so for me. Oh, and speaking of new features, taken in toto this is more than the usual evolutionary upgrade of the MacBook Pro. The RAM is faster, the system bus is faster, the CPU is faster, the NVRAM is faster, the SSD is faster. The screen is brighter with a higher gamut (color range) and better contrast. The speakers are more robust. The ports are more powerful and versatile. The Touch Bar is almost revolutionary. In other words, Apple waited until they could upgrade literally everything on the MBP. For a change they lived up to Steve's old motto: Apple will introduce no technology before its time. Let's hope this proves to be true in this case. I can't wait to try one out at my local Best Buy‚Äîespecially the keyboard, which is a make or break item in my book. And, lo, I've almost reached the character limit on this post. Whoa. Reply Scott M.¬†¬† 2016-11-09 16:38 While I have issues with aspects the whole "dongle" thing, I do agree that the USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports are powerful and overall a good thing. Personally, I don't particularly object to "dongles". It does allow for rather flexible and powerful ports that can then be adapted to how users want/need to use them. And I don't really care that "dongles" are ugly. I am totally in the "function over form" (not that I don't appreciate a nice design). Where I do have an issue is that Apple screwed up how they handled it and the plain reality is that it might cost them some sales. In many ways, Apple could predict which "dongles" people might want or need, so there certainly are challenges to the idea of Apple providing some "dongles" in the box. I would argue that is true for most "dongle" options, but not true for at least one simple USB-C to USB-A (i.e. currently available "standard" USB port). Like a headphone jack on an iPhone, I would argue that the vast majority of MacBook Pro use on a rather regular basis a USB device. So, to me, Apple's true screw up on the "dongle" front was not including at least 1 USB-C to USB-A "dongle" with every new MacBook Pro purchase (and I would argue MacBook purchase). After all, with Apple's "here have a discount for a short period of time on these dongles sale, at least until you forget that we screwed this up" sale on "dongles", it would appear that it costs Apple $9 or less to make the USB-C to USB-A dongle (I highly doubt Apple would be will to sell them at a loss even for distraction/marketing sales in the hopes of dying down the controversy until people forget about it). So, Apple's mistake was not just eating the $9 (or less) cost of providing at least 1 USB-C to USB-A dongle with the sale of a MacBook Pro (like they did with the Lightning to headphone jack dongle with the iPhone 7). I also agree there are other aspects of the new MacBook Pro to like, but some that are still unknown (in particular the TouchBar...hard to say how useful it will really be until actually using it) and some that are not so good (such as the limit of 16 GB of RAM). I, however, will not be watching any of Apple's marketing videos. While I love Macs and will generally pick them over a Windows machines the majority of the time (except for certain situations such as a gaming computer), I can only take so much of the Apple marketing koolaid crap of "magical this" and "magical that". In the end, they are still just marketing videos that come from a very biased source (which is true of pretty much all marketing material). To that effect, I have not watched the MacBook Pro keynote and not sure if I will. I did watch the iPhone 7 event and was left rather unimpressed by the presentation. That is not to say that there were some nice upgrades/improvements to the iPhone 7 and other potentially nice new products (such as potentially the AirPods when they are finally released). What left me disappointed was essentially a 2 hour presentation that did not present enough new and innovative stuff to deserve a 2 hour presentation. It came across too much as a self-congradulatory marathon of "magic this" and "magic that"...AND most of it was not magic in my opinion. In the end, I just think that Apple has let itself get trapped in a self-absorbed and self-congradulatory bubble. Yes, they make excellent products that I prefer to use...most of the time...but they have gotten too caught up in their own marketing hype too often. But that is just me.

People are angry about all the adapters required for the new line of MacBook Pro laptops, but thankfully Apple is temporarily reducing prices on those adapters and the LG 4K and 5K monitors.

Apple learned early on that controlling all¬†entire hardware and software was the way to go, but Google seemed content to just work on the software end. Sure, there were a few forgettable Google-branded Nexus phones, but they were far from the best Android handsets. Now Google has decided to dive in head-first and design its own phones, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. HTC is building the phones, but the design is all Google's. Let's get one thing out of the way first -- Google's Pixel looks like an iPhone. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Apple has sold millions of iPhones, and the design and look are proven hits. But even though it looks like an iPhone and costs the same as the iPhone (starting at $650), there are hardware differences that are worth mentioning. Hardware and specs I've been using the non-XL Pixel for the last few weeks, so my hands-on thoughts will focus on the smaller version. The Pixel is built around a 5-inch AMOLED screen made from Corning Gorilla Glass 4 with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (441 pixels per inch). It runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor with four gigabytes of RAM and ships with 32gb or 128gb of storage. The sleep/wake button is high on the right edge, but the volume rocker button is also on the right. This put all the buttons comfortably under your thumb (if you're right-handed). The big difference in the Pixel's design is the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the phone's back, which happens to be exactly where my index finger rests when I'm holding the phone. Putting the fingerprint reader on the back isn't really better or worse than the iPhone's front placement -- it's a matter of taste. Because the Pixel chose the back, I have to pick up the phone to unlock it with my finger. I do find I keep my iPhone lying on my desk, so I am able to just touch my finger to the reader without picking up the phone to check a message or text. The body is made of aluminum, but the top third of the phone's backside is also glass. The main camera has a 12-megapixel sensor and an f/2.0 lens. The front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor with an f/2.4 lens. The camera is top-notch. The Pixel is on par with Apple's iPhone 7 or Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. I can't say enough nice things about the camera on the Pixel. I also love invoking the camera app by a quick double flip of the phone or double tapping the sleep/wake button. Google also includes unlimited cloud storage for all photos and videos taken with the Pixel. The charger is USB-C, which seems to be where the world is headed (except for iPhones). The Pixel's USB-C port uses the faster USB 3.0, which means much faster transfers. According to Google, 15 minutes of USB-C charging from the included 18-watt power supply will provide seven hours of power. The Pixel's physical dimensions are 5.6 inches x 2.7 inches x 0.2 inches, and it weighs 5.04 ounces. It's about a quarter of an inch longer than my iPhone 6s. The 2,770 mAh battery easily lasted a day for my use. You'll find the usual radios -- 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 along with NFC. There are a few features you won't find on the Pixel, including water resistance and stereo speakers (there's just one). There is no slot for adding storage, and the Pixel does not have wireless charging. Android in all its glory You may have used Android phones before, but you really haven't used Android as Google intended. Different wireless carriers and phone manufacturers put their own software on top of Android, often cluttering up the landscape. The Pixel runs pure, unadulterated Android 7.1, and it's the only phone to feature Google's new Assistant. Simply say "OK, Google," and you'll invoke the Google Assistant, which will answer questions, manage tasks, find photos, entertain you and help you stay on schedule. I think Google's Assistant is much better than Apple's Siri. You can have an actual conversation with Assistant. I asked the Assistant how to get to Klyde Warren Park in Dallas, and the directions from my location were displayed on a Google map. Then I asked, "When was it built?" and the Assistant brought up an article about the park and when it was built. Very cool. There are some other Android tweaks you'll notice. I had to look up the way you call up the app list on the Pixel. With other Android phones, you'll have an icon to bring up all the apps. On the Pixel, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up the apps. The apps are also pretty uniform in their appearance. All the included app icons are round. Third-party apps still can be shaped differently, but I like the round look. Overall the phone was very snappy and responsive. Conclusions I'm really happy Google has decided to get into the phone game. The company has the most popular operating system, and it's about time it designed its own hardware to take advantage of it. I'm a longtime iPhone user, so I'm a sucker for the design. I'm still on the fence about the fingerprint sensor placement. There is a lot to like about the Pixel and Pixel XL. I realize this isn't an in-depth review, but there are plenty of places online to find those. The Pixel is a hit with me, and it joins the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy 7 phones in the top tier of handsets. I can't wait to see what Google does with the next version of the Pixel The Pixel costs $649 and the XL costs $769 for the 32gb model. Add $100 to each to increase the storage to 128gb. They are available from Google, Verizon stores or Best Buy. You might see commercials or websites that say the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive, but that's just for sales. If you buy the Pixel through Google, it's unlocked for use on any carrier. Thanks to Verizon for the review phone. Google Pixel Pros: Looks like an iPhone, solid build, pure Android experience, great camera. Cons: Not water-resistant, no external storage. Bottom line: Great handsets that really allow Android to shine.

Cue cashed in 335,000 Apple shares at an average price of $111.86, netting himself $37,473,100. Cue's windfall follows the September vesting of 525,000 restricted stock units, which were worth approximately $59.6 million at the time. The shares represented the final 75 percent of the 100,000 restricted stock units Cue was awarded in November of 2011, which became 700,000 RSU's after Apple's 7-for-1 split in 2014. The first 25 percent of Cue's RSUs vested two years ago, on September 21, 2014. Cue put his full September award of 268,695 shares after taxes into a family trust, which is also what he has done with the 335,000 shares that were cashed in this week. Following the transaction, Eddy Cue continues to hold 1,464 shares of Apple stock. Apple SVP of hardware engineering Dan Riccio has also cashed in 33,323 shares worth between $110.09 and $110.90, netting 3,677,115.

Ronald James Powell, Ph.D, was both appointed and sworn in during Friday‚Äôs meeting, his role as a provisional board member beginning immediately. Powell has taken the place of Lawrence, who resigned late September, saying she would be moving out of Apple Valley to be closer to family. Last month, the Board of Trustees announced that, in lieu of holding a special election, it would make an appointment to fill a vacant position on the board, in accordance to state education code. Powell, a retired educator, has 41 years of experience in public education, AVUSD officials said. He was selected out of nine qualified candidates who each completed an application packet and were interviewed during public session at the special meeting Friday. AVUSD officials said Powell's provisional appointment shall become an effective appointment unless a petition calling for a special election with a sufficient number of signatures is filed in the office of the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools within 30 days. Powell will hold office until the next regularly scheduled election for district board members in 2018.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 4, 2016 at 5:45PM When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its latest 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro computers, there were some potential buyers who were completely put off by the prices. The base model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar runs $1,799, and the base 15-inch MacBook Pro runs a cool $2,399. Apple's new MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.¬† These are clearly high-priced, premium systems. However, there's a difference between an overpriced product and an expensive one. The former is a product that doesn't deliver the value that its price tag suggests, while the latter is simply a product with a high price. And the latest MacBook Pro computers, although¬†expensive, are not really overpriced.¬† Head-to-head:¬†Spectre x360 vs.¬†13-inch MacBook Pro To give you a sense of the value offered by the 13-inch MacBook Pro (with Touch Bar), I'll compare it with HP's (NYSE:HPQ) premium Windows-based Spectre x360 laptop. (A similar comparison should be possible for the 15-inch MacBook Pro and a suitable Windows-based alternative.) The latter has gotten very good reviews, with Laptop Magazine calling it "the convertible laptop to beat." In the table below, I've put the specifications of a "maxed-out" Spectre x360 side by side with a similarly configured 13-inch MacBook Pro, pulled from HP's and Apple's respective websites -- and for some of the MacBook Pro details, AnandTech: ¬† Spectre x360¬† 13-inch MacBook Pro w/Touch Bar¬† Processor Core i7-7500U Core i7-6567U Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel Iris Graphics 550 Display 1920 x 1080 IPS, touch-enabled 2560 x 1600 IPS, non-touch Memory 16GB LPDDR3-1600 16GB LPDDR3-2133 Storage 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD 512GB PCIe-based SSD Expansion ports 2x USB Type-C, 1 USB 3.1 Gen 1, 1 headphone/microphone combo 4x Thunderbolt 3 ports Wireless connectivity 802.11ac (2x2) and Bluetooth 4.0 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 Trackpad HP Imagepad Force Touch trackpad Battery capacity 57.8 Wh 49.2 Wh Weight 2.85 lbs 3.02 lbs Price (as configured) $1,299 $2,499 Source: HP, Apple, AnandTech. There's no beating around the bush -- the HP system is about half as expensive as the MacBook Pro system. However, if we walk through each of these specifications and closely compare the two systems, it becomes clear that, at the very least, the premium that Apple charges is directly related to component costs. Let's do just that. The tricky processor comparison First, let's look at the processor and graphics technologies in each system. Although the Apple system uses an older sixth-generation Core processor while the HP uses a newer seventh-generation Core processor, the chip inside of the MacBook is faster. The processor architectures of the i7-7500U and i7-6567U are identical, meaning that, at a given frequency, these two chips will perform the same. The main advantage of the seventh-generation Core processors is that they are built on a newer version of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) 14-nanometer process, which should allow the seventh-generation Core processors to run at higher speeds than the sixth-generation Core processors, all else being equal. The 6567U has two processor cores that run at 3.3GHz base and can turbo to 3.6GHz. The 7500U has two processor cores that run at 2.7GHz, but can turbo to 3.5GHz.¬†It's likely, then, that in CPU tasks, it's a wash between these two. In terms of graphics architecture, once again, the sixth-generation Core and seventh-generation Core processors are virtually the same. However, the chip inside of the MacBook Pro uses Intel's higher-performance Iris graphics -- more graphics cores, dedicated eDRAM memory built into the chip package -- so I would expect that in graphics tasks, the MacBook Pro chip will have a clear edge in graphics tasks over the chip inside of the Spectre x360. The trade-off that Apple is likely making by using a chip with Iris graphics is that it's certainly more expensive to manufacture than a similar chip without Iris graphics. The size of the main processor is larger, and the Iris parts include a fairly large on-package memory manufactured in Intel's 22-nanometer logic process.¬† Intel almost certainly charges more for chips that cost more to make, adding to Apple's bill-of-materials costs relative to HP's.¬† The display comparison Moving beyond the processor, the HP system has a 1920-by-1080 resolution IPS display, while the MacBook Pro has a higher resolution 2560-by-1600 resolution IPS display. The display on the MacBook should be sharper. The comparison doesn't end there, though. The display on the MacBook Pro supports the much wider DCI-P3 color gamut, while tests performed by NotebookCheck show that the display on the HP fails to fully cover even the narrower sRGB color gamut. Finally, per NotebookCheck, the average brightness of the display found on the Spectre x360 is 318.6 nits. The site found the average brightness on the new 13-inch MacBook Pro display to be 563.6 nits. Apple's machine has a sharper, brighter, and more colorful display. HP's, on the other hand, supports touch input while Apple's doesn't.¬† Comparing everything else As far as memory and storage go, both have 16GB of LPDDR3 memory and 512GB of storage. However, it's worth pointing out that the MacBook Pro, as configured, uses faster 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory while the Spectre uses slower 1600MHz LPDDR3. 9to5Mac also points out, citing Computer World, that the new MacBook Pro systems are around "two years ahead of most of its competition" in terms of solid-state drive speeds. The MacBook Pro is slightly heavier, but they're both in roughly the same weight class. The Apple system uses a Force Touch trackpad, while HP's system uses what it dubs an HP Imagepad. And finally, the MacBook includes an OLED touch bar with Touch ID support, while HP's system doesn't. Distinguishing price from value Apple's new MacBook is clearly an expensive system, but across the board, it appears to offer more features and better performance than the newest Spectre x360 -- a top Windows notebook. This isn't an attempt to disparage HP's Spectre x360 -- it has received extremely positive reviews from many reputable outlets, and is frankly a very attractive Windows-based machine. The point of this comparison is to show that Apple crams in a lot of things here and there that might not individually mean much to potential customers, but ultimately serve to enhance the user experience. Engineering often consists of making smart trade-offs that balance cool features against cost structure. Apple's new MacBook computers traded off price in order to build extremely feature-rich products. HP, on the other hand, did what it could within a system that it could sell for $1,300, which, frankly, is quite high for a consumer Windows-based notebook.¬† We'll get a better idea of how receptive customers are to Apple's choices vis-a-vis the new MacBook Pro computers when the company reports its financial results in January.¬† Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

There are those who have tried to explain and rationalize the gaping holes in Apple‚Äôs presentation. Part of Apple‚Äôs structuring of the event¬†may have been driven by Intel‚Äôs CPU/GPU roadmap. Part of it may have been that Apple executives have been sidetracked by the Apple Car, Campus 2 construction and EU/Ireland affairs. Part of it may have been that they were taken by surprise by both the Microsoft‚Äôs Surface Studio design and the warm reaction to it. This might be constructed as some of the case for the defense. The prosecution claims that Apple took too long update all of its Mac lineup. There should have been more periodic updates along the way for each kind of Mac. Leading up to the event, the often cited MacRumors Mac Buying Guide showed that all of the Macs, except the MacBook, have been painfully neglected. The addition of a Touch Pad to the Skylake-based 2016 MacBook Pros wasn‚Äôt enough of a broad corporate affirmation to both the mobile and desktop lines. The tagline, ‚Äúhello again‚Äù suggested that Apple would reignite the Mac. It didn‚Äôt happen. Neglect and indifference to consumers as well as to technical and creative professionals were cited. Below, I have a list of¬†notable articles for each side of the argument. Then my verdict. Apple‚Äôs MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Apple‚Äôs Defense 1. Jason Snell presented: ‚ÄúWhy 2016 is such a terrible year for the Mac.‚Äù He lays out the best defense for Apple by explaining Apple‚Äôs situation and the elements of the huge pushback. He‚Äôs critical of Apple in parts, but also explains some of Apple‚Äôs plight. With respect to Intel‚Äôs roadmap: In this case, Apple‚Äôs timing appears to have been bad. There‚Äôs no way to know for sure, but it seems like Apple decided to dance to its own rhythm, skip an Intel chip generation, and then wait for the good stuff, only to get bitten by slippage in Intel‚Äôs schedule. If that‚Äôs what happened, it‚Äôs hard to blame it on Intel. After all, it was Apple‚Äôs gamble. 2. Horace Dediu, in his quintessential analytical style, lays out the business and market forces related to desktop and mobile computing. ‚ÄúWherefore Art Thou Macintosh.‚Äù If the market, the tendencies, the future and all the money are on mobile, it‚Äôs going to be hard for Apple not to place all of its attention there. This is a great article. An excerpt: The Mac is thus not treated disparagingly. It deserves and gets respect. It is preserved but with limited responsibilities‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs [the Mac] not obsolete but it is a decreasing share of engagement. Alternate ways of doing the jobs it does well with direct input are emerging on the third pivot but they are not yet good enough. The children are still adolescent and making lots of stupid mistakes. There‚Äôs still life in the parents‚Ä¶. The Mac is what it is because it‚Äôs not alone. It‚Äôs part of a family. It is a parent. It strives to be better but will not take the future from its child. 3. Finally, belatedly, the defendant takes the stand. The Independent was later given an interview by Apple SVP Phil Schiller.¬†‚ÄúApple‚Äôs Philip Schiller talks computers, touchscreens and voice on the new MacBook Pro.‚Äù SVP Schiller responds to all the negative outcry about Apple‚Äôs deafening silence regarding other Macs. I hope everyone gets a chance to try it for themselves and see how great the MacBook Pro is. It is a really big step forward and an example of how much we continue to invest in the Mac. We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been. Not everyone will see that mea culpa. ¬†That one sentence in the event itself would have saved the day.¬†¬†Now, on to Apple‚Äôs prosecution on page 2.

I should have left reading this until Monday. I looked at that Surface Studio machine ad. That is a pretty slick looking piece of equipment. I am also starting to hear good things about Win10 (but it is still WINDOWS ) I then went to the Apple site and priced out a loaded 2016 MBP. (Warning, I live in Canada). Damn near had a heart attack! Almost $6000.00. That does not even include a monitor and the necessary converters to attach all my external drives and other devices. It is extremely unlikely that there is one of these in my future. I will make my existing 15‚Ä≥ rMBP last as long as possible. If Apple is determined to exit the PC business (in spite of their protestations to the contrary), then the least they could do is license macOS. That is the main reason I use Apple PCs in the first place. I can wait for a while, but when I am ready for a new machine, I will be evaluating very carefully if it is worthwhile to remain in the Apple ecosystem. November 4, 2016 at 5:48 EST PM Albatrossflyer November 4, 2016 Until people stop buying iPhones because Apple won‚Äôt provide the MacBook Pros, iMacs, & Mac Pros they want, Apple won‚Äôt give a damn what you think about their computer lineup. November 4, 2016 at 7:03 EST PM TT November 4, 2016 Maybe Siri will get smart enough to tell Apple engineers how to‚Ä¶fix their Mac lineup. November 4, 2016 at 10:14 EST PM MarcusNewton November 5, 2016 With my 20/20 hindsight, I think Apple should have released a spec-bumped MacBook Pro back in July with Skylake processors, and waited until June 2017 to release the touch-bar MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake processors. This would have allowed Apple to shift the blame squarely on Intel for a delayed redesign, instead of releasing a compromised MacBook Pro this month. One article I read this week said that this new MacBook Pro is not a continuation of that Pro line we are use to (the 2012 line), but it is instead the ‚Äúfull‚Äù version of the 12‚Ä≥ MacBook. Based on everything I have read this week I have to sadly agree. I have also seen people now referring to it as MacBook Amateur. I remember when I bought the original iMac, everything necessary was already in the box; including a phone cable so I could connect the modem to the wall outlet. I love the Ad that Jeff Goldblum did for the iMac where he was explaining the 3 steps to get an iMac on the Internet and there was no step 3. One of the main reasons I have so strongly advocated Apple products to friends and family is that I knew that just about everything they would need would be mostly likely included and well thought out with whatever they bought with Apple. With the new MacBook Pro I feel like Apple has set its users adrift into a sea of adapters, cables, dongles, and hubs with little regard as to how that affects the overall Mac experience. Especially, after Amazon revealed how many counterfeit and bogus cables where being sold on its site. Playing Russian roulette with 3rd-party cables and adapters is hardly a positive and consistent user experience. With that said, I am happy about Thunderbolt 3 finally emerging. I love the idea of being able to run two 5K monitors from a single cable while also charging a laptop. However, that is the only thing I need Thunderbolt 3 for. All of my current devices: the audio interfaces, external hard drives, graphics tablets, scanner, and printer, all max out at USB 3 speeds. I am not going to update my $300 Yamaha audio interface just so I can use a USB-C cable; there is literally no improvement. Finally, Apple not supporting 4K on the Apple TV is making me move away from it. I saved up my money and bought a 65‚Ä≥ Samsung 4K SUHD TV with HDR (the KS8000). It is amazing. The TV has Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Now apps built right in. Streaming 4K shows off of Netflix like Daredevil, Narcos, and Marco Polo is breathtakingly good. The only reason I have even turned on my Apple TV in the last three weeks was to watch the ‚Äúhello, again‚Äù keynote. I can shoot 4K video on my iPhone, edit the 4K footage in both iMovie and Final Cut Pro on either my iPad Pro or MacBook Pro, but I cannot play it at 4K on my Apple TV. November 5, 2016 at 12:24 EST AM shameermulji November 5, 2016 ‚ÄúObservers have noted that Tim Cook‚Äôs presentation seemed strained, not as well rehearsed, and invoked what seems to be filler material at the outset. The team seems to have been up late, re-thinking the agenda in light of what Microsoft announced. All the earmarks of failure to execute are there.‚Äù In light of no evidence, that‚Äôs nothing more than idle speculation. I think Schiller did a stand up job. November 5, 2016 at 3:17 EST AM geoduck November 5, 2016 It has to be said. Tim Cook must go. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. I tried to tell myself that his style was different from Steve Jobs style. Not better or worse just different. That his Apple would be different from the old Apple but the core of what made Apple my favourite company would still be there. But there‚Äôs a difference between following a different course and being rudderless. Today‚Äôs Apple reminds me a lot of the mid 2000s Microsoft under Balmer. Lots of little pet projects that come and go, but the core systems have stagnated. Apple now worries more about share price, and profit centres more than making great products. That is a philosophical change that starts from the top. The philosophy of Jobs Apple was to make delightful products and profit would follow. The philosophy of Cooks Apple is to chase profit and assume the products will sell. Apple needs another dreamer, someone who knows that these aren‚Äôt toasters. Someone that worries more about making the product perfect, than how many pennies he can shave off the cost to get it made. There are people like that out there. The new head of Microsoft is exhibit number 1. Bill Gates choice of Steve Balmer as his replacement showed that the founder of the company is not necessarily the best person to make that choice. It‚Äôs time to admit that Steve Jobs choice of Tim Cook was just as misguided. Tim, you had five years, but it isn‚Äôt working. You‚Äôve shown that, as talented as you are, you are not the right person for the job. It‚Äôs time for Tim to go. November 5, 2016 at 10:12 EST AM Lee Dronick November 5, 2016 Maybe Siri will get smart enough to tell Apple engineers how to‚Ä¶fix their Mac lineup. And fix that horrid iOS Music app November 5, 2016 at 11:38 EST AM JoelS November 5, 2016 Totally agree John, but it is worse than that. It is not just the Mac, there is lame all over at Apple. It is time for Tim Cook to go. It is deja vu all over again and they are playing the part of Microsoft 1999. November 5, 2016 at 11:45 EST AM Lee Dronick November 5, 2016 So who replaces Tim Cook? Certainly Jonny Ive. Elon Musk perhaps. November 5, 2016 at 2:21 EST PM bjeast November 5, 2016 It‚Äôs been a long time since there‚Äôs been this much criticism about Apple from all quarters. I tried to give Tim cook the benefit of the doubt, but at this point he‚Äôs getting perilously close to Ballmer‚Äôs reign of error. Yes, the company is still making money. But the Mac is still suffering from neglect. Under his watch, there has been incredibly poor rollouts of the new Maps and Apple Music. Schiller is, amazingly, getting worse at presenting. In fact, this was the worst presentation ever. From the awkward, awkward demos of the touch bar, to the amazingly lame comparison of the new MacBook Pro to an early Apple portable (utterly pointless), the presentation just dragged. It was easily a half an hour or more longer than it needed to be. And yes, I completely agree with everyone who says that the slogan ‚ÄúHello, Again‚Äù was a significant misstep. How anyone could have thought that was a good idea and wouldn‚Äôt raise expectations is beyond belief. November 5, 2016 at 4:01 EST PM jeffsz November 5, 2016 There is such a thing as ‚Äútoo much elegance and not enough practicality/value.‚Äù I think Apple has crossed over this line with the current crop of MacBooks (I will not call them Pro machines). Thin in a consumer device is nice but really is out of place in a Pro machine. Too thin? Yes. While some are claiming Tim Cook should go, I think his only failing is not having enough balls to stand up to Jone Ive and say, ‚ÄúNo! Stop obsessing about thinness!‚Äù How about a screen with NO bezel‚Ä¶ well, it needs to be thicker. How about some useful legacy ports‚Ä¶ well, it needs to be thicker. November 5, 2016 at 5:28 EST PM Jamie November 5, 2016 I hate to admit it, but I agree with the other posters. Tim‚Äôs Apple seems to have lost its way. I have no idea who is ultimately responsible, I doubt very much it‚Äôs one individual, but I haven‚Äôt had thoughts like these about the company since the System 7 days. Something has gotta change. November 5, 2016 at 11:26 EST PM geoduck November 6, 2016 For those that argue that it‚Äôs OK because Apple is still making money, I‚Äôd like to point out that no matter how Balmer‚Äôs Microsoft blundered, it was also profitable. No matter how utterly clueless, leaderless, or feckless Microsoft became, it still made money. November 6, 2016 at 8:29 EST AM archimedes November 6, 2016 I‚Äôm not going to join the chorus calling for the head of Messrs. Cook/Schiller/Ive, but I‚Äôm puzzled as to why there has been no follow-through on the 2013 Mac Pro, and I agree that ‚ÄúHello, Again‚Äù raised expectations to iMac ‚Äô98 level but delivered less of a step forward than Apple‚Äôs 2012 Retina MacBook Pro (or the neglected 2013 Mac Pro.) On the other hand, unlike many commenters here, I am a huge fan of the iPad Pro. I rarely use the Microsoft-style smart keyboard, but I use the iPad all the time and find the 12‚Ä≥ form factor to be a definite sweet spot for many uses (sketchbook, music apps, sheet music, reading, video, etc..) Apple doesn‚Äôt usually respond directly to competitors, but I would be interested in hearing more from Cupertino about why they think the adjustable drafting table format (e.g. Surface Studio) is a losing idea, and what they think is better for artists, designers and musicians. Personally I find the idea of a large format iOS device to be somewhat appealing. November 6, 2016 at 8:21 EST PM archimedes November 6, 2016 ‚Äúheads‚Äù ‚Äì sadly there seems to be no editing for TMO comments! November 6, 2016 at 8:23 EST PM Scott B in DC November 6, 2016 Before I make my comment: ‚Äúheads‚Äù ‚Äì sadly there seems to be no editing for TMO comments! May I recommend Grammarly. Even if you just sign up for the free version and add the Safari Extension, it might be enough to help you get past those typing nits! Since it is getting to be all about the apps, the software we use, what is the difference if that software runs on a Mac or a PC. I can get along without Safari since I use Firefox as an alternative. Other than Photos, what other Mac-only software will keep my tied to my Mac? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I was hoping for an excuse to replace by late-2009 27-inch iMac. But I can see keeping this machine as my bridge for iOS (no, I do not use iCloud) and Photos while I get a Surface Studio for everything else. I‚Äôve already ditched a laptop for an iPad Air, why not ditch the Mac if working in a browser, Word, Evernote, and the other programs work closer to how they do on my iPad than on my Mac? November 6, 2016 at 11:53 EST PM brilor November 7, 2016 Developer Marco Ament wrote a well-reasoned piece. See it here: November 7, 2016 at 10:31 EST AM brilor November 7, 2016 Here is the link. November 7, 2016 at 10:32 EST AM wab95 November 7, 2016 John: For a topic like this, it‚Äôs hard to know where to begin, so let me begin with a quote from HL Mencken, ‚ÄúFor every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong‚Äù. To illustrate, as a young intern, I had a complicated post-op patient who had had surgery for aesophageal strictures (look it up if you‚Äôre curious). During his recovery, he became febrile. We gave him acetaminophen (Tylenol), and did a workup to rule out infection. There was none. Still, he complained of fever. Clearly, in order to break his fever, I‚Äôd have to use something stronger than Tylenol, so I gave him a true non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID), ibuprofen. What could be simpler? As expected, his fever broke. And then he began to cough up blood. And bleed. I took no consolation that he was finally afebrile as he was wheeled off to the ICU. It turns out that what the patient had was ‚Äòatelectasis‚Äô or isolated areas of lung collapse that can happen post surgery and can cause fever. The cure for his fever was to make him take deep breaths, and not NSAIDs, which can lead to bleeding, and in this case, made things worse. Who‚Äôd have known, right? A more knowledgeable and experienced physician, that‚Äôs whom. As an inexperienced intern, I was focussed on the fever and not the whole patient.(I also learnt that New Yorkers have a rich repertoire of words for ‚Äòstupid‚Äô, some of them in Yiddish, but I digress). It was a valuable lesson. As an avid Mac user, I realise that the Mac is important, but it‚Äôs no longer the core of Apple‚Äôs existence, and may not be a vital organ of Apple‚Äôs future. Still, it‚Äôs tempting to look at Apple, focus on their computer line in isolation and say, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs make Apple great again‚Äô, on the grounds that the Mac made Apple great in the first place. What could be simpler? The problem with that narrative is that it‚Äôs false. Post SJ2, as great as they were, Macs never made Apple great. Rather, that was mobile. The so-called halo effect meant that expanded Mac market share was lofted on the wings of the iPhone, and not by the Mac‚Äôs own bootstraps. What about fixing Apple by replacing Tim Cook as Apple‚Äôs CEO? Okay, with whom? The point above was that, in a complex situation, clear and simple solutions are seldom correct, and may be harmful. What do we know about CEO replacements at Apple? Empirical data on bringing in CEOs from outside Apple indicate a poor outcome, and that was during a simpler time for the industry and for Apple‚Äôs product line up, and pre-dated their global expansion. Leadership today requires an experienced and knowledgeable CEO, proficient both in that system and in leveraging those assets into a prosperous future. That can best be achieved through an apprenticed CEO from within. If anyone doubts this, then point to that company that is currently outcompeting Apple across the entire spectrum of products and services, and is beating Apple at being Apple. Apprenticeship takes time, and is doubtless already underway, but would likely be premature today. The industrial context in which Apple compete is characterised by uncertainty. I suggest that that uncertainty is driven by two things: 1) a plateauing of mature technologies, like CPUs and GPUs, in which real world gains are marginal, and; 2) an abundance of potentially new directions driven by emerging technologies, like AI, virtual reality, robotics, and smart devices like wearables and transportation, to name a few. The choice of direction should be driven by one question; what is the company‚Äôs goal? Apple have stated that their goal is to unleash human creativity and make the world a better place. However Apple achieve that, they cannot do so but from a position of strength in finances, footprint, growth and mindshare. I posit that the path to that goal is not a retreat to a comfortable past rooted in mature technologies, particularly one based on a false narrative around one product line nestled in simpler time that no longer exists. Apple, like all living things with a hope of a future, have to adapt and evolve. Finally, regarding the criticism that Apple have squandered precious time on abortive research and development, like the Apple Car, progress from R&D is not, nor has ever been, linear. Furthermore, R&D among integrated technologies has carry-over benefits into related areas even if a specific project is aborted. NASA tech is rife with examples. One can imagine Apple‚Äôs car R&D leading to benefits in software, secure systems, robotics, AI, and a host of smart devices, to name just a few. However, such progress is inapparent until Apple invest this in new products, which too are likely under development. The point is that, in an environment of evolving complexity, such as the tech industry, adaptation is essential, but the direction of that adaptation will come at a cost, and if poorly selected, can lead to extinction. The clearest, simplest solution is seldom the right one. A knowledgable and experienced CEO can best shepherd that process, and his/her prescription may, and likely will, run contrary to lay expectations. Further, there is always a lag between environmental change and effective adaptation. While it may not be clear in what direction Apple will or should go, a panicked jettison of their leadership, internal cohesion, or simplistic management of the complex interplay between today‚Äôs Apple and their increasingly complex environment will not get them there, neither will an over-emphasis on legacy technology that was never responsible for their rise to prominence.

Single sign-on isn‚Äôt available to the public yet, but the fact that developers have it means the official release isn‚Äôt too far off. Single sign-on shows up in tvOS 10.1 and 10.2 developer betas Single sign-on is a feature that lets Apple TV users enter their cable TV subscription credentials once so they auto-populate in content viewing apps. Apple showed off the feature as part of tvOS 10 earlier this year, but said we‚Äôd have to wait for it to show up. As tvOS software updates started rolling out, single sign-on was still missing in action. We finally got a better idea of when it would show up when Apple announced its new TV app a couple weeks ago and said we‚Äôd see the new app and single sign-on at the same time before the end of the year. Apple no doubt wants developers to test the feature before hoisting it onto regular users, hence it‚Äôs appearance now in the tvOS 10.1 and 10.2 developer betas. Once single sign-on officially available for everyone you can set it up by going to Settings > Accounts > TV Provider on your Apple TV. [Thanks to Mac Rumors for the heads up] Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple TV, beta, single sign-on, tvOS One Comment Add a comment MarcusNewton November 4, 2016 I am really hoping single sign-on works as well as Apple was demonstrated. Trying to activate and manage all the different log-ins for the different apps is cumbersome. I especially have problems with AMC‚Äôs app when trying to watch Halt and Catch Fire or The Walking Dead. For me, about 1 out of 3 uses of the AMC app says I haven‚Äôt activated my cable subscription and won‚Äôt let me watch episodes until I reactivate all over again. So I am definitely looking forward to single sign-on. November 4, 2016 at 9:46 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Per a recent research note from BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long, Apple's profit-share now checks in at an astounding 103.6%. DON'T MISS:¬†Kohl‚Äôs Black Friday 2016 ad just leaked: Apple Watch deals and more discounted gadgets "Tim Long estimates that Apple accounted for 103.6% of smartphone industry operating profits in the third quarter," Investor's Business Daily reports."Its share is over 100% because other vendors lost money in the business, resulting in Apple having more smartphone profit than the industry netted overall. In the year-earlier period, Apple grabbed 90% of smartphone profits, Long said in a research report Thursday." While smartphone manufacturers like LG and HTC failed to churn a profit last quarter, Samsung managed to eek by with a 0.9% share of profits across the industry. All in all, it's another impressive showing from Apple which serves to prove that pure marketshare, in and of itself, is a poor metric for measuring success in the hyper-competitive smartphone industry.¬†If anything, Apple's current marketshare -- estimated at around 12.1% last quarter -- gives the company a lot of room for growth. In fact, Tim Cook during Apple's most recent earnings conference call said that the number of Android to iPhone switchers in 2016 was the highest Apple has ever seen. Meanwhile, if Android manufacturers are still struggling to turn a profit when they're dominating from a marketshare perspective, one has to wonder if any company will ever be able to come close to catching up to Apple.

Apple Cuts Dongle Prices After Users Complain About New MacBook‚Äôs Port¬†Shortage Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Cuts Dongle Prices After Users Complain About New MacBook‚Äôs Port¬†Shortage November 4, 2016 5:41 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup dongles for everyone dongles macbook macbook pro apple Apple wants to bring its MacBook Pro users into the future, and has done so by eliminating every port on the latest version of the computer except for two USB-C ports. The problem? Most of the peripherals on the market aren‚Äôt USB-C, so that means users will have to travel with a fistful of hubs and dongles. Responding to their complaints, Apple has lowered the price of the dongles that customers will need to plug in all of their other stuff. As users of some smaller Chromebooks and last year‚Äôs non-pro MacBooks can tell you, having only one USB-C port to work with is inconvenient, since it‚Äôs used both for charging and for plugging things in to the computer. The new MacBook Pro at leasts adds a second port, but that still leaves customers shopping for dongles to plug in things like displays, external hard drives, and even iPhones. Nope, even iPhones don‚Äôt come with USB-C cables, and users may mistrust third-party vendors after problems in the market for this type of cable earlier this year. Apparently listening to criticism, Apple has cut prices on some of the adapters that MacBook users will need: CNN reports (warning: auto-play video at that link) that a simple standard USB to USB-C adapter will be sold at less than half price (marked down to $9 from $19) for the rest of the year, and a dongle that converts from USB-C to the previous Thunderbolt standard for external displays went from $49 to $29.

Analyst Tim Long, quoted in the Investor's Business Daily, said Apple's staggering 103.6 percent profit share in Q3 2016 came largely as a result of significant losses posted by rival vendors including LG and HTC, and despite Apple continuing to shift fewer handsets year on year. Based on units alone, Samsung accounted for 21.7 percent of all smartphones sold, with Apple coming in second with a 13.2 percent share. In terms of profits however, Samsung came a distant second to Apple, capturing only a 0.9 percent share.Samsung ceded market share in smartphone shipments to Apple and Chinese vendors in the third quarter because of its Galaxy Note 7 troubles, Long said. He expects further share loss by Samsung in the current quarter. Apple captured over 100% of smartphone industry profits for the first time, thanks in part to Samsung's weaker results, Long said. If accurate, the estimates represent the first time Apple has achieved smartphone industry profits of over 100 percent - an impressive number for a company owning only around 12 percent of the market. According to the same report, Apple managed 90 percent profit share in the same quarter a year ago. However, this year Apple's iPhone 7 numbers were undoubtedly helped by Samsung's hugely damaging Galaxy Note 7 recall and discontinuation, which effectively took the South Korean company out of this year's flagship smartphone race, indicating Apple's profit share is unlikely to be sustained in the long term. Despite the impressive numbers, Apple's recent third quarter financial results reported its first full-year revenue decline for Apple since 2001, although Apple expects to return to revenue growth in the¬†holiday season on the back of sales of the iPhone 7¬†and iPhone 7 Plus.Related Roundup: iPhone 7 Discuss this article in our forums ¬ª View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on¬† RedditShare by Email ¬† Source: Wochit Business - 3 weeks ago<¬†>¬†Embed Galaxy Note 7 Disaster Knocks Billions Off Samsung's Profits¬†00:54 The Galaxy Note 7 smartphone debacle wiped out more than a third of Samsung Electronics Co.'s quarterly profits, the electronics giant announced Thursday morning in South Korea.

Follow TechnoBuffalo It looks like Apple is listening to its users after all. Just over a week after announcing its new MacBook Pro, Apple has succumbed to the backlash¬†from users and cut prices of its USB-C dongles and even its new 5K and 4K LG monitors. Apple has never been known for throwing users a bone, instead opting¬†to push forward an industry standard that is in its infancy. Yes, USB-C is the future, but cutting every port out, including the still important SD Card slot, is a pretty drastic change. Luckily, the dongle life will be a little less expensive through the end of the year. The price cuts are coming to all USB-C dongles. Its new 5K and 4K displays that use Thunderbolt 3 via USB-C are also getting a price cut. It should be noted that the discount won‚Äôt be coming to USB-C charging cables, only dongles. We‚Äôll take any sort of savings from Apple anyway we can get them. Down below are the new prices: USB-C to USB-A: $19 down to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2: $49 down to $29 USB-C to Lightning (1 meter): $25 down to $15 USB-C to Lightning (2 meters): $35 down to $29 Hub with HDMI, USB and USB-C: $69 down to $49 Hub with VGA, USB, USB-C: $69 down to $49 LG 5K Display: $1,299.95 down to $949.99 LG 4K Display: $699.95 down to $524 Those are some pretty sweet savings. Apple is even discounting the price of third-party USB-C accessories it sells, such as the SanDisk USB-C SD card reader. This move is primarily aimed at satisfying pro user‚Äôs complaining about the lack of ports. Apple has no problem pushing forward a new technology before the industry is ready to fully adopt it, but it seems it may have pushed the envelope a little too far this time. It‚Äôs nice to Apple admit its error and help out its users for a change.

Fiji Time: 12:35 PM on Tuesday 15 November Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Huawei sets target, launches new premium phone Reuters Saturday, November 05, 2016 CHINA'S Huawei Technologies wants to be the world's second-largest maker of smartphones in two years, Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei's consumer business group, told Reuters on Thursday. Having made its name as a builder of telecommunications networks, Huawei has been active in the consumer devices market for only a few years and is now the third-biggest smartphone maker after Apple Inc and the world leader in the $US400 billion ($F821.8b) market, Samsung Electronics. "When we announced four years ago that we wanted to sell phones, people told us we were crazy. When we said we wanted to sell 100 million phones, they told us we were crazy," Mr Yu said at a launch event in Munich. Huawei on Thursday launched a new premium phone, which will sell for 699 euros apiece. A version developed with Porsche Design will cost 1395 euros ($F2866) The phone has a new artificial intelligence feature: It can learn about its user's habits and automatically put the most frequently used apps in easy reach. Huawei was the world's third-largest smartphone maker in the third quarter with 33.6 million shipped devices, giving it a 9 per cent market share, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. Apple was still well ahead with 45.5 million devices, or a 12 per cent market share. Samsung was the world leader with 75.3 million shipped devices and a market share of 20.1 percent. "We are going to take them (Apple) step-by-step, innovation-by-innovation," Mr Yu said, adding that he expected to improve Huawei's position along with technology shifts. "There will be more opportunities. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality," he said. "It is like driving a car. At every curve or turn, there is an opportunity to overtake the competition." With the new phone, dubbed Mate 9, Mr Yu expects to make a break in European markets such as Germany, France and Great Britain. "In Finland, we are already number one," he said.

ALSO READ Not a great leap forward Commerce ministry bats for local sourcing waiver for Apple Apple's India pie needs local flavour New FDI norms: Apple eligible for 8-year sourcing waiver Local sourcing norms in single-brand retail are being reviewed all over again. The government may cut the mandatory requirement of 30 per cent local sourcing, which any single-brand retailer with more than 51 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) has to comply with, by half. If executed, this would attract multinationals such as Apple, which have stayed away from India due to stringent local sourcing rules. Recently, top government officials deliberated on a proposal to cap sourcing from Indian entities at 15 per cent for single-brand retailers with FDI exceeding 51 per cent. A proposal is also on the table to offset the sourcing norms for domestic use against that for global operations. Among others, the government‚Äôs think tank NITI Aayog has backed these proposals. Earlier this year, Apple‚Äôs application for setting up stores in India got stuck over the sourcing conditions, and the Cupertino-headquartered firm was told to re-apply. Apple CEO Tim Cook met Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his India visit in May and discussed easing of rules to set up shop in India as well as starting manufacturing in the country. India is a fast-growing consumer market for Apple but the company sought complete exemption from local sourcing for setting up fully-owned stores. This is not the first time when sourcing norms have been tweaked. Soon after allowing 100 per cent FDI in single-brand retail in 2012, the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government had revised the sourcing norms as Swedish furnishing major IKEA had said it would not be able to adhere with the stringent guidelines. After that, the government changed the norms from ‚Äúmandatory sourcing from local small and medium enterprises‚Äù to ‚Äúmandatory sourcing from India, preferably from MSMEs‚Äô‚Äô. That helped Ikea go ahead with its investment of Euro 1.5 billion, the largest in the segment so far. Besides Ikea, top brands such as H&M have opted for fully-owned stores in the country. Currently, 100 per cent foreign investment is allowed in single-brand retailing. Up to 49 per cent foreign investment is under the automatic route and the approval from the foreign investment promotion board (FIPB) is required beyond that. The local sourcing norm kicks in when FDI goes beyond 51 per cent. After companies such as Apple, keen to set up shops for iPhones, expressed reservations against these norms, the Modi government allowed companies bringing ‚Äústate of the art‚Äù and ‚Äúcutting edge‚Äù technology to set up stores without local sourcing norms for a period of three years of the opening of the first store. But officials in the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) under the Commerce Ministry are yet to define what is ‚Äúcutting edge‚Äù. While a DIPP-led panel had earlier classified Apple under the cutting edge category, which encouraged the company to apply for India stores, Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) refused to entertain such a classification. It was then that Apple was told to apply again under the new rules. Recently, the US asked India to relax its stringent local sourcing norms in the single-brand retail that has prevented Apple from opening its stores in the country. ‚ÄúThe US encouraged India to consider relaxing local sourcing requirements in single brand retail trade.

On the company‚Äôs website, you can see that both models have seen significant reductions in price with¬†a ‚Äúspecial pricing‚Äù note. Apple¬†may be¬†done building¬†external displays, but these LG UltraFine monitors are essentially the next best thing. Phil Schiller¬†introduced them on stage during last week‚Äôs Mac¬†event, saying Apple¬†teamed up with LG to create these displays specifically for the¬†new MacBook Pro. It seems pretty clear the company¬†is feeling the¬†blowback from the user community, who has criticized the new MacBook Pro for its performance limitations and lack of legacy ports.

The special promotion, which amounts to a $349 price cut for the $1,299.95 monitor, brings the product‚Äôs price under $1,000. The company is also reducing the price on the 4K version from $699.95 to $524. Both products, designed in partnership between Apple and LG, are available on Apple‚Äôs online store, with the 4K model available now and the 5K model going on sale next month. Apple‚Äôs 5K monitor is now less than $1,000 In addition to these display promotions, Apple is temporarily reducing the cost of its many USB-C adapters now that the new MacBook Pro only contains Thunderbolt 3 ports. In a statement, the company said it recognized that many professionals rely on legacy ports and older devices, and that the price cuts would stay in effect until the end of the year. ‚ÄúWe recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem,‚Äù Apple said. ‚ÄúThrough the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables.‚Äù - Via: MacRumors - Source: Apple.com More From The Verge A Tribe Called Quest‚Äôs new album is tear-jerking, essential protest music Watch Dogs 2 is exactly what the original game should have been MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future Microsoft is bringing Visual Studio to the Mac Google Play Music gets a total overhaul Mossberg: New MacBook Pro is a fast, slim tweener Now Trending MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future This NES Classic Edition teardown shows off a simple gaming system Over 300 million AdultFriendFinder accounts have been exposed in a massive breach This Article has a component height of 7.

Share Adjust Comment Print You could use other varieties of apples but I‚Äôd stick with tart, firm ones. A scoop of vanilla ice cream would complete this old favourite. The from Bobette and Belle cookbook by Allyson Bobbitt and Sarah Bell. ‚Äî Mia Stainsby Apple filling: 14 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, sliced 1/4-inch thick 1 tbsp (15 mL) lemon juice 1 1/2 cups (375 mL) granulated sugar 1/2 cup (125 mL) flour 1 3/4 tsps (9 mL) cinnamon 3/4 tsp (4 mL) salt 1/2 cup (125 mL) butter Crumble: 2 1/2 cups (625 mL) all-purpose flour 2 1/3 cups (580 mL) pecans, coarsely chopped 1 cup + 2 tbsps (250 mL + 30 mL) loosely packed brown sugar 1 1/2 tsps (7.5 mL) cinnamon 1/4 tsp (1 mL) salt 2 cups large-flake rolled oats 1 1/2 cups (375 mL) cold, unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cues Preheat oven to 350 F.

Add to apples and toss to evenly coat. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add apple mixture, reduce heat to low and cook the apples, uncovered, stirring occasionally until they are tender and the sauce thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Spread the apples in an even layer in the prepared dish. Topping: In a large bowl, combine flour, pecans, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Add butter and work it in with your fingers until mixture begins to stick together in clumps and the butter pieces resemble coarse meal. Sprinkle the crumble evenly over apples.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (26) Post your comment Apple makes USB Type-C adapters cheaper until the end of the year 04 November 2016 Apple caused some controversy last week when it finally unveiled the new MacBook Pro models. None of the three laptops have any other ports aside from Thunderbolt 3 infused USB Type-C connectors and the 3.5mm headset jack. No SD card slot, no HDMI out, nothing like that. While USB Type-C may take over the world in the future, at this point in time you probably need a dongle or two, or three, to actually get some work done on your brand-spankin-new MacBook Pro. Sure, there are many of those around the internet, but what if you want to buy direct from Apple and not have any quality concerns? Well, good news then. The company is responding to the port-related backlash for its new MacBook Pros by cutting the prices of the USB Type-C adapters it sells before the end of the year. Here's the full statement from the company on the matter: We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables. If you're wondering how big those price cuts actually are, here are some examples. The USB Type-C to USB Type-A adapter is down to $9 from $19, the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter is $29 (was $49), the 1m USB Type-C to Lightning cable is $19 (from $25), the same cable but with 2m length now goes for $29 (from $35), and the multiport adapters are selling for $49 instead of $69. Apple is also discounting the third-party USB Type-C peripherals it sells. Take the SanDisk USB Type-C SD card reader - this is now priced at $29, down from $49. All of these things will be available for the new prices both online and in physical Apple stores.

The deals get you around 25% off¬†the newly announced displays made for the new MacBook and MacBook Pro models.¬† The new LG UltraFine 5K display is currently listed on Apple‚Äôs website for $974, down from an original listing price of $1299 when Apple first unveiled it at the MacBook Pro unveiling event late last month. The display isn‚Äôt yet available to order and is expected to become available sometime in December. A 4K version of the display has been discounted to $524 down from an original $699 list price and is available to order now with a shipping estimate of 5-6 weeks. The 5K display is compatible with and made specifically for Apple‚Äôs new MacBook Pros that come equipped with USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, while the 4K version will work with the¬†12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro via USB-C and likely older Thunderbolt 2-equipped Macs with an adapter. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro model is capable of driving one 5K display with a 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz, or two 4K displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz, while the 15-inch model can handle up to two 5K displays and four 4K displays. Earlier today Apple announced it would offer discounted pricing on a number of its own USB-C accessories as well as those it offers from third-parties through both its online and retail stores. Apple said the¬†limited time pricing will last through the end of the year. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile ¬´ India Plans to become a Global Hub for Cracking Encrypted Smartphones like Apple's iPhone | Main | Samsung's Laughable Quality Extends to Exploding Washing Machines as the U.S. Steps in forcing another Recall ¬ª November 04, 2016 Steve Ballmer is Still Haunted by Apple's Fast Lane Change into Smartphones that Devastated Microsoft Back in 2014 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Steve Ballmer Laughs no more at Apple's iPhone Revolution," that really struck a nerve as we looked back to 2007 when conceited Ballmer laughed and belittled Apple for entering the smartphone market. Ballmer stated that there was no chance that the iPhone was going to get any significant market share. No chance. It's a $500 subsidized item. They may make a lot of money. But if you actually take a look at the 1.3 billion phones that get sold, I'd prefer to have our software in 60% or 70% or 80% of them, than I would to have 2% or 3%, which is what Apple might get." I don't think that there's a moment in time that so defines a CEO being out of touch with the heartbeat of the market than that. Just yesterday we learned that Apple sucked the air out of the room when it came to smartphone industry profits in Q3, even though volume-wise they only held 12% of the smartphone market; So much for Ballmer's brilliance even years after his departure from Microsoft. ¬† In 2014, speaking at a Business School in Oxford, U.K., Steve Ballmer admitted that he would re-do the last ten years if he could. We would have a stronger position in the phone market today if I could re-do the last 10 years," he said. The answer, he said, is to pick up and try to catch the next wave." ¬† To this very day, Apple's fast lane change in 2007 still haunts Steve Ballmer who told Bloomberg that his missteps with the smartphone revolution strained his relationship with Bill Gates. ¬† Steve Ballmer told Bloomberg today that his decision to push Microsoft Corp. into the hardware business contributed to the breakdown of his relationship with long-time friend and company co-founder Bill Gates. Ballmer's only regret: not doing it sooner. ¬† "There was a fundamental disagreement about how important it was to be in the hardware business," Ballmer said. "I had pushed Surface. The board had been a little reluctant in supporting it. And then things came to a climax around what to do about the phone business." ¬† Ballmer said the mistake was getting into handsets and tablets too late. ¬† "I would have moved into the hardware business faster and recognized that what we had in the PC, where there was a separation of chips, systems and software, wasn't largely gonna reproduce itself in the mobile world," he said. For more on this read the full Bloomberg report here. ¬† At the end of the day, Ballmer contradicts himself and tries to rewrite history. In the 2007 interview that we quoted at the top of the report, he was clearly boasting about how smart Microsoft was having 60, 70, 80% of the software for phones compared to Apple's lowly 2 or 3% of smartphone hardware. ¬† Now we're to magically believe that he saw the light about getting into hardware at that time. No, no, no you didn't, Mr. Ballmer. You simply forgot what we remember exactly what you said back then, and your revision of history shows us the depth of how this still haunts you to this day; how Steve Jobs and Apple out-smarted you and left your company in the dust. ¬† About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple has slashed the price of dongles for the MacBook Pro Chris Mills BGR NewsNovember 4, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Facing significant backlash from consumers who faced a $250 dongle bill in order to upgrade to the courageous new MacBook Pro, Apple has cut the price of USB-C adapters across the board. The most necessary adapter, the USB-C to regular USB, has gone from $19 to $9. Even though it's only a drop in the bucket when you're spending upwards of $1,800 on a laptop, the price cut is at least an admission that the future is hard, and courage is expensive. DON'T MISS:¬†Don‚Äôt buy the crap T-Mobile (or anyone else) is selling In a statement to the¬†Wall Street Journal, an Apple spokesperson said that "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem." That's a nice way of saying "Wow, people are mad about this dongle thing." The price cuts are only temporary, and will last until the end of the year. They're applicable on all online orders and those in stores. It's still a surprise that Apple doesn't include any adapters in the box, especially after it threw a Lightning-to-3.5mm jack in with the iPhone 7. That move managed to minimize backlash against the decision to remove the 3.5mm jack, which is arguably a more controversial omission than regular USB ports from the new MacBook Pros. Cutting prices of dongles is probably not going to change many people's decisions about buying a new laptop. MacBook Pro shoppers probably aren't deterred by the extra $20 for an adapter, since they're already paying over the odds for the laptop to begin with. But it's a little bit of a concession to Apple's loyal customers, and gives you the feeling you're being screwed just a little bit less.

Trending in Apple Poll: What is your view of the all-USB-C ports on the new MacBook¬†Pro? November 4 AAPL: 108.84 -0.99 Opinion: From the enthusiast to the general consumer, Apple‚Äôs recipe for success has become¬†boring Edoardo Maggio - 1 week ago @northead Opinion Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit [First of all, I would like to say that this is but my very own take, which is not necessarily shared by my colleagues here at 9to5Mac and therefore not an editorial, staff-wise opinion piece. It represents my view and my view only, so try to keep that in mind.] Up until not too long ago, I used to ask myself a simple question: if I were to pick one company ‚Äî and one company alone ‚Äî to rely on for all of my ‚Äútech needs‚Äù, which one would I choose? The answer would come rather swiftly: Apple. As a critic (by nature more than profession) I have always seen the vast majority of products skeptically, but that didn‚Äôt take from the fact that the Cupertino giant made what I considered to be the best smartphone, the best tablet, the best computers and even two of the most valid operating systems around, accounting for a sweet, unified and well-connected package that would make me feel like I didn‚Äôt have to look outside of it. It was Apple‚Äôs dream of ecosystem lock-in, essentially. However, as my view of this universe has got¬†more and more panoramic ‚Äî especially in the last year of collaboration with the sister site 9to5Google, which has helped me a lot to gain even more direct experience with Apple‚Äôs competition ‚Äî I started to have a feeling that this bubble was somewhat bursting. And this feeling is something I simply haven‚Äôt been able to shake, and one that has brought me, like apparently many others, to think that the well-oiled profit machine Apple Inc. may have lost some of its touch, for what concerns the present and, more importantly, the future‚Ä¶ Apple has long been one of the giants that, thanks to its focus on hardware, managed to surprise and delight me; before I actually got into tech, I fell in love with iPods, which slowly got me into the magical world of Apple products. I remember vividly the day I unboxed my iPhone 5, and just how much ahead of the rest of the tech world that product was bringing me. From its famous introduction to my own unboxing and the first weeks of use, I just couldn‚Äôt believe how much I was loving that little thing. Less than a year later I finally caved in and bought a Retina MacBook Pro, the same machine I‚Äôm still typing this very piece on, and again couldn‚Äôt help but repeatedly fall in love with my gear¬†‚Äî and indeed, if you‚Äôre reading this piece right now, Apple‚Äôs efforts have played a big part in pushing me towards the lucky place I am in at this point in time. One thing I‚Äôm sure of, in fact, is that Apple is still incredibly competent and absolutely fantastic at what it does ‚Äî say what you say about its products or controversial moves, but there likely is no other company on Earth that has the influence of Apple, and I am actually thankful for their choice of taking the reins and doing things such as eliminating old technologies and springing us towards the future, no matter how inconvenient that transition may be. I do understand the users‚Äô complaints ‚Äî¬†more on that later ‚Äî but I also try to fit into Apple‚Äôs shoes, and there is a case to be made for doing what they‚Äôve done. I do not take issue with that. Again, looking at their lineup, it still strikes me how a relatively focussed ‚Äî albeit expanding ‚Äî portfolio of products still makes it possible to produce such incredible pieces of hardware: the iPhone 7 could still easily be considered the best smartphone around, the iPad Pros are great machines, the new MacBooks have a lot going for them, the 5K iMac‚Äôs display still makes my mouth water every time I go to a store and look at it, and hell, I absolutely love my little 6th gen. iPod touch. Apple Store in London‚Äôs Covent Garden I see more Apple products around than any other brand‚Äôs ‚Äî living in central London surely helps with this, but there‚Äôs no denying that the company‚Äôs reach is enviable, to say the least ‚Äî and I am fairly sure that a good chunk of its customers are extremely happy with their Apple-logoed machines. And yet, after all this sweet talking, I feel like I have to address the main issue highlighted in the title. And that is: Apple is boring. And let me get this straight: Apple isn‚Äôt just boring by its own standards, but it‚Äôs being trumped by other companies too, big time ‚Äî and often by names you most certainly wouldn‚Äôt expect. A few years ago ‚Äî two and a half, to be exact ‚Äî at their annual I/O developer conference, Google announced its new, company-wide design system to rethink not just how the design issue should be tackled within tech, but also how we should actually think of it. Material Design was (and still is) an incredibly ambitious, ongoing project, which for the first time put the search giant into that increasingly important conversation. While watching the keynote, I was simply stunned. I was very hyped when, just twelve months prior to that, Apple was to reinvent its software design with iOS 7, and while Ive‚Äôs introduction video became what I deem to be his masterpiece (because yes, of course Ive‚Äôs voiceovers are a thing) it was quickly turned into nothingness, kneeling before the scale of Google‚Äôs ambition. Indeed, Apple had long been a tech design keystone in both hardware (predominantly) and software (more or less), but seeing what Google was aiming at made Apple‚Äôs new software approach seem childish to my eyes. And, beware: I say ‚Äòchildish‚Äô not because of its execution ‚Äî¬†an entirely different matter ‚Äî but rather in its scope. From that moment on I started reading about this upcoming post-mobile ‚Äúcross war‚Äù between the two behemoths: is Google going to become good at design before Apple nails services? Almost 30 months later, I honestly feel like the answer to that question is yes. Material Design is not perfect, and as Google itself reminds us, it is ‚Äúnever done‚Äù, but seeing where the company ‚Äî and all of its products, starting with Android ‚Äî was just two years ago and where it is now is, in my opinion, nothing short of incredible. Consistency needs to be addressed, but in this short amount of time the Mountain View firm was capable of doing what many would have thought of as impossible, which is linking the words ‚ÄúGoogle Design‚Äù with ‚Äúgorgeous‚Äù. No, seriously, go take a look. On the other hand, Apple‚Äôs services have done wonders for the company, but none of them has had a truly identifiable ‚Äúwow‚Äù moment in my mind. Their biggest investment, Apple Music, has proved to be little more than just another music subscription service, and both iOS 8, 9 and 10 as well as the last three iterations of OS X/macOS have done very little to genuinely impress and enchant me. If anything, the one thing I was excited about ‚Äî 3D Touch ‚Äî is the one I have experienced less, as my go-to iOS device does not support it. All in all, each version of the two OSs has mostly looked like a game of very small and incremental catch-ups to me, which I‚Äôve come to realize increasingly more as I noticed that my usage of iOS and macOS was not being drastically altered. Which brings me straight to Apple‚Äôs stronghold: products. Remember the question I would ask myself all the time? That question‚Äôs changed. Now it‚Äôs more like: when was the last time that I was actually thrilled by an Apple product? And, much to my own dismay, the answer is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. It could perhaps be the 2015 12‚Äù MacBook, which indeed, for all its shortcomings, had something special to¬†it, but even that¬†would be a choice driven by exclusion rather than absolute, buzz-led certainty. Have you noticed that I haven‚Äôt mentioned the Watch even once so far? Such is its ‚Äòforgettability‚Äô, in my view. It‚Äôs a product that hasn‚Äôt caught my attention at launch and that I still don‚Äôt see much agitation around for, not even from Apple itself. It doesn‚Äôt really make the case for a compelling device, much less an essential one; something that Apple had always strived for. Perhaps at fault, but when the original iPad came out I did think ‚ÄúYes, I need this‚Äù ‚Äî or at least ‚ÄúI want this‚Äù. It was bold, and ambitious, and beautiful, and new. It was so very Apple. But that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case anymore. It particularly struck me when the iPhone 6s came out: somehow, even weeks after the announcement, my Twitter feed was filled with comments regarding that stupid pink color way more than the decidedly more interesting 3D Touch technology. Did Apple fail to communicate its importance? Or had we all rather become so numb not to actually expect anything from Apple given that it was an ‚Äús‚Äù model? Honestly, I don‚Äôt know. What I do know is that whatever magic used to be there has long been absent outside of Cupertino. You know who‚Äôs actually making great products? Microsoft. Yes ‚Äî the same Microsoft we‚Äôve all laughed at because of Internet Explorer or the buggy, crappy versions of Windows running on that fat, plasticky ‚Äî and now dusty ‚Äî black laptop somewhere in the corner of your room. Or, well, not exactly the same company, to be fair. Much like Google, 2014 saw a watershed moment for the Redmond mammoth, with the arrival of Satya Nadella and his more or less complete overhaul of the tore-apart, losing and clueless firm Steve Ballmer had left behind him. And oh boy, how much have they changed. But just for the sake of tying it in with Apple, I will simply recall the moment that has caught my attention the most: the iPad Pro introduction, and Apple‚Äôs essential bequest of the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù part to Microsoft. ‚ÄúThese guys know productivity,‚Äù admitted Schiller last year. And it‚Äôs sad to say, but it was one of the most memorable moments of Apple‚Äôs keynotes in recent years. After all, which product inspired its very creation? Microsoft has also gotten much more aggressive at Apple‚Äôs own hardware game, in fact: look at Surface. They may have not cracked it with the first iterations ‚Äî or, arguably, yet ‚Äî but the Pro 3 and Pro 4 are fantastic devices. Bold, ambitious, beautiful and new, dare I say. Rings a bell? And they almost certainly didn‚Äôt stop there. Look at the Surface Book: it may, again, not be the ‚Äúultimate laptop‚Äù Microsoft claims, but it certainly is a far more exciting one than Apple‚Äôs latest MacBooks. And yes, you guessed it ‚Äî the Surface Studio is again a more far-reaching and inspiring product than the iMac. Microsoft, it appears, is making a way better Apple-impression than Apple is. It‚Äôs now gotten to the point where Microsoft is seemingly addressing those customers that have long prayed at Apple‚Äôs altar, and that the company is now neglecting. The MacBook Pro is actually not a ‚Äúpro‚Äù machine, I hear them say. I read that just about over 100 times in 100 slightly different ways ‚Äî which is striking, to say the least. And bear in mind that all those complaints come from people who have actually used and loved Apple products likely much more than I have, and whose criticisms therefore have much more weight. But yes, even as a ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù Apple customer and lover, this saddens me. And as a more seasoned observer, I struggle to see cohesion: Tim Cook said that the iPad Pro eliminated the need for a PC. ‚ÄúNo, really, why would you buy one?‚Äù he said. But then Apple has come out with three new Pro laptops, the simpler of which is remarkably closer to the 12‚Äù MacBook than to its more powerful peers. And then the Air has been all but forgotten. Then¬†again, you also have the iPad Pro (two, in fact), with too many overlapping features and price points and not enough uniqueness to make me understand what exactly they want to be. Jobs put the iPad clearly in between the iPhone and the Mac; now everything seems blurry, confused. And this is only one practical example. Ironically, Microsoft‚Äôs ideas of a ‚Äòtablet that can also be a laptop‚Äô and a ‚Äòlaptop that can also be a tablet‚Äô make much more sense, because at least they run the same (great) operating system, and most of all know what they want to be. I‚Äôm not saying that they are necessarily better devices ‚Äî that still largely depends on your preferences and needs ‚Äî but trying to look at it just from an external perspective, I see the Surface lineup as the clear pinnacle of the current hardware game. Apple may still be a leader, but they sure aren‚Äôt the most forward-pushing innovator they were before. There is no doubt that Apple is still a company in great shape and with a lot of good going on for it. I am still faithful that something around the corner may at least bring some of that excitement back. There are so many uncharted territories for them, like VR, AR, AI-trailed products like Amazon‚Äôs Echo or Google Home ‚Äî and then god only knows what else, even leaving the rumored car out of the picture. But as things are right now, I feel like Apple has, at least partially, lost its way. I don‚Äôt understand whether the dissonance between its virtually endless (and growing!) customer base and their business decisions has made it so that enthusiasts simply couldn‚Äôt be their main target anymore, but recent products ‚Äî¬†be it because of their price, compromises or just better alternatives from other OEMs ‚Äî make me question whether even your average Joe is the ideal one. Next year‚Äôs major iPhone redesign could indeed bring some much-needed fresh air to the game, and I very much look forward to that ‚Äî and I still hope that much more is to come. Innovation and competition are the best thing this industry has to offer, and Apple can‚Äôt afford to battle¬†only at the box office. So please, Apple: stay hungry, stay foolish.

Nov 2016, 01:35 MEZ - Deutsche M√§rkte √∂ffnen in 7 Stunden 25 Minuten Apple is slashing prices on USB-C accessories amid complaints about the new MacBook ProVon Steve Kovach | Business Insider¬†‚Äì¬†Fr., 4. Nov 2016 20:15 MEZ Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken Firmen: Apple Inc. AKTUELLER KURS Symbol Kurs Ver√§nderung AAPL 105,71 -2,72 (The new MacBook Pro.AP) Apple is slashing prices on accessories that use the new USB-C standard in an effort to ease the transition to the new type of plug it added to the¬†redesigned MacBooks. The price cut is temporary. It starts now and will last¬†through the end of 2016. Many items are heavily discounted, and many¬†third-party accessories will be about 25% cheaper. (See the full list below.) Apple has also cut the prices of the new displays made by LG, which were designed to work with the MacBook Pro. The move comes as Apple faced harsh criticism from the professional community since the company introduced the new MacBook Pro a little over a week ago. Some are frustrated that Apple eliminated ports in the new MacBook Pro like standard USB and the SD card reader that many professionals¬†found useful. The MacBook Pro only has Thunderbolt 3 ports, which are based on the new USB-C standard and used for everything from video output to charging the computer. ‚ÄúWe are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we‚Äôve ever made. It has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage¬†and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to¬†provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility," an Apple spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.¬† "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition," the spokesperson added. "We want to help them move to¬†the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all¬†USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables.‚Äù (The new Thunderbolt 3 ports on the MacBook Pro.Steve Kovach/Business Insider) While just about everyone agrees USB-C is the future, we're stuck in a transition period, which means you'll have to use new cables, adapters, or dongles to use your older accessories with the new MacBook Pro. The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern even¬†devoted a whole column to the fact that dongles will be part of our reality as we transition to USB-C on computers and wireless audio on mobile devices. The price cuts for first-party accessories made by Apple will be available at the Apple Store, Apple's online store, and some third-party retailers. You're limited to five first-party accessories at a discount. Third-party accessories will be available at the Apple Store and Apple's online store. You'll be limited to three third-party accessories at a discount. Here's a list of the price cuts: First-party accessories USB-C to USB adapter: from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter: from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning cable, 1 meter: from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning cable, 2 meters: from $35 to $29 USB-C digital AV multiport adapter: from $69 to $49 USB-C VGA multiport adapter: from $69 to $49 Third-party accessories SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C reader: from $49 to $29 Other third-party USB-C peripherals: about 25% off LG displays LG UltraFine 5K display: from $1,299.95 to $974 LG UltraFine 4K display: from $699.95 to $524 NOW WATCH: Here‚Äôs your first look at the ‚ÄòTouch Bar‚Äô ‚Äî the biggest change coming to the MacBook Pro More From Business Insider 5 cheaper and better alternatives to Apple's expensive new MacBook Pros Here's why Apple kept the headphone jack in the new MacBook, but not the new iPhone Apple is testing a different screen technology that would make future MacBook Pros look even better TRADING PLATFORM Jetzt handeln Leistungsstarke Handelsplattform von einem Marktf√ºhrer.

Depending on the model, the MacBook Pro features to two to four Thunderbolt 3 enabled USB-C ports and a single 3.5mm headphone jack. While USB-C presents several advantages over the old USB-A standard, most people do not own peripherals that connect to a computer via USB-C. As result, for all but the most tech savvy consumer, buying a new MacBook Pro means also buying a number of adapters to make their old peripherals and accessories play nice with Apple‚Äôs new top-of-the-line laptop. Given the cost of Apple‚Äôs first-party accessories, the cost of an already expensive computer can quickly escalate when one factors in the cost of several dongles. In a surprise turn of events, Apple announced today that, effective immediately, it‚Äôs reducing the price USB-C adapters it sells through its online U.S. store and retail locations. ‚ÄúWe recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple‚Äôs USB-C adapters and cables.‚Äù We‚Äôve reached out to the company if the offer extends to Canadian consumers. We‚Äôll update this article once we hear back from the company. Stay tuned. Update 07/11/16: Apple has started automatically crediting customers who purchased the products prior to the price reduction announcement. 9to5Mac published a screenshot from a reader stating that the company would refund them the difference between the price they paid for a USB-C to Lightning Cable and the new, lower price. MobileSyrup has reached out to Apple for confirmation that the company will be doing the same for buyers in Canada. Given the fact that the deal is¬†already live north of the border, it seems likely. Update 04/11/16: Special pricing for USB-C accessories¬†has launched in Canada. Examples include a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter for $35 CAD, USB-C to USB adapter $10 and the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter got $59. Update 04/11/16: Apple just got back to us. The company will reduce the price of the USB-C adapters it sells in Canada. Pricing hasn‚Äôt been finalized just yet, but we‚Äôll update this article as soon as the new prices are live on the Apple Store website. Related:¬†MacBook Pro 2016 Hands-on: A future without function keys ViaThe Verge Jaycap4 Which I assume means orders of the MacBook Pro aren‚Äôt what they anticipated and are now scrambling. Brad Fortin They‚Äôve already announced that the new MacBook Pro is outselling any previous MacBook Pro, so you‚Äôre wrong on that one. Captain Henry Morgan I think people waited out for this model to come out. I am just disappointed that they don‚Äôt have card slot. At least give us a microSD slot. thomas nguyen Obviously SD card is old and obsolete, hence why it‚Äôs no longer available. If you need to use legacy technology, buy their accessories. beyond How is it old and obsolete if people are still using it today, and it‚Äôs widespread in the camera industry. Brad Fortin VGA is also old and obsolete but people are still using it today. Cars that run on leaded fuel are also old and obsolete but people still use them today. Just because something‚Äôs obsolete doesn‚Äôt mean everyone‚Äôs stopped using it. beyond Nice try, SD cards aren‚Äôt exactly obsolete. They are still in general use by photographers and nothing has really replaced them yet as the standard storage medium for DSLR images. Brad Fortin CompactFlash is also a contender for photographers, so why should a laptop that includes one not include the other? Also, why do cameras still rely so heavily on external storage? Why can‚Äôt cameras have large amount of internal storage like a phone, with a fast wired connection like USB-C and/or a fast wireless connection like 802.11ac? Some would argue that it‚Äôs because removable storage allows photographers to quickly unload one set of images to start taking another set but a fast wireless connection could offload those pictures *as they‚Äôre being taken* with the internal storage simply being used as a buffer. Continuing to rely on SD cards is just a lazy way for camera manufacturers to not have to invest in better file transfer methods. beyond I don‚Äôt know why CompactFlash were not included, maybe because they are too big compared to SD, maybe because they are not as popular, or the fact CF cards have bendable pins making the easy to damage etc etc. The real reason may be that consumer level cameras only include SD card slots, whereas more expensive pro level cameras include both CF and SD card slots. Consumer market always has the greater number of users so that could very well be enough to justify using an SD slot over CF. They are simply more ubiquitous compared to CF. Regardless we have a removable storage medium that serves the same function as film did. Cameras could have internal storage, but how do you know what capacity to include that will satisfy all users? Without a way to increase that storage on the fly, you risk some users running out of space. I suppose you could just make a camera with the largest possible size SSD available and hope its good enough for all users, but then how much is this storage going to increase the product cost? It will cost too much for some users, but then the solution is to create each camera model with different internal storage sizes like Apple does with their phones. But users who can only afford the smaller capacity camera will be restricted by the number of photos they can take before they need to transfer them off the device. And say there was some new wireless technology we could use to transfer images off the camera quickly and easily. Where is the user going to upload them to if they have no receiving device nearby? What if the user is on a backpacking trip? Where do you expect them to offload the images? Or are you just going to tell them tough luck, no more photos for the remainder of your trip. Sure you might say SD cards are also fixed in size and if the user didn‚Äôt bring enough with them on a trip they would also run out of space. This is true, but the user removable storage is always the better option because the user can decide for himself what is good enough for their scenario. Starting with an equal amount of storage, one fixed, one removable, the removable one wins because you can increase it by replacing it with something bigger, or add to it (using two or more in tandem). With fixed you can‚Äôt do either of those things. And manufacturers aren‚Äôt being lazy they are being realistic by using whatever cost effective technology we have that works best today. Brad Fortin ‚ÄúI suppose you could just make a camera with the largest possible size SSD available and hope its good enough for all users, but then how much is this storage going to increase the product cost?‚Äù People who complained about Apple ‚Äúonly‚Äù including 8 GB or 16 GB would regularly go on about how cheap storage is compared to the rest of the device and that the cost increase would be negligible, so surely that same logic applies to camera companies? ‚ÄúIt will cost too much for some users, but then the solution is to create each camera model with different internal storage sizes like Apple does with their phones. But users who can only afford the smaller capacity camera will be restricted by the number of photos they can take before they need to transfer them off the device.‚Äù Then do what many Android OEMs are doing: Include enough internal storage for most people to get by and include the option for expandable storage for people who need more. ‚ÄúAnd say there was some new wireless technology we could use to transfer images off the camera quickly and easily. Where is the user going to upload them to if they have no receiving device nearby? What if the user is on a backpacking trip? Where do you expect them to offload the images? Or are you just going to tell them tough luck, no more photos for the remainder of your trip.‚Äù If a good wireless option existed then a market for portable wireless storage would follow. 2 TB laptop drive in a tough enclosure in the backpack, in the spot where you would normally keep all the extra SD cards. ‚ÄúStarting with an equal amount of storage, one fixed, one removable, the removable one wins because you can increase it by replacing it with something bigger, or add to it (using two or more in tandem). With fixed you can‚Äôt do either of those things.‚Äù Again, external storage is a viable solution. ‚ÄúAnd manufacturers aren‚Äôt being lazy they are being realistic by using whatever cost effective technology we have that works best today.‚Äù It is being lazy because better solutions have existed for years. Imagine if Apple or an Android OEM was shipping flagship phones today with only 8 GB of storage and told users ‚Äúwe think keeping all your stuff on an SD card is the best solution, and it‚Äôs cost-effective for us‚Äù? Heads would roll. beyond What better solutions? You haven‚Äôt named one better solution that ‚Äòactually makes sense‚Äô from a user point of view. Your full of assumptions, oh this is going to work if only they included this technology, and that is going to work if they include that technology. Piece of cake right? Wrong. There‚Äôs more to a product than just throwing a bunch of technologies together. And you‚Äôre totally ignoring that. But keep dreaming, maybe you can fund one of your ideas on KickStarter. And by the way your wireless external hard drive solution is terrible for so many reasons. You can figure them out yourself since you seem to have an answer for everything. Peace, and I‚Äôm out. Omar But obsolete literally means something isn‚Äôt being used anymore. Selling a laptop for $1000+ with only two or four (of the same) ports ‚Äì and then selling adapters for other ports ‚Äì is nothing but a money grab. There‚Äôs no way to justify it. Brad Fortin There‚Äôs a very simple way to justify it: Having a variety of ports that aren‚Äôt used by customers is an incredible waste of internal (and logic board) space, which is at a premium in portable devices. Having a small number of incredibly versatile ports is a much more efficient use of internal space. Omar Nah, a versatile port is one that doesn‚Äôt need five different adapters (each sold separately) to do basic functions. And you‚Äôre reasoning doesn‚Äôt make sense when you consider how Apple decided to use an overly large touchpad. So much for saving space. Brad Fortin What you‚Äôre describing is a single-use port, which has no versatility. A versatile port is one that can serve multiple functions, such as charging, data transfer, video output, etc, exactly like Thunderbolt 3 can, and with its 40 Gb/s it can do more things than any other port available, making it the most versatile of any port. My reasoning makes perfect sense: With a smaller trackpad the palm rest area is wasted by not having a function. With a larger trackpad, like on the new MacBooks Pro, more of the surface area can be functional, thus making more efficient use of the space. You don‚Äôt seem to understand that the interior and exterior of the device will be optimized in different ways, betraying a certain level of ignorance on your part. thomas nguyen well read the rest of the comment trail, as you can tell, this is a sarcastic response to the one I replied with. Brad Fortin They looked at the usage stats of the SD card and not enough people used it for them to consider keeping it around worthwhile. mwahahahaha No. They looked at the profit they would make by excluding user expandable memory and based their decision on that. Brad Fortin You clearly have no idea how Apple operates. beyond Hahahaha good one! Apple operates for one sole purpose ‚Äì profit. Brad Fortin You‚Äôre really showing your ignorance. beyond Personal attack aside, care to enlighten us? Brad Fortin Time for a brief history lesson: Apple used to operate solely for profit, those were the Sculley, Spindler, and Amelio years. Once Jobs returned as CEO he realized that operating solely for profit was a terrible idea and would always result in the kind of mess Apple found itself in in the mid-90‚Äôs. So instead he decided to focus on great products that people actually wanted, and soon after realized that people were much more willing to pay for great products with decent margin than terrible products with huge margins or decent products with terrible margins. In many interviews over the years he stated it pretty simply: Build great products people are willing to buy and the profits will follow, without any need to focus on profits. For nearly 20 years they‚Äôve kept the same 30-40% gross margin and 15-20% net margin (a few points more margin in recent years now that they have enormous economies of scale working in their favour), not focusing on the profits but instead on the products. One of the best ways to focus on the product is to study how they‚Äôre used and how they‚Äôre expected to perform. To figure out how they‚Äôre used most companies would send out surveys or have study groups, but Apple focuses more on usage statistics (that dialog box that pops up during any Apple device setup that asks if you want to send diagnostic info to Apple). In the case of SD card slot, not many people were using it and they could make better use of the space on the logic board so they took it out. If you need any more evidence of just how stringently they study the usage stats, take the fourth-gen AppleTV as an example: As they approached the release date the engineers realized they weren‚Äôt going to be able to ship all features in time for launch and had to decide which features to postpone. So, as Apple is wont to do, they looked at the usage stats and they found that only a small number of customers used Bluetooth keyboards. However, they noticed that the number of Bluetooth keyboard users dropped down to almost 0 during WWDC, which meant that the vast majority of Bluetooth keyboard users were developers and leaving that feature out of the launch would have a minimal effect on customers. Now apply that same approach to any other feature that Apple‚Äôs ever removed and you‚Äôll see they knew exactly what they were doing and exactly how many people would be affected. Or did you think they just did things at random without any insight? MatroXX It‚Äôs still a gimped laptop, and I‚Äôm not talking about MacOS. They‚Äôre using year old Skylake SOC, should be the 7th gen Kaby Lake intel processors for a ‚ÄúPro‚Äù computer. And memory maxes out at 16GB!? Common. Pro is dead at apple. Brad Fortin The only Kaby Lake chips available are the low-power and ultra-low-power 4.5 W and and 15 W chips, which are only available in dual-core configs. Hardly fitting for a ‚ÄúPro‚Äù computer, don‚Äôt you think? Memory maxes out at 16 GB because that‚Äôs the maximum amount of LPDDR3 RAM supported by Skylake, LPDDR4 RAM isn‚Äôt supported by Skylake, and Kaby Lake also maxes out at 16 GB of LPDDR4 RAM. The only way to get 32 GB of RAM is to use desktop RAM, but then you go from 10 hours of battery life to 2 hours of battery life, and if you‚Äôre going to be tethered to a wall due to poor battery life you might as well get a portable desktop. Have you seriously done no research on this? BetelgeuseOrion have you done any research? the MBP13 comes with a pitiful i5 6360U dual core cpu, running at 2.0GHz for $1900, hardly fitting for a ‚ÄúPro‚Äù computer Go to CPU website ark (dot) intel (dot) com you will see the i5-6360U supports 32GB of ram, it can use either DDR4 OR DDR3L but not DDR3. the 1.5v of DDR3 is not supported. it will support 2 memory ch for a max bandwidth of 34.1GB/s Both the 6360u and the i7-7500u is designed for a 15W TDP Envelope so there is no reason why they could use a kabby lake proc in the mbp13 if they used an Intel i7-7500U and DDR4 ram it would use less power and have a longer battery life, less heat, as well as better performance all around. Brad Fortin The i5-6360U supports 32 GB of RAM, but don‚Äôt forget to read Intel‚Äôs own note: ‚ÄúDependent on memory type‚Äù. As in, not all memory types will be supported up to 32 GB, and in this case the memory type that goes up to 32 GB is desktop-class DDR4, not mobile-class LPDDR3. I guess you forgot to read that part. If they used an i7-7500U and DDR4 RAM they‚Äôd be in the same boat as if they used the i5-6360U with DDR4 RAM: It‚Äôs desktop RAM, not laptop RAM. Battery life would suffer significantly, and there would be even more outrage that the MacBook Pro went from 10 hours of battery life to 2-3 hours of battery life. ‚ÄúBut just make the battery bigger‚Äù you might say, but the maximum allowed size for a lithium-ion battery on flights is 100 Wh, which would only increase the battery life to 4-5 hours, which is still less than half that of the previous generation. Not to mention that desktop RAM in a laptop would increase the thermal envelope, requiring bigger and noisier fans, bigger and noisier than the previous generation, which would cause even more outrage. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve totally thought this through. BetelgeuseOrion lol what are you talking about, desktop ddr4? look at any gaming laptop with DDR4, look at any T series lenovo laptop with a 7th gen cpu and ddr4 ram, the laptop im on right now the MSi GS43VR, they are all using 260pin ddr4 SODIMM laptop ram desktop ddr4 is 288pin and is a hellva lot longer, it wont even fit in ultra books. notebookcheck (dot) net/MSI-GS43VR-6RE-Phantom-Pro-Notebook-Review.172721.0.html look at the first picture with the cover off, notice its laptop ram DDR4 2400MHz, that notebook has the exact same GPU as the top end 15MBP. have you been using macs so long you dont even know what ram looks like anymore? Graham Fluet But why does it need to be a <15W cpu? This is a "Pro" computer, not a netbook wannabe. Brad Fortin The entry-level 13‚Ä≥ Pro is meant to be more of an Air replacement, but it‚Äôs still a very capable CPU, the SSD is still blazing fast, the screen is still incredible, and all the rest of the Pro specs are there. Netbooks use the 4.5 W processors, like what‚Äôs in the MacBook. Graham Fluet But why do we need an Air replacement? We want a real Pro computer! Brad Fortin That‚Äôs what the models with the touch bar are for. The 13‚Ä≥ with Touch Bar goes up to the 28 W i5/i7, and the 15‚Ä≥ with Touch Bar goes up to 45 W i7. BetelgeuseOrion ill need to see actual sales figures for that, just trusting apple in what they say is probably the worst thing you can do, they have been caught lying straight out and lawsuits have resulted. Brad Fortin Alright, wait for the quarterly results. It‚Äôs only 3 months away. Also, which ‚Äúlying straight out‚Äù have they been caught in that lawsuits have resulted from? References? FlamesFan89 Order within the next 15 minutes, and we‚Äôll throw in a second adapter (which yer gonna need sucka) for no extra charge! Just pay separate shipping and handling! Operators are standing by to take your order! Laer My thoughts exactly. Brad Fortin Except they‚Äôve already announced that the new MacBook Pro is outselling any previous MacBook Pro, so that assumption is wrong. Bob Loblaw They‚Äôre lying to keep their stupid sheeple happy. Brad Fortin The truth hurts so badly that you‚Äôre calling them liars? That‚Äôs rich. beefmoretti Is there anyone in charge of proofreading at MobilSyrup? Raj Singh Try proofreading your own work whilst criticizing others. beefmoretti There‚Äôs a difference between a typo and plain bad grammar. Laer Both reduce readability, so no, there isn‚Äôt. Just your wounded ego on the line. Can‚Äôt Fix Stupid They don‚Äôt own the new Apple typo to USB-C adapters now for $59. beyond Yes we the readers are in charge! Raj Singh They ‚Äúrecognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done.‚Äù That‚Äôs mirthful. Captain Henry Morgan but they don‚Äôt give a S because people buying their accessories will only increase their revenues. Raj Singh They want to help you during this time of transition. It‚Äôs all about making life easier for you whilst at the same time accelerating growth of this new ecosystem. Captain Henry Morgan I‚Äôll be using a MBP with 15 different adapters. Maybe in few years, I need to check in another luggage just for my MBP accessories that i can use for my business trip. Can‚Äôt Fix Stupid That‚Äôs called courage. Brad Fortin It‚Äôs called putting your money where your mouth is. Mr_Smoosh Too bad they didn‚Äôt realize it while they were designing the machine. Guess they have no pros there. Can‚Äôt Fix Stupid While Tim Cooks arrogance knows no bounds‚Ä¶this is a rare almost acknowledgement they FD up. But again ‚Äúhelp you in your transition of what we decided is best for you‚Äù The Apple sheep analogy has been solidified and cemented by this debacle. Scott Blakula that‚Äôs courage Bob Loblaw They‚Äôll still be overpriced to sh!t in Canada. Brad Fortin That‚Äôs the exchange rate for you. FTR_Part_deux And they got rid of the TOSLINK connection too! I used it for my audio devices, but switched to USB. I‚Äôm going back to TOSLINK just because they said no many people use them. tdotpawel The updated prices have been live on Apple‚Äôs Canada website for the last few hours already. For example USB-C to USB adapter was $25 before and is now $10 (I also did price match on this in best buy to get it down to $8.50+tax). These prices are good until December 31st, 2016 base on the footer note on apple‚Äôs website. Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter ‚Äì $35.00 (was $59.00) Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter ‚Äì $59.00 (was $99.00) Apple USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter ‚Äì $59.00 (was $99.00) Apple USB-C to Lightning Cable, 1m ‚Äì $25.00 (was $35.00) Apple USB-C to Lightning Cable, 2m ‚Äì $35.00 (was $49.00) Apple USB-C to USB Adapter ‚Äì $10.00 (was $25.00) Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Cable, 0.5m ‚Äì $29.00 (was $39.95) Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Cable, 2m ‚Äì $59.00 (was $79.95) Belkin USB-A to USB-C Cable (USB 3.1) ‚Äì $26.00 (was $34.95) Belkin USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter ‚Äì $29.00 (was $39.95) Belkin USB-C to USB-C Cable (USB 3.1) ‚Äì $26.00 (was $34.95) Belkin USB-C to Micro-B Cable (USB 3.1) ‚Äì $26.00 (was $34.95) Belkin USB-C to VGA Adapter ‚Äì $33.00 (was $44.95) Belkin USB-C to Mini-B Charge Cable (USB 2.0) ‚Äì $18.00 (was $24.95) SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C Reader ‚Äì $52.00 (was $69.95) LG UltraFine 4K Display ‚Äì $659.00+tax (was $879.95+tax) LG UltraFine 5K Display ‚Äì $1274+tax (was $1699.95+tax) samsvoc These prices just goes to show, Apple has been ripping people off. A Digital AV adapter was selling for $99 and lowered to $59. Apple‚Äôs still making money with the lower prices. What a Joke. BetelgeuseOrion Look up thunderbolt cable prices on apple‚Äôs website, one of the cables was $1200 Brad Fortin You mean the 200-foot Corning optical Thunderbolt cable? Other websites are charging $1500-$1700 for the same cable. Even the cheapest price on Amazon is $1300. It‚Äôs not Apple charging an arbitrary amount for the cable, the cable is just that expensive. Maybe do some homework before trying ‚Äúfoul‚Äù? The Iceman Cometh Yeah but in fairness they exist to make money. Not offer up garage sale prices because you may think it‚Äôs too expensive. You can never really fault a company looking for a healthy profit margin NoWayHosEH Remember this comment when you complain about the big 3 pricing‚Ä¶.. a healthy profit is one thing and people understand but gouging is rediculous especially when big corps pay so little in tax on those gouging profits. Brad Fortin Apple‚Äôs been making 20% margin on their hardware for years. That they‚Äôre dropping the price by up to 40% means they‚Äôre willing to sell the adapters with next-to-no-or-negative margin. They‚Äôre serious about Thunderbolt 3/USB-C being the future, and they‚Äôre putting their money where their mouth is. Brad Fortin Well, there go all the arguments that Apple was doing this as a cash-grab. Of course, people will still obnoxiously complain anyway, even though we‚Äôve been here before with the original iMac going USB-only, ditching optical drives, moving from VGA to DVI to HDMI, moving from FireWire to Thunderbolt, etc. Captain Henry Morgan LOL I love when Brad comes to defend his Apple. Have a good weekend, Brad. Keep it coming!!! Brad Fortin Looks like the whiners have arrived! BetelgeuseOrion a cash grab is just that, you have to pay more for standard functionality. Brad Fortin VGA and SCSI used to be considered ‚Äústandard functionality‚Äù at one point, too. Does that mean all machines that don‚Äôt still include those ports are a cash grab? Absolutely not, that‚Äôs absurd. BetelgeuseOrion im talking today, current standards, HDMI, Mini Display Port, SDXC, Gigabit Ethernet, USB-A 3.1 all of those are standard in 2016 and all the way to 2020 at the very least, 2020 is probably when the MBP will be updated again. The TRS jack on the MBP (all models) is still there, a design from 1878, want to explain that one? and before you say wireless can supplement gigabit Ethernet, please direct me to at least 1 WAP and 1 WLAN Card that can support 115MB/s throughput stable because that is how much bandwidth i get each and every time i have to copy my rendered videos to my NAS. Brad Fortin Phil Schiller was actually asked about the headphone jack in an interview, the reason they kept it around is (wait for it) they looked at the usage statistics and noticed that a significant number of professionals still use the headphone jack for their work (although only a negligible number of people used the TOSLINK connection previously built into the jack, so they dropped that part). It‚Äôs almost as if they take a look at customers‚Äô usage habits and design their products around those usage habits. Would‚Äôve thought? (Smart people, that‚Äôs who, as in neither you nor any of the i****s voting on your comments.) Why would I say wireless can supplement gigabit ethernet when they have four Thunderbolt 3 connections, each with 40 times the throughput of gigabit ethernet? That‚Äôs a total of 160 times the bandwidth of gigabit ethernet. Clearly Thunderbolt 3 does a better job of replacing gigabit ethernet than wireless. Also, I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve noticed, but MacBooks Pro haven‚Äôt had gigabit ethernet since 2012. You‚Äôre about 4 years late to the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take away my ethernet‚Äù bandwagon. The Iceman Cometh Are on you Cooks payroll by any chance? Seems like you can‚Äôt brook any opposition to this company and no, the company isn‚Äôt fully listening to customers because if they did the SD card port would still be in that Macbook today. Wake up will ya pal! Brad Fortin Wake up, sheeple! thomas nguyen By excluding usb 3.0? Brad Fortin That port‚Äôs been around since the original iMac pioneered it back in the 90‚Äôs. It‚Äôs time to move on. Although I‚Äôm sure, for years to come, you‚Äôll still be able to find plenty of Windows machines that still have not only USB 3.0, but also USB 2.0 because OEMs are that incredibly cheap. Probably VGA, too. thomas nguyen Sure, so they remove all the ports that are ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù yet here they are sticking to it with the headphone jack that has been around since the mid 1990‚Äôs. Why keep anything legacy? The argument is that it is widely used now, so you should not remove it under the guise that it‚Äôs ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù or ‚Äúold‚Äù. Cameron Davidson Still a cash grab. Just less of one. David Rawlins It‚Äôs not the same thing though: If everyone (TV‚Äôs, Hard Drives, Mice, Keyboards, Projectors, Printers, Scanners, All the other peripherals that are too numerous for me to bother listing) switched to USB-C today, this instant, you‚Äôd still have legacy hardware that many people use and would like to/need to interface with for the next 5-10 years as those pieces of hardware got phased out. 1,2 and 3 year estimates for everyone to be using USB-C are just ridiculous. PC manufactures are already putting USB-C on many of their upper end laptops, which means it will likely make its way to the lower end in the next couple of years. But the BIG difference is that many PC‚Äôs will integrate 1 or maybe 2 USB-C ports onto their devices while still retaining ALL the other ports that are most popular today. If Apple had put 2 USB-C ports and left 1 USB-A, LAN, SD Card, and HDMI port on their machine this would have been a non-issue. Designing your laptop so that it will be convenient to use in 5-10 years is just goofy. Brad Fortin But if all OEMs continue to include legacy ports alongside new ports then peripheral manufacturers have little-to-no incentive to move to the new ports. VGA is a perfect example of this: The majority of PC OEMs continued to include VGA support for more than a decade after better alternatives, DVI/HDMI/DisplayPort, became available and as a result many display and projector manufacturers continue to support it to this day despite the existence of much better alternatives. So while companies like Apple are moving on to Thunderbolt 3/USB-C other companies are still supporting a standard that‚Äôs approaching 30 years old and has no logical reason for still being around. David Rawlins No‚Ä¶ older technology just naturally gets phased out. That‚Äôs how it works. USB-C will become a firm standard (eventually) because it‚Äôs a better tech. 1 cable can handle Video, Audio, Data and Power (within limits). That‚Äôs awesome. It‚Äôs a major selling point and certain peripherals will move to it right away. (External hard drives with the data transfer capabilities) Monitors will start adopting it soon I would think as a dual option soon. Much as it was VGA + DVI + HDMI. You‚Äôll likely start seeing USB-C + HDMI. As it becomes more of a standard due to those other two you‚Äôll see peripherals that don‚Äôt utilize any of the new benefits eventually move over. But because there‚Äôs no major selling point it will take longer. Again, if Apple included a couple of USB-C ports and then kept the rest of the useful ports people would have been much happier. As I said, even if everyone switched over today, you‚Äôd still have a ton of legacy hardware that will hang around for 5-10 years that people need to be able to connect to. Dongle dongle dongle. I personally love my MSI Ghost Pro Windows PC. But I‚Äôve seen many many Mac users (including my wife) so disgusted with this move that they‚Äôre going to move back over to Windows laptops. That‚Äôs a strong indication that that was the wrong move. The above price reduction on all the Apple dongles shows that Apple is aware of it and is trying to mitigate this issue. I personally think it‚Äôs too late for that. Too many people are ticked off. I mean people can‚Äôt even connect their iPhone 7 to their 2016 MacBook ‚ÄúPro‚Äù without an adapter. lol Brad Fortin A lot of people are upset and threatening to switch to Windows PCs, but Phil Schiller also said in an interview that they‚Äôve received more orders for the new MacBook Pro than for any previous MBP, so there‚Äôs people going both ways on this. People can‚Äôt connect their iPhone 7 to their MacBook Pro but Apple doesn‚Äôt really care because they‚Äôve had iTunes WiFi sync and iCloud syncing for years, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre well aware of just how few people still connect their phone to their computer. Jo Oh this is getting even funnier by the day Shoey5 It‚Äôs a dongle good time! fruvous So much for Apple‚Äôs courage to stand up to those cheap consumers. Shoey5 Hey it took Courage to drop the price! The Iceman Cometh If Jobs were around today heads would be rolling off the guillotine because of this ckusterfvck. This has become Apples version of the Samsung Note 7 debacle Brad Fortin This exact thing happened under Steve Jobs, multiple times: When the iMac ditched all legacy ports and went all-in on USB-A, and when the iPod switched from FireWire to 30-pin, and again when they dropped FireWire for Thunderbolt, and again when they dropped the optical drive. How quick people are to forget the past when they want to rage on the internet. The Iceman Cometh The difference was their hardware worked consistently across all platforms be it Mac or iPod. The disjointed nature of the offerings now speaks to a crisis in the company at least within their design teams who seemingly are communicating with each other very well. FlamesFan89 Wait, are you saying that switching from one proprietary port to another is the same as ditching essentially all standard ports? Also, there is a big difference between switching the connector for a single portable device which only has a single connection point, and switching all the ports on a device which is the main hub that you are connecting all other things too. You are essentially trying to say that changing the end of an AC adapter that plugs into random device X, is the equivalent of changing the standard wall socket. Brad Fortin Which of those ports, other than 30-pin, is proprietary? USB is a standard, IEEE 1394 (FireWire) is a standard, and Thunderbolt is a standard. Or are you just complaining about my comparison to the iPod switching from FireWire to 30-pin? FlamesFan89 To be honest, I‚Äôll concede that I was thinking FireWire and Thunderbolt were proprietary, basically because I‚Äôve never really paid much attention to them, and really only ever heard about them except in reference to Apple stuff. I just figured that they were Apple things. I stand corrected. Cameron Davidson So they cut the headphone jack out of your phone, using the BS excuse that it will improve sound quality, and then use the headphone jack for the computer that musicians actually make their music on. Apple logic! Brad Fortin They cut the headphone jack out of the phone to make it easier to waterproof, put in a bigger battery, put in a better haptic engine, put in a better camera, and put in stereo speakers. They never even mentioned audio quality, so why are you making stuff up? They kept the headphone jack on the laptop because of how many professionals still use it for their work (but removed the TOSLINK portion because of how few people used it). Cameron Davidson Except that every other device manages to do this as well as have a headphone jack, so you‚Äôre argument is useless. ‚ÄúWe are removing the audio jack because we have developed a better way to deliver audio‚Äù ‚Äì Phil Schiller Brad Fortin Every other device? No other device has a haptic engine comparable to the Taptic Engine. All other devices that have a headphone jack could have a larger battery without the jack. Not all devices have stereo speakers. Not all devices have waterproofing. Not all devices have OIS. Competing devices have some of those features, but none of them have all of those features. It‚Äôs all about picking which features you‚Äôre willing to compromise on. But, again, why are you making up the part about audio quality? Manveer Really, you do realize Sony was the first to make a waterproof phone without covering up the headphone jack? Well apparently, Sony Xperia‚Äôs had IP68 three years ago, stereospeakers, the Z2 has a 3200mAh battery with the headphone jack, not to mention high res audio with clear + audio, PS4 remote play, 23 MP G-lens camera, an ultra stamina mode with 1 week usage on standby, and lastly 5 axis stabilization. The Z5P even has 4K screen, with the most premium glass+metal body. So it‚Äôs clear who has the most features and who‚Äôs copying! Brad Fortin Sony‚Äôs first waterproof phone also had flaps covering all the ports, and if any of those flaps broke off (as many of them did) the phone was no longer waterproof. The stereo speakers were always welcome. The Z2 had a 20 MP camera, but the lens was plastic and easy to scratch. Ultra Stamina Mode disabled features that many people would consider essential, like data and WiFi, apps, widgets, etc, and basically reduces functionality to that of a flip phone. And Sony only recently started including OIS in its camera. Simply having a list of features doesn‚Äôt make a phone great. This isn‚Äôt a list measuring contest. Jason I always find it funny how a company can cut the price of something almost as soon as it comes out, it really shows how much they are making on those Brad Fortin Their typical margin on hardware is 20%, so dropping their prices by that much or more shows they care more about moving to Thunderbolt 3/USB-C as a standard than they do about making a profit from dongles. They‚Äôre putting their money where their mouth is. Paul T. On hardware yes. On cables and adapters? Typical markup is 100% if not more. thereasoner Several hundred percent in the case of the most expensive ones I‚Äôm thinking. FlamesFan89 So you are of the belief that it costs Apple approximately $30 to make a 1 m USB-C to Lightning cable? Well ok then. The VVolf Why wouldn‚Äôt Apple put 2 USB-C and 2 USB 3 ports on it? I have yet to see a single USB-C device around. Also, they removed the SD card, right? So much for catering to photographers. Tim Cooks Apple is a complete and utter joke. He should focus more on making better products and keep out of politics/social issues. Lemmy If you can afford a new MacBook Pro, you can afford to buy peripherals that use USB-C. Me Ted But what if you can‚Äôt? I guess that makes your comment a little ridiculous doesn‚Äôt it. jay USB C good move. why change no changes on the iphone than? just all in and everyone can plan. make sense? bye bye lightning port and usb a. just one fits all and everyone is happy ok we need to make one change but everything is future proof. headphone jack is a thing i honestly never missed it anymore. but i am not a heavy user dukiebc I remember in the late 90‚Äôs when Apple released the first iMac computer. It came with this new port named USB. All my printers were parallel port, and I had nothing that would hook up to it. That soon changed when the mainstream PC‚Äôs added USB ports, and the market exploded with USB compatible devices, printers, mice, hubs, disk drives, hard drives, etc. Once again, Apple is on the leading edge of the curve with USB-C. Since this is not a proprietary standard, I am sure the same thing will happen. David Pollock I would love to know what Apple is doing in places where a Mag-Safe power cord is mandatory due to regulations and law. I believe Europe is one such place. Also ‚Äì no LAN port? I am sorry, but I would be annoyed to the extreme to always have to carry around all of these dongles and adapters. It makes something that is supposed to be portable not so portable any longer. OMFCody Adaptors should have been included in the box, especially considering their brand new iPhone now needs another purchase to become compatible with the brand new Pro.. Until USB C became more common, they very well could have kept a couple spare ports (And the SD slot) around a little longer. If people don‚Äôt get by now Apple only cares about your money (soldering on RAM‚Ä¶etc) then you will never learn.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts ¬† ¬† Apple Watch Gets 8MP, 2MP Cameras Posted: Nov 4 2016, 1:04pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple ¬† ¬† This Apple Watch Band Adds 8MP, 2MP Cameras To The Apple Watch Many of us love the Apple Watch but find it a bit weird that Apple has not included any camera. Well for such people, the new Glide CMRA band is something to look out for. Don't Miss:¬†Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals Glide has made an attempt once again to bring another innovative Apple Watch band for us. Its latest addition is a ground-breaking watch band which has two cameras installed in it. There includes a 2MP front facing camera and an 8 MP outward-facing proposition. The most attractive feature of this watch band is that even after the inclusion of two cameras it is has not increased in bulk and size. The watch band also includes a built in button in accessory for activating the cameras. The button is an amazing feature. It carries out its job of snapping pictures perfectly. The integrated button also has a double tap function which allows the user to switch between cameras smoothly. The inclusion of the camera feature calls for a Photos app. This is why the band is integrated with iOS photos. Your captured images are stored immediately and can be viewed without any further hassle. Now taking photographs and the storage system does sound very impressive but the real power lies somewhere else. CMRA shows its supremacy when its ability to record video and host conference style video calls is observed. CMRA can be used by users to talk in real time while they are on the move and even send photos back and forth. The charging of this band is very simple. A custom dual-charging dock will be available to charge the Apple Watch battery and the CMRA band battery simultaneously. Spring 2017 is expected to be the date for hardware shipping. Glide however is accepting pre-orders for this accessory just to get orders way before launch and also to assess the consumer demand for the CMRA.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts ¬† ¬† Phil Schiller Explains Why Apple Dropped The SD Card Reader From The New MacBook Pro 2016 Posted: Nov 4 2016, 1:20pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Nov 5 2016, 9:46am CDT, in News | Apple ¬† ¬† Here‚Äôs Why 2016 MacBook Pro Has No SD Card Slot. Do you ever wonder why Apple chose to drop the SD slot in the new MacBook Pro but retained the 3.5mm headphone jack the company gave up in the iPhone 7. Well here is an answer for your lawful query. Don't Miss:¬†Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals We are very sure that the new MacBook Pro will be successful. The machine is innovative and the inclusion of the revolutionary Touch bar is enough to attract customers. Nevertheless there are some factors such as the removal of the SD slot which cause apprehension. Apple‚Äôs Senior Vice President Phill Schiller gave an interview recently and discussed some important details Apple has taken regarding the MacBook Pro 2016. He pointed out the reason behind the removal of the much loved SD card Slot. He also admits that the new MacBook Pro 2016 has caused some controversy not only for the features it has included but for functionality it has missed out on too. According to Phill, there are many fast USB card readers and you can use Compactflash as well as SD. Even though more cameras have SD, Apple chose to let go of it as a part of a trade off. It believes cameras are now moving towards wireless technology so Apple thought to move a step ahead. You can use a physical adapter or go for the wireless option instead. One important question raised by customers is that why has Apple kept the 3.5mm headphone jack which it has passionately removed in the iPhone 7? Phill replied to this that the MacBook is a ‚Äòpro‚Äô machine. Which means in this notebook the 3.55 headphone jack is not just used for connecting headphones. Pro audio gear such as amps and much more is used to connect with it. These answers seem to be satisfying. The MacBook Pro 2016 is certainly a spectacular machine and is doing well so far.

The new MacBook Pro only has USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports, so the vast majority of the peripherals people use today will need adapters to work. Someday, all those devices will likely use USB-C, but that day is not today and the Pro users interested in Apple‚Äôs new computers have been vocal about the problem. Apple released a statement explaining the price cut: "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sign that Apple recognizes these dongles are a hassle, and it seems to hope that reducing the prices on them will lessen the pain of this transition. Starting immediately, all of Apple‚Äôs USB-C adapters and some of its USB-C cables will have their prices cut by $6 to $20: USB-C to traditional USB adapter from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning cable (1 meter) from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning cable (2 meters) from $35 to $29 Multiport adapter with HDMI, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 Multiport adapter with VGA, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 Only USB-C charging cables aren‚Äôt being discounted. Apple is also cutting prices by around 25 percent on all third-party USB-C peripherals that it sells. SanDisk‚Äôs USB-C SD card reader is getting a slightly steeper discount, from $49 to $29. The discounted adapters will be available at Apple‚Äôs physical and online stores through the end of the year. It still has no plans to ship adapters in the box with the new MacBook Pro. ‚ÄúWe want to help [pros] move to the latest technology.‚Äù While it‚Äôs never been hard to find cheap USB-C adapters ‚Äî they‚Äôve always been plentiful on Amazon ‚Äî these price cuts will still be a big help for early buyers of the MacBook Pro. Apple‚Äôs cables, unlike those you might order from a random seller online, are going to be well-made and reliable. With their prices cut lower, it now makes sense to buy from Apple instead of a seller you don‚Äôt have experience with. The 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar is already on sale, and reviews have been coming out ‚Äî including our own ‚Äî critical of Apple‚Äôs decision to use USB-C ports exclusively, effectively mandating that buyers use adapters to get anything connected. Cutting adapter prices doesn‚Äôt solve the problem, but it does ease the transition, something that Apple ought to be doing since it‚Äôs the one pushing people headfirst into this change in the first place. Perhaps more important to Apple than any individual MacBook Pro review has been the mass of complaints on Twitter and various blogs from the very professionals who are supposed to buy these computers, with people saying that Apple isn‚Äôt meeting their needs. On one hand, Apple says that preorders for its new Pros are higher than for any prior MacBook. But on the other, it‚Äôs hard to imagine that inconveniences like this ‚Äî however minor ‚Äî won‚Äôt start to add up.

Photo by James Martin/CNET Those MacBook Pro dongles are now a lot cheaper. Apple on Friday cut the pricing for connectors for its MacBook Pro. The offer will run through the end of the year. Apple also lowered the price of the new LG displays announced last week by 25 percent. The LG UltraFine 5K display, will cost $974 when it becomes available in December, while the LG UltraFine 4K display will cost $524 through the end of the year. The new MacBook Pros, unveiled last week, removed the traditional USB and other ports in favor of USB-C. The move angered many power users and meant that people had to buy dongles to use their old equipment -- or even to plug their iPhone 7s into the new MacBooks. The MacBook Pro update, which also adds a Touch Bar instead of a touchscreen, was the first major design change made by Apple in over four years. Many creative professionals have long favored Macs for work, but Apple's changes to make its devices thinner and lighter by ditching traditional connectors could cause it to lose some customers.

Get over it MacBook Pro accessories you're going to want to check out now Apple has lowered pricing for dongles by as much as 52 percent, in the case of the USB-C to traditional USB adapter. That item previously retailed for $19 but now costs $9. Its priciest connectors, the USB-C VGA multiport adapter and the USB-C digital AV multiport adapter, were cut to $49 from $69. Apple said it will not include USB-C power adapters or the USB-C charge cable in the offer. "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition," Apple said in a statement. "We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables." Here are the full pricing details. For Apple branded adapters: USB-C to USB Adapter from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m) from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning Cable (2m) from $35 to $29 USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter from $69 to $49 USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter from $69 to $49 For third-party adapters and peripherals: SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C Reader from $49 to $29 All other third party USB-C peripherals about 25 percent off (that includes the LG displays) 60 Apple MacBook Pro swaps outdated function keys for Touch Bar Update at 3:30 p.m. PT: Adds info about LG display pricing.

(Apple) Share Written by Mike Murphy November 04, 2016 Just two weeks after unveiling a new slew of MacBook Pro laptops that only contain USB-C ports, Apple seems to be acknowledging that it may have tried to force its users into the future a little too soon. Today, Apple cut the price of the myriad adapters that it sells, according to Business Insider. Apple‚Äôs new computers have been criticized as being user-unfriendly for many of the professionals that use its computers. The old Pro models had an HDMI port, an SD card reader, four (regular) USB ports, a Thunderbolt port, and a MagSafe magnetic charging cable. Now, to hook up a TV screen, download photos from a camera, or connect just about any peripheral device made in the last decade, to the new MacBook Pro, you‚Äôll have to use an adapter that has a USB-C connecter on one end. Apple is cutting the price of some of its adapters by as much as 40%: Apple hasn‚Äôt explicitly admitted that it‚Äôs lowering adapter prices as a concession to the fact that its $1,500-and-up machines require an inordinate number of accessories to connect to devices that its old laptops connected to without problems. However, it does seem that the company is trying to make the transition to a USB-C (and wireless) life a little easier. Although some disagree: Right now Apple‚Äôs full set of MacBook adapters costs $266. This will drop to $184 for the next two months. Not much of an admission. ‚Äî Mark Gurman (@markgurman) November 4, 2016 And others wonder why some of these cables weren‚Äôt just included with the very expensive laptops. There‚Äôs recent precedent, too: When Apple released its iPhone 7 smartphones in September without a headphone jack, the company included a tiny adapter in the box so that its customers could still use their regular headphones, even though the new phone didn‚Äôt have a 3.5 mm jack built-in. WHY NOT JUST INCLUDE DONGLES IN THE BOX?! I'm over Apple charging $1,600 for a laptop and then nickle and diming us for the cables we need. https://t.co/CeDBdAfJVJ ‚Äî Geoffrey A. Fowler (@geoffreyfowler) November 4, 2016 Apple wasn‚Äôt immediately available to comment on the sudden price drop to Quartz, but told Business Insider in a statement: We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple‚Äôs USB-C adapters and cables. It‚Äôs worth noting that the price drop appears to only be through 2016, according to Business Insider, so make sure to get all your dongles and accessories for that new computer as soon as you can.

However, that doesn't necessarily hurt Apple. By Conner Forrest | November 4, 2016, 11:20 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/Pinkypills When it comes to the smartphone OS of choice around the world, Google's Android is the clear winner. According to new data from Strategy Analytics, Android commanded an 87.5% market share in Q3 2016, compared to Apple's 12.1% in the same time frame. In a press release announcing the findings, Linda Sui, a director at Strategy Analytics, said that overall smartphone shipments had grown to 375.4 million in Q3 2016. Sui also said in the release that this marked "the smartphone industry's fastest growth rate for a year." Of those total shipments, Android represented 328.6 million units, iOS represented 45.5 million units, and other companies accounted for 1.3 million units. For Android, this counts as 10.3% year-over-year growth, and -5.2% year-over-year growth for Apple. SEE: The state of mobile device security: Android vs. iOS (ZDNet) To explain what the overall market looks like now, Strategy Analytics executive director Neil Mawston said the following in the press release: "Android's gain came at the expense of every major rival platform. Apple iOS lost ground to Android and dipped to 12 percent share worldwide in Q3 2016, due to a lackluster performance in China and Africa. BlackBerry and Microsoft Windows Phone have all but disappeared due to strategic shifts, while Tizen and other emerging platforms softened as a result of limited product portfolios and modest developer support." The drop in Apple's iPhone sales is well-documented. In October 2016, Apple posted its first annual sales decline since 2001, driven in part by three consecutive quarters of falling iPhone sales and revenue.

An App Annie report from July 2016 claimed that, despite having half the number of app downloads as the Google Play Store, Apple's App Store generated twice the revenue. Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen said that Apple simply has a different strategy than Android when it comes to mobile. Android has a broader approach, while Apple's iOS primarily targets the high-end market, which limits its reach, Nguyen said. "I also don't expect them to move down market in any significant way," Nguyen said. "Looking across their history and portfolio of offerings, they've always differentiated by focusing on the high-end." Focusing on that high-end allows Apple to make more money in the margins, especially when it comes to storage upgrades, Nguyen said. But, that means they need to focus on selling customers on why their product is worth the extra money. Additionally, the Android ecosystem is dealing with its own problems. Woody Oh, a director at Strategy Analytics, said in the press release that Android's lead in the market looks "unassailable," and the software is still attractive, but a host of challenges remain. "The Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google's new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place," Oh said in the press release. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Android market share grew to nearly 88% in Q3 2016, according to data from Strategy Analytics. Apple's market share fell down to 12.1% in the same time, leading to the company's first drop in sales since 2001. Still, Apple's App Store makes more money than the Google Play store, despite having half as many downloads. Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Mobile Enterprise newsletter.

The MacBook Pro is meant to be a professional notebook, and as most accessories have not yet moved to USB-C, dongles are needed. Apple suggests today that they‚Äôve seen the need for this, and are therefore cutting costs to USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals throughout the Apple Store. ‚ÄúWe are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we‚Äôve ever made,‚Äù said the statement from Apple. SEE TOO: 5 reasons you should care about Thunderbolt 3 ‚ÄúMacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability, and compatibility.‚Äù Apple‚Äôs statement comes within days of the first announcement of the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro features 4x USB-C ports, able to accept power from a power plug, send video out, and transfer data, amongst other things. The problem with 4x USB-C ports is the lack of other sorts of legacy ports. It‚Äôs not a problem for everyone, but certainly for those power users that still have devices with older connectors. ‚ÄúWe recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition,‚Äù said Apple. ‚ÄúWe want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem.‚Äù As such, Apple will be ‚Äúreducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals [sold by the company], as well as the prices on Apple‚Äôs USB-C adapters and cables.‚Äù The date range for this discount in Apple Stores is October 27th, 2016 through December 31st, 2016. After that day, prices return to their normal place. SEE THIS: Pixel cords go ‚ÄúPro‚Äù while MacBook wavers USB-C to USB Adapter ($19) -$10 Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter ($49) -$20 USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter ($69) -$20 USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter ($69)-$20 USB-C to Lightning (1 m) ($25) -$6 USB-C to Lightning (2 m) ($35) -$6 Each other 3rd-party peripheral will have a slight discount depending on the device and the brand.

First it was the feeling that the Mac line including MacBook Pros weren‚Äôt being updated as often as, say, iPhones. A redesigned MacBook Pro helps resolve that with at least one member of the Mac family. But the new MacBook Pro goes all in on USB-C and drops legacy ports like standard USB-A, and many Mac users believe this move is too aggressive considering the cost attached to this transition. The good news is that Apple is listening and lowering the price of its USB-C adapters in an effort to ease the USB-A to USB-C transition, but you have to act fast‚Ä¶ Apple‚Äôs lineup of USB-C accessories¬†is changing in price starting now through December 31 with a few exceptions: USB-C to USB Adapter ($19 ‚Üí $9) Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter ($49 ‚Üí $29) USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter ($69 ‚Üí $49) USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter ($69 ‚Üí $49) USB-C to Lightning (1 m) ($25 ‚Üí $19) USB-C Charge Cable (2 m) ($19) USB-C to Lightning (2 m) ($35 ‚Üí $29) 29W USB-C Power Adapter ($49) 61W USB-C Power Adapter ($69) 87W USB-C Power Adapter ($79) While charging accessories are not dropping in price, Apple¬†is¬†discounting third-party USB-C accessories sold through its retail channels, including SanDisk‚Äôs $49 USB-C SD card reader which drops to $29. It‚Äôs unclear how this will affect sales for adapters that have been made recently, but I would advise following up with customer service if you‚Äôve made a purchase in the last week or two. [Update: Customers who made recent purchases appear to be receiving emails alerting them to credits.] Apple tells us that this is the reasoning for the change: ‚ÄúWe are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we‚Äôve ever made.

 Apple is slashing prices on USB-C accessories amid complaints about the new MacBook Pro Steve Kovach Nov. 4, 2016, 3:15 PM 19,791 facebook linkedin twitter email print The new MacBook Pro.AP Apple is slashing prices on accessories that use the new USB-C standard in an effort to ease the transition to the new type of plug it added to the¬†redesigned MacBooks. The price cut is temporary. It starts now and will last¬†through the end of 2016. Many items are heavily discounted, and many¬†third-party accessories will be about 25% cheaper. (See the full list below.) Apple has also cut the prices of the new displays made by LG, which were designed to work with the MacBook Pro. The move comes as Apple faced harsh criticism from the professional community since the company introduced the new MacBook Pro a little over a week ago. Some are frustrated that Apple eliminated ports in the new MacBook Pro like standard USB and the SD card reader that many professionals¬†found useful. The MacBook Pro only has Thunderbolt 3 ports, which are based on the new USB-C standard and used for everything from video output to charging the computer. ‚ÄúWe are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we‚Äôve ever made. It has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage¬†and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to¬†provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility," an Apple spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.¬† "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition," the spokesperson added. "We want to help them move to¬†the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all¬†USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables.‚Äù The new Thunderbolt 3 ports on the MacBook Pro.Steve Kovach/Business Insider While just about everyone agrees USB-C is the future, we're stuck in a transition period, which means you'll have to use new cables, adapters, or dongles to use your older accessories with the new MacBook Pro. The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern even¬†devoted a whole column to the fact that dongles will be part of our reality as we transition to USB-C on computers and wireless audio on mobile devices. The price cuts for first-party accessories made by Apple will be available at the Apple Store, Apple's online store, and some third-party retailers. You're limited to five first-party accessories at a discount. Third-party accessories will be available at the Apple Store and Apple's online store. You'll be limited to three third-party accessories at a discount. Here's a list of the price cuts: First-party accessories USB-C to USB adapter: from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter: from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning cable, 1 meter: from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning cable, 2 meters: from $35 to $29 USB-C digital AV multiport adapter: from $69 to $49 USB-C VGA multiport adapter: from $69 to $49 Third-party accessories SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C reader: from $49 to $29 Other third-party USB-C peripherals: about 25% off LG displays LG UltraFine 5K display: from $1,299.95 to $974 LG UltraFine 4K display: from $699.95 to $524 SEE ALSO: First impressions of the new MacBook Pro NOW WATCH: Here‚Äôs your first look at the ‚ÄòTouch Bar‚Äô ‚Äî the biggest change coming to the MacBook Pro Loading video...

The new MacBook Pro only has USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports, so the vast majority of the peripherals people use today will need adapters to work. Someday, all those devices will likely use USB-C, but that day is not today and the Pro users interested in Apple‚Äôs new computers have been vocal about the problem. Apple released a statement explaining the price cut: "We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple's USB-C adapters and cables.‚Äù It‚Äôs a sign that Apple recognizes these dongles are a hassle, and it seems to hope that reducing the prices on them will lessen the pain of this transition. Starting immediately, all of Apple‚Äôs USB-C adapters and some of its USB-C cables will have their prices cut by $6 to $20: USB-C to traditional USB adapter from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning cable (1 meter) from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning cable (2 meters) from $35 to $29 Multiport adapter with HDMI, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 Multiport adapter with VGA, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 Only USB-C charging cables aren‚Äôt being discounted. Apple is also cutting prices by around 25 percent on all third-party USB-C peripherals that it sells. SanDisk‚Äôs USB-C SD card reader is getting a slightly steeper discount, from $49 to $29. The discounted adapters will be available at Apple‚Äôs physical and online stores through the end of the year. It still has no plans to ship adapters in the box with the new MacBook Pro. ‚ÄúWe want to help [pros] move to the latest technology.‚Äù While it‚Äôs never been hard to find cheap USB-C adapters ‚Äî they‚Äôve always been plentiful on Amazon ‚Äî these price cuts will still be a big help for early buyers of the MacBook Pro. Apple‚Äôs cables, unlike those you might order from a random seller online, are going to be well-made and reliable. With their prices cut lower, it now makes sense to buy from Apple instead of a seller you don‚Äôt have experience with. The 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar is already on sale, and reviews have been coming out ‚Äî including our own ‚Äî critical of Apple‚Äôs decision to use USB-C ports exclusively, effectively mandating that buyers use adapters to get anything connected. Cutting adapter prices doesn‚Äôt solve the problem, but it does ease the transition, something that Apple ought to be doing since it‚Äôs the one pushing people headfirst into this change in the first place. Perhaps more important to Apple than any individual MacBook Pro review has been the mass of complaints on Twitter and various blogs from the very professionals who are supposed to buy these computers, with people saying that Apple isn‚Äôt meeting their needs. On one hand, Apple says that preorders for its new Pros are higher than for any prior MacBook. But on the other, it‚Äôs hard to imagine that inconveniences like this ‚Äî however minor ‚Äî won‚Äôt start to add up.

PT Written by Jim Dalrymple Apple on Friday cut the price on its USB-C adapters in the online store. The company also said that third-party USB-C peripherals in the store would be reduced in price. ‚ÄúWe are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we‚Äôve ever made,‚Äù Apple said in a statement provided to The Loop. ‚ÄúIt has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility. ‚ÄúWe recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple‚Äôs USB-C adapters and cables.‚Äù It‚Äôs obvious that pros looking to move to the new MacBook Pro will have to buy adapters to continue using the same gear. I‚Äôm in this position myself if I want to use my pro music gear, so having steep discounts on adapters will save me quite a bit of money. In looking at Apple‚Äôs decision to reduce the price of the adapters, I immediately thought of Phil Schiller‚Äôs comment in an interview earlier this week. ‚ÄúWe care about what they love and what they are worried about. And it‚Äôs our job to help people through these changes. We know we made good decisions about what to build into the new MacBook Pro and that the result is the best notebook ever made, but it might not be right for everyone on day one. That‚Äôs okay, some people felt that way about the first iMac and that turned out pretty good.‚Äù Schiller, and Apple, are taking the transition responsibility seriously. They know there are costs associated with moving to the new MacBook Pro and they are trying to ease that transition. It‚Äôs also important to note that new MacBook Pro sales are not suffering, as Schiller pointed out in that interview. ‚ÄúAnd we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before,‚Äù said Schiller. ‚ÄúSo there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it.‚Äù Adapters included in the price reduction include: USB-C to USB Adapter (from $19 to $9); Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter (from $49 to $29); USB-C to Lightning Cable (1m) (from $25 to $19); USB-C to Lightning Cable (2m) (from $35 to $29); USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter (from $69 to $49); USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter (from $69 to $49). The cost of the SanDisk Extreme Pro SD UHS-II Card USB-C Reader will be reduced from $49 to $29, and all other third party USB-C peripherals will also be discounted. Great move on Apple‚Äôs part to ease the transition. I‚Äôve been using the 13-inch MacBook Pro for just over a week and love it.

The AirPod is Apple‚Äôs premium headphone solution touted as the replacement to its corded predecessor. With a second delay, Apple now finds itself without a¬†native solution to its flagship device; you know, the one it ‚Äòcourageously‚Äô dropped the headphone jack on. It‚Äôs a conundrum, and it‚Äôs especially perplexing coming out of Cupertino. Apple is known for planning and perfecting the ecosystem accompanying its devices yet for¬†the iPhone 7/7 Plus we‚Äôre left with third-party solutions and adapters.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Remember how Steve Jobs used to say¬†Apple products ‚Äújust work?‚Äù That‚Äôs not true anymore. Take, for example, the latest MacBook Pro. What was once a standard feature, sometimes still required by professional users, the SD card slot, is now gone. This, of course, follows Apple‚Äôs decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7. This isn‚Äôt new, of course, Apple has abandoned old technology in the past ‚Äî floppy drives and disc drives were also abandoned from Apple computers before competitors ‚Äî but now it‚Äôs ditching technology before we‚Äôre ready to give it up, and features we still love. It‚Äôs not hard to see where Apple is coming from with some of the hardware omissions it has made in the past, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we have to agree with it. The world is slowly shifting towards USB-C, for example, and I know Apple is just taking steps to ensure their products are on the cutting edge by removing the SD slot. What¬†is hard to understand, however, is the shift towards these new technologies in such a clumsy way. It‚Äôs been a week since Apple‚Äôs last event and I thought it was time to pour one out and vent over all the limitations present on Apple‚Äôs products. Again, let me repeat that I understand some of its decisions, but others make me scratch my head because they make absolutely no sense. In the end, Apple will be Apple and it will sell millions of units, but it‚Äôll also get ridiculed for some for some of its decisions. Here are the latest features Apple is ditching: MagSafe Apple‚Äôs¬†wondrous solution to the crappy computer chargers was MagSafe‚Äîan elegant magnetic charger that easily detached from your computer. After two generations, Apple decided to ditch MagSafe and use Thunderbolt 3 via USB-C making it much more plausible to destroying your MacBook by accidentally tripping over your cable. USB-C is neither as simple nor as fun as MagSafe although it offers more functionality. SD Card A videographer or photographer‚Äôs primary means of transferring their gigabytes of information (terabytes, even) from their camera to computer is the SD Card. This is the industry standard and everybody uses it. But Apple doesn‚Äôt think you use it enough so it decided to eliminate it from the new MacBook Pros. It thinks you‚Äôll use wireless technologies instead. All of those professionals are left out in the cold now and need to figure out a way of integration Apple‚Äôs into their new workflow, if they don‚Äôt opt for a Windows laptop¬†all together or buy a dongle that just¬†makes matters unnecessarily clunky. 3.5mm Headphone Jack The iPhone 7 did away with the headphone jack. It was frustrating, but less so thanks to¬†the included adapter. It looked like any future products by Apple would also bail on the headphone jack, but that was not the case. For some reason, despite Apple‚Äôs move to kill the jack, it‚Äôs still present on the new MacBook Pro. Talk about confusing. This decision was quickly embraced by users but it just further cemented Apple‚Äôs fragmented of connectors. Your Lightning EarPods won‚Äôt work with your MacBooks, and there isn‚Äôt a Lightning connector to headphone jack, so this pretty much makes those headphones just a one-trick pony. It begs the question, why did Apple get rid of the headphone jack on the iPhone? Lightning/USB-C There is a great divide between Apple‚Äôs products with the different charging methods. Prior to this year, the MagSafe connector justified the boundary ‚Äì iPhone‚Äôs are too thin to support this method, after all. Now, the MacBook Pro charging method has turned to USB-C. Right now, nearly every new product out there ‚Äì MacBook, Android phones and Windows computers ‚Äì use that standard.¬†If Apple knew this was coming in the MacBook Pro, why didn‚Äôt it just use USB-C on the iPhone? Gee, that would have made too much sense.¬†Instead, you can‚Äôt connect your iPhone 7 to your MacBook Pro‚Ä¶ unless there‚Äôs a Lightning to USB-C cable out there, which you‚Äôll have to buy. Will this ever change? Who knows, but I doubt it. I do know Apple loves its proprietary cables. With the MagSafe gone, the Lightning cable is the lone remaining proprietary cable. We‚Äôll see how long that lasts. Topics #Apple #Apple #iPhone #MacBook Danny Zepeda Danny‚Äôs interest in writing began with tech, which influenced his career path in college.

At that time it was reported that India's relationship with the global tech industry had become increasingly fraught. This year alone, the government has banned Facebook's free web service and declined to exempt Apple from local sourcing rules and open its own stores. Now India could force companies to use technology cooked up in a government-funded lab. India's new biometric system is called "Aadhaar' and is being rammed down the throats of all tech companies. If they don't comply, they won't have access to the Indian market. Today India's law enforcement is moving quickly ahead of 'Aadhaar" going into effect and announcing that they'll be purchasing technology from Israeli security firm Cellebrite that will assist them in cracking difficult smartphone security measures and encryption. ¬† The Economic Times of India reports today that "The Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), the country's premier forensic institute located in Gandhinagar, will be buying the technology from Cellebrite" that the FBI used to unlock a terrorist's iPhone in San Bernadino California. ¬† The report quoted a senior FSL official stating that "We are likely to have the technology within a month or so. India will become a global hub for cases where law enforcement is unable to break into phones." The official went on to say that the technology from Cellebrite is the only technology that crack iPhones beyond iOS 8. ¬† India has worked with Cellebrite on several key cases with success and because of that they decided to acquire the tools for their own forensic's lab. With gained experience, they're planning to offer their new capabilities of cracking smartphones to other law enforcement agencies from around the world for a fee. ¬† About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Software is an important consideration when looking at older model Macs. It‚Äôs good to know if it will run the latest version of macOS (this model will not), in case you felt the need to buy one on eBay. Mactracker can also be useful. Wonder how how much RAM the¬†a base model of a specific Mac had, and whether it can¬†be upgraded? Mactracker gives you all that information and even links to RAM upgrade instructions. It also details the machine‚Äôs display capabilities, which on this machine means a native resolution of 1280√ó800 pixels. Not bad, but certainly not Retina-quality. Connections are also important. Newer Macs are eschewing older legacy ports in favor of the newer USB-C standard, but as you can see, this particular MacBook model is brimming¬†with all kinds of ports: Ethernet, FireWire, USB, and more. There‚Äôs also a History tab that will give you a basic lowdown on that model. Here, you get an idea of where it fits in the evolution of the MacBook line, and that this configuration was pretty high-end at the time. Finally, the Notes tab lets you jot down any comments you have and provides product links so you can check out any relevant support information. Best of all, if you click the image of the Mac you‚Äôre reviewing, it will play that model‚Äôs startup sound. That gives you a good idea of the wealth of information¬†Mactracker contains, but it covers far more than just Macs. It‚Äôs veritable treasure trove of Apple hardware history. If you‚Äôre an Apple collector or enthusiast, then it‚Äôs an excellent source of information. Not only does it cover your run-of-the-mill Macs, but all Apple devices and even operating systems. For example, if you‚Äôve ever wanted learn all there is to know about Apple‚Äôs early attempts at a PDA, then Mactracker has all there is to know about the Newton MessagePads. Mactracker also has a timeline feature, so you can view Apple‚Äôs products by year. Or, you can view all of Apple‚Äôs current offerings. What about if you want to see which of Apple‚Äôs peripherals have or have had USB ports? That‚Äôs easy, just set up a Smart Category and you can define whatever criteria you want. Finally, you can keep¬†your own Apple inventory using the My Models feature. Simply input all the information pertinent to you equipment and you can be¬†your own Mactracker. Once you start exploring and playing around, you‚Äôre liable to spend hours checking out all the stuff. Best of all, Mactracker is free and constantly updated. So, whether¬†you have an interest for Mac notebooks, want to learn all there is about every iMac made, or you‚Äôre keen to know about Apple‚Äôs brief history making dot matrix printers, you will find it all in Mactracker.

Ten years after BBC first showed us the mind-blowing Planet Earth, the David Attenborough narrated nature show is getting a 4K upgrade. The dramatic trailer shows us the crisp slo-mo shots we‚Äôve come to expect from any BBC wildlife production of recent times but it looks as though it won‚Äôt be shown on TV in 4K just yet ‚Äî unless BBC get a dedicated 4K channel before Sunday. So, for this week‚Äôs series premiere, you‚Äôll have to put up with HD only. If the trailer is anything to go by, we‚Äôre hoping the 4K airing date is announced pronto.

Apple‚Äôs single sign-on acts as a universal login across a variety of apps, and single-sign on allows a pay TV provider to automatically verify, grant access to, and stream content that is part of a user‚Äôs subscription.

Simply enter your info and you‚Äôll have access for all corresponding apps. For now, the companies listed are pretty limited: Dish, GTVC Communications, Hotwire and Sling TV.

This was possible because the majority of¬†other smartphone makers lost money in the period, meaning the industry's profits as a whole were lower than Apple's. This is despite Apple suffering from a slowdown in sales¬†and reported its first fall in annual profits for the first time in 15 years at the end of October.¬† The analysis from BMO Capital Markets shows that¬†despite its declining fortunes, Apple has seized an extra 13pc share of the profits compared with the same period last year. ¬†(If you're after a deal on its products, find out when Black Friday 2016 is.) One reason for the dramatic shift is Samsung's significant losses following the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, said Tim Long, the analyst with BMO Capital Markets who conducted the research.¬† At a glance | Smartphones compared Samsung still held second position in terms of smartphone operating profit share with¬†0.9pc.¬† The Korean electronics company fared better than Apple¬†in terms of smartphone units sold, with 21.7pc of the market. By comparison, Apple had a 13.3pc and HTC followed with 9.7pc.¬† According to research from Strategy Analytics, Android devices accounted for 87.5pc of handsets sold during the period, against Apple's 12.1pc. Fears that the smartphone market is drying up will have been somewhat allayed by the fact that global sales of the devices increased by 2.1pc compared with last year, with over 346m shipped.¬† The news comes as internet usage on smartphones overtook that on desktop and laptop computers for the first time this week.¬† Is Android better than iOS? ¬† Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Mobile phones Samsung iPhone Apple Show more Technology latest 15 Nov 2016, 12:01am Bad battery life?

The earphones haven't shipped yet. It's still unclear whether buyers will want to invest US $159 in AirPods, which are being forced on iPhone 7 buyers, according to critics. Many wireless earphones are already available, but according to one analyst, AirPods are the most advanced. They have unique technologies not found in other earphones, all of which combine to deliver a continuous stream of high-quality audio from the iPhone 7. [Related: Apple iPhone 7 Plus review: including Portrait Mode] AirPods may support multiple wireless protocols to ensure there is no degradation in audio quality, Mike Demler, an analyst at Linley Group, said in a research note this week. The glue in the AirPods' operation is its W1 wireless chip, which includes the radios to transfer music from the iPhone to the AirPods. The chip can process AirPods‚Äô audio codecs, provide stereo synchronization, and handle user controls. "By actively controlling the synchronized operation of the left/right earphones, the W1 delivers more accurate stereo reproduction, and it reduces power consumption relative to commodity multichip solutions," Demler wrote. Apple has shared only a few tidbits on the W1's inner workings. The chip has optical sensors and accelerometers to determine when the wireless headset is in the ears, automatically triggering music playback and pausing when the earbuds are out. The AirPods can also detect when a person speaks, which helps with phone calls. The W1 is Apple's first wireless chip. It is most likely based on technology Apple got from Passif Semiconductor, a small wireless chip maker it acquired in 2013. Apple likely has implemented technology so audio can be streamed from the iPhone via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or a proprietary protocol, Demler said. Passif registered a patent called "un-tethered wireless stereo speaker system" for transfer of audio wirelessly over multiple channels, and it's "consistent with the AirPods specifications," he said. Another Passif patent addresses limitations in the Bluetooth-Special Interest Group‚Äôs A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) specification. The patent resolved issues Apple faced when it was developing the AirPods, Demler said. It describes technology for better surround sound by carrying audio reliably over wireless for the left and right ears. It also provides ways to improve battery life. Apple has also filed patents to transfer data reliably using Bluetooth Low Energy and a earphone design that looks much like AirPods.

MORE >> Gail Simmons has a bounty of kitchen tips to feed you before the holiday season begins. Simmons, the Director of Special Projects at¬†Food & Wine¬†magazine and a permanent judge on¬†Top Chef, dropped by the¬†Celebuzz office to share her tips and hacks that she‚Äôs picked up throughout her extraordinary career in the food industry, but first, she made us a delicious mocktail. Using Pure Leaf Sweet Tea, the author of¬†Talking with My Mouth Full, concocted¬†Iced Apple Brown Bettys by combining¬†1 cup of Pure Leaf Sweet Tea¬†and 1 cup of apple juice or cider with one 1 teaspoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. Fill a shaker with ice. Add tea, apple juice or cider, lemon juice and cinnamon. Shake vigorously until chilled. Pour into rocks glasses over ice and garnish each with one apple slice each. This recipe makes two servings to be served immediately. Simmons suggests adding 2 ounces of bourbon¬†along with the tea and apple juice or cider before shaking to transform it into an adult beverage and freezing Pure Leaf Iced Tea ahead of time to make impressive ice cubes. ‚ÄúFreeze the apple cider and make your ice cubes out of apple cider or even iced tea,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúI actually often will make ice cubes with Pure Leaf iced tea and, before they freeze, you drop a mint leaf in every ice cube in the tray so when they freeze, they have this beautiful ice cube in their ice tea ‚Ä¶ so that when you have your ice tea drink and you‚Äôre drinking it and the ice starts to melt, it doesn‚Äôt water down your drink. It just makes more iced tea.‚Äù Chrissy Teigen and John Legend Attend 'Cravings' Launch 7¬†Photos¬†¬ª In addition to sharing the genius ways that she incorporates Pure Leaf into her cooking, Simmons advocated for the use of seasonal produce, highlighted important brain foods that you should be eating, and, most importantly, explained how to achieve the most delicious scrambled eggs. She said that cooking them slowly and at a low temperature is key. ‚ÄúPeople want to turn the heat on to high and throw your eggs in the pan really fast, but because eggs are actually so delicate, they‚Äôll burn really easily,‚Äù said Simmons. ‚ÄúYou want to put a little butter in the pan, scramble and season your eggs first in a bowl, and put the heat on a medium-low. Then, when I put my eggs in the pan, I shake them very slowly and deliberately and sometimes I‚Äôll put a dollop of cream or something¬†luxurious to make them a little more fluffy. But if you cook them and move them around the pan slowly and let that heat slowly cook them, you‚Äôre gonna get a much better egg.‚Äù Get more recipe ideas from Pure Leaf on their website, order Simmons‚Äô book on Amazon, and don‚Äôt forget to take advantage of our free 30-day trial of Audible by clicking here.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Tom Jackman November 4 Follow @TomJackmanWP The ‚ÄòVigilante‚Äô phone app shows where crime is being reported, so users can either avoid the area or go there with cameras. Apple has removed it from its App Store. (Jack Crosbie/Inverse) Information is power, they say. So the makers of a new phone app, ‚ÄúVigilante,‚Äù believe that letting people know when any nearby crime in progress is being reported to the police, thereby enabling users to either avoid or approach the area, is empowering. Safety enhancing. Revolutionary. #CrimeNoMore The cops in New York City, where Vigilante was unveiled last week, don‚Äôt see it that way. And neither did Apple, which removed the Vigilante app from its store shortly after its launch last week. But entrepreneur Andrew Frame, who created Vigilante, sees the app as a way to use transparency both to fight crime and improve police-community relations. He is working to restore the app on Apple phones, to release it soon on Android phones, and to expand it beyond New York, where it debuted after a closed test with 1,000 users in Brooklyn. This is a promotional video for the "Vigilante" smartphone app, which was taken down from the Apple app store shortly after launching in New York City. The app allows users to know when any nearby crime in progress is being reported to the police. Users can also report an incident or live stream an event. (Vigilante) The app not only maps where new crime is being reported, but allows users to live stream an event if they so choose or report an incident. Vigilante cautions people not to get involved, to stay safe and allow the police to handle the situation. But even in the small test in Brooklyn, Frame wrote on Facebook last week, ‚Äúpeople have been saved by this app under somewhat extraordinary circumstances.‚Äù In a public manifesto released on Medium, Frame wrote, ‚ÄúTransparency is the single most powerful tool in the fight against crime and injustice, and we believe it will rebuild cooperation towards a shared vision.‚Äù In addition to crime, users presumably could record police actions at a scene, as civilians did with the South Carolina police shooting of Walter Scott and the fatal New York police arrest of Eric Garner. ‚ÄúCrimes in progress should be handled by the NYPD and not a vigilante with a cell phone,‚Äù the New York police said in a terse e-mail. The police would not answer any questions about whether they were involved in getting the app removed by Apple, whether they would seek to keep it from being revived, and how exactly Vigilante is getting their information about 911 calls in the first place. It would appear that Vigilante is mainly listening to police scanner traffic, then creating short summaries of the event as dispatched and pinpointing the location on a map. Frame told the New York Post that ‚Äúwe are not hearing the victims‚Äô 911 calls. There are police scanners involved and we have a network of antennas across the boroughs.‚Äù New York police and fire dispatch frequencies are not encrypted and can be heard by anyone with a scanner, though every reporter who‚Äôs ever spent much time listening to a scanner knows that erroneous information often leaks into the chatter between dispatchers and officers or firefighters, and it‚Äôs not intended for public consumption. But the initial dispatch usually has the location and nature of the call mostly right. Vigilante‚Äôs video explaining how it works, below, indicates that concerned citizens can respond and scare off the bad guy, maybe getting some video as well. It‚Äôs the kind of aggressive involvement that police departments tend to discourage, but watch for yourself: ‚ÄúPolice can‚Äôt be everywhere at once,‚Äù Frame‚Äôs manifesto noted, particularly in a city of eight million, ‚Äúand by the time an officer arrives on the scene, the situation is often over. With Vigilante, vital information is unlocked and everyone can do their part.‚Äù That ‚Äúpart‚Äù has long been defined as witness or bystander. ‚ÄúIf people intervene and police officers arrive at the scene,‚Äù said Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, ‚Äúthen they can mistake well-meaning vigilantes for perpetrators, and a horrible tragedy can ensue. If vigilantes and posses were answers to the law enforcement problem in the U.S., we wouldn‚Äôt have discarded them in the 19th century.‚Äù Frame founded a New York-based startup, Sp0n, to create Vigilante, both the software and the staff to digest the information and post it or send push notifications. He said in a press release he was backed by technology venture investors and celebrities such as Deepak Chopra and Russell Simmons have issued endorsements. The app comes with ample liability waivers should one of its users become injured while responding to a Vigilante-reported incident. Some have noted that allowing people to track police movement on an app might enable criminals to commit crime in unprotected areas, and the ability to report an incident could be abused for sinister purposes. ‚ÄúWe believe the 911 system information should be open,‚Äù Frame told Gizmodo. ‚ÄúIf a person needs help and hundreds of people are nearby, why shouldn‚Äôt they know?‚Äù On Facebook, he wrote, ‚Äúwe are exploring the relationship between transparency and justice. Can we use transparency to reduce crime?‚Ä¶What behavioral changes might this create? Are they good for the world? Can we use transparency to repair the relationships between community and police? We are hoping a long-term behavioral change will deter criminal behavior.‚Äù Frame declined an interview with The Post. One question I had was, why the name? ‚ÄúVigilante‚Äù seems to imply more than transparency, more like a call to action. Sudden, untrained citizen action, with the chaos and tangential damage that can ensue. Nancy La Vigne,¬†director of the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said, ‚ÄúThat branding is really counterproductive. It suggests citizen intervention, and you‚Äôre thinking about Trayvon Martin. It‚Äôs pretty disturbing.‚Äù But ‚Äúthe functionality of the app,‚Äù La Vigne said, ‚Äúencouraging the public they could and should think about having a role in transparency, could be beneficial.‚Äù She noted that when people decide to turn on their cameras, and where they are located when they film, all play into the consideration of a citizen video‚Äôs credibility in the context of an entire incident, such as a police shooting. But for episodes such as the North Charleston, S.C., police killing of Scott, ‚Äúwould we have even heard of it?‚Äù without citizen video, La Vigne asked. John DeCarlo, a former police chief in Connecticut and now a professor at the University of New Haven, said having large numbers of citizens rush to a crime scene is ‚Äúproblematic. I think the intent of the people is to record police officers potentially hitting someone, when they‚Äôre actually heading into what could be a dangerous situation.‚Äù But DeCarlo endorsed the idea of greater transparency as a way to reduce crime, saying that both surveillance and body-worn cameras have increased the civility of those being filmed on either side of a police encounter. In addition, making crime information available more rapidly to citizens, which DeCarlo did in Branford, Conn., a suburb of New Haven, ‚Äúbrought crime way down. People knew what was going on, where it was going on. We actually started getting more calls, when people were more aware. It‚Äôs very important that you don‚Äôt leave people in fear. Knowing what‚Äôs happening is a mechanism to alleviate that fear. Being in a communicative partnership with the police department is a valid tool.‚Äù Frame said on Facebook that Sp0n was being asked to bring Vigilante to Chicago and other cities by community leaders who had heard of its results in Brooklyn.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Find Company: 23abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz NITI Aayog pitches for easing single-brand retail sourcing norms S Ronendra Singh ¬†¬†¬∑¬†¬† print ¬†¬†¬∑¬†¬† T+¬†¬†¬∑¬†¬† T- Tweet The proposal could, if implemented, make it more attractive for companies such as Apple and Ikea to do business in India Proposes 15% domestic sourcing, down from 30% New Delhi, November 4:¬†¬† NITI Aayog Chief Executive Officer Amitabh Kant has proposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the mandatory domestic sourcing norms for single-brand retail entities with foreign direct investment (FDI) beyond 51 per cent be eased. The proposal, which favours lowering the threshold of domestic sourcing from 30 per cent of purchase value of products sold for five years to 15 per cent, could, if implemented, make it more attractive for companies such as Apple and Ikea to do business in India. Kant has also proposed that domestic sourcing for global operations by foreign investors be allowed to be set off against domestic sourcing requirements. ‚ÄúThere was a meeting at the PMO last week and a lot of proposals were discussed, including diluting souring norms for single-brand retail,‚Äù a government official told BusinessLine. Under the existing policy, for the first five years of their operation, the entities do not have to meet their 30 per cent domestic sourcing obligations annually, but as an average of five years. To attract big foreign companies such as Apple, the government had done away with domestic sourcing norms for those producing ‚Äúcutting-edge products‚Äù, but in June this year, the exemption period was restricted to three years. Apple had applied for exemption under the ‚Äúcutting-edge product‚Äù category earlier this year when a blanket exemption on local sourcing was allowed. However, after its application was rejected by the Finance Ministry, Apple did not bother to re-apply under the new rules. Four others, including Acer, Lenovo (India), Le Ecosystem Technology (LeEco), and OPPO Mobiles, had applied for relaxation of local sourcing norms. The proposed relaxation will, if approved, apply to all single-brand retailers, irrespective of whether or not they qualify as ‚Äòcutting-edge‚Äô or not. According to RC Bhargava, Chairman of Maruti Suzuki India, companies like Apple would invest in India only if there is a path to profitability. ‚ÄúUltimately, whoever invests in anything ‚Äì electronics or manufacturing ‚Äì will come only if manufacturing in India is competitive and profitable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt help to give a concession for the sake of giving one. It makes sense if that is the only way to profitability,‚Äù Bhargava said.

Emergency phone systems were clogged throughout Phoenix and much of the central part of the state, with problems even extending into California and Texas. But this wasn't a virus or hack by a terrorist. It all began with a teenager, a link on Twitter, and thousands of dollars in desired prize money from Apple. Meetkumar Desai, 18, told police he created a 'non-harmful' bug meant to be a funny prank that would also put some more cash in his own bank. Desai, who describes himself as a visual designer and front-end developer, was searching for glitches in Apple's iOS system as part of its bug bounty program. The program, launched in September, offers cash rewards that range from $25,000 to $200,000 to those who find vulnerabilities in the company's software, such as being able to access iCloud account data, and then privately report them to Apple. Desai told investigators an online friend have given him a bug they thought he might be able to tweak. The teenager manipulated the bug, adding 'pop-ups, commands that would open email and activate the telephone dialing feature on iOS cell phones', according to Ars Technica.¬† He then decided to have the dialing feature call emergency services, creating a java script code that would automatically dial 911 when people clicked on a link. Desai claimed he had made two versions of the link, saying he had no plans to push out the 911 link because he knew it was illegal and would cause people to 'freak out'. Desai manipulated the bug so that it would activate the dialing feature on iOS cell phones and begin calling 911 on a loop - he posted this grab that seems to indicate a link with the bug was clicked more than 151,000 times after he posted it on Twitter¬† But that was the exact link, seemingly disguised as a connection to his personal website, that Desai posted to his Twitter account on Tuesday night. The next day he posted an image that seemed to indicate the webpage had received more than 151,000 views. Desai tagged a YouTube channel page called TheHackSpot and wrote: 'Still going strong'. TheHackSpot also encouraged people to click on the link, which police said was opened nearly 1,900 times from the YouTube channel.¬† Surprise Police Department, which is in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, received more than 100 calls within minutes after Desai's link was posted.¬† The nearby Peoria Police Department and Maricopa County Sheriff's Office were also suddenly flooded with calls.¬† What made the link even more harmful was that Desai had allegedly set it up so that the program would call 911 on a loop, repeatedly dialing the number after someone hung up. In the majority of cases the cycle was only broken when the user powered off their phone, according to Network World.¬† But making matters even worse was the fact that it was designed so that users wouldn't even realize they were calling 911. Desai claimed he had made two versions of the link, and accidentally pushed out the 911 link - which connected to his personal website (pictured since it has been shut down)¬† A cached version of Desai's site shows this personal information he had included¬† Authorities said the link had the potential to shut down emergency 911 service across Maricopa County and put officers in 'immediate danger of losing service to their switches'.¬† Desai was taken in for questioning on Wednesday and booked on suspicion of three felony counts of computer tampering, according to the¬†Arizona Republic.¬† Police also seized a number of items from Desai's home that will be forensically examined.¬† Although the entire thing may have been an accident, it seems to have opened up more trouble. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Russia falls victim to massive hack which reveals it WAS... Clinton campaign attacks Trump's friendliness towards Russia... Share this article Share Copycat websites have since popped up to exploit the same vulnerabilities of the 911 network that Desai's link exposed.¬† And although Desai's 'prank' mainly only affected Phoenix - where most of his Twitter followers are based - his code could have international implications. If someone in Europe had clicked on the link, the phone would have been able to recognize that 911 was an emergency number and would have dialed Europe's emergency number (112) instead. 'The biggest wake-up call to nearly everyone was that all indications pointed to this as an accident,' wrote Mark Fletcher, a chief architect for public safety solutions at a California technology company.¬†¬† 'However, this know-how could now be easily used by anyone with nefarious intent,' he added.¬† 'And a large-scale coordinated attack would be a matter of time.' ¬†¬† Read more: iPhone hack that threatened emergency 911 system lands teen in jail | Ars Technica The day the 911 network stood still | Network World MCSO: 18-year-old arrested in cyberattack on 911 system Share or comment on this article e-mail 14 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes?

STMicro, Sony, and Intel could all benefit from buying the motion sensor maker. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 4, 2016 at 1:00PM Chipmaker InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) is reportedly interested in selling itself, according to¬†multiple reports citing unnamed sources. InvenSense supplies motion sensors to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, and other mobile-device makers, but it's had a rough year because of rising competition and sluggish smartphone sales. Image source: InvenSense. Analysts expect the chipmaker's revenue to fall¬†24% this year, compared with 47% growth in¬†2015. Those bleak expectations sent the stock tumbling almost 40% over the past 12 months. With an enterprise value of just over $600 million, InvenSense now has an enterprise value-to-sales ratio of 1.6, making it a fairly cheap purchase for companies interested in its "best-in-breed" motion sensors -- accelerometers and gyroscopes. Let's take a closer look at the three most likely suitors for the struggling chipmaker. STMicroelectronics Chipmaker STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM), which competes directly against InvenSense in the motion-sensor market, could buy InvenSense to become the undisputed market leader in gyroscopes and accelerometers. With $1.68 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of last quarter, STMicro could theoretically acquire¬†InvenSense in an all-cash transaction. STMicro previously supplied Apple with¬†motion sensors for its iPhones, but InvenSense won that spot from the iPhone 6 onward. STMicro struck back at InvenSense by supplying the motion sensor for the Apple Watch, but Apple still apparently uses¬†InvenSense sensors in the iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. By gobbling up InvenSense, STMicro would become Apple's primary supplier of gyroscopes and accelerometers, regardless of which brand the iPhone maker picks. But there's also a risk that Apple -- not wanting to let a single supplier gain too much clout -- could start buying its motion sensors from STMicro and Invensense's rival Bosch instead. Sony InvenSense would also be a good fit for Sony (NYSE:SNE), which could use its motion sensors to complement its camera, image sensor, and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. It would be a fairly cheap purchase for Sony, which finished last quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and¬†equivalents. InvenSense is mainly known for its smartphone motion sensors, but it also supplies optical image stabilization sensors for cameras. Sony produces its own¬†optical image stabilization sensors, but that unit could benefit from merged technologies and the inclusion of InvenSense's customer list. InvenSense also has a rapidly growing IoT business, which provides motion sensors for wearables, drones, and other devices. That unit would directly complement Sony's acquisition of IoT 4G chipmaker Altair earlier this year and enable it to grow its content share across various connected devices. Integrating InvenSense's motion sensors could also help Sony tighten up the supply chain and reduce operating costs at its mobile unit -- the same reason Apple and Samsung use first-party silicon in many of their own devices. Intel Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the world's top manufacturer of PC and data center chips, has been stuck in a rut because of weak growth in both markets. Its inability to penetrate the mobile market also forced it to seek growth in other markets, such as IoT modules, programmable chips, non-volatile memory, and depth-sensing cameras. One of Intel's key strategies to expand beyond PCs and data centers is to create all-in-one "reference designs" that enable OEMs to quickly create devices such as drones and VR headsets. These designs bundle together Intel's chips, RealSense depth-sensing cameras, and other first-party components to widen its moat against larger rivals. Intel's Project Alloy. Image source: Intel. Intel's VR/AR headset reference design, a standalone device dubbed "Project Alloy," is powered by Intel's sixth-generation Core processor and¬†RealSense camera. It's unclear who supplied the gyroscopes and accelerometers, but Intel could certainly beef up that bundle with InvenSense's sensors. The same could also be said about Intel's reference designs for drones or other IoT gadgets. With $17.8 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of last quarter, InvenSense would be¬†a bite-sized purchase for Intel. But will InvenSense actually be acquired? It makes strategic sense for STMicro, Sony, or Intel to buy InvenSense, but it's also logical to simply wait for InvenSense to become cheaper. With sales slipping and the company struggling to defend its moat against bigger rivals, it seems InvenSense could become even cheaper over the next few quarters. Therefore, investors shouldn't buy InvenSense with the expectation that it could be acquired in the near future. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Email Password Remember me Forgot¬†password? ¬† ¬† Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports ¬† ¬† Op-Ed: Does Apple still care for Mac? Insights on Mac's upcoming future Listen | Print By Claudio Buttice ¬† ¬† Nov 4, 2016 in Technology 2016 was quite a bad year for Mac users, and many keep asking if Apple still cares about the underwhelming future of what now seems to be a second-rate product. The entire 2016 has been quite devoid of major Mac announcements and updates about the new products, making everyone anxious about what's the real future that Apple devised for this line of goods. Even the new MacBook Pro is long overdue, clearly showing how Apple is neglecting its high-end PCs instead of using these products as a spearhead to drive off competition. While iMac, Mac Pro, or Mac mini weren't so fortunate and never saw any update, even the MacBook Pro seems to be quite limited with its just 16GB of RAM and Intel‚Äôs Core i5 and i7 chip, compared to the forthcoming Microsoft Surface Studio and its innovative touchscreen technology. Apple did not even care about waiting a few more months for the next-generation quad-core Kaby Lake processor to become available before releasing the current model, worrying Mac users with what seemed to be a "we couldn't care less" attitude. One of the most widely advertised features of Macs is their alleged superior security that led many users into thinking that their computers were completely free from all kind of vulnerabilities. Expert users could prevent unauthorized access without any third-party program with a powerful built-in feature to encrypt the various Mac folders, and many new tools like Little Flocker and BlockBlock added further layers of security to an environment that is universally thought of as one the safest around. However, Mac OS X is all but invulnerable to outside attacks, as showed by the recent Russian "Fancy Bear" hacker group hit. Their "Komplex" Trojan did not exploit a software vulnerability: instead, the cyber espionage group simply used a phishing email to unload their payload in the form of an executable code disguised as a PDF. Today's users need to use their own Mac OS X VPNs to protect their browsing much like PC users, losing more and more ground against the simpler and more appealing Windows operating systems. Apple keeps putting Mac products in a declining category of run-of-the-mill classic "keyboard and mouse" devices that, although far from being obsolete yet, is not cutting-edge or avant-garde either. The new MacBook Pro seems to be more optimized for lightness and thinness rather than power and high-end computing features, a strategy that, although viable, yet again sounds much more like 2014 than 2016. Mac users always have been more interested in computer specs rather than design, and even this choice seemed to be at least questionable. If Apple will not renew its entire line of Mac products within a few months, including the largely overlooked iMac and Mac Pro, there's a distinct possibility that the whole line will fail to get through 2017.

The assumption the smartphone industry is quickly tanking is not only an observation on the morning commute, but also one which is backed up by numerous analysts and research agencies. Volume does not make the claim correct, but it makes it more likely. Swimming so strongly against the tide make the statement by Canalys a bit more remarkable; the team really has puts itself out there and is backing Apple strongly. ‚ÄúWhile the new models are selling well, there are still unsold first-generation Apple Watches in the channel,‚Äô said Canalys Analyst Daniel Matte. ‚ÄúQ4 performance will be key to better assessing the long-term prospects of the improved Watch models. Apple needs to make a strong marketing push during the holiday shopping season, especially to highlight new and compelling apps for its platform. ‚ÄúMeanwhile, its renewed focus on fitness functionality puts it in more direct competition with Fitbit. The inclusion of GPS by Apple and many other vendors now poses a big threat to traditional GPS watches and fitness trackers.‚Äù Canalys believe Apple shipped 2.8 million Watches in Q3, which is a considerably different number from IDC‚Äôs research which we covered last month. IDC estimate Apple sold only 1.1 million smartwatches over the quarter, and the segment on the whole shrunk from 5.6 million to 2.7 million. The two figures are so wildly apart you would be forgiven if you came to conclusion that someone is just making it up. Apple does not give the figures of how well certain product lines perform, and the smartwatches are one of those products. The financial results have a segment called ‚ÄòOther Products‚Äô which includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories, but no break downs. Year-on-year this segment was down 22% for the last quarter to $2.3 billion. Canalys is pretty adamant Apple and the smartwatch segment on the whole are growing quickly, 60% year-on-year, though if Apple‚Äôs financials are anything to go by, the might be a bit off the mark. Telecoms.com is not going to take sides, but IDC is pretty accurate most of the time.

Photo: Steve Jennings/WireImage/Getty Images In the great war that is Neil Young versus music streaming, a ceasefire appears to have been declared. CNET reports that Young's entire catalog has mysteriously returned to both Spotify and Apple Music with no warning. Last year, Young yanked his work from both streaming services, like a true audiophile, because neither service met his sound-quality standards. However, he did note in that same announcement that "when the quality is back, I'll give it another look. Never say never." True to his word, he did give Tidal ‚Äî which offers a pricier tier for higher-quality audio ‚Äî exclusive streaming rights for over a year. (It should be noted that he has¬†his own fancy digital-music player Pono.) He even claimed earlier this year that his live album EARTH wouldn't fit on iTunes and "breaks all their rules." But it now appears that either Spotify and Apple Music have miraculously gotten more high-res or Young has simply lowered his expectations because he's back on both and somehow managed to squeeze EARTH on iTunes, too. He's even dropped a new song, "Peace Trail," to seemingly celebrate. Keep on rockin' as you were.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more ¬† skip to main content skip to main menu ¬† ¬† iOS 10.1 jailbreak on iPhone 7 demoed in video By Anthony Bouchard, Nov 4, 2016 Tweet 57 Comments There‚Äôs really been a lack of news about an iOS 10 jailbreak recently, but despite any updates, we‚Äôve been able to count on iOS hacker Luca Todesco to show off his personal jailbreaks running on iOS 10. Now, another iOS hacker that goes by the handle¬†@ijapija00 is demoing his jailbreak, only this time, the spotlight is on an iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 10.1. He claims it works on iOS 10.1.1 as well. iOS 10.1.1 is currently the latest of Apple‚Äôs public iOS releases, so this is a pretty big deal in terms of breaking through Apple‚Äôs latest security updates. Apple has been battling hard against jailbreaking via rapid software updates, which contain a constant flow of bug fixes and new features. This jailbreak demo is reportedly based off of a single exploit and is considered ‚Äústable,‚Äù which is a brilliant achievement considering iOS 10 implements Apple‚Äôs KPP (kernel patch protection) security. This security has been known to cause instability in improperly implemented jailbreaks. Just like with Luca Todesco‚Äôs Cydia Substrate demonstration on iOS 10, @ijapija00 is using a specialized alternative library to Cydia Substrate to run tweaks on the latest firmware. While there is some confusion about whether or not Cydia Substrate works on iOS 10-10.1, Saurik seems confident it should work just fine, which according to a comment he shared on Reddit, questions the legitimacy of the video: So he should tell me what he feels needs to be ‚Äúpatched‚Äù :/. FWIW, Substrate is known to work on iOS 10.0, and I have good reason to believe it works fine on iOS 10.1. BTW: I‚Äôll say that one way to gain a lot of immediate legitimacy is to actually provide such details‚Ä¶ rather than saying ‚Äúwaiting on saurik‚Äù, you say ‚Äúon iOS 10 they changed X, and so we had to do Y, which is something saurik now needs to update‚Äù; it doesn‚Äôt affect your jailbreak (as this is something in userland which is totally unrelated to the exploit), and it makes it extremely clear ‚Äúok, this is actually real‚Äù, as the only way you‚Äôd be able to say something credible about that is from having tested it with a real jailbreak (and otherwise, as it stands, I still don‚Äôt see anything in this video which is really making me think ‚Äúok, this is a jailbreak‚Äù). One thing that‚Äôs worth noting is he uses a set of third-party system query apps to show off the iOS version and the type of iPhone he‚Äôs using rather than going to Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí About, which may cast some doubt because it‚Äôs not the standard way to showing off the software version in these kinds of demo videos. You should take this video with a grain of salt, just like the others. Just like the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak from Pangu, this jailbreak appears in the video to be semi-untethered, which means it relies on a specialized jailbreak app on the device‚Äôs Home screen to boot into a jailbroken state after every reboot. This is different from a tethered jailbreak because you don‚Äôt need to connect your device to a computer to perform the process. On the other hand, just like other demos in the past, this jailbreak likely won‚Äôt ever see the light of day. It was built for the developer himself, who says releasing and maintaining a public jailbreak is a lot of work for just one person and carries a lot of burden of risk and responsibility for himself. His full commentary on why the jailbreak won‚Äôt be released is mentioned in the YouTube video description: The major reasons for this not being published are: 1. Cydia Substrate is patched by replacing a library that loads the tweaks into the system. If we would have a un-patched Substrate for 10.x then I maybe would consider twice about this. But as long as it‚Äôs patched and I don‚Äôt own it, there‚Äôll be not releases! 2. As a single developer, I don‚Äôt want to be responsible for other people‚Äôs devices, if they break or lose something. I neither don‚Äôt have the time to help people having problems with the jailbreak process itself. 3. Also, this jailbreak is stable sometimes and sometimes not. That means that it‚Äôs mostly used for testing tweaks or for private use and is NOT ready to be released at all! So eye candy aside, the jailbreak demonstrated in this video shows that jailbreaking is indeed still possible despite all the security measures Apple keeps taking to try and thwart the community. A public jailbreak is most likely to be released by a larger hacking team like Pangu or TaiG, both of which have remained silent these last several months. Pangu, on the other hand, did express their interest in creating an iOS 10 jailbreak when it was still in its beta stages over the Summer, so a light may still exist at the end of the tunnel.

They definitely have an issue on how long it takes why defend them, complaining or not? Those folks have their own lives and hardly get paid for what they do for all of us. Some people are so selfish now-a-days.. jgr627 In the words of my boy Jeff‚Ä¶..meh 10.2 is around the corner and will patch this plus we getting new emojis Mark S meh to emoji those are for 8 year old girls #StockSucksOS jgr627 And jailbraking is for what? 10 year olds The King If Apple keeps patching jailbreaks in rapid pace ‚Äì faster than I‚Äôve ever seen before to be honest ‚Äì then it‚Äôs clear that jailbreaking is getting THEIR (Apple) attention regardless if jailbreak news is in the spot light of the media or behind Apple‚Äôs closed doors. The joke when jailbreaking was seriously in the news was that Steve Jobs had an iPhone and he had a jailbroken iPhone. I feel that Cook has two as well, and is why they keep adding all the features they see from Cydia. Damian Jailbreak does not get coverage because people of my moms age don‚Äôt even know how to do basic stuff on iPhone Blip dude You‚Äôre basing an ‚Äúexcitement‚Äù of emojis based on media attention?? There are people out there (I actually know a few people) who don‚Äôt even know about the updates to messages app in iOS 10, so I think it‚Äôs safe to say that emojis and Jailbreaking are as appealing as a wet carrot. Josh Venegas Lol. Are you serious? Jailbreak > emojis any day. mersc Lol seriously? Emojis? As far as stock vs JB‚Ä¶ There is no comparison. The iphone is what it is today largely because of jailbreak developers. Nearly all of the features after ios 4 WERE jailbreak tweaks. I will remain on ios 9 jailbroken until a new jailbreak. If it never happens I‚Äôll easily go to android. Jailbroken iphone > android > stock ios. No question for me, because I‚Äôm electronically proficient. Stock ios is fine for a lot of people that aren‚Äôt proficient, don‚Äôt care or are old. But for me, I want freedom to change my device how I want, not to be subject to what Apple says I can or can‚Äôt have. jgr627 You would leave the best eco system pound for pound for android if you can‚Äôt jailbrake no more? For freedom? You say your electronically proficient? Where! Are you nuts! What freedom is it that you speak of? The ability to remove your carrier name? F*** dan Actually, when the iOS 4 PDF exploit was around, there was a jailbreak tweak patching the vulnerability before Apple could push an update. mersc This is the exact narrow mindedness Apple wants you to have. I have already stated that some people are ok with accepting things as stock, some aren‚Äôt. You refuse to accept that fact. You go as far to say ‚Äúwe have everything we need now stock‚Äù. You tout this subjective opinion as a universal truth, a base logical fallacy that most are aware of. Google subjectivist fallacy. This is the reason ‚Äúknow-it-alls‚Äù are highly alienating. Hopefully for your sake, personally and professionally, this display is uncommon in your life. Your opinion has been opposed by several and can therefore not be construed as truth. For example, there are dozens of important tweaks to me and others that are still not available in stock iOS. Maybe you are aware of some of them, maybe you aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs your choice to find and/or use them, or remain stock. No one else cares about personal choices. üôÇ If you don‚Äôt want freedom to customize and control your device that is totally fine, but yelling at others while confined in the box is neither productive nor attractive. As far as security with jailbreaking goes, I haven‚Äôt been exploited once in seven years of jailbreaking. Installing a package with security issues is a novice mistake. Your tolerance for another person to have a differing opinion is low, going as far as throwing insults. It‚Äôs not hard to accept and even celebrate others‚Äô differences. Try it; I sincerely promise you and other people will feel better about you. Blip dude Actually, yeah it is relevant because Apple still continues to do so, but no one obviously expects you to recognize that. And so what if a person wants customization on a walled garden?? I‚Äôm wondering how the f*** this affects you in any way. Sure, iOS has definitely advanced since iOS 3 and I can go back to stock iOS at any time (I did it for most of iOS 8 & 9), but if people are STILL Jailbreaking at this point then that only proves that not even iOS itself is perfect. Go ahead and bash Android, but both OS can still be shit and boring sometimes. Favna you crazy? i just got a brand new iphone 7+. I would die for a jailbreak on there. Vista Now we just have to wait : ) Pedro S√° I always wait for the next jailbreak. The only exception is when I get a new device with a newer iOS version (but living in Brazil it means it will take a looong time to become true). Troy If lets say this jailbreak drops (i know unlikely) and 10.2 is released will we able to get the new emojis with the jailbreak? Vista i remember on the 9.3.3 jb there was a tweak to get iOS 10 emojis. so maybe? Bugs Bunnay Good luck for those waiting on ios 10 jailbreak! ravinigga Still rocking iOS 10.0.2 And updates my watch and Its weird from 7.30 to 5.16pm still 90% battery.

I‚Äôve noticed the same thing on my Nike+ model. I went from the first gen watch to this one. The battery life is so good it‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs displaying wrong on the watch face. Scott Curry ‚Äú‚Ä¶who says releasing and maintaining a public jailbreak is a lot of work for just one person and carries a lot of burden of risk and responsibility for himself.‚Äù So you collaborate with other jailbreak-creators, and let a bigger group release it. Keeping it for himself and bragging about it is ONLY for notoriety and no other reason. That being said, I ditched JBing with the iOS 10 public beta and truth be told, I don‚Äôt miss it at all, except my wallpaper switcher. Fingers crossed Apple implements that feature in a future update. Anthony Bouchard It may be easier said than done. A lot of people cannot be trusted with your valuable exploits, which btw are worth a lot of money and could be easily stolen and cashed in. Scott Curry I‚Äôll admit, I don‚Äôt understand the value behind the exploits or how that could be cashed in. It‚Äôs always been heralded that JB-creators always performed for the general community and not for personal gain. Anthony Bouchard Well to be fair, I‚Äôm not pointing any fingers at JB creators. My point is who would this developer go to? Pangu and TaiG aren‚Äôt exactly easy to reach, and that means @ijapija00 would have to trust other ‚Äúaverage Joes‚Äù that claim they can help make a JB tool. Those might be the people you‚Äôd have to be wary of. njdan30 Apple pays very good for finding exploits and vulnerabilities that‚Äôs how.

This represents a notable increase from the year-ago quarter where Apple had grabbed 90% of smartphones profits. This share of the profits is even more amazing considering iOS share of global smartphone shipments clocked at 12.1% for Q3, compared to 13.6% in the year-ago quarter. How can Apple get¬†over 100% of the profits, you may ask? It‚Äôs simply that many smartphone makers actually lose money in the business. Any net loss from other vendors results in Apple being able to grab more profits than the global industry netted overall. Samsung comes at number 2 with a 0.9% share of smartphone profits despite having a market share almost twice that of Apple‚Äôs. Of course, Samsung profits took a hit following the Note 7 debacle, and this is expected to have more negative impact going forward. Apple historically never fought for market shares, instead focusing on profits. This was true for its personal computer business 15 years ago, and it is still true today with its smartphone business. Apple shows once again that market shares don‚Äôt mean much and the real bottom line is how much money you bring home at the end of the day. Source: Investors.com Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Samsung enjoys its most profitable quarter in two years thanks to strong Galaxy S7 sales Apple is Number One Smartphone Manufacturer in US Ahead of June quarter earnings, Apple‚Äôs stock passes $100 for the first time in six weeks TSMC‚Äôs Q3 revenue expected to climb to a record high on strong iPhone 7 A10 chip orders Related Topics Apple, Business, Finance, Market Share, Money, Profit, Samsung Jamessmooth ‚ÄúApple shows once again that market shares don‚Äôt mean much and the real bottom line is how much money you bring home at the end of the day.‚Äù I think this is a great point and always seems to get lost on folks.

Over 100% of it!!! callicles How did they take more than all the profit? Also, ‚ÄúApple historically never thought for market shares instead focusing on profits.‚Äù ‚ÄúThought for market shares‚Äù is odd phrasing. Perhaps you meant ‚Äúfought for market shares?‚Äù HaabHimself Maybe reading the article properly will give you your answer, the article says fought‚Ä¶. callicles The article was edited after my post to change from thought to fought as noted above by the author. callicles Also, once the changes were made, I attempted to edit my original comment to reflect that, but edits don‚Äôt seem to be saved. Sebastien Not sure what your original question was, but the only edit that was made after the post was initially published was to change ‚Äúthought‚Äù to ‚Äúfought‚Äù in the last paragraph. Rowan09 But Apple is doomed. Can the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù stop the nonsense now? 919263 Yup today, Apple is at what‚Ä¶??? 104% of the profits‚Ä¶ Fail to understand how you could have more than the entire thing‚Ä¶BUT this is about something else‚Ä¶ IT is the Ecosystem‚Ä¶ 9 out of 10 Smartphones are running some form of Android. DO you understand what is going on here‚Ä¶ Let me give you a History Lesson‚Ä¶ Once upon a time.. 9 out of 10 computers were IBM based‚Ä¶Remember what happened to the 10th computer which was apple‚Ä¶? Same is going to eventually happen again‚Ä¶ Windows (IBM Based) PC‚Äôs More than DOMINATE the world of PC today. The Mac could not win was due to the CLOSE Environment of APPLE‚Ä¶ Well, same is going to happen soon‚Ä¶ I love the iPhone‚Ä¶ BUT hate the company‚Ä¶ and that will eventually make me move from Apple to Anything else‚Ä¶ all it would take is a device that meets my requirements‚Ä¶ (And does NOT Explode)‚Ä¶ So all this Trump‚Äôish Hoopla about Apple is all just that.. Hoopla‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs all about Market capture‚Ä¶ and other than US‚Ä¶ Android is winning BIG time‚Ä¶ By the Billions‚Ä¶ JohnS They got a positive percentage because others this quarter lost money. When you average negative numbers into the mix it sort of messes with the totals. As far as the main point you have here I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs accurate. If Apple is taking home literally all the profit in the whole industry they can sit at one percent a lot longer than the rest of the world can afford to sit at 99%. Apple isn‚Äôt in danger at this point of going anywhere. If all things were equal then yes Apple would be in serious trouble but that‚Äôs just not the case. But what‚Äôs the point in winning by billions if the small guy on the corner is walking away at the end of the day with all the money and you have nothing to show for your numbers? The second issue is that iOS is actually open source as well as several other technologies such as their programming language (Swift), their browser (webkit) and health kit. When it comes to the closed parts Apple has expensive APIs for their developers and has opened up more and more of their OS and apps for extensions and integration with every passing year. Contrast that to what Google is doing and it‚Äôs an interesting story‚Ä¶ Google is shutting down Open source projects every single year and replacing them with closed offerings, penalizing people who want to use their own tools and literally attempting to force people out of the industry who want to modify android source like the folks at Amazon. Google is open in lip service only and they are very aggressive when it comes to controlling their systems. I‚Äôm not saying Apple and Google are trading places or anything but I‚Äôm just pointing out the stereotype is actually completely wrong. ¬† Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle ¬† The most recent headlines Reviewers weigh in on the new MacBook Pro‚Ä¶ Nonprofits in U.S. now able to accept donations using Apple Pay Apple seeds third beta of iOS 10.2, macOS Sierra 10.12.2, and tvOS 10.1 to developers KGI (again) predicts iPhone demand has peaked for the year due to lackluster improvements Apple spent years testing if touchscreens made sense on the Mac ¬† The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more‚Ä¶ EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you‚Äôre connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy ¬† Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics¬† Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search LG V20 Review: Stealing the Note 7‚Äôs spotlight Chris Burns - Nov 4, 2016 14 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 8/10 Pros Display is color accurate, sharp, and bright Secondary display is surprisingly helpful Two camera lenses, standard angle, and wide-angle Replaceable battery Easy access to innards Cons Battery life a day or less Concerns about fragility of camera array glass Pricing quite high With the galaxy note 7 quite literally self-destructing and throwing Samsung‚Äôs holiday plans into disarray, LG finds itself with an unexpected opportunity with the v20. Today we‚Äôre aiming to provide a review helpful to both former Galaxy Note users and potential users curious about the ins and outs of this high-end smartphone. The LG V20 is a power user device, now we‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs a device we can live with. In the LG V20 is part of a line of smartphones LG has created to go above and beyond the average call of duty for a high-end phone. This device has everything the LG G5 has, but here LG ramps key elements up to 11. LG does not seem to be releasing this smartphone to compete with everyone-aimed phones from Apple or Samsung. Instead, the LG V20 is a smartphone for people who love smartphones: those who proudly call themselves Power Users. The LG V20 is a phone for people who don‚Äôt want the best device within a set cost barrier. This smartphone was made for people who want the most premium and unique smartphone on the market, full stop. 1. Hardware Quality The LG V20‚Äôs industrial design feels to me to give attention to functionality first, then form and comfort in use. It‚Äôs almost as if LG was aware that the vast majority of smartphone users immediately pick up a case to protect their device, and therefore didn‚Äôt fret too much about the looks. I feel the same way about Google‚Äôs Pixel and Pixel XL: function comes before form. In the hardware it‚Äôs clear LG intended this device is for smartphone-loving power users. Once the back cover is off, an array of philips-head screws can be accessed. Repairs to this phone will likely be more realistic than in rival devices. Likewise the SIM card slot and microSD card slot are right up top above the battery and easy to access. The battery is replaceable, too ‚Äì and LG retains its street-cred for keeping it power-user-real. Once we see the battery we‚Äôre reminded that LG wants us to look under the hood ‚Äì they know their users appreciate good graphic design, too. 2. Primary Display This smartphone has two displays, one just above the other. The smaller is just as much a touchscreen as the larger, more traditional display, and both function separately. Both displays work with the same gear aside from touch sensitivity, which is handled differently on each unit. The main screen is a 5.7-inch IPS LCD display with 1440 x 2560 pixels. This means that we have a 513 pixels per inch density, all covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 4. It‚Äôs exceedingly bright ‚Äì almost too bright at times, in fact. The display suffers from the opposite problem most phone screens have. That is that it doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to get as dim as we‚Äôd like at night. Over the past week we‚Äôve spoken to several other LG V20 users that‚Äôve confirmed this ‚Äì not that it‚Äôs a big deal, but it‚Äôs not just an isolated situation. Most phones can‚Äôt get bright enough for direct sunlight ‚Äì this LG V20 does not have that problem. 3. Secondary Display The secondary display on the LG V20 is not meant for the same standards as the primary display. Think of the secondary display as more of shape-shifting tool, able to summon and control multiple functions. The primary reason I‚Äôve used this display ‚Äì and the display on the LG V10 ‚Äì is to flip switches in the dark. When I don‚Äôt want to blast the brightness of the primary display when I‚Äôm in a dark room, I use the secondary display. I‚Äôll use it to turn my sound off, or check the time, or control music on the phone through my headphones. This secondary display does the same thing as Samsung‚Äôs always-on display, but here it‚Äôs even less obtrusive. Inside some of LG‚Äôs apps, this secondary display acts as an extended control panel. In the camera app, for example, the secondary display contains Auto, Manual Photo, and Manual Video Camera buttons. Apple may be making headlines with its Touch Pad on the new MacBook Pro, but LG‚Äôs secondary display introduced the feature first on last year‚Äôs V10. As with Apple, though, LG really requires the support of third-party app developers for it to be truly useful throughout the system. 4. Hi-Fi Audio DAC The LG V20 has a fairly standard speaker system blasting out its bottom. Unlike some high-profile masqueraders that‚Äôve released phones this year, the LG V20 isn‚Äôt a visual trickster. This speaker system doesn‚Äôt appear to pretend to have more speakers than it actually does, appearing here with only one speaker grille. This single speaker is loud enough to listen to your occasional album whilst doing the dishes. It‚Äôs not meant to be your go-to system for powering a college dorm-room full of kids. LG has included a Hi-Fi Audio DAC for that. A DAC (Digital-Analog Converter) is a piece of hardware inside the phone that keeps the quality of audio as high as possible. It takes digital audio files and converts them to analog sounds through the LG V20‚Äôs headphone port with high quality output for high-end speaker devices. For the LG V20 out-of-box experience, this means the Bang & Olufsen earbuds included with the smartphone. Listening to the same audio file on this device and several others with as few external factors changed as possible, LG wins. It‚Äôs difficult to say whether Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy Note 7 would have sounded better because we no longer have one to test ‚Äì and neither should you. Generally it‚Äôs a matchup between the latest hero HTC device and hero Samsung Galaxy device for headphone output quality. Right now LG is out ahead of the pack with the newest in DAC technologies from EES Tech (in the ES9218 Quad DAC). Audio quality doesn‚Äôt get the same level of attention that display and camera technology do on smartphones, so we‚Äôre pleased to see some competition around what‚Äôs most pleasing to the ears. 5. Back-facing Camera As it was with the V10, so it is with the V20 with a truly unique camera setup. Having two cameras ‚Äì one standard-angle, the other wide-angle ‚Äì makes all the difference when we‚Äôre out hunting oddities to photograph. To show the quality of this camera setup, I‚Äôve gone out to take photos of some offbeat locations and items. Important to note is the fact that I took a trip to take these photos with a non-professional colleague who will remain nameless. Some of these photos may or may not have been captured on semi-abandoned private property. As such, especially if you‚Äôre a member of law enforcement, all credit for the capture of these photos goes entirely to my anonymous colleague. Above you‚Äôll see an example of a photo captured with the default non-wide-angle lens. Below you‚Äôll see an example of a photo in nearly the same spot captured with the wide-angle lens. Having the ability to capture scenes with such a wide angle comes in mighty handy in tight situations. Quality in the wide-angle shots is a bit lower than those in the standard-angle ‚Äì in most cases. Both setups capture photos that are extremely fine and easily compete with the nicest smartphone cameras in the field today. The only less-than-great element we‚Äôve experienced is the fish-eye effect that doesn‚Äôt always get corrected perfectly. But it‚Äôs better than it was with the V10, and no other smartphone has a wide-angled lens as wide as this. Several phones have been released recently with more than one lens attached to their backside. The iPhone 7 Plus has two lenses, one 12MP camera with an f/1.8 wide-angle lens, the other also 12MP with a 56mm f/2.8 lens. The LG V20 has one 16MP camera with an f/1.8 lens and OIS and one 8MP camera with an f/2.4 wide-angle lens. Apple‚Äôs setup aims for zooming without a lost of picture quality, helping you capture things that are far away. LG‚Äôs setup instead allows you to see more of the environment you‚Äôre in, extending the view of the camera in all directions. If I had to choose between these options, I‚Äôd go for LG‚Äôs. I can always get closer to my subject, I can‚Äôt always get further away. Some concern has been expressed by several users about the fragility of the back-facing camera‚Äôs outer glass cover. We have seen photos of this glass with cracks, but have not yet found the glass to be easily damaged on our review unit. We will continue to investigate and update if necessary. 6. Battery Life We‚Äôve gotten some mixed results with battery life thus far, and not only with time on stand-by. Stand-by with LTE active and the same apps installed and active has the Google Pixel XL lasting at least twice as long as the LG V20. In everyday use there‚Äôs no truly fair way to compare the two, but we‚Äôve not gone more than a full day with the V20 under most circumstances. The LG V20 does have a replaceable battery, so buying another might be a good idea for people taking long airplane trips overseas. Otherwise charging the device every night while you sleep shouldn‚Äôt be an issue for all-day use. Those who make particular use of streaming video ‚Äì either on-demand services like Netflix and YouTube, or broadcasting with Facebook Live or Periscope ‚Äì might struggle, however. Wrap-up The LG V20 is a smartphone made for people who love smartphones and for whom price takes a backseat to flexibility. No, it‚Äôs not the most expensive smartphone on the market, but for the cash, you really need to know what you‚Äôre getting ‚Äì and what you‚Äôre not. If you never use your smartphone‚Äôs camera or listen to audio on headphones, the LG V20 probably isn‚Äôt for you. If you do, it very well could be. If, though, you already live in fear of being out of reach of an outlet, the V20‚Äôs higher-than-typical power consumption could be a real problem. You sacrifice water-resistance in return for microSD and a removable battery, so you need to be sure they‚Äôre truly priorities. Most importantly, you need to be willing to put in the effort playing with manual camera controls, setting up the secondary touch bar, and generally tweaking the V20 for it to deliver its best. LG won‚Äôt make the biggest splash in smartphones this year, but it has produced one of the best options for power users. With the demise of the Note 7, that‚Äôs a segment currently feeling fairly under-served, and though the V20 may not tick every box, it‚Äôs a powerful and flexible example of Android delivered in a different way to Google‚Äôs vision with the Pixel XL. The LG V20 is available from Verizon for $28 a month for 24 months or $672 full retail price. It‚Äôs also available from T-Mobile for $769.99 USD, from AT&T for $829.99, or unlocked from NewEgg for $800 USD.

While not confirmed in any official capacity, Foxconn, an Apple manufacturing partner, is said to be testing wireless charging modules designed for the planned 2017 release of the smartphone. Although several phones have been capable of wireless charging in the past, that‚Äôs typically only possible with an external case designed with it in mind. However, if Foxconn‚Äôs wireless charging module does end up in the next-gen iPhone, no special case will be necessary ‚Äî it will be capable of it right out of the box. While Nikkei reports that Foxconn is definitely testing the iPhone-intended module, what isn‚Äôt known at this time is whether it will be a stock feature of all iPhones, or something included in only high-end, or special versions of the handset. Related:¬†iPhone 7S and iPhone 8 rumors Part of that decision may be down to the kinds of yields Foxconn is able to produce. If it can output a large number of the modules, Apple may include it in the base iPhone, but if smaller quantities are created, it may be restricted to specific versions of the handset. Apple hasn‚Äôt made any official statement about wireless charging, but it is expected to pull out the stops with its next version. 2016‚Äôs iPhone 7 release saw the first noticeable decline in its sales since the original iPhone, so kickstarting interest in the brand again with new features is an important step to take. 2017 will also mark the the 10th anniversary of the iPhone‚Äôs debut, so it holds some significance for Apple fans. Other speculative features that Apple may include with its next-generation handset include a new glass back built into a metal frame for the phone‚Äôs body; a new, curved, OLED display for the flagship 5.5 inch model; an underscreen light sensor with reduced bezel size, and no home button. With the iPhone 7 not really impressing the fans, what would you like to see Apple include in its next-generation device?
