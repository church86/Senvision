Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 12:55 PM, April 28, 2017 NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO - Growing tensions with North Korea should worry global electronics firms such as Apple Inc as they source key parts from South Korea, but investors are brushing off such concerns and snapping up shares in key exporters, heartened by robust earnings and big investment plans. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday in an interview with Reuters that a major conflict with North Korea is possible in the standoff over its nuclear and missile programs, though he would prefer a diplomatic resolution. South Korea, a U.S. ally and home to major electronics parts makers such as Samsung Electronics, LG Display and SK Hynix, would be particularly vulnerable to any military attack from its northern neighbor. Any interruptions to operations could significantly disrupt global manufacturing of smartphones, televisions, computers and tablets. South Korea supplies more than half of components such as memory chips and flat screens. Despite escalating tensions, investors are pouring money into South Korea's financial market, and companies are flocking to the stock market to raise billions of dollars. "This is mainly just chest-thumping behavior on the part of North Korea and President Trump, but I don't think it will be anything more than that," said Geoff Pazzanese, a senior portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York. Pazzanese, who owns large positions in Samsung and chipmaker Hynix, said he would be a buyer if the market sold off as a result of a North Korean nuclear test, partly because the Trump administration has reaffirmed its military support for South Korea. For a graphic on South Korean firms' key domestic manufacturing sites, click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/NORTHKOREA-SOUTHKOREA-SUPPLYCH... Seoul's stock market has climbed 9 percent so far this year to near record highs, helped by strong earnings by major exporters including Samsung Electronics, which rose 3 percent to a life-time high on Friday after reporting its highest profit in more than three years. Earlier this week, Hynix and LG Display, both Apple suppliers, reported record quarterly profits and sounded upbeat for the remainder of the year. "The tension might mean some sentimental risk more than fundamental risk," said John Teng, an equity analyst at Janus Capital Group in Singapore. "It might potentially push their customers to restocking earlier, in terms of component inventory. Memory suppliers, they are very disciplined in terms of capacity expansion." Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic advisor at the Allianz Group, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Friday that investors should take a more critical look at their exposure, but had been conditioned to set aside such risks. "And they have been rewarded well by markets for doing so." he added. South Koreans have grown used to the threat of conflict with the North after decades of bellicose rhetoric from Pyongyang, and the companies remained unruffled on Friday. "We think talk of conflict is speculative, and we do not have any plans to react to the current situation," LG Electronics said in a statement. Hyundai Motor, the country's top automaker, said it had detailed contingency plans to ensure business carried on under various situations but couldn't disclose them. RATIONING Any military conflict on the Korean peninsula could have a dramatic effect on the memory chip market in particular, as Samsung's and Hynix's main operations are clustered in South Korea. The pair control nearly 50 percent of the flash memory market, and almost two thirds of DRAM chips, widely used in computers, making it almost impossible for customers to find alternative supplies quickly. As supply of those chips are already tight, any interruptions to their manufacturing operations might cause large customers such as Apple and Lenovo to trigger a contractual term known as an "allocation" to get more of their suppliers' limited supply, according to industry executives. Those fights often get ugly, with corporate giants throwing their weight around with suppliers, said Trevor Schick, a former supply chain executive at H-P Enterprise and Motorola Mobility. "In the memory world, the minute things go into allocation, everyone is in a fight for who gets into the allocation. Scale plays a big role in that," Schick said. "Most contracts have a formula for how the allocation happens. But when it does, everyone from the big companies gets on planes to Asia to get in front of those CEOs and lay out their case as to why they should get the memory." Samsung, Hynix and LG Display declined to comment. Apple declined to comment. The ultimate beneficiaries of supply interruptions in South Korea would likely be Japan's Toshiba Corp, and U.S. firms Micron Technology Inc and Western Digital Corp. Toshiba’s production is mostly in Japan, while Micron’s is clustered in the United States and Singapore. But the geopolitical wild card could be China, Schick said. "If something did happen in Korea, the massive impact would be in China. Most of that memory goes from Korea into China to be made into tablets, phones and computers,” Schick said. The vast majority of Apple's iPhones, for example, are manufactured in China by its partner Foxconn.

Following recent rumours of Apple delaying the launch of its next iPhone, another report coming from the financial newspaper Nikkei suggests that Apple is, in fact, likely to push the launch this year due to supply issues for display, wireless charging and printed circuit boards.   As per the report quoting sources familiar with the development,  “The production of iPhone’s 10th-anniversary range has hit a snag as suppliers struggle to perfect key components including the display, wireless charging and printed circuit boards."   To further explain, Apple is struggling to procure enough displays from Samsung which it is likely to use in its next iPhone. While quoting Arthur Liao of Taipei-based Fubon Securities, the report further suggests that Apple is struggling to cope up with overheating issues on its wireless charging modules. If you are not aware, Apple is expected to bring wireless charging and OLED displays to its next iPhone.   Apart from this, the Cupertino-based giant is also struggling with mass production of model circuit boards, as per IDC analyst Sean Kao, the report adds.    However, justifying this Sean Kao says - “There is a new design for a much smaller printed circuit board to allow a more powerful battery for this upcoming iPhone”. So, if the statement from Kao is to be true, the next iPhone will, indeed, come with a new design. Meanwhile, a recent schematics leak suggested that Apple is planning to implement a vertical dual-camera setup at the back and might embed the fingerprint scanner underneath the display because we didn’t spot any fingerprint cutout at the rear and given Apple is planning to come with a bezel-less display, this might turn into reality.   The above image is for representative purposes only.

In 2013, Apple shifted gears and saw the Mac Pro as an iconic desktop system with great performance if one shared the company’s vision for both industrial design and OpenCL. Now, it appears that Apple sees the Mac Pro as a platform that will support its future initiatives. Can Apple hold to that pattern? That abiding faith in high end computation and visualization? A new trademark filing suggests Apple now sees the light. Soon, you could be joining detective Dixon Hill on your own holodeck. On your own Mac. Image credit: Paramount. Apple’s recent detachment from the Mac, especially the Mac Pro, suggests that very busy Apple executives have been obsessed with mobility, the iPhone, and MacBook Pros. Perhaps it was felt that there were no new challenges on the horizon for the venerable Mac, such as it has been, now 33 years old. And yet. The technologies of the future all seem to relate, eventually to visualization whether it’s AR or VR or just good old-fashioned 2D cinema. While many of Apple’s competitors were focusing on advances in computation, design, CAD, holography, VR and some AR, Apple became immersed in, and distracted by, the iPhone as its major money maker. That may be changing. An Interesting Mac Pro Trademark Filing This article at Patently Apple suggests that Apple has shifted gears and now realizes that developers need more than a dual-core MacBook Pro and a single external display. The technologies that are emerging, autonomous systems, AIs, robots, gaming, simulations, navigation, 4K cinema, VR and AR all need massive computational and graphics power. If Apple doesn’t supply it, other companies are keen to seize the market. Here’s the article of interest Apple has interestingly updated their ‘Mac Pro’ Trademark to Cover Augmented Reality Displays, Smartglasses and more The gist of that article is that Apple has greatly expanded the associated terms in the Mac Pro trademark to include the key technologies of the future. Here’s one of several key observations from that article: So what’s changed in Apple’s latest trademark filing for the Mac Pro? A lot has changed. Anytime Apple floods their international class with a ton of boiler plate filler, you know that their trying to hide something by presenting a confusing soup of possibilities. Yet some of the entries in their filing definitely stand out, if not scream out, as real possibilities. The most interesting one of all is mentioning ‘augmented reality displays,” because Apple has a patent for such a device and we know that Apple’s Augmented Reality team just keeps growing with all-star engineers. The displays could also be a part of a headset or smartglasses that could be powered by the Mac Pro. Rethinking the Mac Pro Future Apple recent fiasco with the LG UltraFine 5K display showed Apple that depending others to fill out its product line and corporate  vision just won’t do. Professionals were a bit taken aback by Apple’s half-way measure of the 2016 MacBook Pro and the LG displays, and I surmise Apple executives realized they could do better at building complete systems that would fulfill the needs and aspirations of advanced professionals. That, by the way requires one big, bad boy graphics unit that no consumer Mac on the drawing board supports. Putting a “pro” label on a consumer Mac with Core i5/i7 CPUs and a GPU that won’t melt a thin 27-inch display doesn’t cut it. On the other hand, competitors have gotten really good at putting together very high end, technically amazing systems with Windows 10 or Linux that put stylish Macs to shame. HP’s computational monster. Up to a TB of RAM and very high end graphics. Image credit: HP It appears that Apple will soon be back in the business of meeting the desktop needs both for the pros and the developers that Apple depends on to create the consumer platforms and products of the future. Here’s hoping that Apple can sustain that momentum after it ships the 2018 Mac Pro.

Buy Apple Gear Instead Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin 1 minute read Apr 27th, 2017 5:35 PM EDT | Cool Stuff Found Do you have United frequent flyer miles, but don’t want to risk being dragged bloody and battered from a United flight? It turns out you can buy Apple gear with your United miles. United’s MileagePlus program has an entire Apple Store that allows you to trade your miles for iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, Apple TVs, and even accessories. For instance, a 32GB iPad Pro (9.7-inch) Wi-Fi model is currently 79,900 miles. An aluminum Apple Watch with a Sport Band is 53,200 miles. AirPods are 21,200 miles, while MacBook Pros start at 173,200 miles. The store shops like Apple’s own, allowing you to choose options and configure your device as you want it. Plus, you won’t get thrown off a flight, thrown to the floor, or dragged out by your feet, which counts as a big win in my book. [Update: @markelp noted that Mileage Plus members with “status” get better deals on this gear. He noted, for instance, that the same Apple Watch I mentioned is 49,900 miles.] Check It Out: Have United Miles, But Don’t Want to Fly the (Un)Friendly Skies? Buy Apple Gear Instead Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Print Tumblr 8 Comments Add a comment geoduck April 27, 2017 I’m not on any “miles” program with United or anyone else. I fly so seldom it’s just not worth bothering with. Where3 did you get that picture? It’s great. I wonder if it’s Photoshop or actual vandalism. April 27, 2017 at 6:37 EDT PM ibuck April 27, 2017 C’mon, Bryan. The regional airline (operating as United Express) made a bad, late decision to insist 4 pilots had to ride that plane, displacing already boarded passengers. Then one of United’s gate people messed up, undoubtedly due to company restrictions on denied boarding compensation (a management policy mistake). And there were top management screwups in the aftermath. A bunch of mistakes, to be sure, but eventually there were changes in procedures. But it was Chicago’s airport police who physically removed and injured the passenger. It’s unfair to lay the whole incident on United. The airline did not direct the police to batter and bloody the passenger. A passenger who refused to follow the airline’s orders and police orders. And we all know that there are passengers who refuse to follow safety guidelines every single day and/or are passively or actively aggressive. Do we want these uncooperative acts to become even more widespread? Delaying or causing cancellation to our flight? Or just making our flight miserable? Continuing to batter United doesn’t serve anyone. If United’s traffic falls off or they lose revenue and go out of business, it will adversely affect the public because lessened competition will make seats on flights a lot more scarce, and that will push seats closer together and raise airfares. If Apple asked the police to remove someone from their store who was preventing the operation of that store, would you similarly pile on Apple if the police injured him/her? The airline made changes after the incident. And you can be sure all major US airlines made similar adjustments. As did airport police. Wouldn’t you want that after Apple screws up? April 27, 2017 at 6:40 EDT PM Bryan Chaffin April 27, 2017 geoduck, I added (stock) handprints to a stock photo. April 27, 2017 at 7:23 EDT PM geoduck April 27, 2017 Thanks Bryan. iBuck: You make a good point, but only to a point. Very true this was a particularly egregious episode made worse by execrable decisions at every level. However it is typical of the kind of attitude and abuse, albeit at a lower level, ALL US airlines give to ALL passengers ALL the time. It is why I do everything in my power to not fly commercial. You ask rhetorically “If Apple asked the police to remove someone from their store who was preventing the operation of that store, would you similarly pile on Apple if the police injured him/her?” If Apple had a history of treating its customers in such a shabby way then yes. Yes I would. Maybe it’s time people stood up and demanded respect from the airlines. Maybe a few flights need to be disrupted, even cancelled. Maybe a few airlines need to go bankrupt. Whatever it takes. all I know I do not fly commercial, and when I do it is not on a US carrier. I refuse to be treated like cattle. I refuse to be treated like a criminal suspect. I refuse to be disrespected by their ilk. April 27, 2017 at 9:42 EDT PM ibuck April 28, 2017 geoduck, I hear your frustration and agree that airlines should treat passengers better. I don’t fly as often as i used to do, because it has become such a hassle, no matter the airline. Their policies have exasperated many travelers, with fees and penalties to boot. Maybe, just maybe the tipping point has been reached, and more passenger friendly actions will follow. Check out United’s pledged changes: April 28, 2017 at 12:53 EDT AM Scott B in DC April 28, 2017 @ibuck, the problem is that United told their regional carrier to transport their pilots to Louisville. United holds the contract and manages the contract. Their liasons set the rules and follow what the airline tells them to do. This is how it works when a regional flies with the tail logo of a larger airlines. Both are culpable. That is how the industry works. Sorry, if you do not understand that! April 28, 2017 at 12:55 EDT AM ibuck April 28, 2017 Here’s the United link that didn’t load April 28, 2017 at 12:56 EDT AM ibuck April 28, 2017 Scott, I think you may have misconstrued my initial comment above. Obviously they were both at fault, as were the Chicago police. What we all seem to want is for the airlines to return to treating us like valued customers. And United’s changes seem a step in the right direction. April 28, 2017 at 1:09 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

The partnership will see Apple Music supply the song clips in the Musical.ly application, which allows users to create their own videos singing along to popular songs. Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover Currently, Musical.ly receives its songs from U.K.-based provider 7digital. The switch to Apple Music, however, will officially occur on Friday. With the changeover, Apple Music subscribers will be able to listen to full songs in the Musical.ly application, whereas non-subscribers will only get brief clips of songs. For Musical.ly, the deal with Apple will allow it to expand from 30 countries to 120 countries. Meanwhile, for Apple, it gives it another way to market Apple Music and continue to grow its user base. Users will be able to easily subscribe to Apple Music and allow Apple to promote the paid tier of the service. Apple’s extensive licensing deals will allow Musical.ly to expand the number of countries it supports from 30 to 120.

The company, based out of Shanghai, raised $100 million at a $500 million valuation last year. The app allows users to create their own music videos, set to any song they like. For instance, users can sing along to a song, dance, and more. Once a user has created their video, they can share it with friends and to other social media networks. Apple’s partnership with Musical.ly comes as the company continues to grow Apple Music.

The commission ordered Apple to pay Ireland €13 billion in unpaid taxes after finding that tax authorities had granted the tech giant a “selective advantage” which allowed it reduce its Irish tax bill. The decision, which Apple and the Irish government have appealed, centred on two “open-ended” tax opinions given to Apple by Revenue in 1991 and 2007 which, the EU found, constituted state aid. Revenue said it provided such opinions to assist customers in understanding and complying with their obligations under the law.

Now it seems that thanks to a recent update to its Mac Pro trademark, Apple has hinted at possible AR plans for the future. Spotted by the folks at Patently Apple, Apple’s update to the Mac Pro trademark in Hong Kong reads, “augmented reality displays, goggles, controllers, and headsets; 3D spectacles”. As pointed out by AppleInsider, trademark registrations demand that information about a product covers not only what it can do now, but what it could do in the future. However as they also point out, the fact that it is so comprehensive could also be just Apple’s way of covering their bases should a lawsuit arise in the future. That being said, we know that Apple is working on revamping the Mac Pro lineup. The company recently confirmed that they are “rethinking” the Mac Pro, but exactly what will this entail remains to be seen. We’re not sure how AR would work on a desktop computer like the Mac Pro, but like we said Apple’s interest in the technology has been pretty well-established and we’ll just have to wait and see.

This is why it’s not surprising that Apple is doing the same thing with Apple Music. The company has recently announced an upcoming documentary for musician Puff Daddy dubbed “Bad Boy” which will be exclusive to the Apple Music platform. Basically this documentary will chronicle Puff Daddy’s rise to fame to become one of the biggest names not just as a hip-hop artist, but also as a music producer. Speaking to Billboard, Apple Music exec Jimmy Iovine said, “I think Puff and Bad Boy’s story is incredible and one that a lot of people can relate to in any genre or in any business. His story is powerful. He really overcame a lot to get to where he’s at today and the documentary shows that.” He also adds that Apple has more content planned for the future that could be similar in nature. “We have a bunch of other stuff that we can’t talk about yet because the deals aren’t’ done.” Recently it was revealed that iOS 11 would be introducing (another) revamp to Apple Music where it would focus more on video content.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Photos Of Apple’s Self-Driving Test Vehicle Surfaces By Tyler Lee on 04/27/2017 18:34 PDT Image credit – Bloomberg By now it is hardly a secret that Apple is interested in self-driving cars. Not too long ago the California DMV granted Apple permission to test self-driving cars on the road, and thanks to a report from Bloomberg, they have managed to obtain photos of Apple’s self-driving test car in action. In case you’re unfamiliar with your cars, the test car that Apple appears to be using is a Lexus RX450h SUV. The vehicle came kitted out with a bunch of sensors which will probably be used to help gather data and also to help the vehicle navigate around autonomously. Some of the sensors includes two radar, a bunch of cameras, and Velodyne Lidar’s 64-bit channel lidar. Bloomberg quotes an industry expert who claims that these products appear to be bought off the shelf as opposed to being custom-made, so it is possible that maybe Apple is still in the early stages of testing, although unsurprisingly the company declined to comment. We have heard that Apple was interested in the technology, and at one point we even heard that they wanted to build their own cars. However a later report suggested that Apple had given up trying to build its own cars and instead would focus on the technology behind it instead. Exactly what will this result in remains to be seen.

When Samsung comes out with a new model, we like to put it up against the best that its archrival, Apple can produce. Because the Galaxy S8 Plus only has a larger display, we decided to look at the base Galaxy S8 and how it stacks up to the iPhone 7 Plus. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is a solidly built device, with a fast processor, but the problem we Android lovers have with the iPhone is its restrictive iOS. These two devices could not be more different in their specifications or design philosophy, but we will look and see just what common threads we can find. The iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy S8 look nothing like one another inside or out. The iPhone 7 is typical looking smartphone with an all-metal design with large bezels all around, whereas the Galaxy S8 is an all glass design with a new Infinity Display that has no bezels on the right or left and only small ones at the top and bottom. Even though the Galaxy S8’s display is .3-inches larger, the device itself is 10mm shorter and 9mm narrower and weighs 33 grams less than the iPhone 7 Plus. Besides the size of the display, they use a different technology and different resolutions. When it comes to processors, the iPhone 7 Plus uses its own Apple A10 Fusion while the Samsung Galaxy S8 uses the newest Snapdragon 835 octa-core 10nm processor in the US model, although the Samsung Exynos 8895 octa-core 10nm processor is used in other markets. The iPhone offers 32GB, 128GB, or 256GB of fixed internal storage while the Galaxy S8 offers 64GB of expandable UFS 2.1 storage. The primary cameras are both 12MP – although the Galaxy S8 uses a Dual Pixel variety. The front-facing cameras (FFC) are only a megapixel a part – 7MP on the iPhone 7 Plus and 8MP on the Galaxy S8. Both will provide you with excellent photos and social media selfies. They both use a non-removable battery, but the Galaxy S8 offers rapid charge and quick wireless charging. They both provide a fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and authorizing mobile payments – the iPhone only offers Apple Pay while the Galaxy S8 provides Android Pay and Samsung Pay. They both have the usual suspects – WiFi, Bluetooth (iPhone with v4.2 and S8 with v5.0), GPS, and NFC (the iPhone’s is only good for Apple Pay), and they each have a connector for charging and data transfer but the Apple plug is proprietary, and the Galaxy S8 uses a standard reversible Type-C port. Please take a thoughtful look at the detailed Specifications Comparison chart below, and here you will see just how these two great devices stack up against one another – click on the “View Full Comparison” link at the end of the chart to expand the details. After that, we will look at each device in greater depth and point out some of its pros and cons. From all of this information, we will try to determine the winner based on specs and execution of design and functions. Specifications Apple iPhone 7 Plus The Apple iPhone 7 Plus looks very similar to its predecessor, the iPhone 6s Plus, with the usual enhancements throughout the device. This will quickly become a problem for Apple with all of the new bezel-less designs and curved displays hitting the market, as the iPhone is very quickly looking ‘dated’ when viewed side-by-side a newer flagship. Apple did a little maintenance work of the outside of the 7 Plus by moving the antenna positioning to the outside edges for a cleaner look, and the old physical Home button is now touch-sensitive with no moving parts. What remains are large bezels everywhere. Apple introduced 3D Touch on the iPhone 6 and made improves to both it and the Display Zoom – great features that appear on a typical looking smartphone. Apple added stereo speakers, but took away the 3.5mm earphone jack and now you must go through the Lightning plug adaptor or turn to Bluetooth earphones. The processor is much improved and is still a standout for speed and stability. Apple finally added IP67 dust and water resistance, but did not go that extra mile to IP68. They added a dual camera only on the iPhone 7 Plus. Let’s take a look and see just how the iPhone 7 Plus holds up to the new Samsung Galaxy 8. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus sports a 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD display with a Full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and 401 pixels-per-inch (PPI.) Apple improved the 3D Touch feature that allows the user to press a finger, with varying degrees of force, to make multiple selections. The processor is their new Apple A10 Fusion quad-core clocked at 2.23GHz and coupled to a PowerVR Series 7XT Plus six-core graphics processor. The iPhone 7 Plus packs only 3GB of DDR4 RAM and comes with 32GB of internal memory as standard. The memory is not expandable, but you can purchase a 128GB or 256GB model. Apple has still refused to drop in 4GB of RAM, although for all that the iOS will allow the user to do, 3GB is probably enough. We are glad to see that after all of these years, Apple finally eliminated the 16GB option, which was a complete waste. Even with 32GB, why is Apple so afraid to include expandable memory? Only on the iPhone 7 Plus does Apple include the dual cameras. There are new dual 12MP sensors – one for wide-angle with a larger f/1.8 aperture and one for telephoto shots with a much smaller, f/2.8 aperture. The dual cameras use phase detection autofocus (PDAF), Quad-LED dual-tone flash, and OIS. For its FFC the iPhone 7 Plus uses a 7MP sensor with an aperture of f/2.2 for selfies and FaceTime. It uses a 2900mAh non-removable battery to supply power and Apple still offers no form of rapid charging for their batteries, which is another area that Apple really needs to address. The new Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with many internal refinements – a much improved processor, a dual-camera (Plus model only), improved camera lens, and Quad LED flash. Apple then improved the 3D Touch, improved the stereo sound and increased the volume, improved Home button, and added IP67 dust and water resistance. They increased the RAM from 2GB to 3GB, did away with the 16GB model, and now offer 32GB of non-expandable memory as the smallest amount available. Those refinements are in a design that is physically outdated looking. Apple has removed their 3.5mm earphone plug in what appears to be an increasing trend. They supplied an adapter for you to use with regular earphones or you can switch to Bluetooth earphones to avoid lugging around the extra dongle. The iPhone 7 Plus measures 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm and weighs in at 188 grams. Apple still uses its proprietary plugs and ecosystem services like iTunes, Apple Pay, iMessage, and FaceTime, making it increasingly difficult for iPhone users to communicate with Android folks. Pricing starts out at $770 for the 32GB model and will cost you $870 for the 128GB model. Samsung Galaxy S8 The new Samsung Galaxy S8 is a refreshing change of pace – Samsung actually made their new flagship look and act nothing like its predecessor. The flat display on the Galaxy S7 is gone as Samsung introduces us to their new Infinity Display that seamlessly wraps around the sides of the device. No more side bezels and the top and bottom bezels are almost non-existent, allowing Samsung to squeeze much more display into a smaller area. Samsung got rid of their physical ‘Home’ button and it is now an on-display key. The lower part of the display now has 3D Touch capabilities and when pressed and the ‘Home’ as well as the ‘Back’ and ‘App’ keys magically appear on the lower part of the display. The fingerprint sensor was moved to the back of the device, near the camera lens, but the Galaxy S8 gives us facial recognition and an iris scanner to unlock the device. The new Galaxy S8 is a real beauty, even more so than the ‘Edge’ display. However, does it have the specs to beat the iPhone 7 Plus? Let’s check out the Galaxy S8 to see where it stands. The Galaxy S8 has a new and larger 5.8-inch Infinity Display that uses the Super AMOLED QHD+ display with a resolution of 2960 x 1440 pixels and 570 PPI. The display uses a 18.5:9 aspect ratio making it taller and slightly narrower and taking up 83.6-percent of the front of the phone. The Galaxy S8 retains the ‘always-on’ screen to help save battery life and makes it easy and quick to check notifications. The newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core 10nm processor clocked at 2.35GHz and an Adreno 540 GPU are used in the models destined for the US. In other countries, the Galaxy S8 will use Samsung’s Exynos 8895 octa-core 10nm processor with four cores clocked at 1.7GHz and four cores clocked at 2.3GHz. The Galaxy S8 packs 4GB of DDR4 RAM and has 64GB of the faster UFS 2.1 expandable memory via a microSD card. Samsung used the same camera from the Galaxy S7 with a Dual Pixel 12MP sensor and instead concentrated on making advancements to their imaging software. They kept the same f/1.7, 26mm, PDAF, LED flash, auto HDR and OIS. Samsung did increase the FFC from a 5MP to an 8MP sensor and added its own autofocus while retaining its wide-angle lens, the same f/1.7 aperture, and Live HDR. The camera area should continue to take great pictures, but it is odd that Samsung did nothing to the primary camera’s hardware. Samsung also kept the same sized non-removable 3000mAh battery that features Quick Charge and still offers Quick Wireless Charging. The Galaxy S8 is packed full of ‘extras’ – it has the better IP68 certification rating against dust and water; it sports a heart rate monitor and oxygen saturation sensor. Samsung’s long-established S-Health is still there but is now called Samsung Health. You will find a new Samsung Connect feature to tie together Samsung’s appliances, SmartTVs, thermostats and other IoT (Internet of Things). Samsung’s new Bixby personal assistant works a lot like Google Assistant, but also uses the camera to help answer your questions. If you point it at a historical building, it will tell you the history of the place or aim it at a sign in a foreign language, and Bixby will translate it for you. Another new feature is the DeX Station that will interface the Galaxy S8 with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse for a desktop experience. The Galaxy S8 can use both Android Pay as well as Samsung Pay, which will allow Galaxy S8 users more flexibility to make mobile purchases just about anywhere a merchant can swipe a credit or debit card. The Galaxy S8 will come with Android Nougat 7.0 and then be followed by a quick upgrade. It measures 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm, weighs in at 155 grams, is available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, Arctic Silver, Coral Blue, and Maple Gold depending where you are located. The Galaxy S8 will cost about $720 outright and is now available. …And The Winner Is… The Final Word The Galaxy S8 easily wins this comparison, as it is the more advanced device – both in design and specifications. This is not to put down the processor or GPU of the iPhone 7 Plus as they are both excellent, but the dated look, lack of features, and inflexibility of iOS are only more reasons the Galaxy S8 wins. The Galaxy S8 has a larger and better display, more RAM for true multi-tasking, 64GB of storage, but expandable memory, and an excellent camera. It has the always-on display feature, better water resistance, a fast charging battery, wireless charging, and can make mobile payments at more places than the iPhone. The iPhone 7 Plus is a nice device, but you are limited by its iOS to customize your smartphone experience. It is outdated in looks and other than the processor/GPU, it has less of everything, yet will cost you $50 more than the Galaxy S8 and give you 32GB less of memory.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Cars Image Source: Niels Epting First-ever photos of Apple’s self-driving test car surface online Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 27th, 2017 at 6:48 PM Share Tweet After many months shrouded in secrecy, concrete information regarding Apple’s plans in the automotive space are finally starting to leak out. While Apple’s initial plans may have centered on developing and manufacturing an Apple-branded car from scratch, Apple in recent months is said to have narrowed the scope of Project Titan to focus more on autonomous vehicle technology. Don't Miss: There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 Far from idle speculation, Apple earlier this month applied for and received a permit to test driverless cars in the state of California. And a few months before that, Apple penned a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) indicating that it is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation” and that they are “excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” More recently, details from Apple’s permit application to the California DMV emerged and revealed that Apple outfitted three Lexus vehicles with self-driving software and hardware. Earlier this afternoon, Bloomberg obtained photos of the Lexus vehicles Apple has outfitted with a wide array of sensors. The white Lexus RX450h SUV emerged from an Apple facility this week and was kitted out with an array of sensors, according to a person who saw the vehicle and provided photos to Bloomberg News. The sensors included Velodyne Lidar Inc.’s top-of-the-range 64-channel lidar, at least two radar and a series of cameras. The sensors appear to be products bought off the shelf from suppliers, rather than custom-made, according to an industry expert who saw the photos. Two such photos are featured below.

Apple received a permit in California earlier this month so it could start testing Lexus cars with self-driving technology, and already, Apple has been spotted driving around the Silicon Valley area. Bloomberg News posted footage of a white Lexus RX450h crossover outfitted with the usual sensors and hardware you'd see on a self-driving car. Most of it appears to be third party, including a Velodyne-made LIDAR sensor. Apple Car: What's the story so far on Project Titan? You can also see two radar units and several cameras, as noted by Bloomberg. We don't know what Apple is doing with this car or what types of data it is collecting, but we imagine the vehicle is part of its secret Project Titan autonomous car unit. That project originally started with a lofty ambition: Apple wanted to develop its own self-driving car, but now, it's scaled back and focusing on autonomous software. Will Apple let car maker add its autonomous software one day? Who knows. All we know is that Apple declared in a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last December that it was “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation”.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Apple’s self-driving Lexus test SUV spotted in Silicon Valley Brittany A. Roston - Apr 27, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Earlier this month, word surfaced that Apple had both applied for and been granted a permit to test self-driving vehicular technology on public roads in California. Following that, someone has spotted a Lexus vehicle fitted with autonomous technology that Apple is using to conduct tests, though none of it appears to contain any Apple-centric gadgets. The vehicle’s presence follows the release of apparent training documents from Apple that detail a trio of 2015 Lexus RX450h SUVs being used as testing vehicles. It has long been rumored that Apple is working on its own car project, though reports and sources have varied at times and word, as of now, has it that things have been rough behind closed doors. Speculation at one point indicated that Apple had ceased work on the so-called Project Titan automotive effort, but that later changed and, most recently, all signs point toward the company testing self-driving technologies. At this point it isn’t clear what exactly Apple is up to. It is possible that Apple has an actual self-driving vehicle in the pipeline, but there’s no reason to make that leap at this time. It is just as likely that the company is testing autonomous vehicle technologies for a different reason. Regardless, it appears that Apple testing vehicles are now on the road, each of them with two humans onboard, and one was spotted in the wild. The photos were sent to Bloomberg, which has published two of them plus a short GIF. According to the publication, an expert who was shown the photos said the technology on board appears to be off-the-shelf and not proprietary to Apple. The technology is said to include two or more radars, a bunch of cameras, and a 64-channel lidar. Apple, to no one’s surprise, has not commented on the photos.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Please let this iPhone wireless charging feature actually exist Chris Smith BGR News April 27, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share It may not happen with this year’s iPhone 8, but Apple dreams of charging its future products with the help of conventional Wi-Fi routers or even other Apple products. The technology would not only offer a way for various devices to potentially be used as wireless chargers but would also fix the most annoying thing about wireless charging nowadays: You still have to place a device in the proximity of a charging mat or device. Don't Miss: After two weeks with the Galaxy S8, I still think the iPhone 7 Plus is the world’s best phone Early iPhone 8 rumors suggested the iPhone will feature wireless charging powers unlike anything currently seen on mobile devices. That’s long-range wireless charging support that would allow an iPhone owner to keep using a device while the battery would recharge wirelessly. Multiple reports have shot down that rumor, and more recent leaks do not mention anything about long-range support, although the iPhone 8 is still expected to feature wireless charging. The US Patent & Trademark Office, meanwhile, published on Thursday an Apple patent application titled Wireless Charging and Communications Systems With Dual-Frequency Patch Antennas that describes antenna technology that would support simultaneous wireless charging and Wi-Fi support on a device. First discovered by Apple Insider, the patent doesn’t specifically mention the iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. And the drawings do not show anything resembling any of these devices. But the patent’s wording indicates that the wireless charging technology described herein can apply to a variety of Apple gadgets, not just the iPhone. Apple’s choice of words practically covers any device currently made by Apple, but also future gadgets that are yet to be unveiled: Device 10A and/or device 10B may be a computing device such as a laptop computer, a computer monitor containing an embedded computer, a tablet computer, a cellular telephone, a media player, or other handheld or portable electronic device, a smaller device such as a wrist-watch device, a pendant device, a headphone or earpiece device, a device embedded in eyeglasses or other equipment worn on a user’s head, or other wearable or miniature device, a television, a computer display that does not contain an embedded computer, a gaming device, a navigation device, an embedded system such as a system in which electronic equipment with a display is mounted in a kiosk or automobile, equipment that implements the functionality of two or more of these devices, or other electronic equipment. What’s interesting about this type of ambiguous language is that it also seem to indicate that Apple may be thinking about peer-to-peer wireless charging. For example, a MacBook connected to a power source might recharge an iPhone in the future. The technology might even allow iPhone owners to share battery power in the future. Read More The patent explains that the devices may communicate wirelessly over Wi-Fi or cellular connection and that the same frequencies used for getting online or connecting to a carrier’s network might also be used for wirelessly charging a battery or providing energy to a device. The patent describes dual-frequency dual-polarization patch antennas that “may be used in beam steering arrays” and which may be used for “wireless power transfer at microwave frequencies or other frequencies and may be used to support millimeter wave communications.” What’s interesting about these patch antennas is that they would be flat components placed over a flat metal surface inside a device. Earlier this week, a leaked iPhone 8 schematic showed what seemed to be the location of the phone’s future wireless charging coil — see that big patch under the Apple logo in the image above? Again, there’s nothing to suggest the iPhone 8 will sport such wireless charging tech. Even if the iPhone 8 would support it, you’d still need a second device to sport the same time of hardware so that long-range wireless charging would actually work.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry Trump to Meet With Apple’s Top Manufacturing Partner Foxconn, Likely to Discuss US Investment By Rafia Shaikh 8 hours ago 15Shares Share Tweet Submit Trump's meeting with Silicon Valley tech giants - December, 2016 President Trump has remained critical of Cupertino tech giant’s manufacturing its products out of the country and has pushed Apple to build all-American products. The President is now expected to meet with Foxconn – Apple’s primary iPhone factory partner. This information comes from Nikkie that reported today that Trump will be having a meeting with Terry Gou, the chairman of Foxconn, “in Washington on Thursday, according to people familiar with the plan”. Taiwanese tycoon is reportedly meeting with Trump today Foxconn is one of Apple’s top manufacturing partners that employs over 1 million people in China, assembling products for Apple and other companies. While it is unclear what the two will talk about, Apple had asked both Pegatron and Foxconn to explore bringing some of the manufacturing processes in the United States. Foxconn had shown interested in building a factory in the United States for making flat-screen display panels, however, plans about an “All-American iPhone” are still unclear and according to experts highly unlikely due to increased costs. Related A Prominent Wireless Charging Tech Company CEO Calls Wireless Charging a “Standard Feature in the Next iPhone” The sources did not disclose details of the first-ever encounter between the two. But with Trump’s persistent pledge to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., and Gou’s dogged determination to acquire the memory chip business of embattled Japanese conglomerate Toshiba, the two will likely exchange their views on related issues. According to the report, Gou was able to secure the meeting with Trump “with help from his friend SoftBank Group Chairman Masayoshi Son,” who met with the president back in New York following his election win last year. Gou had also reportedly met with Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, during the Taiwanese billionaire’s visit to Washington in February. Advertisement Something to do with Toshiba’s memory business? Foxconn is currently trying to acquire Toshiba’s NAND storage business to get into the semiconductor industry – expected to be on the agenda of today’s meeting too. The report suggests that since Toshiba’s NAND business has possible national security implications for the United States, Foxconn – with its Chinese ties – may not be able to acquire it. Related Scammers Are Piggybacking iCloud Hack Stories – Tricking People to Give Up Login Details Industry sources have said that Washington is involved and being consulted on Toshiba’s plans to sell its semiconductor unit and Westinghouse, its American nuclear unit which owns military grade reactor technology, as the fate of both businesses has implications for U.S. national security. President Trump had campaigned to bring back jobs to America, specifically focusing on Apple outsourcing most of its production to Asian companies. After his election win, President Trump had offered Tim Cook “very large tax cuts“. I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ Gou is likely to please the new President by offering to bring some manufacturing facilities to the US and possibly getting help on the taxes and Toshiba front, in return. However, citing people familiar with the matter, Nikkie said that the Taiwanese manufacturer “is unlikely to become the new owner of Toshiba’s memory business due to its Chinese-linked background”.

People familiar with the matter have said two of the shows are about two hip-hop labels Bad Boy Records and Cash Money Records and another is about music manager Clive Davis. Iovine sat down with Bloomberg to discuss the future of Apple Music in an interview, which he noted that he and his team will slowly grow the music service – instead of running full speed ahead with it. 'I don't know how to do it fast,' he told Bloombegr comparing this approach to how he founded Interscope in 1989, which went on to become one of the most successful labels in the world. 'A music service needs to be more than a bunch of songs and a few playlists,' Iovine also shared with Bloomberg. 'I'm trying to help Apple Music be an overall movement in popular culture, everything from unsigned bands to video. We have a lot of plans.' In a few months, the highly anticipated Carpool Karaoke is set to hit Apple Music for users to stream. The tech giant is also expected to release will.i.am's 'Planet of the Apps' by the end of the year and several documentaries. Sources told Bloomberg that Apple could introduce as many as 10 series this year – but the details have yet to be revealed nor has Apple confirmed the matter.

It'S believed that the content will be available for users who pay a $10-a-month fee to stream music from Apple Music, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm already offers these users access to 'Carpool Karakoke', which it bought last year Celebrity pairs including Alicia Keys and John Legend, Ariana Grande and Seth MacFarlane, and Blake Shelton and Chelsea Handler will be featured on the 16-episode series to be released weekly on Apple Music. A debut date has yet to be announced, but E! has reported that it will be later this year. Corden, who will appear with Will Smith on one episode, said he was proud The Late Late Show has created a segment that works so well it will stand on its own.  He has also met with Warner Bros. Television in regards to developing a show 'loosely based' on his business partner Dr. Dre. 'Apple Music is nowhere near complete in my head,' he says.

The Cupertino company has been in discussions about developing its own 'Venmo competitor', with the hopes of reviving its not so popular Apple Pay, according to Recode. It is believed that users would use digital debit cards linked to the service, which would let them use funds without waiting for the money to hit their bank account. Scroll down for video  Apple as been in discussions about developing its own 'Venmo competitor', with the hopes of reviving its not so popular Apple Pay. A digital debit card would be tied to their smartphones Apple Pay digital wallet APPLE'S NEW MOBILE-PAYMENT SERVICE  Apple has been in discussions about developing its own 'Venmo competitor', with the hopes of reviving its not so popular Apple Pay, according to Redcode.  A digital debit card would be tied to their smartphones Apple Pay digital wallet. Users would have access to funds on the card the moment it is sent - instead of waiting for the money to clear in their bank account. The hope is to convince more users to use Apple Pay, as sources inside a few major US banks told Redcode that the 'usage has been lighter than expected since it launched two and a half years ago.' Apple Pay was released to the iPhone 6 in 2014, allowing users to store their Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit cards in their smartphone. Users simply hold the phone up to a card reader and press their finger on the Touch ID button in order to confirm their identity. The idea is to have the phone act as the credit card – ultimately letting people toss out their wallets all together. Although Apple is ahead of its competitors, Apple Pay still does not seem like a home-run – it reported 86 million users this year, Samsung Pay has 34 million and Android Pay has 24 million. But Apple may be returning to an idea it tossed around in 2015 to attract more iOS users to the mobile-payment service. Multiple source familiar with the recent talks told Jason Del Rey with Redcode that Apple has been speaking with payments industry partners to create their own service to rival Venmo. Venmo, owned by PayPal, first hit the market in 2016 and lets users send money to each other in seconds. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Incredible ice cave in Transylvania reveals how Europe's...

Share this article Share Towards the end of last year, the app was on track to process $20 billion in payments. And it seems Apple wants a piece of the action. Once source familiar with the plans told Recode that the tech giant will announce its own service later this year. Users would have access to funds on the card the moment it is sent - instead of waiting for the money to clear in their bank account. Apple's service could pit it against the likes of Pay-Pal's Venmo app It was discovered that Apple has also been rubbing elbows with Visa in order to develop its own digital pre-paid debit cards that would run on the Visa network and be linked to the new payment service, the sources said. Users would have access to the money on the card the moment it is sent - instead of waiting for the funds to clear in their bank account. And the digital debit card would be tied to their smartphones Apple Pay digital wallet. The hope is to convince more users to use Apple Pay, as sources inside a few major US banks told Redcode that the 'usage has been lighter than expected since it launched two and a half years ago.' Gene Munster, who is a managing partner at Loup Ventures, a venture-capital firm specializing in tech research, recently told The Wall Street Journal that he estimates Apple saw $36 billion in 2016 Apple Pay transactions – he initially predicted of $207 billion. 'The pace of Apple Pay adoption has been 'disappointing even to conservative expectations,' he said. 'Just 13% of the estimated 680 million iPhone users have used Apple Pay, according to the research firm.' And one of the major causes for the low numbers is that Apple Pay is not widely accepted everywhere.    Read more: Apple is in talks to launch its own Venmo - Recode Apple Pay Promised to Make Plastic Obsolete.

The car, a white Lexus RX450h crossover, was spotted by a driver somewhere in the Silicon Valley area, and the footage was then passed along to Bloomberg News. The car appears to be outfitted with standard third-party sensors and hardware, including a Velodyne-made LIDAR sensor, two radar units and a number of cameras, according to Bloomberg. It’s unclear what type of data Apple is gathering here, given the secrecy of its Project Titan autonomous car unit. But we do know, from various reports and rumblings out of Cupertino, that Apple has ditched its ambitions to build an entirely new vehicle from scratch and has instead shifted focused to building autonomous software it could develop for existing car markers. Here's the car that #Apple's using to test its autonomous car technology.

By contrast, the newly renamed Ford Escape (nee Kuga) is a perennial underachiever, highly regarded critically but comparatively ignored by buyers. We want to investigate whether this discrepancy is justified. To do so, we’ve tested each model in its highest level of specification, with petrol engines that take the lion’s share of the segment. So we have the Hyundai Tucson Highlander versus the Ford Escape Titanium.   Pricing and specs There’s nothing in it in terms of price, with the Ford costing $44,990 before on-road costs and the Tucson listed at $45,450. Common equipment includes 19-inch alloy wheels; rear-view camera; front/rear parking sensors; front, side and curtain airbags; outboard ISOFIX anchors; and five-star ANCAP ratings (2017 date stamp for the Ford, 2015 for the Hyundai). Both also have proximity keys; 8.0-inch touch-screens; satellite-navigation with live traffic updates; Apple CarPlay/Android Auto (just added to the Hyundai as part of a running change); USB/Aux/12V; and Bluetooth phone and audio. Furthermore each has leather seats with electric adjustment and heating for front occupants; cruise control; LED cabin lighting; dual-zone climate control; glass roofs; electric tailgate; rain-sensing wipers; dusk-sensing headlights; privacy glass; and roof rails. Unique to the Hyundai Tucson as standard is Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB); blind-spot monitoring; lane assist; and rear cross-traffic alert. Note: all of these features can be had on the Ford Escape, but you’ll need to pay $1300 extra for the Tech Pack (we recommend you absolutely buy this, and we are disappointed that Ford isn’t offering it as standard), which also adds radar-guided cruise control and a tyre-pressure monitor. The Tucson alone also has a full-size spare wheel; electric seat adjustment for the front passenger; and seat cooling as well as heating. The Ford Escape’s unique standard features include an additional knee airbag; Emergency Assist; and a programmable MyKey. Winner: Hyundai, for its active safety tech and full-size spare. Just.    Cabin thoughts The Tucson’s rather austere interior design places the emphasis on practicality, ergonomics and quality rather than flair. There’s nothing adventurous going on, but key touch-points are pleasant for the tactile-minded and the plastics are well put together. Our test car had a 8.0-inch touchscreen with integrated sat-nav (up free updates for a stint), but in welcome news Hyundai has since added Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Connectivity includes an improved Bluetooth quality over the first iterations and two 12V inputs, though our tester still lacked Hyundai voice control (the new Apple/Android mirroring brings this). Audio Listen to the Bluetooth quality of the Ford Escape and Hyundai Tucson, and subscribe to the CarAdvice podcast here. We like the extensive amount of cabin storage in the doors and below the fascia, and the fact that unlike the Ford, the Hyundai gives you electric adjustment for the front passenger seat, plus ventilation for both front occupants. Australia needs this more than mere seat heating. The Ford Escape sports what is unmistakably a more distinctive interior design, though the trade-off for its ‘sportier’ feel is reduced knee room thanks to the protruding centre stack. And while the colour palette isn’t quite so monochrome, the materials feel cheaper and flimsier, especially the stuff flanking the screen and gear shifter. Our tester had a pillar squeak, coming from interior trim. The SYNC 3 system familiar from a host of other Ford is excellent, with conversational voice control and CarPlay/Android Auto, better navigation graphics and superior audio quality. You also get two USB inputs over the Tucson’s one. That chintzy blue-green font on the climate control is so 1986, though. We imagine the Ford has more immediate appeal, but Hyundai’s interior is the definition of a grower. Given the positioning of both of these vehicles as family-friendly offerings, the comfort in the back seats and the practicality of the cargo area is just as vital. The Tucson has a little more space in the back row than the Ford, and the hard plastic seat backs (while unpleasant to touch) are easier to keep clean and stop you poking the back of the driver/passenger with your knees. As with the Ford, the rear seats recline slightly, though unlike the new Volkswagen Tiguan, have no sliding function to liberate more useable cargo space or pull a child-seat closer to you, in the front. Amenities include rear air vents, individual LED reading lights for outboard occupants, hand grips, a flip-down centre armrest and big door pockets for bottles. Neither model here has levers to flip the back seats from the cargo area as offered in a Mazda CX-5 (which also has a more clever 40:20:40 folding seat configuration), though the Tucson gets maximum points for accommodating a full-size matching spare below the cargo floor. The Kuga offers less space for taller rear occupants, in terms of knee- and shoulder-room, though it’s hardly tight and will still accommodate two adults. You also get nifty little flip-up tables mounted to the front seat-backs, and while the glass roof isn’t as massive as the Hyundai’s unit, it does slide and tilt. All four windows are one-touch-operated though they’re smaller than the Hyundai’s and therefore the rear feels less spacious. As you can see, the larger part of the Ford’s 60:40 folding rear seats is on the kerb side, unlike the Hyundai which does it the other way. Amenities include individual LED reading lights, vents, grab handles, a flip-down centre armrest and bottle holders in the door As you can read in the table below, the Ford offers slightly less cargo space and no full-size spare, though, like the Tucson, its electric tailgate has a hands-free operation option for full hands. Winner: Hyundai, by the skin of its teeth.    Drivetrains The Ford clearly outguns the Hyundai when it comes to power, thanks to its 2.0-litre turbo-petrol producing a very healthy for the class 178kW (at 5500rpm) and 345Nm (from 2000rpm). By contrast, the Tucson’s 1.6 turbo-petrol makes 130kW (at 5500rpm) and 265Nm (from a low 1500rpm). Small wonder lots of buyers opt for the $2000 pricier diesel with its 136kW/400Nm punch. Despite its portly 1751kg kerb weight, the Ford definitely wins in terms of performance. Power delivery is excellent right through the mid-range, with hot hatch-rivalling straight-line pace, while the engine is refined when relaxed and sonorous under heavier throttle. This is helped by the well-calibrated six-speed automatic with torque converter that is generally intuitive under dynamic driving conditions, and relaxed and jolt-free in stop-start situations. However, claimed combined-cycle fuel use is a high 8.6L/100km, though in average driving you can expect closer to 10L/100km – nothing comes without consequence. Like the Hyundai, the Ford gets a front-biased on-demand all-wheel-drive (AWD) system that shuffles torque to the rear when the onboard computer detects traction loss. The Hyundai’s engine, which is similar to that in the Veloster SR and Elantra SR, is by comparison a little underdone next to the Ford, or for that matter a Volkswagen Tiguan (either in 132kW/320Nm or 162kW/350Nm tunes). On the other hand, the normally aspirated 2.5 Mazda CX-5 has a similar 140kW/250Nm, with peak torque not arriving until much higher in the rev range than the Tucson. To its credit, the Hyundai doesn’t feel at all sluggish – maximum torque from 1500rpm gives it a strong mid-range – and its fuel consumption is about 1L/10km lower than the Ford’s. Matched is a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, which is typically good under aggressive driving and better at reducing torque loss, but also feels a little hesitant and jerk-prone in day-to-day manoeuvring, and less smooth than the sequential AT in the Escape. Hyundai’s on-demand AWD system gets a locking mode at low speeds, though on the flip side offers 16mm less ground clearance. If you tow regularly and are interested in either of these vehicles, perhaps opt for the diesel versions (note, the Escape diesel gets a DCT). Both petrol versions have a 1600kg braked limit. Winner: Ford Escape, by a point.    Ride and handling Hyundai Australia has long (quite rightly) made a concerted effort to publicise the extent to which it tunes the suspension of its cars for our market. The Tucson might just be its best work yet, with fantastic comfort over typical urban patchwork roads and sharp hits. The car just floats, despite the low-profile tyres and 19s. Given the fact that ride comfort and NVH suppression is a priority in the medium SUV class, the Tucson is very good indeed. The trade-off to that cosseting ride is a slight reduction in body control, as would be expected. There’s no wallowing, but against lateral forces the body does roll a little compared to overtly sporty offerings such as the Tiguan and, as we’ll discuss, the Escape. The Hyundai’s all-round independent suspension does a good job of maximising the contact patch, and the standard BLIS system along with the large windows is a blessing for merging. The Escape’s European origins – American name but Euro built – are obvious in the way the Ford handles. Its weight means it isn’t exactly nimble, but it’s very polished. Urban comfort is almost as impressive as the Hyundai, in terms of the way it isolates occupants from sharp hits, and the noise suppression is also excellent at a higher clip. Body control is a little more tied-down than the Hyundai’s, meaning it matches the engine’s nature by feeling a little sharper through corners than its bigger-selling rival. Ford’s Control Blade rear suspension does a good job of separating ride from handling, minimising the way that improvement in one tends to undermine the other. We would contend that buyers after a higher-specified SUV on 19-inch wheels care somewhat about performance in corners, and the way the Escape balances the two fundamental contradictory metrics makes it an appealing proposition. We’d also note that both cars have light electric steering with little communication. The Tucson’s turning circle of 10.6m is very good, and 60cm better than the Ford. It’s also easier to park as it’s easier to see out of. Winner: Ford again, only just.    Running costs From an ownership perspective, Hyundai gives you an excellent (transferrable) five-year/unlimited kilometre warranty, complimentary sat nav updates for three years, free roadside assistance and lifetime advertised servicing prices. For MY18 Hyundai Australia has thankfully improved the turbo engine’s servicing intervals to 12 months or 10,000km (up from an average 7500km). We’re chasing the cost of each visit at the moment. By contrast, the Escape offers a three-year/100,000km warranty with roadside assist that is, like Hyundai, contingent on you getting your car serviced by a dealer. Servicing intervals are 12 months or 15,000km, with four of the first five visits each currently set at $375 (the 60,000km or fourth-year visit is $625). Winner : Hyundai. Though the Kia Sportage with a seven-year warranty beats them both.    Verdict Tough call. Both of these sub-$50k medium SUVs are excellent, even factoring in the brand new just-launched Mazda CX-5 (comparison tests on this top-seller coming soon), the Kia Sportage and Volkswagen Tiguan kicking big goals, and a brand new Honda CR-V around the corner. The Hyundai Tucson, however, is best value in base Active and Active X forms, especially with its uprated normally aspirated drivetrain that’s better around town. That’s where the brilliant value truly lies. As a semi-premium offering the Ford Escape works better – its drivetrain and handling ensure this – and while we strongly criticise Ford for charging extra for active safety, it’s still the car that impressed us marginally more.

Now, Bloomberg has obtained the first images of the vehicles Apple is using to test its autonomous car technology on the road… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover As you can see in the images, Apple is using the Lexus RX450h SUV to test its self-driving technology. The vehicle is, of course, outfitted with a wide variety of sensors, including Velodyne Lidar’s 64-channel lidar, at least two radars, and a series of cameras. At this point in the process, it appears that the sensors and other accessories are ones bought off the shelf from other companies, rather than ones Apple designed itself. The use of hardware from other companies further suggests that Apple is focusing more on the software-side of self-driving cars, rather than building its own hardware and/or car. Of course, this could change as the company continues to test and expand its efforts While Apple has yet to comment on its self-driving car efforts, these pictures offer the first look at its initiative. Apple isn’t the only company using Lexus SUVs to test self-driving efforts, as it’s something Google is doing as well. Though, Google also has a partnership with Chrysler for its electric minivans. Earlier this month, it was revealed that Apple had obtained permission from the state of California to officially begin testing self-driving cars in California. Apple’s name was added to the list of companies with Autonomous Vehicle Testing Permits on the Department of Motor Vehicles website in California after two years of reports that Apple had been testing self-driving car technology. A variety of other hints had emerged concerning Apple’s self-driving efforts. Apple partner Didi Chuxing opened its own self-driving lab near Apple in California, while the company also appeared on a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration urging the department not to restrict autonomous vehicle testing. Currently leading Apple’s autonomous driving efforts is ex-hardware lead Bob Mansfield. The company was originally believed to be building its own car, but has now shifted its focus to self-driving software. With cars now on the road, it’s clear that this is an area in which Apple has a vested interest.

Apple is looking into the possibility of charging iPhones through medium to long distance wireless charging technologies, a U.S. Patent and Trademark filing named "Wireless Charging and Communications Systems With Dual-Frequency Patch Antennas" made public Thursday shows. Read: New iPhone 8 Leak Features Vertical Lenses, Wireless Charging Technology The filing shows Apple is trying to find a way to transfer power to devices over frequencies traditionally dedicated to data communications. Apple is looking for a way to charge iPhones via Wi-Fi, patent shows Photo: USPTO The power transfer capabilities could be made via wireless communications link, including cellular between 700 MHz to 2700 MHz, Wi-Fi operating at 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and millimeter wave communications between 10 GHz and 400 GHz. The patent also points to power transfer via “WiGig communications [millimeter wave IEEE 802.11 ad communications in a communications band at 60 GHz].” The filing shows two devices are required for the power transfer, a transmitter and a receiver. Each gadget may include one or more antennas coupled with wireless circuitry that can make phase and/or magnitude adjustments to signals that are received and transmitted. Apple is looking for a way to charge iPhones via Wi-Fi, patent shows Photo: USPTO Again, the idea is just a patent, and Apple could choose to move forward with the technology or not. Also, it could have been a patent associated with Apple’s AirPort routers, on which the company reportedly stopped production. A November Bloomberg report said Apple shut down the wireless router division and transferred engineers from that team to other product development groups, including the one dedicated to Apple TV. iPhone 8 To Come With Wireless Charging While we wait to see if Apple moves on with the technology described in the patent filing, numerous reports have claimed the company will release the iPhone 8 with wireless charging capabilities. A schematic of the iPhone 8 leaked Wednesday shows the device sporting a wireless charging feature. A previous report by the Verifier said the iPhone 8 will come with Apple’s “Smart Connector” for augmented reality and virtual reality accesories, as well as wireless charging technology. The Smart Connector is currently used on the iPad Pro. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also suggested in February the 2017 iPhone lineup will feature wireless charging. It’s also worth noting Apple joined the Wireless Power Consortium this year, joining companies like Sony, Samsung, LG and Verizon. The move fueled more rumors about the iPhone 8 featuring wireless charging. Read: iPhone 8 Could Feature 'Smart Connector' For Wireless Charging, AR And VR Accessories Meanwhile, a report this week said the iPhone 8 release date could be delayed because Apple and its suppliers are working to fix overheating problems with wireless charging components. The 10th anniversary OLED display iPhone is expected to be released this fall alongside two LCD versions, the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus.

Now, Trump is set to meet with one of Apple’s top manufacturing partners, Foxconn. Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover According to a report from Nikkei, Trump is set to meet with Terry Gou, Foxconn’s Chairman at some point on Thursday. While details such as the topic of the meeting remain unclear, it marks the first encounter between the two. Gou was reportedly able to secure the meeting with Trump thanks to SoftBank Group Chairman Masayoshi Son, who met with the president back in New York last December. Apple and Foxconn have both been heavily involved in talks with Toshiba regarding the company’s NAND storage business and a possible acquisition. Today’s report speculates that the meeting between Trump and Gou may focus on the possible Foxconn acquisition of Toshiba’s NAND business due to national security implications: Industry sources have said that Washington is involved and being consulted on Toshiba’s plans to sell its semiconductor unit and Westinghouse, its American nuclear unit which owns military grade reactor technology, as the fate of both businesses has implications for U.S. national security. While it marks the first meeting between Trump and Gou, today’s report claims that Gou met with Jared Kushner in late February. Kushner, of course, is Trump’s son-in-law and a senior advisor. It’s still not clear what Kushner and Gou discussed, though. President Trump campaigned on the promise of bringing jobs back to America, suggesting multiple times that he might tax company imports. Given its size and influence, Apple has naturally become the top target of pleas for United States manufacturing. Suppliers have expressed skepticism as to the likelihood of Apple bringing production to the United States, though Trump has said that Tim Cook has “eyes open” to domestic manufacturing. It’s also been reported that Apple asked Foxconn and Pegatron to investigate manufacturing the iPhone in the United States. Either way, it will be interesting to hear more about the meeting between President Trump and Foxconn Chairman Gou.

Samsung, Apple and Huawei have retained their top three positions with 22.8%, 14.9% and 9.8% shares of the global smartphone market respectively, while OPPO and Vivo rounded out the top 5. While market leader Samsung managed to ship 79.2 million units during the quarter in spite of the Galaxy Note 7 controversy, Apple did 51.6 million units, whereas Huawei shifted 34.2 million units worldwide during the first three months of this year. Samsung and Apple, however, both lost market-share with growth stagnating during the period, while some of the more well-established Chinese vendors, such as Huawei, OPPO and Vivo made significant headway. The top five vendors increased their collective market share from 57.9% to 60.1%, even though more companies continue to enter the industry with every passing year. As has been the norm in recent years, global tech heavyweights, LG, Sony and HTC, are nowhere to be found on the list, while Xiaomi, once the largest smartphone vendor in China, remains out of the global top five as the company continues to try and mend its fortunes in its homeland, even though its market share in India continues to soar. While substantial discounts on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge helped Samsung significantly during the quarter, the company’s Galaxy J-series and Galaxy A-series mid-rangers are also said to have sold well over the past year, helping the company cement its position at the top. Huawei not only retained the number three spot, but actually managed to close the gap with the two leaders after experiencing a massive 22% growth YoY during the quarter, shipping 34.2 million units as opposed to just 28.1 million units during the same period last year. Meanwhile, even as China continues to remain the focal point for most of these Chinese smartphone brands, they have also been betting heavily on overseas markets for growth of late. In the case of OPPO, the brand was propped up by the success of its camera-focused R9s in China, although its growth in international markets have been even more spectacular. The company operates in a large number of emerging markets across the Middle East and Africa, but registered its highest growth in India and in South-East Asia. As for Vivo, the company’s selfie-focused X9 smartphone became a major success story in China, helping the company increase its market share in the country. The company is also focusing ardently on India and Indonesia, and is the title sponsor of the 10th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament, which is expected to bring the brand even more visibility going forward.

This patent suggests that Apple might use patch antennas to transfer power wirelessly. They’d transfer power at microwave frequencies (or other frequencies) and could also be used “to support millimeter wave communications.” While filed back in 2015, this patent application was first published today, April 27th, 2017. The publication number for this patent is US 2017/0117754 A1, and can be found with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as such. While it was suggested that this wireless charging technology could be used to increase the range at which wireless charging can be done effectively, it also claimed a few other, more grounded angles. The background for this patent said that Apple’s aim is to provide systems with improved wireless circuitry, quite plainly. Apple’s patent said that “challenges can arise in implementing wireless charging and communications system[s]. If care is not taken, sensitivity to antenna misalignment and other issues can make it difficult or impossible to achieve desired levels of performance when integrating antennas and other structures into devices of interest.” It seemed at the start of the patent summary and background that Apple would seek to claim a better method for manufacturing hardware. It seemed – to my eyes – that Apple’s aim might’ve been to improve the way in which the most popular wireless charging methods of today would be used. Instead, Apple gives a “Detailed Description” which includes how “power may also be transferred wirelessly between devices… at these frequencies or other suitable frequencies.” The frequencies they speak of are what they describe as a “cellular telephone link”, going on to clarify, “a wireless link at frequencies of 700 MHz to 2700 Mhz or other suitable cellular telephone frequencies.” They also claim that this connection could be a wireless local area network link operating at 2.4Ghz, 5GHz, or other suitable wireless LAN frequencies. In all, they list: • Cellular Telephone Link • Wireless LAN link • Millimeter Wave Communications • WiGig Communications • Communications at any other wireless communications frequencies Apple claims a patent to “an electronic device that wirelessly transfers power to an external device” which comprises of two things. First, wireless power transfer circuitry. Second, a “dual-polarization dual-frequency patch antenna that is coupled to the wireless power transfer circuitry and that is configured to wirelessly transfer power from the wireless power transfer circuitry to the external device.” If this is the sort of thing Apple has in mind for future iPhone and iPad devices, sign me up. No need to charge things up if they’re constantly being pinged for more power from my router – that’s something I’m very, very interested in. Maybe the iPhone 8 (iPhone X, iPhone Edition, iPhone Pro) is only the start.

If so, have no fear – I remembered to mark mine for next Tuesday 2 May, when Apple will release the results in the early afternoon (Cupertino time) and then offer some of its executives up to financial analysts in an hour-long telephone call. This is the season where Wall Street tries to intuit where Apple’s stock price will go, and those of us more focused on Apple’s products will scrape for any suggestion about how those products are selling and what might come next. It can be easy to joke about these quarterly rituals – I’ve already done it several times and this is only my third paragraph – but they’re vital opportunities to take a rare glimpse into Apple’s inner workings and the executives’ thinking about the company’s business strategies. Yes, it’s a choreographed dance, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t glean understanding from it. The first fiscal quarter of 2017, which Apple reported on 31 January of this year, covered the last three months of the 2016 calendar year. It was a record quarter after a few tough months in which revenue shrunk for the first time in recent memory. At the time, Apple suggested that its next quarter would generate between $51.5 and $53.5 billion in revenue, which would make it a second straight quarter of slight year-over-year revenue growth. Apple is rarely wrong about its future guidance, and is actually still living down a reputation for being too conservative with its estimates and surprising the investment community with breakout quarters. That hasn’t happened in a little while, though some analysts think Apple might have been too conservative in estimating this quarter’s total revenue. Either way, if Apple meets or beats expectations Wall Street will be happy with the trend, but will be looking carefully at the guidance for next quarter to see if it will continue. Here are a few other things to watch for on 2 May: An iPhone sales update. General consensus is that iPhone sales will be just under 52 million, which is about a one percent increase over the same quarter a year ago. At this point, sales stability going into the autumn release of new iPhone models is probably all anyone’s looking for from the iPhone. What’s up with China? Apple’s rapid growth in China hit a wall a little more than a year ago. Apple CEO Tim Cook has insisted repeatedly that in the long run, China will be Apple’s largest region, but in the previous three quarters Apple’s China sales have slipped below its European sales. Will China turn the corner this quarter? And if not, what will Cook say on the conference call with analysts about the issues Apple faces there? Can Services growth continue? The biggest growth in Apple’s portfolio is currently in the company’s Services line, which has been increasing consistently for a few years now. Apple’s been heavily promoting this bright spot on its ledgers, but can it keep pace with the excellent growth it’s shown up to this point, or will it show signs of leveling off? If it’s the latter, Apple will have some explaining to do. What’s going on with the Apple Watch? Apple doesn’t break out numbers for Apple Watch sales, but Cook will frequently characterise watch sales when he’s discussing matters with analysts. We’re unlikely to hear any tangible numbers, but if Cook mentions record sales or strong year-over-year growth, that will be a sign – and if he says nothing at all, that’s a sign that this might have been a sleepy quarter for watch sales. Is the Mac growing again? According to Gartner, Mac sales are up, with an estimated 4.2 million Macs sold in the first quarter. After an entire year where Mac sales slid down when compared to the previous year, a second straight quarter of even slight growth – as Gartner predicts – will be a good sign. The iPad turnaround: Is it happening yet? Cook insists he’s still bullish on the iPad, and with the bifurcation of Apple’s tablet product line between a stripped-down $329 model and the higher-end iPad Pro, maybe it’s ready for a comeback. But a lot of us – myself included – have been expecting a boost in iPad sales for a few years, and it just hasn’t happened. The introduction of the $329 iPad in early April means it won’t show up on this quarter’s results, but in the conference call, Cook may offer a little commentary that indicates how well the lower-priced tablet has been received. Stick with Macworld for complete coverage of Apple’s results on the afternoon of 2 May, and I’ll see you back here next week for more charts and analysis of where Apple’s been and where it’s going.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Apple Music in iOS 11 could put video front and centre Caitlin McGarry 28 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Apple Music is a work in progress, and with iOS 11 Apple plans to revamp its monthly streaming service once again – this time to make video a more prominent feature. According to Bloomberg, the redesign reflects Apple’s big bets on video. Apple’s video plans span from the previously announced (and since delayed) ‘Carpool Karaoke’ to a potential sequel to the classic R. Kelly hip hopera ‘Trapped in the Closet’, to feature-length documentaries (Apple just won exclusive rights to Sean “Diddy” Combs’ documentary Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: A Bad Boy Story, beating out LiveNation). A show about Dr Dre has also been discussed and producer Brian Grazer and director J.J. Abrams are brainstorming ideas, while about 10 new original series are scheduled to debut on Apple Music this year. Apple has deep pockets and an A-list network to tap into. But so do other companies, like Netflix and Amazon. Where Apple can differentiate itself is its musical roots, which date back to the launch of iTunes 14 years ago, and the vision of longtime record executive Jimmy Iovine, who joined Apple when the company acquired his Beats headphones and streaming service in 2014. Iovine now leads Apple Music and has a staff of 300 working on every aspect of the business, which now extends to video. Spotify has also ventured into original video content with about a dozen TV series, but none have taken off. Video isn’t easy to discover or watch in the Spotify app, though the company launched its video feature two years ago with great fanfare (and a little help from “Broad City” stars Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson). According to Bloomberg, Iovine originally pitched Beats to Netflix as a potential acquisition, but the streaming giant reportedly told Iovine it wasn’t ready to move into music. If Apple nails video, making its exclusive content of the same caliber as Amazon and Netflix while also making it easy to find and watch, it could create the first successful music and video streaming service. But we’re still waiting to see if ‘Carpool Karaoke’ is any good. The James Corden-hosted show was reportedly delayed from its April launch date because the series isn’t finished yet. There’s no official word yet on when that show, or the will.i.am. reality series ‘Planet of the Apps’, will premiere.

The service will allow iPhone owners to transfer money digitally to other iPhone users, Recode reported, citing sources familiar with the talks. Apple will announce the new service later this year, one source told Recode, while another told the website an announcement and launch date may not yet be set. The service, if launched, would compete with digital money transfer services such as PayPal's Venmo offering, Square's Square Cash, as well as services from big banks. Apple was also in talks with payments network operator Visa to create its own pre-paid cards to run on the Visa debit network, and tied to the new peer-to-peer service, the Recode report said. Apple is looking for ways to boost usage of Apple Pay, its mobile payments service, and the debit card could be one way to do that, Recode reported. Apple Pay usage has been lighter-than-expected since its launch two and a half years ago, the website reported, citing sources from big US banks. Apple and Visa declined to comment on the report.

Allegedly, it features a speaker and microphone that people can use to turn on music, get news headlines or set a timer. With the rapid popularity growth of Amazon Alexa and the launch of Google Home, it wouldn't be surprising if Apple is indeed working on a rival.

Samsung: Apple Sees Flat 2017 Q1 Sales Despite iPhone SE, RED iPhone 7 Release By Denisse Moreno On 04/27/17 AT 5:34 PM Close With little fanfare, Apple released the iPhone SE and the iPhone 7 RED Special Edition last month and those releases did little to help the company's Q1 numbers, according to data released by the International Data Corporation (IDC). Phone companies overall shipped a 347.4 million smartphones globally in the first quarter of 2017, growing 4.3 percent. However, shipments of Apple iPhones remained “essentially flat,” preliminary results of IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker show. The Cupertino company shipped 51.6 million units in Q1 2017, a bit more than last year’s 51.2 million first quarter figure. Read: iPhone 8 vs. Galaxy S8: Apple Wants Higher-End Display Than Samsung’s Flagship Has Apple Vs. Samsung Samsung seems to be moving forward from last year’s Galaxy Note 7 debacle. The Apple rival “regained control as the leader in the worldwide smartphone market despite a flat first quarter,” IDC said. The Korean company had a zero percent year-to-year growth, however discounts on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge helped the company sell last year’s flagship models as it geared up for the release of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Samsung’s less expensive smartphones, such as the J-Series and A-Series, also helped out the company. “A refreshed A7, A5, and A3 earlier this quarter, along with a recently updated J-Series, and new flagship S8/S8+ should give Samsung a well-balanced portfolio across all regions in the second quarter,” IDC predicted. “An early positive response to the recently launched S8 and S8+ looks promising as it may have finally put Samsung's Note 7 fiasco to bed.” Meanwhile, Huawei and Vivo saw their year-over-year numbers grow by more than 20 percent, although the shipment volume in Q1 2017 was less than Apple and Samsung’s figures. Apple sees iPhone sales remain flat in Q1 2017 after releasing RED iPhone 7 and iPhone SE. Photo: International Data Corporation (IDC) Apple iPhone 8 Sales Apple probably won’t be left behind this year, especially with the release of the upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone 8, which could also be called the iPhone Edition, iPhone Pro or iPhone X. “Despite any formal announcements from Apple it is safe to say the industry is highly anticipating what comes from this year's iPhone announcements," IDC’s Ryan Reith said in a statement. Read: iPhone 8 To Have Vertical Dual-Camera, Display-Embedded Fingerprint Sensor, Leaked Dummy Hints Apple is expected to release the OLED display iPhone 8 this September alongside two LCD models, the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. The iPhone 8 is rumored to have a price tag exceeding $1,000. However, some reports suggest Apple will face delays with the 10th anniversary device. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this week mass production of the iPhone 8 could be delayed until October-November, instead of the traditional August-September timeframe. Kuo said the possible delay of the iPhone 8 could be a “potential downside risk to shipments” of all three iPhones slated to be released this year. Another risk could come from Apple’s rivals, including Samsung and Huawei, which are gearing up to release high-end full-screen devices this year. Rival smartphones could impact sales of the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. In a worst-case scenario for Apple, the company could see iPhone shipments plummet by 15 to 20 percent, Kuo said. Apple is expected to reveal its 2017 first quarter results during its Q2 2017 earnings conference call next week.

Apple is reportedly looking to expand its finance offerings and potentially launch a Venmo competitor, Recode reports. Recode said Apple has been conducting meetings with companies in the payment space about tentatively launching a Venmo-like program. With the service, iPhone users would be able to send money directly to and from other iPhone users. At the moment, the timeline for the program is still fluid, as the program could potentially launch this year.   Read: Apple Adds More Than 20 U.S. Banks To Apple Pay Apple is also looking into launching a debit card-like prepaid card that could be tied to the payment service. Recode said the card could be digital-only and a major point of focus for Apple’s Venmo program — since Apple likely wouldn’t charge for sending money from one person to another, it would instead make its money on purchases made with the debit card. If the rumored program, which has seen several starts and pauses, ends up happening, it’ll be a way for Apple to bolster Apple Pay.  Apple Pay, which lets iPhone users tie their credit cards or debit cards to an Apple account, has been thoroughly integrated into iPhones through iOS and Apple Wallet. However, the service has struggled to make a significant impact on Apple’s bottom line. The Wall Street Journal reported Apple analyst Gene Munster estimates Apple Pay saw around $36 billion in transactions during 2016. In addition, adoption rates for Apple Pay at major vendors can also vary and the service has also seen stiff competition from providers like Samsung Pay. Google Wallet smartphone-payment option ran into similar hurdles with adoption rates during its early rollout and was eventually discontinued in 2016. Systems like Samsung Pay and Apple Pay generally rely on near-field communications and hardware to process payments. To make payments, you have to put your phone near a payment console during the checkout process. Read: How To Use Apple Pay And Samsung Pay Outside direct mobile payments, Apple’s peer-to-peer payment system also would be far from the first option on the market. Along with Venmo, the market also includes competitors like Square and other direct-payment options from services like Facebook and Gmail. For companies like Samsung and Apple, mobile payment options have not necessarily been an easy sell to consumers. In most cases, they’ve generally found minimal upsides to using a smartphone to make payments versus a traditional credit card or debit card. With the number of competing payment options via smartphone, market fragmentation — where providers may accept one form of payment but not another — has been a similar hurdle for smartphone payment systems to mass market penetration. However, the benefits for smartphone manufacturers are clear, as payment services options are both another way to differentiate themselves from the competition and tie themselves more closely to day-to-day needs.

The film chronicles Sean “Diddy” Combs’ rise to the top of the music business back in the mid-nineties, as well as the challenges he faced in putting together the 20th anniversary Bad Boy reunion shows last year. Although specific terms of the deal between Combs and Apple weren’t revealed, Apple Music is expected to have exclusive rights to the documentary for at least the first year. This latest exclusive documentary deal comes right on the heels of last week’s announcement that Apple Music would also be the exclusive home of legendary record producer Clive Davis’ new documentary.

Wants to Help You Pay Your Friends Can Apple Pay become Venmo before Venmo becomes Apple Pay? Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 27, 2017 at 2:32PM Back when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) first launched Apple Pay in 2014, it was able to avoid a bit of regulatory oversight since the service could not store money and could not be used to send funds to other people on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis. Storing funds opens up a whole can of regulatory worms, in part to adhere to anti-money-laundering regulations. At the time, it made sense to leave P2P to other companies while focusing on the relatively harder challenge of pushing adoption of contactless payments among both merchants and consumers, or person-to-business (P2B). All the while, P2P has seemed like an opportunity for Apple Pay to expand into. Recode reports that Apple is indeed working on such a service (again). Apple Pay on the Web. Image source: Apple. Try, try again The company has reportedly been in talks with partners in the payments industry to introduce a P2P service that would compete with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and its subsidiary Venmo; eBay acquired Venmo parent Braintree for $800 million in 2013, which was included in the subsequent PayPal spinoff in 2015. The new P2P service could be announced as soon as this year, but that timing could change. There had been prior reports from 2015 that Apple was putting together a P2P service. Apple has also considered the idea of launching its own line of pre-paid debit cards that would be integrated with the P2P service, according to the report, which could allow users to have faster access to transferred funds without having to wait through holding times at financial institutions. The prospect of Apple launching a debit card has irked may banks, since Apple's strong brand could commandeer a user's wallet. Apple Pay adoption has been underwhelming thus far One of the most prominent hurdles for Apple Pay has been the mere fact that paying with your phone at a register isn't that much more convenient than using a regular old plastic card; this is an old observation that has long made it difficult for all mobile payment services to gain traction, since it's tough to beat the ubiquitous status quo that already just takes a few seconds. That's why Apple continues to explore new ways to implement Apple Pay. On the January earnings call, CEO Tim Cook touted some vague Apple Pay metrics: Apple Pay continued its strong momentum, with the number of users more than tripling over the past year, and hundreds of millions of transactions and billions of dollars in purchases in the December quarter alone. Transaction volume was up over 500% year over year as we expanded to four new countries including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain, bringing us into a total of 13 markets. Apple Pay on the Web is delivering our partners great results. Recode says that industry partners are far more excited about Apple Pay on the Web, since e-commerce is often held back by the cumbersome process of entering payment information, especially on mobile devices. That process takes more time, and Apple Pay represents a meaningful improvement in convenience in that context; it really has the potential to be a game changer as more and more sites and apps implement Apple Pay. P2P payment services are notorious money-losers, though. Competition continues to sprout up, but much of it isn't sustainable since consumers aren't really willing to pay a fee in order to send a friend $3 for that cup of coffee. Meanwhile, there are still costs associated with facilitating those payments. Companies that have jumped into P2P in recent years include Venmo, Square with Square Cash, and even Facebook with Messenger. Just this month, the social network added the ability to send group payments among friends. The loss-inducing nature of P2P services is also why they make the most sense as a tangential service offered by larger companies, as opposed to stand-alone companies trying to squeeze blood from a stone. Apple Pay wants to become Venmo before Venmo can become Apple Pay PayPal reported first-quarter results yesterday, and said Venmo total payments volume (TPV) more than doubled year over year to $6.8 billion as the service continues to gain momentum. The company is in the process of rolling out its P2B offerings like Pay with Venmo, which allows merchants to accept Venmo on their sites and apps. Apple Pay started as P2B and now wants to expand to P2P, while Venmo started as P2P and wants to expand to P2B. In other words, Apple Pay wants to become Venmo before Venmo can become Apple Pay. That would typically put Apple Pay on better financial footing, but Venmo's parent PayPal already operates one of the largest and most profitable P2B platforms in the world. This won't be a short-lived battle by any stretch of the imagination. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple and FB. Evan Niu, CFA has the following options: long January 2018 $120 calls on FB.

Another driver hit his Jeep, and Mr. Bennett flipped over. His iPhone dropped out of reach, but he had an Apple Watch. Emergency SOS Because Mr. Bennett had an Apple Watch he was able to make use of the Emergency SOS feature: I was trying to figure out if I could get out, and I was like nope, you’re just going to have to hang out here…I just pressed down this side button on here for six seconds and it called 911. Apple added the Apple Watch Emergency SOS feature in the watchOS 3 update. When you hold down the side button for several seconds, an option appears on the screen to call 911, or the corresponding emergency service in your country. Apple Watch Emergency SOS In addition to calling 911, the Apple Watch sends your current location at the moment, along with periodic updates over time. You can see a video of Casey talking about his experience at local TV station ABC2News. How To Use SOS If you ever find yourself in an emergency situation (and we hope you never do) here’s how to use SOS: Press and hold the side button on your watch until the Emergency SOS slider appears. Continue to hold down the side button. Wait for a countdown to begin and an alert to sound. You can also drag the Emergency SOS slider. When the countdown ends, your watch automatically calls emergency services.

A patent filing dated October 2015 shows that Cupertino is looking into sending precious electricity to our iOS devices using Wi-Fi routers—or some kind of wireless transmitter. It looks like a promising way to wirelessly charge your iPhone. It could also curb the number of gadgets you need to have in your house, and it might even mean Apple’s AirPort router isn’t dead, after all. Could electrical plugs like these really become a thing of the past? A recent Apple patent filing suggests that your Wi-Fi router might replace some of your power cords (Image Credit: Taken) Power Can Be Transferred Lots of Ways This new invention notes a number of wireless communication links can transfer power. The cellular network spectrum between 700MHz and 2700MHz is capable of transmitting electrons to power devices, and so are the WiFi frequencies in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. The patent filing points specifically to the WiGig standard’s 802.11ad channels, operating in the 60GHz frequency band. This means, in theory, that we could one day power our devices using our Wi-Fi routers. Again in theory, we might even be able to draw electricity for our devices from cell towers and satellite signals, or other devices using those frequencies. The distance involved with cell towers might be too great to provide more than the barest of trickle charges, though. Still, other devices can license frequencies in the cellular spectrum, like the Micro Cell device used by AT&T. Always Two There Are When it comes to wireless charging, you always need two devices with the current state of the technology. You’ve got the power transmitter and the wireless receiver. Each device uses one or more antennas coupled to wireless circuitry that can make the proper phase and magnitude adjustments to transform those wireless signals into electricity to charge up your device’s battery. The nice thing about doing this through your Wi-Fi router would be the matter of simplicity. Just about everybody has a Wi-FI router, so the transmission device would already be there. All you’d need would be the receiver pad, which could be embedded into your iPhone itself. Do We Want That Kind of Power Transmitted All the Time? Sending power to your devices through your Wi-Fi router might not be all puppies and roses, though. The electrical output would be pretty tremendous. Not many people would want that much of a signal broadcasting willy nilly through the air. That’s where beamforming comes into play, something the latest model of the AirPort router already supports. With beamforming, it would be possible for your iPhone to tell your Wi-Fi router, “Hey, I need some juice.” The router would then strengthen its signal only in the direction of your iOS device. Electricity would flow directly to your iOS device without spamming the wavelength in all directions. We don’t know that’s what Apple has in mind, though, because the patent filing just deals with theory, not with operating details. An Interesting Parallel Another purported leak of schematics for the iPhone 8 came out this week. The schematic for the space supposedly shows a large wireless charging pad in the handset’s rear casing. This looks remarkably like the patch antenna described in this most recent patent filing. It seems pretty clear that Apple is developing wireless charging for its iPhone, and it’s doing it in a new, fresh way. Like the old man in Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail, I think the AirPort router is crying out, “I’m not dead yet”. Maybe wireless charging can be a defibrillator to bring the accessory new life.

Jeff Butts @clefmeister · +Jeff Butts 2 minute read Apr 27th, 2017 3:19 PM EDT | Rumor Apple might be looking to break into another new market. According to Re/code, Cupertino is in talks to introduce its own competitor with Venmo, like Facebook, Square Cash, and Chase’s QuickPay have done. The service would focus on iPhone owners, allowing them to send money digitally to other iOS device owners. Splitting bills and paying friends could be a lot simpler from your iPhone with “Apple Cash” (Image Credit: quinntheislander) Not the First Time Apple’s Wandered Down the Venmo Path Apple has flirted with the idea of building its own money transfer service in the past, but the project never took off. In recent years, though, the market has grown and more competitors have taken a shot at it. The results for some have been poor, but others have done well. Millennials seem to love using Venmo so much that the service registered US $17.6 billion in volume last year and continues to double year after year. Chase’s QuickPay fared even better, processing $28 billion in transfers for 2016. The services have typically been money losers for newcomers to the sphere, but they’re a great way to get into the “next generation” of personal finance services looking to disrupt traditional banking. Further Disrupting Traditional Banking with ‘Apple Cash’ We’ve got Apple Pay, so it seems reasonable to think the new service would be called Apple Cash. You could use it to pay your rent, send money to your friends to split the dinner bill, or spot your BFF $20 for a movie. It’s a highly competitive field, but there are plenty of opportunities. Plus, Cupertino has the cash reserves to take its chances. I’ve never used Venmo, but I have used a competing service through Facebook Messenger quite a few times. The nicest thing about how that works is that typically, when I receive money through Facebook Messenger, it’s in my bank in minutes, not days. It’s definitely more convenient than receiving funds through PayPal and then waiting for the direct deposit to hit my bank. What’s next, an Apple prepaid Visa? Maybe (Image Credit: profivideos) Finding a Way to Make Money in the Venture One reason these services don’t make money is that most of them don’t charge to send or receive money. So how will Cupertino transform this into a cash-generating venture? One possibility lies in recent talks between the maker of all things “i” and Visa. We might also see an “Apple Visa” prepaid debit card in coming months. An Apple Visa card would run on the Visa debit network and be tied to Apple Cash. People could send money back and forth to each other. You could even add the card to your Apple Pay digital wallet. Cupertino might make money by charging fees to load the Apple Visa. When you use an Apple Visa debit card with Apple Pay at a merchant, Cupertino would benefit. The Timing of the Announcement Isn’t Clear Recode’s sources aren’t unanimous in their timeframes for what I’m going to keep calling Apple Cash. One source said the company should announce the new service later this year, while another has cautioned that the announcement and launch date may not be set in stone yet. If Apple is going to do it this time, I hope it makes up its mind relatively quickly. People are creatures of habit. If the growing numbers associated with Venmo and Chase’s QuickPay are any indication, it’s pretty clear that folks are getting used to those services. Changing from one to the other might not come easily for many people, so Cupertino probably needs to strike while the iron is hot. Waiting to See What Happens This might be the “one more thing” Cupertino announces in September, when Apple unveils the next-generation iPhone. The iOS cellular phone is an important part of Apple’s ecosystem. Adding more benefits to being a part of the iPhone “Cool Kids’ Club” would possibly be a boon to Cupertino. As for me, I’m waiting impatiently to see what happens.

However, while the iPhone 8 might free users from the lightning cable, future iterations could take a much bolder step judging by a recently filed patent application. The firm is working towards technology that would enable iDevices to be replenished via the Wi-Fi router across the other side of the room. Of course such tech is non-existent right now, but Apple envisions medium to long-range charging through a home Wi-Fi monitor at some point in the futrure. Related: Galaxy S8 review The patent, which went public on Thursday (via AppleInsider), is entitled “Wireless Charging and Communications Systems With Dual-Frequency Patch Antennas," and explains how power could be transferred to devices over the same frequencies usually used to connect to the internet. Apple says the use of Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), cellular and (from 700 MHz to 2700 MHz frequencies) and millimeter wave (between 10 GHz and 400 GHz) could all be on the cards. Cupertino proposes that beamforming antennas like the ones in the company’s AirPort routers could be used in the solution. This would enable pinpoint positioning of the device and enable the router to devote more of that power signal to mobile device. While making such tech a reality is probably a long way away, it’s interesting to see Apple’s thinking on the subject. Especially considering how long the firm has taken to embrace wireless charging. Would the addition of wireless charging push you towards an iPhone 8 purchase? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

Abrams and R. Kelly Thursday April 27, 2017 6:20 am PDT by Mitchel Broussard Jimmy Iovine, one of the heads of Apple Music, has given multiple interviews and visions for the future of Apple's streaming music service over the past few months, mainly detailing how Apple Music will morph into "an entire pop cultural experience" with the advent of original video content. In an interview with Bloomberg posted online today, Iovine continued that pitch by stating, "I’m trying to help Apple Music be an overall movement in popular culture," detailing plans that include original shows and videos with partners like director J.J. Abrams and rapper R. Kelly. The expansion of Apple Music beyond streaming new songs and music videos by artists began slowly for Apple, with the company releasing a tour documentary in partnership with Taylor Swift in 2015, as well as a 23-minute short film with Drake in 2016. Those modest beginnings have helped Apple learn what works and what doesn't, with Iovine stating, "We’re gonna grow slowly no matter what, I don’t know how to do it fast." Iovine further mentioned that Apple's vast resources provide the Apple Music team with enough room for betting on risky projects, so the service can "make one show, three shows" to see what viewers favor. “A music service needs to be more than a bunch of songs and a few playlists,” says Iovine, 64. “I’m trying to help Apple Music be an overall movement in popular culture, everything from unsigned bands to video. We have a lot of plans.” Apple Music’s foray into video programming could be a temporary dalliance, but if Iovine succeeds, the world’s wealthiest company could increase its investment, routinely competing for top projects. “We have the freedom, because it’s Apple, to make one show, three shows, see what works, see what doesn’t work until it feels good,” Iovine says. Those slow-to-build plans apparently include a largely redesigned, "new edition" of the Apple Music app coming to iOS 11 this fall that will "better showcase video." Because of this update, Iovine said that Apple won't make the same mistakes that rival Spotify has made in producing original video content, but subsequently not promoting it enough to get people to watch. "We’re going to market it like it’s a TV show," Iovine mentioned. "You’re going to know this is out." Currently, those shows include Carpool Karaoke: The Series and Planet of the Apps, although the former show was recently delayed indefinitely and the latter has only a vague spring launch date. In the immediate future, Iovine said that Apple Music's video ambitions are still very music-related, including Dr. Dre's Vital Signs, and Iovine even wants to produce a sequel to R. Kelly's rap opera Trapped in the Closet. “For a music streaming service,” Iovine says, “we’re building a very decent slate.” According to Carpool Karaoke producer Ben Winston, who helped sign the agreement to partner with Apple along with star James Corden, the mere fact that Apple is involved with producing these new shows is all it takes to get people excited to work with them. "If I call LeBron James and I name five networks or cable channels or even different online platforms, I’m not convinced he agrees to sit in a car," Winston says. "If you say you’re doing a new show for Apple, people get excited." But the company's plans are far bigger than just original content that has a music slant, with Iovine having met with well-known Hollywood creatives to discuss "possible ideas," including director J.J. Abrams and producer Brian Grazer, although talks with Grazer regarding Imagine Entertainment are said to have "fizzled out" for unknown reasons. Of course, any specific details regarding what a J.J. Abrams-produced series on Apple Music might be were not given. Previous reports of Apple's dealings in Hollywood have been largely critical of the Cupertino company's inability to forge ahead with a consistent, unified vision in the original content space. For Iovine, the almost-two-year-old service still has a ways to go. "Apple Music is nowhere near complete in my head," he said. Achieving his vision for the future of Apple Music has gotten Iovine in hot water with some of his colleagues, as well. Some ideas get Iovine into trouble. He’s taken meetings with artists and made arrangements to release music without telling anyone in advance, frustrating colleagues. He’s persuaded artists to release music exclusively with Apple, frustrating record labels. But no one doubts his knack for bringing people together. Everyone from Apple CEO Tim Cook to Apple Music executive Bozoma Saint John have reinforced Apple's future with original content coming to its music streaming service. Earlier this year during an earnings call, Cook said that Apple is starting off slow -- echoing Iovine's comment -- and has a "toe in the water" testing original content, while Saint John said of Apple Music as a whole: "We're developing something very special and we just want people to pay attention."

Apple got them a global radio station and the worlds biggest marketing platform .... and if that expands to TV also.... wow talk about being used . Though please do explain how that 3 billion is paying for itself ? Apple Music could have been awesome. Iovine ruined it , making it Hip-Hop centric.... sorry it's crap, can't stand the station, so one dimensional . No disprepect to proble who love hip-hop. Though I'd be interested to hear from hip-hop fans and that they think of AM. Yep. Complete obsession with rap and hip-hop. And watch people here be called racist for saying that, even though in my case my favorite artist happens to be a black man. :rolleyes: Apple Music could release as many as 10 original series by the end of the year, including will.i.am’s Planet of the Apps and several documentaries. Iovine won’t say what they are, but people familiar with the matter say two are about the legendary hip-hop labels Bad Boy Records and Cash Money Records while another is about music impresario Clive Davis. “For a music streaming service,” Iovine says, “we’re building a very decent slate.” Rating: 8 Votes ProVideo 17 hours ago at 06:47 am Great.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat Apple today started rolling out the fifth beta version of iOS 10.3.2, a point update to iOS 10.3 that will be going out to everyone in the next few weeks. After making the beta available for developers to try out, Apple is now also releasing it for public beta testers. This comes just three days after Apple pushed out the fourth public beta of the mobile operating system update, which itself arrived a week after the third beta. Apple isn’t flagging any major changes in today’s update, although it does feel speedier than previous builds in my limited testing. The fourth beta had some bugs, and today’s update might well have fixed some of them. If you want to try out the new build as a public beta tester before the final version of 10.3.2 comes out, you can sign up here. It’s free. And in about five weeks, you should be able to try out a beta of iOS 11. Apple should be taking the wraps off it at its WWDC conference in San Jose on June 5.

(AFP) NEW YORK: US businesses would reap a windfall if President Donald Trump’s plan to cut corporate tax rates and slash taxes on cash parked overseas becomes law, but it was unclear whether they would stimulate a surge in investment and job creation in return. Under Trump’s proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the US in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration’s tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp. Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned “the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation.” Big US companies have nearly $1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc. has more than $200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. “What we would do with it, let’s wait and see exactly what it is, but as I’ve said before we are always looking at acquisitions,” Cook told investors on the company’s first-quarter earnings call in January in response to an analyst’s question about the company’s thinking on acquisitions. Cook’s comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by US companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co. , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many US companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A mixed bag The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 percent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 percent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co. on Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. “At the highest level we’re a big supporter of tax reform,” Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call Wednesday. “It’s going to drive jobs, it’s going to drive the US economy broadly speaking and it’s going to allow us to compete.” Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. “A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump’s first 100 days in office,” said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

As an extension of Apple Pay, Apple is reportedly looking to break into the peer-to-peer payment systems. This would put Apple in a position to compete with existing services like Venmo or Square Cash. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard that Apple is considering such a system. A couple of years back, similar rumors began to surface, but ultimately nothing ever materialized. Sources close to the project now tell Recode that Apple has taken those plans off the back burner, perhaps gearing up to announce the new service as soon as later this year. As Recode points out, though, these peer-to-peer payment systems are usually money pits for companies looking to break into the space. Beyond that, Apple would be throwing its hat into the ring with a number of established companies. Why would Apple want to do that? There are a number of reasons, but one could be the potential for Apple Pay growth when it’s paired with a peer-to-peer money service. Apple, of course, would like all iPhone (and now MacBook) users to opt for Apple Pay over pulling out their wallets, and by adding peer-to-peer functionality, it could see increased growth in overall Apple Pay usage. Such growth could be facilitated if another aspect of this report turns out to be true. Apple is said to be in talks with Visa to offer its own pre-paid cards, which would presumably be used within Apple Pay as a solution for folks who don’t have a bank account. It could also be used as a shortcut to money that has been sent though Apple’s peer-to-peer service, allowing users to spend that money right away instead of transferring it to another bank account. As with all rumors, take this with a grain of salt. With a crowded space, Apple will certainly be hesitant to try developing a service of its own, even if it does see a bright future. If any company has the cash to throw at a service until it succeeds, though, it’s Apple. Perhaps we’ll find out more later this year when Apple reveals its next iPhone? We shall just have to wait and see.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Please let this iPhone wireless charging feature actually exist Chris Smith @chris_writes April 27th, 2017 at 3:16 PM Share Tweet It may not happen with this year’s iPhone 8, but Apple dreams of charging its future products with the help of conventional Wi-Fi routers or even other Apple products. The technology would not only offer a way for various devices to potentially be used as wireless chargers but would also fix the most annoying thing about wireless charging nowadays: You still have to place a device in the proximity of a charging mat or device. Don't Miss: After two weeks with the Galaxy S8, I still think the iPhone 7 Plus is the world’s best phone Early iPhone 8 rumors suggested the iPhone will feature wireless charging powers unlike anything currently seen on mobile devices. That’s long-range wireless charging support that would allow an iPhone owner to keep using a device while the battery would recharge wirelessly. Multiple reports have shot down that rumor, and more recent leaks do not mention anything about long-range support, although the iPhone 8 is still expected to feature wireless charging. Image Source: Apple via USPTO The US Patent & Trademark Office, meanwhile, published on Thursday an Apple patent application titled Wireless Charging and Communications Systems With Dual-Frequency Patch Antennas that describes antenna technology that would support simultaneous wireless charging and Wi-Fi support on a device. First discovered by Apple Insider, the patent doesn’t specifically mention the iPhone, iPad, or MacBook. And the drawings do not show anything resembling any of these devices. But the patent’s wording indicates that the wireless charging technology described herein can apply to a variety of Apple gadgets, not just the iPhone. Apple’s choice of words practically covers any device currently made by Apple, but also future gadgets that are yet to be unveiled: Device 10A and/or device 10B may be a computing device such as a laptop computer, a computer monitor containing an embedded computer, a tablet computer, a cellular telephone, a media player, or other handheld or portable electronic device, a smaller device such as a wrist-watch device, a pendant device, a headphone or earpiece device, a device embedded in eyeglasses or other equipment worn on a user’s head, or other wearable or miniature device, a television, a computer display that does not contain an embedded computer, a gaming device, a navigation device, an embedded system such as a system in which electronic equipment with a display is mounted in a kiosk or automobile, equipment that implements the functionality of two or more of these devices, or other electronic equipment. What’s interesting about this type of ambiguous language is that it also seem to indicate that Apple may be thinking about peer-to-peer wireless charging. For example, a MacBook connected to a power source might recharge an iPhone in the future. The technology might even allow iPhone owners to share battery power in the future. The patent explains that the devices may communicate wirelessly over Wi-Fi or cellular connection and that the same frequencies used for getting online or connecting to a carrier’s network might also be used for wirelessly charging a battery or providing energy to a device. The patent describes dual-frequency dual-polarization patch antennas that “may be used in beam steering arrays” and which may be used for “wireless power transfer at microwave frequencies or other frequencies and may be used to support millimeter wave communications.” Image Source: Twitter What’s interesting about these patch antennas is that they would be flat components placed over a flat metal surface inside a device. Earlier this week, a leaked iPhone 8 schematic showed what seemed to be the location of the phone’s future wireless charging coil — see that big patch under the Apple logo in the image above? Again, there’s nothing to suggest the iPhone 8 will sport such wireless charging tech. Even if the iPhone 8 would support it, you’d still need a second device to sport the same time of hardware so that long-range wireless charging would actually work.

Drew Angerer / GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / AFP Samsung and Apple maintained their leadership in the smartphone market in early 2017 while Chinese-based Huawei’s strong growth cemented its number three position, a market tracker said Thursday. Research firm IDC said overall smartphone shipments grew 4.3 percent in the first quarter, slightly better than its prior forecast, to 347 million units. “The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists,” said IDC analyst Ryan Reith. “There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and the strong first quarter results certainly support this argument.” Reith said the 2017 market will feel the impact of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship handset, and a widely expected announcement from Apple for its new iPhone later this year. According to the survey, Samsung led the market in the first quarter with a 22.8 percent share to 14.9 percent for Apple, with little growth for the top two vendors. But Huawei’s sales jumped 21.7 percent to give it a 9.8 percent share, and fellow Chinese makers Oppo and Vivo, the number four and five vendors, respectively, also boosted their sales. IDC said the bulk of smartphone growth is likely to come from low-cost handset makers. “Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets,” said IDC’s Anthony Scarsella. “Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies’ portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models.” He added that makers “have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment.” The report is based on preliminary quarterly estimates, with Apple due to report sales figures next week.

The patent, titled “Wireless Charging and Communications Systems With Dual-Frequency Patch Antennas,” details how devices could use beamforming antennas (similar to those used on the company’s existing AirPort Extreme router) to locate where a device is physically located and focus the signal there for improved range and charging speeds. Remember: this is only a patent In addition to the more general antenna bands, the patent also specifically cites transmitting power through the 60 GHz wavelength used by the WiGig 802.11ad standard, which makes sense as a high-frequency choice given that WiGig is a formalized standard that is likely closer to hardware adoption than other millimeter wave solutions. Obviously, it’s worth noting that this is only a patent, not an indication that Apple is actually working on a magical router that can give you gigabit Wi-Fi while simultaneously charging your iPhone from across a room. Still, the idea of doubling up the antennas used for Wi-Fi and cellular data to wirelessly charge devices is a clever one, even if true long distance wireless charging is still a long way away from practical day-to-day use.

Sony A6500 Apple says the change will take place in seven days and will not affect auto-renewable subscription prices. The App Store is also introducing a new tax in Taiwan that will affect developers: On May 1, 2017, a value added tax (VAT) rate of 5% will go into effect for customers in Taiwan buying apps and in-app purchases. We will administer the collection of taxes from customers and the remittance of taxes to the appropriate tax authority in Taiwan. Your proceeds will be reduced accordingly, and will be calculated based on the tax exclusive price. Apple regularly adjusts its product pricing and App Store pricing when taxes and exchange rates change. Earlier this year, for example, App Store prices increased in the U.K. by about 25% following Brexit.

The update will come roughly two years after Apple Music first launched, and mark a sizable bet on streaming video that will see several big-name celebrities contributing content. Only last year, Apple redesigned Apple Music considerably, in part to bring the company’s curated playlists to greater prominence. That was billed as a way for Apple to maximize the value of its human-curated suggestions, which it has long argued help differentiate the service from rivals like Spotify. Now, according to a report from Bloomberg Businessweek, the Next Big Thing for Apple Music is video. For that, the company has turned to Jimmy Iovine. “I’m trying to help Apple Music be an overall movement in popular culture, everything from unsigned bands to video,” Iovine told the site. “We have a lot of plans.” That will start with Carpool Karaoke, which British comedian James Corden is making for Apple. However, Apple could have as many as ten shows running by the end of the year, if Iovine has his way. In addition to the Planet of the Apps competition that will star will.i.am, there’ll also be a number of as-yet unconfirmed documentaries. “We have the freedom, because it’s Apple, to make one show, three shows, see what works, see what doesn’t work until it feels good,” Iovine points out. Rather than putting all this video into a standalone app – like the recently-launched TV app, for instance – Apple plans to integrate it into Apple Music. It’ll come with a significant redesign, it’s reported, which pushes video to the fore. The fear, it’s suggested, is that without making the expansion bold and unmissable, Apple runs the risk of replicating Spotify’s minimal impact with its own video investments. And where is iTunes in all this? Seemingly buried with as little trace as Apple can manage. The role that the little-loved media software, increasingly swollen and confusing in recent years, will play is uncertain. Previous rumors have even suggested that Apple could deprecate the role of music downloads altogether, focusing instead on all-you-can-stream subscriptions, though the company denied such a plan last year. For now, we can look forward to another version of Apple Music later in the year, arriving alongside the new release of iOS. That’s likely to be iOS 11, and launch alongside the new iPhone 8.

By Emily Bary April 27, 2017 2:17 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large iPhone owners could soon use the device's camera for more than just photography. Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto Snapchat drew some ridicule when it called itself a camera company during its IPO process, but the social networking hotshot might be onto something. In looking at what the future might entail for Apple, one analyst sees the iPhone camera playing a big role. “We believe the smartphone camera’s singular role as a passive image capturing device will end soon,” Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz wrote Thursday. In the future, he says, Apple could begin using the iPhone camera for security, gestures, and, most interestingly, contextual awareness. Get the best of Barron's Next every weekday.

The new device is expected to feature “depth sensing,” which enables a camera to get a 3D awareness of what’s in front of it. Initially, depth sensing on smartphones can improve biometric authentication -- people could use facial recognition to log into their devices, instead of a fingerprint scan. Also in the near term, the new technology could enable more sophisticated augmented-reality functions, like the ability to add smarter live overlays over photos and videos, something Uerkwitz calls “a more sophisticated version of the Snapchat filters.” In the long run, though, smartphone cameras could determine where exactly you are and what exactly you’re doing -- and perhaps better anticipate what you want. Such “contextual computing” applications might sound unnerving , but they also represent big opportunities for the companies that manage to do them right. Given a slowdown in smartphone sales and people holding their devices for longer, the industry needs a new catalyst for growth, Uerkwitz wrote. “We believe 3D sensing, or contextual computing in general, is one such catalyst.” Big Picture: Smartphone cameras have the potential to drive the next big change in computing.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Apple Suppliers for Investors to Consider The Apple supply chain has taken a hit in recent weeks, but these three companies need not worry. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Apr 27, 2017 at 2:22PM The Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supply chain has been rattled over the past few days, after rumors emerged that the iPhone maker will replace Dialog Semiconductor's power-management chips with its own solution. But this isn't the only bomb Apple has dropped on its supply chain in recent weeks. Earlier in April, Cupertino decided that it no longer needs Imagination Technologies' graphics and multimedia related chips, delivering a body blow to the supplier, which gets over half of its revenue from the smartphone giant. These supply related actions have sparked fear among chipmakers that rely on Apple for substantial business, but Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), and Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) investors might have reason to sleep a little easier. Image source: Getty Images. Why RF chipmakers shouldn't worry Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh believes that Apple is unlikely to develop its own radio frequency (RF) chips, thanks to high entry barriers and strong intellectual-property protection. The iPhone maker uses a large number of chips from these RF suppliers for different processes, which makes it difficult to source the components, since a lot of technical expertise is needed to recreate the product. As it turns out, the iPhone 7's RF content climbed 17% from the previous generation to $19 per unit, driving dollar-content gains for Broadcom, Qorvo, and Skyworks. Citigroup's Atif Malik believes that Broadcom was the biggest gainer with a 30% bump in RF content, while Skyworks and Qorvo saw gains of 10% and 8%, respectively. Apple has been using more and more RF chips from these suppliers, thanks to the evolution of wireless networks. Qorvo's research points out that a 4G smartphone contains 400% more RF content as compared with a 3G smartphone, thanks to the higher number of frequency bands. Therefore, further evolution of connectivity technology toward fifth-generation networks should open up a bigger market for RF chip suppliers, as the likes of Apple will need more chips to tackle network complexity. Not surprisingly, Qorvo expects smartphone RF content to grow at an annual pace of 15%. Image source: Broadcom. RF suppliers are diversified bets Though Apple is a substantial contributor toward Skyworks, Broadcom, and Qorvo's top lines, the chipmakers have been aggressively pursuing opportunities in other areas. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one such space, as it is estimated to boost the number of connected devices from 15 billion in 2015 to 31 billion by 2020, according to IHS. Not surprisingly, Skyworks has expanded its next-generation LTE product portfolio to provide embedded cellular connectivity to Internet of Things devices. The company's latest front-end solutions are targeting IoT devices such as wearables, action cameras, and smart meters by providing low-power connectivity in a compact form factor. Image source: Skyworks Solutions. What's more, Skyworks' IoT solutions are gaining traction in the automotive space, as LG Electronics is going to use eight of its RF chips to power location-based services and IoT applications in Volkswagen cars. In addition, the chipmaker's products have been selected by a leading electric-car maker in the U.S., though the company hasn't provided specific details about this client. Though Broadcom isn't competing in the IoT space anymore, it is trying to tap the lucrative market for global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) chips that could be worth $5 billion in 2022. GNSS chips are used to power location-based services across a wide range of applications, including smartphones, wearable devices, and drones. Broadcom has taken an early lead in this market, having launched its first GNSS chip for wearable devices three years ago. As it turns out, wearable-device shipments could double to 213 million units in 2020 compared with last year's levels, which could give Broadcom's top line a nice boost. Qorvo, meanwhile, is targeting the connected-home market. It acquired Netherlands-based GreenPeak Technologies last year to enhance its short-range RF communication technology, which should help it move faster in the smart home networking space that's expected to be worth $2.3 billion in 2020. By comparison, Qorvo's revenue over the trailing 12 months stands at $3 billion. IoT specialist GreenPeak had already made a dent in the market by shipping 100 million chips for the ZigBee smart home platform in 2015, so it adds good value to Qorvo's smartphone business. In all, the fortunes of the three chipmakers are still closely tied to Apple, but the relative strength of their products offering, coupled with each companies focus on ancillary businesses to diversify revenue makes them a safer bet.

The Apple Watch NikeLab edition is now available. The Apple Watch itself is the same as the regular Series 2 model, complete with water resistance, a built-in GPS, and a brighter display. What’s notable about this model is its band. The limited edition band features a main Light Bone color with Black holes punched throughout it. What’s notable is that that while Apple sells other Nike Sport Bands for the Apple Watch separately, it doesn’t appear that this limited edition band can be purchased on its own. This new Apple Watch NikeLab model is available from nike.com as well as NikeLab stores, and the Apple Watch Store at Isetan Shinjuku in Japan. Pricing is set at $399 for the 42mm model and $369 for the 38mm version.  Source:  Nike iOS Wearables Apple Apple Watch Products mentioned Apple Watch Next ArticleApple rumored to be working on competitor to Venmo Don't forget to VOTE!

By Chris Ciaccia Published April 27, 2017 Fox News Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print File photo: An Apple iPhone 6 with Apple Pay is shown in this photo illustration in Encinitas, California, U.S. June 3, 2015. (REUTERS/Mike Blake) In a bid to potentially boost its Services business and strengthen its ecosystem, Apple may further strengthen its role in mobile payments, potentially going after Venmo in the process.  According to a report in Re/Code, Apple may look at having a money-transfer service which would allow iPhone users to send money to other iPhone users. Apple has discussed the idea in the past, as recently as late 2015. At that time, Apple was said to be working with several U.S.-based banks about the service, but nothing came of the talks. If Apple were to come up with its own Venmo-like offering, it could help boost the Service business but it's likely more about keeping its users entrenched with Apple, experts say. "Expanding in payments would be all about the ecosystem given the minimal amounts of money Apple would make running a peer to peer payments service or its own debit card," Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research told Fox News via email. "Apple is also always keen on extending its control over the elements of its service, and so far it’s had the banks and card issuers doing most of the heavy lifting, so it’s also natural that it would want to extend further into some of the areas that it doesn’t control." It could help Apple's appeal with younger users, as it tries to fend off competition. "I believe this offering would be most appealing to college students/teenagers but a negative of course is Apple’s closed operating system, which could limit the actual opportunity such an offering would present," CFRA analyst Angelo Zino told Fox News. CEO Timothy D. Cook has talked about payments in high regards on several of the company's earnings calls, but much of the context has been in regards to Apple Pay, its existing mobile payments offering. In the company's most recent quarter, Apple generated $7.2 billion in Service revenue. Apple Pay was part of that, as Apple takes 0.15 percent from every credit card transaction in the U.S., with Cook noting that transaction volume was up 500% year-over-year in the December quarter, thanks in part to it now being available in 13 different countries.  The mobile payments business is one which includes several competitors, as they all compete for financial information of young Americans, especially millennials who have eschewed traditional banking relationships. Venmo helped PayPal, which owns the money transferring service, report strong first-quarter results.  MASTERCARD HAS A NEW CREDIT CARD WITH A FINGERPRINT SCANNER IN IT In addition to potentially competing with Venmo, along with Square Cash, Snapchat's own offering and other such services, Re/code reported that Apple has also discussed with Visa about creating its own pre-paid cards that would be tied to the new service. Both Apple and Visa declined to comment for this story. Apple is slated to report fiscal second-quarter earnings on May 2. Wall Street analysts polled by FactSet expect the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant to earn $2.02 a share on $52.97 billion in sales.   Advertisement TRENDING IN TECH 1 NASA's Cassini spacecraft sends first images from Saturn rings dive 2 Microsoft Word bug let hackers have access files for months 3 iPhone 8 may be slower than the Samsung Galaxy S8 4 Apple may go after Venmo, but why? 5 Google Home can now help you cook See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

The device may also integrate AirPlay and Beats audio technology, according to a source. The rumor comes via Melbourne-based Twitter user Sonny Dickson, who also posted leaked iPhone 8 designs and features. Dickson tweeted, “Apple is currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device.” One might expect the Apple Siri device to be priced higher than Amazon Echo, as are Apple TV, iPhone, iPads and other Apple-branded products. Amazon’s full size Echo sells for $179.99, while the Echo Dot sells for $49.99. Apple currently does not have a competitor for Amazon Echo or Google Home, both of which have been growing in the home voice assistant/smart speaker marketplaces. If Apple is, in fact, developing a competing product it would likely utilize Wi-Fi for connectivity as does AirPlay. Echo connects via Bluetooth, while Home utilizes Wi-Fi. The company may announce something about an Echo competitor at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference coming in June.

The tenth anniversary device has largely being expected to offer significant improvements over previous releases in the series. But now sources close to the Apple supply chain suggest that there may not be an iPhone 8 after all. hurk / Pixabay No iPhone 8? Reports from sources within the critical Foxconn corporation suggest that Apple will only place orders for the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. these two updated versions of the existing iPhone 7 were expected to launch alongside a brand new iPhone 8, complete with considerable new bells and whistles. The source close to Foxconn suggests that the packaging materials for the new iPhone will begin arriving in the last week of June, meaning that at least the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus can be released in September. Once these materials arrive at Apple headquarters, reports should provide further indication of the potential iPhone releases. Despite the reports, the majority of Apple observers still believe that the company will do something outstanding in order to mark the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range. This has been particularly anticipated considering that recent iPhone releases have been considered somewhat conservative. There is a clear market need for Apple to produce an outstanding device in 2017, and this would seem to pave the way for an iPhone 8 to accompany the two incremental iPhone 7S updates. Leaked images In accordance with this probability, some leaked images of the purported iPhone 8 have also emerged this week. Tipster Benjamin Geskin shared the photographs of what is believed to be a dummy version of the iPhone 8, which also emanated from the supplier Foxconn. If this leak turns out to be accurate then the iPhone 8 will deliver several features that have been expected for some time. Most notably, the concept images depict an iPhone 8 unit without a Home button. It has been suggested by many sources that Apple will indeed do away with this traditional aspect of the iPhone when the iPhone 8 is released. Samsung has, of course, ditched the Home button for the Galaxy S8, and the Galaxy Note 8 is expected to follow suit later this year. Ridding the iPhone 8 of the Home button will enable the display to extend to the outer limits of the body of the device. This is another design parameter that is becoming fashionable in 2017, with the Galaxy S8 characterised by its wraparound screen. LG has also released a handset with seriously slimmed down bezels. This would enable Apple to produce an iPhone 8 with a much larger display, while retaining the physical size of the iPhone 7. Elsewhere, it is suggested that the dual-camera setup that was included in the iPhone range for the first time in the iPhone 7 generation will be retained and upgraded, but with an interesting design innovation. Geskin suggests that the camera will be rotated 90-degrees in order for vertical stacking to be utilized. While the reasons for this may not be immediately apparent, there is an obvious motivation for Apple. Augmented reality tipped It is suggested that this will enable advanced augmented reality features to be included within the camera, something that the CEO Tim Cook has spoken glowingly on in the recent past. Cook suggests that Apple is very much committed to augmented reality, and it seems unlikely that the CEO of the company would have let this cat out of the bag if it was not to be imminently reflected in the Apple product range. Thus, the iPhone 8 could benefit from augmented reality technology, and it will be interesting to see precisely what the consumer electronics giant comes up with. Other physical aspects of the device notable from the leaked images are the placement of the volume controls and mute switch on the left hand-side of the alleged iPhone 8, while a sleep / wake control is placed on the right. Wireless charging In addition to this supposed image of the iPhone 8, further news has also emerged regarding one of the key features to be included in the device. Powermat CEO Elad Dubzinski called wireless charging “a standard feature in the next iPhone”. This is particularly significant, as Powermat is involved in wireless charging technology, and thus is considered to have insider knowledge. “With the recent announcement by Apple that wireless charging will become a standard feature in the next iPhone, we are finally at the threshold of mainstream adoption,” Dubzinski continued. Apple also entered into the Wireless Power Consortium recently, which certainly set tongues wagging, and the expectation is that wireless charging will finally feature in the iPhone 8; marking a first in the device range’s history. However, this news it should be tempered by the fact that Powermat has also released a statement indicating that it will support “whatever wireless charging protocol” Apple uses. This suggests that the company is not necessarily in possession of any specific inside information, and in fact speculating based on knowledge already in the public domain. Nonetheless, this is still another indication that Apple will include wireless charging in the iPhone 8, following the suggestion from the legendary Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities. Kuo suggested that Apple will arm both the iPhone 7S generation and the new iPhone 8 with wireless charging, as it attempts to mirror the technology already included in the Samsung Galaxy range. In addition, analysts from the massive investment bank JP Morgan have suggested that Apple is currently working with Broadcom on wireless transporting for new iPhone units. However, this particular research also suggested that due to time constraints the technology maybe delayed until next year. The speculation regarding the iPhone 8 will continue until Apple confirms its existence, even though some sources are sceptical that it will be released this year, or possibly ever.

That seems to be getting Apple’s attention. By Emily Bary April 27, 2017 1:31 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple Pay has been slow to catch on, but a peer-to-peer payment feature could boost interest. Photo: Getty Images Venmo is doing so well that it seems Apple wants in on the fun. The company is reportedly in talks with various payments-oriented companies about starting its own peer-to-peer money transfer app, according to tech site Recode.

The issue with peer-to-peer payment apps in general is that it’s hard to make money off of them. People aren’t inclined to pay a fee to send money to their friends when there are plenty of ways to do so for free, including Venmo. PayPal, which owns Venmo, offers the service for no fee for users that attach debit cards or bank accounts. The peer-to-peer platform has a clear appeal: Venmo has amassed a large, active user base. The company announced Thursday that the amount of money flowing through the Venmo doubled in the first quarter, reaching $6.8 billion. The company now hopes to start making money by charging merchants that want to make Venmo a payment option for shoppers. The merchant angle is probably making Apple nervous, since it’s failed to reach a critical mass with its Apple Pay service, more than two years after launch. An Apple Pay that works between users could be the jumpstart that the service needs. Once people link their credit cards to their iPhones in order to pay back a friend, they may be more interested in trying out Apple Pay with in-store and online merchants. And, there, Apple makes money. As it stands, Apple plays nicely with Venmo. You can “Venmo” money through iMessages and even via Siri. It’s unclear whether that would change if Apple unveiled its own rival app. Apple probably knows it has to move quickly. As the company has already learned with Apple Pay, consumer payment habits, once formed, are hard to change. Big Picture: PayPal is having success with Venmo, its peer-to-peer payment network. That has Apple’s attention.

That new emphasis on video will reportedly be the cornerstone of a revamped music app when Apple introduces the next version of its iOS operating software later this year. Iovine all but confirmed Apple Music's video ambitions in an interview with Bloomberg: “A music service needs to be more than a bunch of songs and a few playlists. I’m trying to help Apple Music be an overall movement in popular culture, everything from unsigned bands to video. We have a lot of plans.”  Several of the shows have been announced that provide a hint at just how music-centered Iovine's video plans are including exclusives on documentaries about Cash Money Records, Bad Boy Records and Clive Davis, plius original shows like “Planet of the Apps,” the recently delayed “Carpool Karaoke” and "Can’t Stop Won’t Stop” from Live Nation and Sean “Diddy” Combs.

Apple Music chief Jimmy Iovine was already an Apple veteran when he sold Beats for $3 billion in 2014. But Iovine approached Netflix as he mulled whether he could keep Beats as a stand-alone company, according to a profile in Bloomberg Businessweek published on Thursday. According to Bloomberg, Iovine realized he needed to raise money and dilute his stake in Beats because of the costs of keeping the brand afloat. But Netflix's content chief, Ted Sarandos, told Iovine the company wasn't ready for music. Iovine was a key player in Apple's release of iTunes and the iPod in the early 2000s before founding Beats. "I've always known in my heart that Beats belonged with Apple," Iovine had said in a statement after the acquisition. "The idea when we started the company was inspired by Apple's unmatched ability to marry culture and technology." show chapters Apple might be starting its own money-transfer service    13 Hours Ago | 00:47 The New York Times had previously reported that Iovine "didn't see a stand-alone model that was going to work" for Beats, which was co-founded by musical artist Dr. Dre. But the Netflix talks provide an interesting tidbit, considering that Iovine said earlier this year that Apple Music has "nothing to do with what Netflix is doing." Variety asked if he sees Apple Music attempting to become competitive with Netflix, and he replied. "I wouldn't put it that way ... When I read that, or I read that we're taking on whomever, I say no. To me it's all one thing. It's Apple Music, and it happens to have video and audio. … It has nothing to do with what Netflix is doing." Netflix itself has been bandied about as an Apple acquisition target to beef up its streaming services. But Apple analyst Neil Cybart of Above Avalon noted that Iovine's vision is different that what's out there — and that's what draws Apple in. Apple's Eddy Cue has posited that Apple Music is positioned to be more like a modern-day MTV. "If management wanted quick access to a successful music streaming service, the obvious path forward ran through Spotify, not Beats," Cybart wrote. "However, Apple wasn't looking to buy just a music streaming service. Instead, Tim Cook and Eddy Cue, Apple SVP of Internet Software and Services, were looking for a long-term vision as to how Apple should approach music content. Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine was selling that vision."

Samsung, Apple lead smartphone market Technology Thursday 27 April 2017 - 6:42pm File: Samsung and Apple maintained their leadership in the smartphone market in early 2017 while Chinese-based Huawei's strong growth cemented its number three position. Photo: MAXIM MALINOVSKY / AFP WASHINGTON – Samsung and Apple maintained their leadership in the smartphone market in early 2017 while Chinese-based Huawei's strong growth cemented its number three position, a market tracker said on Thursday. Research firm IDC said overall smartphone shipments grew 4.3 percent in the first quarter, slightly better than its prior forecast, to 347 million units. "The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists," said IDC analyst Ryan Reith. "There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and the strong first quarter results certainly support this argument." Reith said the 2017 market will feel the impact of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship handset, and a widely expected announcement from Apple for its new iPhone later this year. According to the survey, Samsung led the market in the first quarter with a 22.8 percent share to 14.9 percent for Apple, with little growth for the top two vendors. READ: Samsung's Galaxy S8 hits stores hoping to reignite brand But Huawei's sales jumped 21.7 percent to give it a 9.8 percent share, and fellow Chinese makers Oppo and Vivo, the number four and five vendors, respectively, also boosted their sales. IDC said the bulk of smartphone growth is likely to come from low-cost handset makers. "Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets," said IDC's Anthony Scarsella. "Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies' portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models." READ: Huawei launches 'no explosions' smartphone He added that makers "have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment." The report is based on preliminary quarterly estimates, with Apple due to report sales figures next week. AFP Comment Now!

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile This may be Apple’s first brand new iOS device since 2015 Chris Smith @chris_writes April 27th, 2017 at 1:14 PM Share Tweet The rumors saying that Apple is working on a Siri-based Amazon Echo rival are back, with a noted insider saying that Apple is currently finalizing the design for the unnamed product. Don't Miss: There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 “Apple is currently finalizing designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device,” Sonny Dickson said on Twitter. Apple is currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device. — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 Dickson, who has a decent track record when leaking details about unreleased Apple products (especially iPhones) also said the upcoming Echo rival is “believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run [an iOS variant].” The insider did not mention anything about an actual launch date for the product, or a price. Amazon’s Echo is currently the most popular voice-based home assistant product out there. Earlier this week, Amazon unveiled a new Echo gadget, the Echo Look that comes with a built-in camera. Amazon’s Alexa assistant, the AI brains of the Echo line of devices, is available in other non-Amazon devices as well, with more third-party companies interested in integrating the service into their products. It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run an variant iOS — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 Google is looking to turn its Home device into an equally popular gadget, although Amazon’s lead can’t be contested for the time being. A Time report in February said that Apple had no interest in making a device that would compete against Amazon Echo and Google Home. However, given the increased popularity of these home devices, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Apple come out with a competitive product that would offer Siri functionality at home.

The Apple Watch Nike+ featured exclusive sport bands, but it was otherwise technically identical to the standard Watch Series 2 models, aside from a simplified watch face for fitness fanatics, and integration with the Nike+ Run Club social platform. Today, the two companies have expanded their collaboration with the Apple Watch NikeLab. It features a new strap design, but it's otherwise identical to the previous version.You won't be able to buy the new strap design separately from the new NikeLab model, so if you've really got your heart set on it, you'll have to buy the whole Watch to get it. The Apple Watch NikeLab will only be sold through Nike's website, NikeLab locations, and - for some reason - at a single Apple Watch pop-up shop in Tokyo. The 38mm is priced at $369, while the 42mm will set you back $399.

A new report claims that Apple could launch a Venmo competitor that’ll let iPhone owners send money to other iPhone owners. Details on the service are still light, though. One source suggested that Apple’s new service could launch later this year, but another suggested that a launch date hasn’t yet been set. Apple has reportedly also talked with Visa about crafting its own prepaid card on the Visa debit network, says Recode. The Apple card would be tied to this new peer payment service and let you spend money that’s sent to you without waiting for it to be cleared to your bank account. The card could also be added to your Apple Pay wallet to pay for goods at stores and on websites. While still a rumor, an Apple service that let you send money to friends could be a nice compliment to Apple Pay. The service would likely be more deeply integrated with iOS than competing services would be and it could help to boost usage of Apple Pay, especially if Apple got that prepaid debit card that it’s rumored to be in talks with Visa about. Do you use services like Venmo, PayPal, and Square Cash? Would you use a similar service from Apple?

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. People don't want Touch ID on the front of iPhone — they want ambient, persistent authentication everywhere. Now that it seems likely that Apple will ship an iPhone with an "edge-to-edge" display — as I predicted back in January of 2015 — we're already seeing preemptive controversy over what that means for Touch ID, Apple's fingerprint authentication system. The hope is to have it on the front, where it's always been, albeit slipped elegantly beneath the display. The reality, though, might mean moving it to the back, where it can keep its current, hyper-reliable, implementation. The arguments are over the relative convenience of hitting the sensor as your phone lies flat on a table or in a charger vs. hitting it as you slide your phone from your pocket or bag. But is either really an argument for Touch ID convenience or an argument that we need even more convenient authentication than Touch ID? Touch ID, especially with Apple's second-generation sensor and the changes made with iOS 10, has become so fast and so reliable that I barely, if ever, think about it anymore. I simply pick up my iPhone 7 Plus, press the Home button with my finger, it unlocks, and I'm in. There are a few times, though, where my finger is wet, I'm carrying something and the easier finger to use isn't one that's registered with the system, or I'm wearing gloves, and I'm reminded that Touch ID is still an active process. I still have to do something and, no matter how fast it feels these days, I still have to wait for it to respond. Imagine a future where iPhone is continuously grabbing snippets of biometric and other data and using it to maintain a state of trust. Imagine a future iPhone where authentication is ambient and perpetual, not requiring a specific fingerprint or biometric challenge/response but continuously grabbing snippets of biometric and other data. And imagine it would use that data to maintain a state of "trust" where your iPhone is simply unlocked for as long as it can be reasonably (or strictly, depending on settings) certain it's in your possession, challenging only when that state becomes uncertain. There are already rumors of Apple incorporating Touch ID into the capacitive display, rather than a discrete capacitive home button, in this year's iPhone. There are also patents for microLCD technology that further enhances screen-as-fingerprint reading. Is the idea that parts, areas, or even the entire iPhone display being able to read at least partial fingerprint data really that far off? iPhone cameras are already doing face and object detection for photographic effects and tagging. Microsoft is using them for facial recognition-based authentication. We look at our screens often and it's more than possible they could not only start looking but constantly authenticating back. The same is true for infrared-based iris scanning. Samsung has recently introduced both facial recognition and iris scanning into its Galaxy phones. Unfortunately, you can't use them at the same time, with the system intelligently switching between facial recognition in daylight and iris scanning in low light, but that can't be far off either. Siri began doing the basics of voice printing a couple years ago. Now, when you use setup buddy on a new iPhone, it has you say a few simple phrases so it can distinguish your voice — and your voice queries and commands — from those of others. I don't believe it's robust enough for authentication yet, but companies like Nuance have been offering just those kinds of "my voice is my passport, authorize me" services for a while. It's not tough to see Apple using the multiple, beam-forming mics on iPhones and AirPods to constantly check for your voice either. It's the co-processor in iPhone that allows for low-power "Hey, Siri", the same co-processor that serves as the sensor fusion hub for accelerometer, manometer, barometer, and other data. Right now that's used for things like health and fitness apps and games. Taken further, though, could gait-analysis be used to record and check your walking and motion patterns, so as you move around your iPhone can know it's you that's doing the moving? Biometric data could also be supplemented by other factors, like trusted objects. Previously, trusted objects were dumb — grab someone's dongle and you got into their phone. With Apple Watch, though, trusted objects got smarter. Auto Unlock on macOS, which uses the proximity of your Apple Watch to authenticate you for your Mac, feels downright magical. You authenticate on the watch via passcode or Touch ID on iPhone, then that authentication is further projected from Watch to Mac. So could environmental data. For example, if you're in a certain place at a certain time that fits your existing patterns, that could add to the trust weighting. Taken separately, each of these authentication methods either requires user action or doesn't provide enough security to be useful. Taken together though, every touch of the display provides a partial print, every glance at the camera provides a partial face or iris scan, every word a partial voice print, every step a partial gait analysis, and if a paired Apple Watch is proximate and you're in a place, at a time, that fits your pattern, enough factors pass authentication and the moment your iPhone senses any engagement, it's already unlocked and ready to be of service. Touch ID doesn't exist for the sake of Touch ID. It's there to solve a problem — a problem that can also be solved in other ways. Conversely, any time enough factors fail authentication, your phone goes into lockdown and challenges for a proper fingerprint, iris scan, or passcode/password to make sure you're really you. And it could escalate for situations that warrant it. That's what happens today, for example, after a reboot, timeouts, software updates, etc. For secure enterprise or government use, it could do so more often and require multiple factors to resume a trusted state. We'll need considerable advances in battery chemistry and strict adherence to privacy policies to enable this kind of technology, but Apple is uniquely positioned to deliver both. Just like chipsets, they don't have to worry about acting like a battery vendor, and unlike data harvesting companies, they don't want or need any of the personal information this surfaces. To me, arguing about whether or not Touch ID would be good or bad on the front, back, or sides of iPhone 8 is too much in the now. Touch ID isn't there for Touch ID's sake. It was a way to solve a problem and, in the future, there will either be better, faster, and easier ways to solve the same problem or things that make the problem disappear so it no longer needs solving. Historically, that seems like the approach Apple takes. iPhone 7 iPhone 8 Roundup iPhone 7 Review iPhone 7 Buyers Guide iPhone 7 Users Guide iPhone 7 News Hub iPhone 7 Discussion Reader comments Dreaming of persistent, ambient authentication... for iPhone 11 4 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating dstrauss It really would be great if you could "reverse authenticate" from your Apple Watch - as long as you are wearing it your iPhone would open without the need for biometric or password input. 0 18 hours ago Reply Pale Wraith I'd rather my iPhone's security not being disabled by another device. 0 17 hours ago Reply VAVA Mk2 Android already does that with smart lock :) 0 6 hours ago Reply RodoBobJon So why is Apple Watch authentication supported for the Mac but not the iPhone?

Keep dreaming, Mike. I miss Android. I really do. But it's kinda hard to go back. I got into the smartphone game late: My first foray was with the iPhone 5 back in April of 2013. Going from a Sanyo Juno to the iPhone 5 was like when The Wizard of Oz switches to color — to say I was enthused would be an understatement. But two years later, I had become disillusioned with Apple. I was sick of all of the proprietary necessities, and I was damn sick of being asked to sign into iCloud every 5 minutes. I fell into the stereotypical Android mindset: "I want freedom and can no longer live in Apple's box." So I got the Samsung Galaxy S5. I was thrilled with it, and used it until I started working here. As I wrote more for iMore, I found myself more and more glancing back to the world of iOS. My mobile allegiance wavered, and when the iPhone 7 was released, I fell in love with the iPhone all over again. I've now used it longer than any phone in the last year, and until recently, I've been plenty happy with it. But as iOS's little irksome qualities rear their little heads, I once again feel the tug of the Android ecosystem. Samsung Galaxy S8 features I'd like to see in iPhone 8 Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Simply two of the best Why I want to switch I haven't just jumped back onto an Android phone yet. I've been mulling things over to see if it's what I truly want. Here's why I'm thinking of switching back: iCloud Let's be honest: iCloud is annoying. (Throw Apple IDs in there too for good measure.) The fact that I have to sign into every little thing on iPhone drives me crazy; Touch ID has quieted that fire to a degree, but every time I get randomly asked to sign in (for whatever reason), my ire grows again. I don't like using iCloud, and I hate even more that you only get 5GB for free. That's paltry compared to Google Drive's 15GB and photo storage capabilities. "Why don't you use both?" you might ask. I do. But why can't iCloud just be better so that I can buy in completely? Google's suite of apps have worked flawlessly for me, and you only have to sign in once and you're in for everything. Not once, on any Android device that I've used, was I randomly asked to sign into my Google account unless I had actually signed out of it myself. Everything you need to know about iCloud on iPhone, iPad, and Mac Google Photos may be free — but there's still a cost Notifications The more I think about it, the more I enjoy the Android user experience best. To me, it feels like they actually work more like Macs than iPhones do — and no matter my qualms with iOS, I love my Mac. The biggest thing for me is the way notifications are presented. Android wins big time with its stacked notifications that are neatly laid out and easy to dismiss or act upon. I also appreciate that you don't have to swipe down an entire screen to see them. Lock screen access is just more pleasant on Android, too. Notification Center: The ultimate guide Freedom There! I said it! Throw your daggers, light your torches, and sharpen your pitchforks. Kidding. It's not about freedom in the sense that Apple is an evil overlord; I'm talking about the freedom to do the actions that make sense, like quickly tapping and holding to drag apps around the home screen. Moving apps around iOS's Home screen is a chore, especially if you have a 3D Touch-enabled iPhone, and there isn't any way to customize those actions. The ability to see and manage the files stored on your device is also a massive boon to Android. I love that I can just throw songs on and then go into the internal memory as though I'm on a computer. It's especially handy for managing storage — something my iPhone constantly struggles with. Android Nougat: Everything you need to know! Options This is, obviously, the nature of the Android ecosystem being detached from hardware manufacturing. But that said, I like that I have many phone options to choose from. Before the iPhone SE, users who wanted a small phone had to stick with old technology; in contrast, if I don't like the look or size of one Android device, I can just pick another of the many options available. It's almost like you can build your own phone; you pick the features you want, and find the device right for you. There are downsides here, of course: Detaching hardware from software means that Android devices aren't always updated as quickly as they should be, and new hardware devices may not support new software features. But it's a tradeoff I'm willing to make. It also means paying less for a great phone: If I don't want to spend the cash on the latest and greatest Galaxy S8, I can likely find an Android device with decent specs for much less. Android Smartphone Buyers Guide Customizability Again, comparing iPhone and Android isn't exactly apples to apples, but I love the ability to truly customize your Android device. Between launchers, screen layout options, themes, and icon packs, you can personalize your smartphone experience, while iPhone, as a whole, is pretty cookie-cutter: You can change your background, but that's about it. Especially on larger phones, the ability to set up your screen the way you want it is paramount, especially when it comes to widgets — another boon for Android. With an iPhone, I feel like I'm interacting with a phone. When I'm using an Android device that I've set up, I'm interacting with my phone. How to personalize your Android phone with themes, launchers, and more! Native apps Android's native Google apps are better. Period. Google Calendar is far better than iOS's Calendar app, Google Maps is excellent, Google Photos is a better photo manager than the Photos app, Gmail is a fantastic mail manager, and Google Drive is easy to use, convenient, and intuitive. Are these bold statements? Sure. And you may disagree with me. But Apple has some work to do in the native apps category, and while the company's working on it, it's not there yet. Google's apps, in contrast, have seen significant overhaul over the last few years, and have not only become functionally great, but nicely minimalistic in their Material Design looks. Charging capabilities Quick Charge and wireless charging. 'Nuff said. Learn more Google Assistant Currently, Siri is the superior assistant for me, but I feel like once Google gets Assistant on its feet, it'll far surpass any Siri functionality. Given Google's track record with quick iteration and its massive database to help augment Assistant, third-party app integration and other advancements should come quickly. Learn more Why I'm hesitating While those nitpicks may make it seem like I hate my iPhone and iOS, I don't. I actually really like my iPhone. In fact, I'm having a really hard time deciding whether or not I should switch back (and it's not just because I seem to have misplaced my SIM tool). The ecosystem No matter how much I want to resist it, I've become part of Apple's larger ecosystem. I have an iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple TV, and an Apple Watch, and they all work together beautifully. Aside from phones, I have no other Android devices (largely because, well, Canada), so if I make the abrupt switch, I lose all that cross-device functionality. I love the convenience of texting on my Mac instead of having to stop what I'm doing and pick up my phone. I love wearing an Apple Watch when I'm out and really busy. Sure, I can still use the iPad, Apple TV, and Mac together, but I use my phone the most, so why wouldn't I want it tied in? AirDrop This sort of goes part and parcel with the ecosystem, but I feel that it's an important enough feature to mention. AirDrop is the BEST. If I'm out on the road with the magician I work for, and he's just received a standing ovation, which I've filmed, I don't have to painstakingly email it or transfer it to my Mac to then send to him. I just AirDrop it over, and a gigantic file near-instantly winds its way to him. Additionally, throughout the course of my day I end up having to take an enormous amount of screenshots: Quickly sending them to my Mac via AirDrop instead of having to mess around with Dropbox or Google Drive or a USB cable is more than convenient; it's a lifesaver. AirDrop: The Ultimate Guide iMessage One of the main features that brought me back to iPhone in the first place was iMessage. It's great to be able to send or receive video in full quality, and far superior to an MMS message. (On Android, you'll sometimes receive video that looks like it was shot with a toaster.) iMessage is just plain more fun, too, thanks to group messaging, stickers, and games. Google's Keyboard is trying to replicate these things, but it's not doing the best job just yet. iMessage: The Ultimate Guide Updates Perhaps the best iOS feature of all is that when an update goes out, everyone gets it instantaneously. For security and functionality, there's no beating it: Android updates can take forever to get to certain phones depending on model and even carrier. Since manufacturers can put its own specific Android flavor on its devices, these updates have to go through its system first. For example: I didn't get Marshmallow on my Galaxy S5 until like 6 months after it rolled out, and when I did, it was super-buggy. How to update your iPhone I have friends who use iOS As much as I hate to base my decision on what other people are using, I do have friends who own an iPhone, and, much like my decision to delete Facebook, I feel like switching would arouse annoyance. I share a Pages document with a friend for a project we're working on; I regularly send group texts to my band (who all use the iPhone); I also need to stay on top of updates, so I can help my mother and sister when they inevitably need it, and write for iMore. It's not so much peer pressure as the fact that I just hate to inconvenience that many people at once. Setting up a new phone takes a while Setting up a brand new phone is often fun and a journey of discovery and amazement. When you've done it four or five times in the last year, however, it can get a bit tedious. You can't really just switch at the drop of a hat; you have to set everything the way you like it, download all your most-used apps, update some stuff, and it's kind of a chore. Support Apple is a massive company with millions of customers, but when I've had to call support, I've felt like I'm the only one that matters. With a recent iCloud issue (surprise, surprise), the agent said she would follow up the next day, but actually called me back within 15 minutes to say she had been doing a bit more research and wanted to try something else before she made me wait any longer. That's excellent customer service. In contrast, going to Google for support is like going to the Prime Minister or President to ask why your trash wasn't picked up yesterday. Will I switch? I'm still seesawing, but honestly — probably. I have a perfectly good Nexus 6P sitting on my desk, and its huge screen and rear fingerprint sensor are calling to me. But I've been thinking about it for almost two weeks and still haven't pulled the trigger. Yes, my iPhone 7 has its shortcomings, but there are also many things it does right that keep me from readily crossing sides. I'm living in the ecosystem, and there are some major conveniences and niceties that I'd miss. And if nothing else: The beauty of working for a company that covers technology is that I don't have to give up one phone for the other. I can always use both! What do you think?

Left iPhone because AT&T had the monopoly and they screwed me over. Got hacktastic with custom ROMs and such from Android Froyo2.2 to 4.2. By then it evolved to the point where the native user experience was good enough to no longer justify the security risks for a rooted device in an escalating malware environment. When the iPhone 7 and iOS developed a ledger screen and multitasking, I came back, primarily because of security and updates (which is actually a major part of security). One thing Android does much better is INTEGRATION with 3rd party apps and services. If you want another app to be your primary maps/gps, email, calendar, etc, it doesn't care. You can get close by adjusting notifications, but you can't make a native app truly dormant and save space. It's getting better, but not as good as Android. But what Apple gets right is updates, AirDrop, iMessage, FaceTime, AirPlay, and more, and Android can't see, to touch it. Plus, I've always been a Mac guy, really an Apple guy since the Apple IIe we had when I was in Junior High, and the seamless transition from device to device is amazing. If they could get better widgets, give the ability to make native apps dormant, and hide app shortcuts we don't want to see with an app tray that could be pulled up for seldom used apps, it would be amazing. 0 3 hours ago Reply flychinook Only 1% of users prefer more choice of devices?

During my work week, the iPhone is the perfect companion, and can be easily used with one hand. Podcast app work great and it's very easy to get done stuff quickly. During the weekends i switch to the OnePlus 3T, that bigger screen works best, and it becomes my entertainment centre. Best of both worlds....But I feel a BlackBerry should be in there somewhere....perhaps dig out my Lumia 950XL??? 0 14 hours ago Reply rchapman80 Just read your article say I agree with you on most of your comments. I was an iPhone user since the original and then a 3GS. It was at that point I wanted more options, not less. I switched to Android and really enjoyed my experience there, but a few years ago my wife convinced me to go with an iPhone 6s Plus. I liked the phone. The operating system is smooth, the continuity between all our devices is great, the build quality is amazing and I absolutely love iMessage. As of earlier this week however, I have gone back to the Android camp. I now have a Galaxy s8+ and really do like it. I'm feeling good about being back. I will always love my MAC and the time I spent with my previous iPhones but in this point in time the pros of the iPhone just don't out way the pros I have within Android. Now before anyone tars and feathers me, this is only my opinion for myself. It was a hard decision to switch but one that I am happy with. 0 14 hours ago Reply bluegreen1965 I have been struggling big time whether to switch. My partner got the S8 and it is super fun, so it is in my face daily! However, I know that Apple is going to come out with something stupendous for the 10th anniversary later this year, so I'm hanging with my iPhone 6s until then.

I even shelved my Apple watch and got the Samsung watch and love that too. I don't miss the blue bubble of the Apple Message. I stopped and looked at the S8+ and almost gave up on waiting for the Note 8 but every time I see another rendering of what that could look like I know I did the right thing. Wireless charging is the bomb drop the phone on the pad and poof it take off, no worrying about messing up the connection and I rarely ever plug it in.

And although I would like to see the storage increased from 5GB to something more, google's 15GB is nowhere near enough ether and it is the same 99 cents a month to go to 50 on each service. The place I disagree hugely with you is Google Apps vs iOS Apps. Now you may prefer google calendar or google mail but you ignore google docs vs pages, google sheets vs numbers, and the laughable google slides vs keynote. Using theses services on a phone vs using the native apps on iOS is not even close and it further ignores things like iMovie and garage band. There are certainly some personal preferences in play here but performance alone has to tip the scale in most cases. There are some customizations that are nice in Android, but consistency normally leads to productivity although not always that sense of ownership that can feel missing on iOS. Still I think the positives outweigh the negatives. I'm sticking with iOS. 0 13 hours ago Reply cmdacos Just like how most Apple customers don't use the bad office apps, most android customers don't use the Google office apps.

This has always happened to me regardless of the iphone. Even now with my iPhone 7 it happens. 0 57 min ago Reply Magus12000 Apple ID security measures are incredibly annoying if you ever forget your password. My elderly mother forgot the password on her iPhone and it's near impossible to reset it. We had to reset the phone itself after too many failed attempts. I tried to set it up again and apparently there's an activation lock on the device, so now I need her Apple ID password. Apple doesn't do a standard password reset via email either. You need to confirm the phone number it was set up with (could be a problem after you reset the phone as you can't access messages or receive the call to confirm it, which is downright ridiculous!). I had to switch her SIM card into a backup Android phone to confirm I had access to the line. Then it asked me to confirm an old credit card number, which she doesn't even have anymore. So instead I chose the option for Apple to call me to complete account recovery, so again, I needed to switch the SIM card into an Android phone. They never even called, so the account is still in limbo and she's using my old Nexus 5x while I try to find her old credit card that she never even uses to confirm the account. I also tried setting her up with an old iPhone I have as well that I restored from a backup of her iPad. Everything was going well until the device told me that I need to log into iTunes with her Apple ID that is active on the iPad it was restored from. Again, I don't have that password and as soon as I press cancel when it asks me to enter the iTunes password, it pops again. Apparently you cannot use an iPhone without being signed into iTunes. The device is useless with a perpetual pop-up that I cannot permanently dismiss to actually use the iPhone. What a pain! 0 12 hours ago Reply Decodering I’ve thought about switching from iOS over the past couple of years for some of the same reasons cited in the article. While thinking about it, I looked at what was most important to me so that I could make sure that I was focusing on the major things and not getting caught up in the secondary stuff (all platforms will be a mix-and-match of strong points and sore spots). Ultimately, security, bug fixes, and trust in the platform overall and its maker win over other things that I like less about iOS/Apple. Apple’s approach to keeping a majority of its users on an up-to-date version of its system is the clear winner amongst the options. The close ties between software and hardware make the ecosystem much more complete. And I generally appreciate Apple’s minimalist approach to things (even if they take it too far sometimes, like actively hobbling good software by removing functionality that may or may not come back at some point). I also love the hardware Apple puts out; it just suits my esthetic sense. That said, there are times with things that aren’t perfectly mature rear their ugly head and it just feels like Apple doesn’t allocate enough resources to them despite the billions in the bank. That’s when my faith in their ecosystem integrity falters and I glance across the aisle at other platforms. But Android/Google doesn’t feel like a good fit for me for several reasons. For a while, I was actually thinking of jumping Apple’s ship – for Microsoft! (The “me” from the 1990s/2000s would be shocked at that statement.) I really was intrigued by the interface, and it seemed like Microsoft had kickstarted a new phase in its creativity. (As an aside, I recently got a new iPad but was fairly seriously contemplating jumping to the Surface Pro. I stayed with iOS.) But Microsoft botched its phone development, plus the lack of apps was enough to keep me within Apple’s universe. It looks like I’ll be staying there a while longer. 0 12 hours ago Reply Derrick4Real I agree with lots of this. i'm on a iphone 6. Not looking for a new phone either. But in the future i'm gonna very much consider android. I simply haven't been impressed with any new apple additions. I'm not fond of their app changes like the music app. Siri is meh for me. icloud 5 gbs now is too small for even just my backup. I'm only have a macbook, no appletv, ipad, iwatch and i'm not getting any either (Firetv/Roku instead) so cross device work is virtually nonexistent. I only use icloud for backup. i use one drive for storage, i have 50gbs free so apple doesn't compare. not to mention plenty of google accounts full of free storage. I have 20k songs uploaded free to google music. I'd have to pay for icloud music uploads. I occasionally get a text on my laptop which is the only cross device activty that's a plus but i just text, i don't differentiate between icloud and can't be bothered to keep track of the devices my friends have. And the only person whose phone brand i know is my mother because i bought her phone, my father because he still has a dumb phone, and my best friend who is religiously android/anti-iphone. Point is imessage is pretty irrelevant to my uses. I just need free texting. plus group texting should be banned from humanity. Also price there's a lot more hardware options. android seems to have it's issues. i don't like having to manage app closing. but generally i'm very open to it. And for my usage i wouldn't be the biggest change as i'm not embedded in the apple ecosystem in huge ways. 0 11 hours ago Reply Thoughter Unless I missed it, you missed the most important reason not to switch back - your privacy and security! Go back and read the Google terms of services and research what they are doing. In the TOS, which Google prays nobody reads or understands, you are acknowledging that they are using a "master identifying" number for you to link all of their services and info about you into a master file ("dossier" is a better word IMO). You are also giving a worldwide license perpetual license to them to use anything you upload, e.g., your photos. Google didn't start out evil, but soon they developed a dependency on advertising to survive. Over 90% of their revenue comes from advertising, so they are on a continual quest to know everything about you because that is the only way to keep the advertising model going. Folks should be alarmed that the master file/dossier Google is building on them includes copies of every email they have ever sent or received, every search they have ever conducted, every movie they've ever read, every book, article, web site they've read, everywhere they've ever driven, every photo they've taken, every social media post, every document uploaded, etc. Of course, Google doesn't sell that file directly, it's too valuable and once out they would lose their golden eggs. No Google sells access to that info to advertisers. But since that info is collated/collected about you, it is subject to lawful and unlawful access by others, including law enforcement, intel agencies, hackers, criminals, etc. Intel agencies sit back in amazement that folks voluntarily contribute to these files, something they could never amass. Thanks Goodness Apple's model is not built on selling your information. Here's hoping that they soon release the built in VPN and tracker blocker to Safari. If that happens, people at Google's HQ will be jumping out the windows. 0 11 hours ago Reply cmdacos Google is crystal clear on what they do with your data in their terms.

I can't depend on others to download apps to accommodate me if I were all google for example. I prefer some google apps as well and use them. Can't say I care about customizing. I don't stare at icons or lock screens. I go into what I need. You should be using an app, not staring at icons. That said, notifications could be better. Lots about iOS could be better and I'm sure Apple will continue to improve it. iCloud could be improved but it works fine for what I use it for.

I love them but then I end up back on an iPhone. Just today I returned the Galaxy S8+ for another iPhone 7 Plus after four days of using the S8+. The S8+ is a great device and has many things I like but there was just a batch of little things that I didn't like that made me switch back. There's a ton to like about Android phones, but as others have mentioned, I have several Apple products (iMac, MBP, Apple TV, Apple Watch 2, etc.) that it's hard to give up the ecosystem. I agree with the writer of this article about the native Google apps being superior to their iPhone counterparts. iCloud is GARBAGE I don't care what anyone says. I spent 45 mins on the phone today with Apple trying to figure out why I couldn't log into iCloud keychain and the countless times my iPhone and Macs kept asking for my **** apple ID and password.

It seems like every year when the "Galaxy S" device launches I get the urge to switch. I have to be honest, I have tried the Note 5, S7 Edge and Note 7, and Pixel only to come back to Apple. The challenge for me when I am on Android is as follows: 1) Bloat I can't say how unappealing it is to purchase a phone and be hit with the Carrier logo the minute I turn the phone on and then be forced to use their own messaging service or whatever garbage they throw at you. The Pixel was a nice change and one that I hope more phones adopt, but unfortunately LG, Samsung and others seem to cater to the carriers and unfortunately consumers are the ones that suffer. 2) I won't lie, getting a new Android device is kind of exciting (coming from iOS). Unfortunately, I do find iOS to be stale with the static grid of icons and I appreciate the way Android allows for customization of the home screen and their handling of notifications. However, once I tend to get the phone customized to my liking, I start to find issues that start to bug me. On Samsung, I start to notice things get slow over time (not months. Weeks). The lack of 1:1 scrolling becomes irritating. And the quality of applications is so inferior; applications are optimized for iPhone's whereas they seem to be a one-size-fits all with Android. In addition, many popular apps tend to hit iOS first and just look more polished than the Android counterpart. 3) The ecosystem. I found that having an iPhone actually improves my experience with other Apple devices. If you have a Mac, being able to text, answer phone calls, and the seamless integration between the two is top notch. Android really doesn't offer a "desktop" class alternative (sorry, Chromebook isn't there yet). In addition, being able to FaceTime friends and family members is so much easier with iOS than having to tell all of my family and friends to use Skype or Hangouts to video chat. Plus, if you buy an application on your iPad it just shows up on your iPhone. This tight integration makes all the difference. I do believe that Android and Android OEM's have come a long way and the temptation to switch is definitely higher than it has ever been. But I do think that if you are in the Apple ecosystem, leaving for Android is extremely hard. If the only Apple device you have is the iPhone, I would even consider looking at the S8 or Pixel, but considering I have an Apple Watch, iPad Pro, 2016 MacBook Pro, and an Apple TV makes any transition very hard. 0 8 hours ago Reply sladyrko I missed it too for the customization, sold my iPhone 6 and got me Huawei P9... **** what a mistake! Apps are so much worse, especially Instagram, Facebook, Messenger (uploading videos to my day/stories is complete trash quality wise). Updates?

P.S: I like Huawei P9 as a phone, great camera, battery not too bad, great build quality, but the biggest flaw is it's running Android... With iOS this phone would be a beast :-) 0 7 hours ago Reply cuttheredwire And that is an advantage with Android: variety. All for the low low cost of security. :P All jokes aside, at least Apple gives a small selection now: three sizes and two year versions.

Hyperbole, or actual experience? 0 4 hours ago Reply johnathanblade IMO, instead of switching, just buy a quality (something like the Moto G5 Plus) mid-range Android phone as a second device. Get a feel for the premium that you are paying for brand over utility. As for security and timely updates, while this is a real concern, it is also not a real concern. Almost no Android security issue lives in a vacuum, meaning it's rare that any one issue compromises security by itself. If you observe best practices (Don't hang out on open networks. Don't install apps outside of the Play store. Pay attention to app permissions.) Your practical chance of compromise is nil. 0 4 hours ago Reply Moodyz I agree with the author about iCloud inconveniences.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Apple's been working on bringing Siri and HomeKit Hub functionality fully into the living room for years, but what will they release and when will they release it? April 27, 2016: Apple finalizing designs for home hub Sonny Dickson, who made his name leaking iPhone prototypes from the Chinese supply lines, tweeted that the Apple home hub is nearing final design: Apple is currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device.— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 Apple TV already has both AirPlay and Siri, as well as HomeKit support, so what differentiates this product from the current Apple TV — or next generation Apple TV 4K supposedly also in the works — is unclear. September 29, 2016: Apple stepping up plans for smart home hub Mark Gurman and Ian King, writing for Bloomberg: Besides serving as a controller for other smart-home devices, the speaker would theoretically be able to process many of the Siri commands available on the iPhone. For example, users may be able to ask the device to read e-mails, send text messages and Tweets, and stream content from Apple Music. Apple has also considered integrating mapping information into the speaker, another person said, potentially allowing the device to notify a user when it's time to leave the house for an appointment. Here's the challenge, and why I think we haven't seen an Apple home hub ship already: An iPhone is a personal device. So is an iPad, the way it's currently set up. An Apple Home hub, much like an Apple TV, would be a communal device. That's why Apple TV doesn't have many of these features already. Apple obviously has the technology, but there's a big philosophical question they believe needs answering before rolling it out. More on that below. Apple home hub vs. Amazon Alexa Echo vs. Google Home From the moment Amazon launched Echo, it's Alexa voice-powered home hub, people have been asking where Apple and Siri were in the living room. The answer, so far, has been Apple TV, but as a very different type of device. When Google launched Google Home, interest in a possible Apple home hub intensified again. Apple has also had a difference in philosophy. Where Amazon focused exclusively on the living room, initially in one language and one country — English in the U.S. — Apple put Siri on every device, in dozens of countries and over a score of languages. Similarly, Alexa began third party integrations early and quickly where SiriKit is just in its first year and for just a handful of domains. In other words, Echo kills when you're in your living room in New York. It's useless when you're down the block, across town, or around the world. Conversely, Siri can go with you everywhere, but it's even-odds it'll work at any given time. An Apple hub, it's hoped, would bring the same level of home experience to Siri that Alexa has enjoyed for years. Apple home hub as multi-personal assistant <img src="/sites/imore.com/files/styles/larger/public/field/image/2017/03/macos-sierra-siri.jpg?itok=qEllQlsW" width="1600" height="1200" alt="" class=right" /> On an iPhone, saying "Hey Siri, read my texts!" results in your texts being read. On an Apple TV or Home hub, saying "Hey Siri, read my texts!" results in whose texts being read... and to whom? Do you get to access to your parents' or children's' data? Your spouses or siblings? Your roommate or host? Apple TV can already be logged into multiple Apple IDs, but tvOS hasn't made any of them available to Siri or even for messages or mail apps on the device. Because, privacy. Similar to the path Apple took with Siri apps, where they tried to go deep instead of broad, and ensure domains and intents could handle a robust set of languages and sentence structures, bringing full-on Siri to the Home requires a lot of care and consideration. That's especially true given Apple's very public, very high-level stance on privacy. Always listening microphones and always watching cameras are amazing for beam forming and target locking, but have profound ramifications for privacy. As does making Siri truly multi-user. Voice ID and pass phrases, facial recognition and body analysis, and all sorts of other authentication systems work great in the movies, but in the real-world living room? Apple won't even let Siri on Apple TV unlock your door or open your garage right now because the Siri remote can't authenticate the request the way Touch ID or the heart-rate monitor on iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch can. More than whether or not Apple will extend Apple TV or AirPort Extreme, or release Apple Speakers or a standalone Apple Home hub, how the company solves for multi-user and privacy is going to be fascinating to watch. And likely require a whole lot of that Apple "magic". Apple home hub as iCloud intermediator macOS server does a variety of amazing things, including automagically caching iCloud backups and software updates for all the Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV devices in the household. It could also work with technologies like on-demand resources, pre-fetching them a stage before so they're ready and instantly available exactly when you need them. Your Apple home hub wish-list? The best thing about unannounced, potentially never-announced products is that they're wide open. We can imagine them to be anything we want them to be. So, what would you like to see from an Apple home hub?

I love my Echo devices but not being able to have multiple accounts stinks. I also hope they have something in the works to sync Photo data.

Surely they can find a way to sync this data privately. 0 7 months ago Reply JBSlough The whole thing hinges on really good voice recognition which means that it'll be processor intensive or have to rely on the cloud. Relying on the cloud would present some privacy issues which Apple is probably working on. A neat solution would be a "home cloud" of sorts (a server, really) like a Mac Mini that runs said recognition software. Not seeing Apple getting into the personal cloud game though.... 0 7 months ago Reply mavsguy842 Options: 1) Limit what Siri on Apple TV can do. (Not a great solution, but could be a setting to put the decision in the hands of the user) 2) Only allow personal actions (reading text/email aloud) after verifying that a) an iphone, ipad, or apple watch on the same wifi network is signed into the Apple ID of the person whose text/email you're trying to get Siri on Apple TV to read -AND- ( b) the settings on their phone/ipad allows Siri to read text/email when the phone is locked -OR- c) pop up a confirmation dialogue on all devices on the same wifi network currently signed into that Apple ID that requires you to hit "accept" and also unlock the device ) Honestly, the bigger issue for me is HomeKit. I've setup automation routines, but they won't run unless I'm in the house. I've shared the home with my wife, and she has an iPhone and iPad at home, but the routines won't run unless my iPhone is on the network. That's a pretty big gap, in my opinion. If iPad is supposed to be able to act as a HomeKit hub, they need to improve the usability of routines, and let the arriving/leaving triggers take into account other people with whom you've shared your HomeKit home. 0 7 months ago Reply Tech198 Yes, i doubt Siri would be able to control everything... and sign in to everything as we all would like. Although, it would surly be more convenient.. then needing a keyboard weather real or virtual. I would say on level of privacy, Apple can only say this because Siri goes to Apple servers, and as a result, that basically wanting to do two things at once here.. Keep your stuff login stuff private while being in the cloud. However, we already have that anyway with iCloud drive. usernames/password with iTunes Store, so Apple's reason for not doing this with Siri kinda falls a bit short.. If the reason is anyone shouting in your room would now know the password as well for lack of asking Siri for this, it doesn't really matter, since if someone else is starring at the screen currently they know what u enter anyway. Keyboard is gotten rid of anyway with Siri, and all Apple needs to do is use the same encryption they use for other stuff but on Siri 1 7 months ago Reply Mister Gmann I figured out a way to make Hey Siri work for multiple users. Reason I want to make Hey Siri work with multiple users is for HomeKit reasons so it would work with the iPad I mounted in the kitchen. There are three adults in the house (Me, my wife and my MIL) that I want to have Hey Siri work for. So here's what I did...Turned Siri off and back on to start from scratch. Had my wife say the first phrase, then I said the next and we continued to alternate until we finished the process. Good news is that Hey Siri now works for all three of us. My first attempt I tried to have the three of us alternate but when we finished it wouldn't work for me (they said more phrases). My wife said let's try a male and female voice and see if that works. Well, not sure why but it did work. With that said, I wonder if because they are mother and daughter and if that helps with the recognition since there is likely a similarity in their voices. But in any event, it's working for me now so I'm happy. -1 5 months ago Reply cuttheredwire I think you've got some food stuck in your "Apple home hub as multi-personal assistant"… wait minute… just an unparsed image tag. 0 13 hours ago Reply CavemanJohn Simple solution to different accounts - each user has their own phrase for getting Siri's attention - Hey Siri, vs Hi Siri vs Yo Siri.

Abrams and R. Kelly By Joseph Keller Thursday, Apr 27, 2017 at 11:25 am EDT 0 Comments Apple Music's Jimmy Iovine is once again talking about his efforts to expand the service's video offerings. Iovine says that he's focused primarily on music-related video for Apple Music, such as a potential collaboration with R. Kelly, but he's also exploring moves beyond music. From Bloomberg: Eventually he plans to go beyond music and has discussed possible ideas with his friend Brian Grazer, producer of Empire and Genius, and director J.J. Abrams. "Apple Music is nowhere near complete in my head," he says. The service, with more than 20 million subscribers, is the second most popular after Spotify, with more than 50 million premium members. In recent months, Apple Music has put more of an emphasis on video content. While not original productions for the service, a number of artists, including Drake, Future, and 6LACK have offered exclusive music videos and even short films on Apple Music. Later this year, Apple will also debut Carpool Karaoke: The Series on Apple Music, along with Planet of the Apps, a Shark Tank-like series about app development. Interestingly, Bloomberg also offers a tidbit of supposed information about iOS 11, saying that when it launches this year, the updated Music app will include a little more focus on video.

Titled Can't Stop Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story, the documentary follows the rise of Combs and Bad Boy Records in the 1990s and the issues faced last year when assembling the Bad Boy 20th anniversary reunion shows. The film will be made available to Apple Music subscribers on June 25. From Billboard: "I went to the [Bad Boy Reuion] concert and thought it was incredible," Jimmy Iovine, Apple Music chairman and CEO, tells Billboard. "I think Puff and Bad Boy's story is incredible and one that a lot of people can relate to in any genre or in any business. His story is powerful. He really overcame a lot to get to where he's at today and the documentary shows that." This rights acquisition reflects Apple's continuing efforts to offer a distinct video experience that compliments its streaming music service. In a recent interview, Jimmy Iovine talked about his ambitions for Apple Music's video catalog, and while he has broader plans for the future, music-related video remains his primary focus for now.

Apple has just released iOS 10.3.2 Beta 5 for developers around the world. iOS 10.3.2 Beta 4 was released this Monday. iOS 10.3.2 Beta 5 Arrives Just Three Days After Beta 4 – Download it Today Apple released the fourth beta of iOS 10.3.2 this Monday, and already the company has pushed out a brand new build. Just like previous releases, the new build is available to download over the air, and you can grab it right now if you are on a WiFi network and happen to have the pervious version of the software installed on your iPhone or iPad. Related Beta 4 Download Released: iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2, tvOS 10.2.1 To kick things off, first of all make sure that your device has at least 50% of battery remaining.

Rumors have been floating around about an Apple Money-transfer service since 2015; now it seems the company is making another push in the space. Unfortunately, it seems the service would be limited to people on Apple’s ecosystem, perhaps only from iPhone to iPhone. That would make it extremely-not-useful if you have any friends that owe you money and run Android. Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT The pre-paid debit card rumor is a bit more interesting. According to the report, the company has been in talks with Visa to create a card that would be tied to the payments system. The idea is that you would be able to transfer money through the peer-to-peer payment system and be able to use your funds instantly. With Venmo, you typically have to wait a day to access your funds – longer, if on a weekend or holiday. The debit card might only come in digital form, so you’d have to either add it to Apple Pay or use it with online retailers. Apple Pay hasn’t been quite the revolution Apple promised, so this would at least be one way to get more people to use the service. Still, limiting the payments service to Apple devices only seems absurd – here’s hoping Apple opens up its walled garden just a little bit, should the product ever come to fruition.

Woodvine on April 24th, 2017 at 4:25 PM 1 of 5 2 of 5 Out of the blue, a neglected, eight-year-old security vulnerability caused by the way the Internet supports multilanguage Unicode typefaces has resurfaced with a splash. Two weeks ago, an information security researcher demonstrated how easy it was to still use Unicode font tricks to make malicious faked websites look safe and legitimate in modern web browsers. In an April 14 blog post entitled “Phishing with Unicode Domains”, security researcher Xudong Zheng showed off a one-page website he created using a properly registered domain name. When viewed in certain versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera, Zheng’s “proof of concept” website showed both a reassuringly secure and encrypted connection and one of the most trusted URL addresses in the world, namely “http://www.apple.com“! Of course, the website had nothing to do with Apple and neither did the URL—it just looked that way. The “аррӏе” of Zheng’s URL was made using characters from the Slavic Cyrillic alphabet—an alphabet included in every Unicode typeface. The Cyrillic characters and the order in which Zheng used them in just happen to bear a near-perfect resemblance to the Latin alphabet characters that spell “apple”, though the pronunciation of the Cyrillic “аррӏе” would be closer to “arr-eh”. What Zheng had pulled off is well known among Internet security experts as a homograph attack, one exploiting the superficial resemblance between characters in different language scripts to fake website URLs. More specifically it is called an IDN homograph attack, because it exploits the Unicode font support of the Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) system, which has allowed for the creation and registration of non-English domain (website) names for the last eight years. However, before I go any further to explain the flaw that Zheng exploited, I want to quickly address his claim that certain web browsers are still susceptible to it—specifically that Mozilla (the makers of Firefox), when informed of the vulnerability in January of this year, decided not to issue a security patch and therefore that Firefox continues to be vulnerable. A “proof of concept” proves not so dangerous after all Google Chrome 57.0.2987.133 displayed the faked URL as www.apple.com but the lastest version, 58.0.3029.81 wasn't taken in. My personal tests with the eight web browsers that I have on hand confirm that Google Chrome was vulnerable until March 30 but not after that date, and that the Opera browser, up to the very latest version, is still vulnerable. However, none of the Firefox versions I tested (going back to 2014) were fooled in the slightest, and even the aged Internet Explorer 10 (from 2012) didn’t actually fail. Basically, only two of the eight web browsers I tested displayed the spoofed Unicode URL as “http://www.apple.com“: Chromium-based Opera, version 44.0 (since updated to fix this flaw) Google Chrome 57.0.2987.133 (March 30, 2017) Firefox-based Pale Moon 27.0 and every other Firefox browser I tried siplays the url properly as http://xn--80ak6aa92e.com. Six of the eight web browsers I tested safely displayed the spoofed Unicode URL in its non-Cyrillic ASCII form: “http://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com“. Google Chrome 58.0.3029.81 (latest) Midori 0.5.11 (latest) Firefox-based Pale Moon 27.0 (2016) Chromium-based Vivaldi 1.0.435.42 (2016) Maxthon Nitro 1.0.1.3000 (2015) Firefox 28 (March 2014) Internet Explorer 10.0.9200.16843 (2012) The 2012-vintage Internet Explorer 10 safely displayed the ASCII version of the URL—in the address bar, at least. You can test whatever web browsers you use on Zheng’s proof of concept example. Now back to the previously scheduled technical explanation, already in progress. The perils of teaching an old dog new tricks Unicode is an international standard created in 1991 for digital text, which recognizes a total of 128,000 characters covering 135 of the world’s modern and historic scripts. Most modern typefaces include only a fraction of the Unicode total—Arial, for example, contains a total of 27,720 characters, including special invisible ones to indicate things like a change in the reading direction. The Unicode standard, when it came into being, only had desktop computers in mind. The Internet—which was a nearly 20-year-old U.S. government research project when the Unicode was being implemented—wasn’t even on the public radar yet and anyway, thanks to the age of its conception, the Net was already firmly based on U.S. English. The Domain Name System (DNS), for example, gave every numeric server address on the Internet (email, ftp, website and so on) an equivalent, easier-to-remember (for people, at least) English-language domain name. It was drawn from a subset of the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) character set—specifically the letters A through Z, the digits 0 through 9, and the hyphen character. It wasn’t until 2009 that Internet domain names became truly multilingual (after a fashion) with the implementation of the Unicode Internationalized domain name (IDN) system. Actually, all server address domain names are still based on the U.S. English ASCII character set. But just as the ASCII DNS system sits atop the numeric address system, so too the Unicode-based IDN system now sits atop the ASCII-based DNS system, with all Unicode domain names having an ASCII equivalent called a punycode. To take Xudong Zheng‘s deceptive Unicode IDN as an example, the Unicode “http://www.apple.com” is converted by the DNS system into the ASCII-only punycode “http://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com“, which is, itself, just a mask for a numeric address, such as “64.66.26.158”. Using Unicode to bait a “phish”hook Opera 44.0 takes the bait of a Cyrillic-styled "paypal" website link found in Google and which now fortunately points nowhere. Since the introduction of Unicode support to Internet systems in 2009, security experts have warned of a variety of ways in which Unicode typeface characters could be used for so-called “phishing” attacks. Phishing is the term for fraudulent schemes to trick computer users into giving up sensitive personal data, usually by tricking them into downloading from the Internet and installing onto their computers disguised software, or “malware”, designed to secretly collect and transmit their passwords and credit card numbers. A key to this kind of online con job is to use the most compelling clickbait email offers and/or trustworthy-looking counterfeit websites. Beyond Zheng’s example, consider the word at the end of this sentence: “Раураӏ” It’s made of the following Cyrillic characters: “Er-a-u-er-a-palochka”. I dare you to distinguish it from the ASCII word “Paypal”. Which is to reiterate that Unicode font support allows for the creation of some very convincing-looking fake domains of famous Western websites, using lookalike characters from non-Roman Unicode alphabets, such as Cyrillic but that’s not all Unicode offers would-be fraudsters. In a 2015 post on Unicode spoofing tricks, I covered a range of possible Unicode homograph attacks, from website domain name spoofing—which may (or may not) still just be a speculative risk—to the well documented use of invisible Unicode RLO characters. These are designed to indicate changes of reading direction, to disguise dangerous malware programs as harmless picture files, in order to trick computer users into opening them. Steps have been taken over the years to mitigate various vulnerabilities inherent in Unicode support. Web browsers will now always render domain names that mix Unicode and ASCII characters in their ASCII/punycode equivilent. However, Zheng’s pure Unicode domain name was (and is) able to slip past some current web browsers. If nothing else, we have to hope that the fact serves as a wake-up call to the various browser makers to once and for all try to patch all the known security vulnerabilities presented by Unicode font support. For my part, I’ll certainly be laying off using Opera until I hear that the still-glaring Unicode flaw in that browser has been patched.  Update: I didn't have to wait long! According to the Opera blog, Opera Stable 44.0.2510.1449 update, released April 25, "has been enriched with a security patch to prevent possible phishing with Unicode domains". The Opera blog even includes screen shots to show how the update now renders Xudong Zheng's fake Cyrillic Apple domain in its punycode equivalent. Stanley Q.

With the NFL only 24 hours away, lets reflect back to the 2016 NFL Draft. The 2015 New York Giants finished with a 6-10 record, and had the 10th overall pick in what turned out to be a draft filled with talented players. With the 10th pick, the Giants selected Eli Apple, CB from Ohio State. Now that he has amassed one full season under his belt, lets grade this pick, and look forward to our next first round selection, and make a prediction of our next first round pick will make less of an impact, an equal impact, or a greater impact, then Eli Apple did.             Eli Apple started the season as the nickel corner, behind talented veterans Janoris Jenkins and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Eli Apple would make his first career start on September 25th, 2016 in a 29-27 loss to the Washington Redksins. During the start, Eli Apple ended up injuring his hamstring, and was forced to miss two of the next three games, with separate injuries. There was certainly some growing pains for the young CB, as the 21 year old would have to adjust to a new level of competition, the low point for Apple could be considered his game against the Philadelphia Eagles, where he was benched for cornerback Trevin Wade after not playing well.             Eli Apple began to show promise for the Giants, during the Giants week 13 matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Eli Apple not only intercepted Ben Roethlisberger (his first and only INT of the season), he would also record his first career fumble recovery in a 24-14 loss. Overall Eli Apple played in 14 games, starting in 11 for the New York Giants, recording 7 pass deflections, 51 combined tackles, and the aforementioned interception and fumble recovery. He would be named to the 2016 All-Rookie Team, as NFL Media Senior analyst Gil Brandt was quoted as saying “Some thought the Giants reached for Apple in the draft, but I think he outplayed expectations…Apple looks like he’ll be a cornerback in the NFL for a long time; he can play inside or outside” (Source Giants.com)                         The Giants got an impact player once Eli Apple adjusted to the NFL level, and was able to maintain being healthy. From Week 10 onward, Eli Apple took more then 95% on the defensive side of the ball, and while there were growing pains, it is clear the Giants have found themselves a long time starter in their 2016 first round pick. I give this pick an A, the Giants did very well for themselves.             I think whoever the Giants draft tomorrow night in the first round will have some big shoes to fill if they want to have as much impact as Eli Apple did. For this to happen, I believe the player will have to come in, and be an instant contributor on either side. If the Giants do choose to go with offensive linemen, and he is able to play every snap from the Left Tackle position well, I believe the Giants will believe that he provided as much value as Eli Apple did this past NFL season. In my own personal opinion, I think the play will be slightly less valuable to the Giants then Eli Apple was, not because I think they can not be successful, but because expectations need to be tempered to a later first round pick, and Eli Apple did have some growing pains, as is expected. At the end of the day, if the Giants are able to choose a starting-caliber playing, and they show flashes of greatness, that will be good enough for me, and many other Giants fans.    Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Giants Draft Booms and Busts Texans Select Deshaun Watson LSU safety Jamal Adams selected by Jets Giants Draft: 3 Things that will happen John Ross finds a home with Cincinnati Share & Embed Broncos Schedule Breakdown: Part 1 Full Story The Giants Beat Top Stories Instant Draft Analysis: Evan Engram The Giants Beat examines New York's top draft choice and how he'll fit in with the G-men. by Alex Evans The Giants BeatYesterday at 8:54 PM Giants select Evan Engram with No. 23 pickThe New York Giants selected Ole Miss product Evan Engram, with the 23rd overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft. by Alexander Wilson The Giants BeatYesterday at 8:37 PM Giants Draft Booms and Busts The Giants Beat takes a look bask at the past five Giants drafts and identifies the booms and busts. by Sara Stanley The Giants BeatWednesday at 6:55 PM Giants Draft: 3 Things that will happen The Giants Beat predicts three things that will and three things that won't happen to the Giants on draft night. by Sara Stanley The Giants BeatWednesday at 5:39 AM Giants NFL Draft Prediction: Round Seven New York will go with a talented defensive end out of UCLA with their final draft choice. by Alex Evans The Giants BeatWednesday at 7:06 PM Giants 2017 Final Mock Draft The NFL draft is 7 days away, and there are still several looming concerns for the Giants.

Andrew Cunningham - Apr 27, 2017 6:20 pm UTC Enlarge / Apple's Craig Federighi talks up Apple Pay on the Web. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 78 Share this story Rumors about an Apple-backed peer-to-peer payments system that could compete with services like Square Cash, PayPal's Venmo, and Google Wallet have been floating around for years. Those rumors still haven't amounted to anything yet, but a new report from Recode indicates that Apple is still interested and that it's in talks with banks and other "payments industry partners" about launching a peer-to-peer payments service later this year. If launched, the service would likely fall under the Apple Pay umbrella. Right now, Apple Pay supports online and in-app payments and in-person contactless payments, but the app only lets users send money to merchants. The company is also allegedly looking into offering its own pre-paid debit cards, though the Recode report suggests Apple could face pushback from the banks it partners with to make the rest of Apple Pay work. Further ReadingApple Pay introduces website payments but punts on peer-to-peer money transfer If Apple did get into the money transfer business, it would be a late entry into a crowded market, much as Apple Music was. But the sheer size of Apple's installed base and its ability to push these new services out to people quickly via an operating system update without needing to prompt for any new app downloads or account sign ups still shouldn't be underestimated. At last count in December, Apple's music service had racked up 20 million paid subscribers after a little less than a year and a half. This isn't too shabby compared to the 50 million milestone that Spotify just hit after a little more than eight years on the market, though that is up from 30 million in March of 2016 and 40 million in September. Apple Music obviously hasn't stopped Spotify from growing quickly, and an Apple-backed money transfer service wouldn't necessarily upend that market, either. As of iOS 10, Apple lets third-party peer-to-peer payment apps offer iMessage and Siri app extensions to allow their apps to integrate more deeply with the rest of the operating system. Whether an Apple-owned service would be able to do extra things that those third-party services can't isn't clear.

Apple today released iOS 10.3.2 beta 5, days after launching beta 4. The update is now available to registered developers, who can grab it by going to Apple’s Developer Center or over the air on their device. The update to iOS 10.3.2 contains some fixes for SitiKit car commands, but other than that, the contents of the update remain a mystery. iOS 10.3.2 is likely focused on under-the-hood performance improvements and bug fixes, though. Apple hasn’t announced when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the public, but now that we’re on the fifth beta release, the public launch could be coming soon.

It recently dawned on me that throughout my life, Apple has had a constant, underlying presence in the background. From the bland “platinum gray” computers in my elementary school’s computer lab to the colorful iMac G3s that all of my friends seemed to have once upon a time, Apple managed to leave a lasting impression on me before I even realized that Apple was both a fruit and a company. Nothing would solidify Apple’s name more than the reveal of the iPod, which took the world by storm in the early 2000s. Apple would have a solid string of iconic gadgets for the next decade including the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, making the company hands down one of the most quintessential in my life thus far. However, as they say, all good things must come to an end – even if just for a short while – and one recent Apple gadget has yet to impress the consumer market on the same scale as the rest of their products: the Apple Watch. Perhaps it’s due to the nature of smartwatches themselves. While more manufacturers are devoting more time and resources to the peculiar gadget, hype for them is growing at a snail’s pace. Do people really need (or even want) another gadget to keep track of? After all, didn’t smartphones become so popular largely due to the fact that they made for a decent all-in-one device that negated the need for a separate music player, camera, phone, GPS, PDA, etc.? While it’s true that a smartwatch's purpose is muddled - is it a smartphone accessory or a replacement? - they can be useful for some. I believe that the overall desire and demand for smartwatches are lower than expected, but I think a bigger reason for this is simply that smartwatches are not a good purchase for the money for most people currently, and where Apple has previously succeeded in “borrowing” an existing idea, fine-tuning it and making it successful, they have failed to do so with the Apple Watch. Which isn’t to say that the Apple Watch isn’t successful for a smartwatch, but it hasn’t been as successful on as grand of a scale in comparison to other Apple products at launch. Despite being content with my Pebble watch for the time being, I found myself casually browsing smartwatches the other day. Despite the “Best Smartwatches” and “Top Smartwatches” list, of which all featured the Apple Watch somewhere, I never once considered buying it. For me, that's weird; I always consider Apple when comparison shopping. Not the Apple Watch, though. Not only do I not currently use an iPhone, making the potential purchase useless, but its overall design, price, and performance weren’t tempting, either. In order to win me, a generic consumer of the utmost caliber, over with the Apple Watch, here are the changes I would like to see: 1. Better battery life This is a given, but it’s also a biggie. The reason that Pebble had me from the get-go is because I only have to charge it once or twice a week. I can sleep with it on, track my sleep habits, use it as an alarm, and use it for notifications throughout the day for at least 5 solid days without worry that my watch will die on me at some point. While likely a trade-off between the Pebble Time’s ePaper display and Apple’s OLED display, I much prefer the one that gives me a longer battery. 2. Thinner I can’t believe I’m saying this, but considering all of Apple’s efforts to make its other iGadgets as thin as possible, the Apple Watch is the one that needs it the most but doesn’t have it. I’m not a watch person because I’m not a fan of how they feel on my wrist. If I could bet on anybody to implement the values of thinness and lightweight material in a gadget, it was Apple. Although this probably directly conflicts with my first proposed change of better battery life, I would say this is almost equally as important. 3. Non-exclusive I get it. Apple wants to keep Apples to Apples. It’s almost always how it has been (with the exception of Apple Music) but I think it’s time for the company to swallow its pride and allow Apple Watch to be compatible with other platforms. I don’t know about other smartwatch buyers, but the last thing I want is another gadget that I feel compelled to upgrade every year or two. I want to buy a smartwatch for the long haul. Without knowing whether my next smartphone will be an Android, iPhone, or dare I say it, Windows Phone, buying an Apple Watch that only works with Apple products is a big commitment that I’m not willing to make anytime soon. The iPhone isn’t the be all, end all smartphone that it used to be; Android brought some serious competition to the table in recent years, and they’re not letting up anytime soon. Those are pretty much the three big things keeping me from buying an Apple Watch. Taking recent rumors into consideration, it would seem that these changes will be me made sooner rather than later, as it is said that the company will be switching out its OLED displays for micro-LED displays instead, which require less power and may allow for the watch to be thinner. However, even if Apple were to make their smartwatches thinner and more power efficient, I’m still not sure I’d be convinced to buy it still knowing that it only works with Apple products. I feel non-exclusivity is an equally important change to make at this point. It’s possible that the Apple Watch may never take off, but I don’t think that’s the case. I think smartwatches have a real future, just not so much in their current state. I’m used to seeing Apple succeed from the get-go, so it will be interesting to see if the company can get this relatively struggling product to take off before somebody else beats them to the punch. Readers, what are your thoughts on Apple Watch? Do you think that the product will eventually live up to the hype that other Apple products have, or do you think that it’s doomed to fizzle out?

That’s what happened to a 22-year-old college student in Maryland after his car was struck by another vehicle and his iPhone was slung out of reach… Sony A6500 Casey Bennett says he was driving to class on April 6 when his Jeep was hit by another driver and flipped. Bennet’s airbags deployed and his seat belt kept him strapped in, but his iPhone fell from his center console to the ground. Bennet happened to be wearing an Apple Watch, however, and thought to use the Emergency SOS feature to dial 911 for help. “I was trying to figure out if I could get out, and I was like nope, you’re just going to have to hang out here,” Bennett said. It was then that he pushed one button on his Apple Watch. “I just pressed down this side button on here for six seconds and it called 911,” Bennett said. Bennet adds that he sent Apple CEO Tim Cook a note describing the experience and how he was helped by his Apple Watch which got a response from the company. Apple added the emergency SOS feature to Apple Watch in the watchOS 3 software update last fall. In the U.S., holding down the side button on Apple Watch for a few seconds calls 911 and sends a text to your emergency contact that you need help … all without having to tap through multiple apps. Emergency SOS also sends your current location including updates over time when activated. Outside of the U.S., the feature works with other emergency services as well. If you don’t have the feature fully setup, you can learn more about how SOS on Apple Watch works here.

Research firm IDC said overall smartphone shipments grew 4.3 percent in the first quarter, slightly better than its prior forecast, to 347 million units. "The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists," said IDC analyst Ryan Reith. "There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and the strong first quarter results certainly support this argument." Reith said the 2017 market will feel the impact of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship handset, and a widely expected announcement from Apple for its new iPhone later this year. According to the survey, Samsung led the market in the first quarter with a 22.8 percent share to 14.9 percent for Apple, with little growth for the top two vendors. But Huawei's sales jumped 21.7 percent to give it a 9.8 percent share, and fellow Chinese makers Oppo and Vivo, the number four and five vendors, respectively, also boosted their sales. IDC said the bulk of smartphone growth is likely to come from low-cost handset makers. "Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets," said IDC's Anthony Scarsella. "Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies' portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models." He added that makers "have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment." The report is based on preliminary quarterly estimates, with Apple due to report sales figures next week.

Amazon’s Echo is currently the most popular voice-based home assistant product out there. Earlier this week, Amazon unveiled a new Echo gadget, the Echo Look that comes with a built-in camera. Amazon’s Alexa assistant, the AI brains of the Echo line of devices, is available in other non-Amazon devices as well, with more third-party companies interested in integrating the service into their products.

A Time report in February said that Apple had no interest in making a device that would compete against Amazon Echo and Google Home. However, given the increased popularity of these home devices, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Apple come out with a competitive product that would offer Siri functionality at home.

The company has recently held discussions with payments industry partners about introducing its own Venmo competitor, according to multiple sources familiar with the talks. The service would allow iPhone owners to send money digitally to other iPhone owners, these people said. One source familiar with the plans told Recode they expect the company to announce the new service later this year. Another cautioned that an announcement and launch date may not yet be set. Apple previously held talks with banks about such a service back in 2015 but did not end up launching anything. If it happens this time, the new Apple product would compete with offerings from big U.S. banks as well as PayPal, its millennial-popular subsidiary Venmo, as well as Square Cash in the increasingly competitive world of digital money-transfers. Chase’s QuickPay service processed $28 billion in transfers last year, while Venmo registered $17.6 billion in volume and is still doubling year over year. These services have typically been money losers for the new entrants in the space, but are seen as the gateway to the next generation of payment and personal finance services that could upend traditional consumer banking relationships. They are used for everything from splitting dinner bills to paying rent. Apple has also recently held discussions with Visa about creating its own pre-paid cards that would run on the Visa debit network and which would be tied to the new peer-to-peer service, sources told Recode. People would be able to use the Apple cards to spend money sent to them through the new service, without having to wait for it to clear to their bank account. Users could then add the debit card, which may only come in a digital form, to their Apple Pay digital wallet to use for tap-and-pay purchases at brick-and-mortar stores. The card number could also be used to make purchases on websites and in apps. Apple and Visa spokespeople declined to comment. Apple is looking for new ways to boost usage of Apple Pay, and the debit card could be one way to do that. Several sources inside big U.S. banks told Recode that Apple Pay usage has been lighter than expected since it launched two and a half years ago. Long-time Apple analyst Gene Munster recently told the Wall Street Journal that he estimates Apple saw $36 billion in 2016 Apple Pay transactions, well below his original prediction of $207 billion. The service has an uphill battle in physical stores because it is not accepted everywhere and is not widely viewed as a significant upgrade over physical cards. Industry insiders are much more excited about the service’s future inside of websites and apps. That’s because it eliminates the need to enter in information like card numbers and shipping addresses that can be a cumbersome task on the small screens of mobile phones. Apple charges banks 0.15 percent of each Apple Pay credit card transaction in the U.S., and a tiny sliver of debit card purchases. But Apple would likely not charge consumers to use the money-transfer service, meaning it might only be able to make money if they also use the Apple debit card tied to it. The potential of Apple getting its own debit card, however, is not sitting well with some bank executives, sources told Recode. Some plan to raise their concerns with Visa next week during an annual summit that the credit card company is hosting for its bank partners. “Banks spent heavily in insuring their cards were top of wallet when they all built and rolled out Apple Pay,” said Cherian Abraham, a digital payments executive at Experian. “So it’s justifiable to be concerned that Apple will have its own card and could potentially be top of wallet. If you are top of wallet, you are top of mind.” It’s unclear whether pushback from the banks could pressure Visa into not working with Apple on the initiative, or what that might mean. There is a chance that banks’ fears may be overblown, however. Apple would likely have to provide incentives or rewards to get people to switch to its pre-paid card over their existing credit or debit cards. But it’s not clear whether Apple is willing to fund such a rewards programs itself, and it seems unlikely that banks or merchants would do it for them. One potential target audience for a pre-paid Apple debit card could be teens or college -aged young adults who don’t have a bank account or credit card, but want an easy way to use the money their friends or parents send them through the service. Square’s Square Cash service offers a similar virtual debit card, and CEO Jack Dorsey talked about this very use case at a recent Recode Code Commerce event.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Former Nikki's Cafe building razed for Chase Bank Thursday Apr 27, 2017 at 10:48 AM Apr 27, 2017 at 1:39 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — An abandoned building that once housed the iconic Olympic Flame and Nikki’s Cafe has been demolished to make way for a new bank. Chase Bank, who has the ground lease on the southeast corner of Bear Valley and Apple Valley roads, pulled the demolition permit and began razing the building on Wednesday. "Chase Bank has for many years planned to build and operate a branch location at this prime corner,” said Orlando Acevedo, assistant director of economic development and housing for the Town of Apple Valley. “We are excited to see this project moving forward once again. It is another indicator that the rising economic tide is enabling projects to emerge from dormancy." Built as the Olympic Flame in the ‘80s and later remodeled and named Nikki’s Cafe, Robin Angelopoulos and her family closed the eatery and leased the property to Chase Bank in late 2011 after 28 years of business. The following year, heavy equipment operators tore down two small structures next door to the main restaurant. The structures included an old house and a building that was used by Yun’s Produce, according to Randy Williams, superintendent of Butler Construction in Irvine. For nearly five years, many residents have called the old building, surrounded by a construction fence and screening, an “eyesore,” with many hoping that a Trader Joe’s, Johnny Rebs’ or Chick-fil-A would occupy the space. In 2014, rumor spread that a strip club had purchased the building that once served biscuits and gravy, and homestyle meals. Chase Bank has branches in Adelanto, Apple Valley, Victorville and two in Hesperia. Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's Work on a Virtual 3D UI for a Future Headset Focuses on the Position of a User's Eyes | Main | Foxconn's Chairman Terry Gou and President Trump are set to Meet Next Thursday » April 27, 2017 Apple's Patent Pending Venmo-Like Apple Pay Service may be coming to Market later this year   Patently Apple covered two patent applications from Apple about potential new future financial services related to Apple Pay in 2015 and 2016. The patents covered iPhone owners being able to transfer funds to their friends, family or colleagues. It 's now being reported that Apple "has recently held discussions with payments industry partners about introducing its own Venmo competitor, according to multiple sources familiar with the talks. The service would allow iPhone owners to send money digitally to other iPhone owners."   A "Venmo" is a mobile payment service owned by PayPal. It allows users to transfer money between one another using a mobile phone app or web interface. It handled $7.5 billion in transactions in 2015, and nearly $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2016.   ReCode reports today that "One source familiar with the plans told Recode they expect the company to announce the new service later this year. Another cautioned that an announcement and launch date may not yet be set.   If it happens this time, the new Apple product would compete with offerings from big U.S. banks as well as PayPal, its millennial-popular subsidiary Venmo, as well as Square Cash in the increasingly competitive world of digital money-transfers. Chase's QuickPay service processed $28 billion in transfers last year, while Venmo registered $17.6 billion in volume and is still doubling year over year."   For more on this story, check out the Recode report here. Below is a set of patent figures from our 2016 report titled "Apple Patent Shows Siri being used in an iMessage Thread to Send Funds to a Friend using Apple Pay."     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Need help with your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Mac computer? You should be able to find it through Apple's Support app and website. Released in January for iOS devices, the Apple Support app shows you the best ways to get help for your Apple products. You'll find tutorials on how to use, manage, and customize your Apple devices. You can also call or chat with an Apple Expert or schedule repair service or other help at your nearest Apple Store. Let's see how the app works. First, download the Support app. Fire it up, and it automatically detects your Apple ID and displays a list of all the Apple devices linked to that ID. If you're having trouble with a particular device, tap on its entry. The app then shows you a list of troubleshooting topics related to your device. For example, tapping on the entry for an iPhone delivers links to such topics as Battery, Power & Charging; Cellular & Wi-Fi; Apple ID & Password; iOS & Applications; and iCloud FaceTime & Messages. Tap on a specific topic, and you'll see another list of certain types of problems. For example, under the topic for Battery, Power & Charging are such technical issues as "Unable to power on," Unexpected shutdown or restart," "Device slow or unresponsive to touch," and "Not charging when connected." Tap on one of the problems, and the app segues to a screen with recommended articles that may help you resolve the issue, as well as links to contact someone at Apple to get support. You can get information and help on products you don't own in case you're interested in buying them and want to learn more about any potential technical troubles. On the homepage of the app, you can also read general how-to articles, such as "How to back up your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch," "Use Messages on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch," and "Take and edit photos with your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch." You have a few options for getting help directly from the folks at Apple. After you tap on a specific problem, the app offers you the ability to chat with an Apple tech support rep via instant messaging, talk to someone on the phone, schedule a call for later in the day, provide your contact information and then call back later, or schedule an appointment to bring your device in for repair. Depending on the nature of the problem, your best bet is probably to chat with or call someone at Apple and see if the rep can resolve your issue that way. If it can't be fixed via a phone call or chat, then the rep can help you schedule an appointment at your neighborhood Apple Store. Get Technical Help on Your Computer If you don't have an iOS device, or your iOS device is giving you trouble, you can also troubleshoot and get help from Apple on your computer. To kick off this process, hop online and browse to the Apple Support website. Click on "Contact Support" on the top right and then "Get help" under the "Talk to us" section. On the next page—which will say "What can we help you with?" or "Get help where you are" depending on whether you've signed in on this site before—click on the button for the product category that's giving you trouble. At the next screen, click on the name of the specific product. Alternatively, at the "Get help where you are/What can we help you with?" page, you can click on the link to "See your products" and then sign in with your Apple ID and password. The next page that appears displays all of the Apple products registered in your name. Just click on the name of the device that's misbehaving. If another screen pops up, click on the topic that best describes the trouble you're experiencing. And if yet another screen appears, click on the name of the specific issue that's plaguing you. By this point, you should see a page listing the different options for contacting Apple Support. Note that some products and problems will trigger fewer screens before you get to this page. In some cases, the page will list options to talk to Apple by phone: 1) Talk to Apple Support Now; 2) Schedule a Call; and 3) Call Apple Support Later. Choose the option that's most convenient for you. For options 1 and 2, you'll be asked to sign in with your Apple ID if you haven't already done so. For option 3, you'll be asked for your contact information. You'll then be able to speak with an Apple Support rep. In other cases, you'll see an option to chat with Apple. Choose that option if you're not much of a phone person. You'll have to sign in before being connected with a support rep. And in still other cases, mostly those that entail hardware problems, you'll see an option to schedule an appointment to bring your device in for repairs. Choose that option if you feel it's most appropriate. Sign in with your Apple ID. At the "Bring in for Repair" screen, enter your city and state or ZIP code to find the closest Apple Store and then click on the Go button. Choose the nearest store, and pick a date and time for the appointment. Your reservation is then confirmed. Good luck!

Gottesman April 27, 2017 10:44am EST 10 Comments Which devices are best for accessing the internet and storing your data? PCMag readers weigh in. The router forms the foundation of your wired and wireless network—it may be the most critical piece of technology in your home you don't think about, save your broadband modem. When your router is down, none of your devices can talk to one another or to the outside world. You can't browse the web, stream movies, listen to music, update social media, connect to your office, or pretty much anything else. About the only thing you can do is work on a spreadsheet and play Solitaire. NAS devices don't serve as basic a need as routers, but they provide a lot of very valuable benefits for all sorts of users. A NAS is a standalone box that houses one or more drives that can store data accessible to all the devices on your network—PCs, smartphones, tablets, and even TVs and streaming media players. Our survey respondents use NAS devices for a variety of reasons, including backing up data and storing photos, music, and videos. Files stored on the NAS can be accessed in a secure manner on the internet so you can easily stream home videos when you're away on vacation or share photos with family and friends. The most significant change in routers this year has been the increasing popularity of whole home Wi-Fi (mesh) systems. One of the biggest challenges with routers is ensuring a fast, reliable connection everywhere in your home. Even if you place your router in a central location, distance or certain building materials may prevent the signal from getting everywhere you need it. To address this, several router companies have devised systems that use multiple nodes that you place throughout your home, which create a mesh network of sorts. Most systems come with two or three nodes but you can typically add more as needed. Unlike range extenders, whole home Wi-Fi systems don't create additional networks in your home. No matter where you are, you're always on your main network. Nearly every home networking company has announced or is already shipping a whole home Wi-Fi system. In addition, several lesser known companies such as Eero, Luma, and Securifi have entered the market. Even Google is offering a system called, fittingly enough, Google Wifi. Only two brands—home networking market leaders Linksys and Netgear—received enough responses to be included in our survey analysis this year, but we expect many other entrants to qualify in 2018. As always, the goal of our survey is to gauge our readers' satisfaction with the products they use. Each respondent was asked to rate their overall satisfaction with their routers and NAS as well as more detailed questions such as satisfaction with reliability and ease of setup. Pay attention to how respondents rated their likelihood to recommend a brand. This question often proves to be one of the most telling aspects of user satisfaction. Use the results of our survey, along with our expert labs reviews of routers and NAS devices to help you decide the right way to stay connected. This survey was in the field from March 13 through April 2, 2017. For more information on how the survey is conducted, read the survey methodology. Those who completed the survey were entered to win a $350 Amazon.com gift card. You can win! Sign up for the Readers' Choice Survey mailing list to receive invitations for future sweepstakes. Looking for expert opinion? See our roundups of the Best Wireless Routers, Best Wi-Fi Mesh Network Systems and Best NAS Devices. Routers When deciding on a home router, you have several different brands from which to choose. Ten companies received enough responses to be included in our survey. Two—Apple and Asus—have stood out over the competition for years. Coming into this year, Apple had won our PCMag Readers' Choice Award every year since 2005; starting in 2012, Asus shared the award with Apple each year. This year, Asus stands alone as our sole winner of the 2017 PCMag Readers' Choice Award for home networking routers. It's impressive that Apple has kept pace with Asus for so long considering that it has not released a new router since 2013 while Asus has continued to innovate. In fact, the two companies still tied for the highest overall satisfaction ratings in our survey: 8.9 on a scale from 0 (extremely dissatisfied) to 10 (extremely satisfied). However, it appears that survey respondents are starting to sense that Apple is ceding the home networking market to other companies. The likelihood to recommend Asus remained at 9.0, the same score it received last year, while Apple dropped from 9.0 last year to 8.6, barely ahead of TP-Link and Netgear, which both received likelihood to recommend ratings of 8.5. (In the NetPromoter Score generated from that same question, even TP-Link out-scores Apple with a 56 percent rating compared to Apple's 52 percent.) Apple's rating of 9.2 for satisfaction with reliability did edge out Asus, which scored 9.1, but both are excellent ratings and slight improvements over last year. Asus and TP-Link tied for top marks for satisfaction with setup (9.1). This question is only asked to respondents whose routers are less than a year old. Asus had the best overall satisfaction rating among new routers by far, earning a score of 9.1. Its closest competitors, Linksys and TP-Link, only rated 8.5. As noted in our intro, whole home Wi-Fi systems, which use multiple nodes in what's sometimes called a "mesh network" to spread throughout a home to provide consistent fast coverage, are ever increasing in popularity. However, the technology is relatively new and only the Linksys Velop and Netgear Orbi systems received the minimum responses required for our analysis (and both, by the way, share our Editors' Choice Awards based on reviews). However, only the Linksys Velop wins our inaugural Readers' Choice Award for whole home Wi-Fi systems based on its slightly higher overall satisfaction rating. The Velop earned an 8.7 from our respondents compared to the Orbi's 8.6. The two companies had identical likelihood to recommend ratings of 8.4. This is somewhat lower than we expected and may be due to the high cost of the systems. Both companies' 3-node systems list for $499, though you should be able to get them for less. In terms of reliability, the Orbi actually outscored the Velop, 8.8 to 8.6; not a single Orbi rated required repairs in the last 12 months. If you're not sure what to choose, you might decide to just go with the router built into the broadband modem that your ISP provides. Keep in mind that these tend to get the lowest satisfaction ratings in our survey. Actiontec, Arris (which now includes the 2Wire and Pace brands), and Motorola either primarily or exclusively make integrated broadband modems/routers. Actiontec's overall satisfaction rating was 6.8, far behind most router companies. Arris (7.5) and Motorola (7.4) did not fare much better. See all of our survey results for routers. WINNERS: ROUTERS Standalone Routers: Asus This is the sixth straight year Asus has won a Readers' Choice Award for its home networking routers. No brand is more likely to be recommended than Asus. The company receives excellent marks for their ease of setup and reliability. Whole Home Wi-Fi Systems: Linksys Velop Whole home Wi-Fi systems promise to provide a much more seamless wireless networking experience than standalone routers throughout your home. Linksys's Velop earns our inaugural Readers' Choice Award in this category for its top overall satisfaction rating. We look forward to continuing innovations as the competition in this market heats up. Network Attached Storage (NAS) Devices Network attached storage devices, also known as NAS devices, come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and price tags. A simple single drive or dual drive system can be had for under $200 while multi-drive systems may cost several hundreds of dollars but can provide much greater capacity, speed, and reliability. NAS devices can serve a variety of needs. In addition to backing up PCs and other devices, several respondents told us they use their NAS along with the Plex media server to view their videos and listen to music on any device from anywhere. Serious photo enthusiasts turn to NAS to store all their photos including large, lossless RAW files. Many NAS devices also let you share your photos with others outside your network without first uploading them to a service. For the seventh year running, Synology wins our PCMag Readers' Choice Award for network attached storage. The past two years, Synology shared the award with QNAP, but this year it stands alone. Synology received a 9.4 for overall satisfaction compared to QNAP's 8.8. No other brand received higher than 8.3. Last year, Synology and QNAP both rated 9.0 in overall satisfaction ratings, so this is an impressive bump up for Synology and a slight dip for QNAP. Synology had the highest satisfaction ratings on every drill-down question. Its top scores were a 9.5 for storing photos, music, and videos for access on the network and 9.6 for storing other types of files for network access, as well as a 9.6 for satisfaction with reliability. Synology rated 9.0 or better for accessing all types of files across the internet and sharing those files with others. Many routers can become NAS devices when you attach external drives to them. This can be a cost-effective solution, but overall satisfaction with routers as NAS devices was lower than any dedicated NAS device. Linksys was the top-rated router-as-NAS with an overall satisfaction rating of 7.8, but that's not really enough to earn an award. Interestingly, both Linksys and Asus routers rated better than Seagate's NAS for storing files for access on the home network. However, none of the router-based NAS devices received very good satisfaction ratings for remote access to files. You might be able to save a little money and space by using your router to manage your network storage but our survey respondents seem to be recommending you opt for a dedicated device instead. See all of our survey results for NAS Devices. WINNERS: NETWORK ATTACHED STORAGE DEVICES Synology Synology has been a Readers' Choice Award winner every year since 2012. Even more impressive, every one of Synology's already excellent satisfaction ratings improved this year. The company's competitors can only look upon Synology from afar.

There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Samsung has out-designed Apple with its new Galaxy S8, but in this post I covered key areas where Samsung still can’t even approach the iPhone. There’s one more reason I could never switch to the Galaxy S8 and ditch my iPhone 7 Plus, though, and it’s a reason I never thought I would have. Don't Miss: After two weeks with the Galaxy S8, I still think the iPhone 7 Plus is the world’s best phone I’ve received more than two dozen emails and a handful of mentions on Twitter since published that opinion piece on Wednesday. Oddly, nearly every single one was from a person nodding in agreement. It’s still early days, but I would wager that no Samsung phone released in the past few years has drawn more interest from iPhone users than the new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. It makes sense, of course, because they’re stunning. And yet from the messages I’ve received and the conversations I’ve had elsewhere, Samsung for the most part isn’t actually stealing these users away. Everyone seems to be intrigued by the Galaxy S8, which features an incredible new “Infinity Display” design. The Super AMOLED screens on the S8 takes up an impressive 83% of the phone’s face, which is the best screen-to-body ratio the world has ever seen on a widely available smartphone. Coupled with a curved front and back that make the S8 more comfortable and stylish than any other smartphone out there, and you’ve got yourself a winner. But is it enough to steal away many iPhone users? For me personally, there’s simply no chance I could bail on Apple’s ecosystem for the Galaxy S8. As I explained in yesterday’s post, Apple’s iPhone UX is still so much better than Android, it’s not even close. The OS is smoother, the third-party apps are superior in design and performance, Apple’s Continuity features are fantastic, and the iPhone itself outperforms every Android phone including the Galaxy S8. Add in the iPhone 7 Plus’ class-leading battery life and Apple’s unrivaled customer support, and you’ve got an experience that no other phone can match. Not even the Galaxy S8. There’s one more reason I am personally locked into the iPhone though, and I think millions of other iPhone users would probably agree. Smartwatches, in general, are awful. They have been awful for years. And when rumors began swirling that Apple was developing its own smartwatch, I figured it too would be awful. I knew the device would be popular, of course, since Apple users are a dedicated bunch. But in terms of features and design, I certainly didn’t think the Apple Watch would ever appeal to me. As anyone who has read my earlier Apple Watch coverage surely knows, I sang a different tune the moment I began using one. I’m a lifelong watch lover and collector who thought that there was no way a silly smartwatch could ever replace a mechanical watch on my wrist. Since buying my first Apple Watch shortly after it was released, I have sold almost every watch in my collection. In fact, over the past two years since I started wearing the Apple Watch, I’ve only gone for two or three days total without having it on my wrist. Read More After testing every big-name Android (and Tizen) smartwatch that has been released over the past few years, I’m hesitant to lump Apple’s watch into the same category. Early Android watches were garbage. There’s no way around it. More recent offerings are vastly improved, and Samsung’s most recent Tizen watch pretty nifty as well. “Nifty” is about as much as I can say for them, sadly. The Apple Watch is far smoother and more streamlined than anything its rivals have managed to cook up. It’s also simpler, with a UX that practically anyone can figure out because just about everything makes sense. Simple doesn’t mean it lacks features, however, and I rely on Apple Watch features all day long. I have different Apple Watch faces that display different complications, giving me zero-touch access to real-time information. The Dark Sky complication shows me the current weather conditions and alerts me when it’s going to rain or snow. The Openfolio complication shows me exactly what my stock portfolio is doing. The Activity complication reminds me that I need to get off my butt and walk some more so I can meet the day’s goals. Then, there are a number of third-party apps I rely on as well. For example, the August app lets me unlock my front door with a tap, and the Newton Mail app gives me rich notifications so I can quickly read previews of new emails and then delete or archive them. That last one is key for me because I can get anywhere from 200 to 400 emails in any given day, but the majority of them are messages I don’t even need to read beyond the subject line to know I can delete them. With the Apple Watch, I tap one button and an email is deleted without having to pull my phone out of my pocket over and over. There are rival smartwatches that can handle some or even most of the tasks I perform on my Apple Watch, just as there are Android phones that can handle just about everything I do on my iPhone. But it’s not the same. After all these years, and after all of the features other companies have copied, Apple still offers user experiences that are leaps and bounds beyond its competitors.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Consumer Watchdog Files Complaint with FTC over Uber’s Unfair and Deceptive Tracking; Transportation and Technology Firm Followed Users Even After App Was Deleted from Device SANTA MONICA, Calif., April 27, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Consumer Watchdog today filed a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission charging that Uber Technologies had deceptively tracked users of its app after people thought they had deleted it from their iPhone. "The Commission should not be surprised by Uber's abuses. It is a renegade technology and transportation company whose executives pride themselves on a disruptive, rule-breaking approach to business," wrote John M. Simpson, the nonprofit nonpartisan group's Privacy Project Director. "It is long past time for the company and its CEO Travis Kalanick to be held accountable for their actions which regularly flout the law." Read Consumer Watchdog's formal complaint here: http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/ltrftc042717.pdf Consumer Watchdog's complaint focuses on Uber and the mobile app that is the backbone of the company's business.  According to the New York Times, Uber continued to track iPhone users who had once installed the Uber app even after they believed they had deleted it from their device. Uber was obviously aware of the deceptive nature of its activities because it went to great efforts to hide its activities from Apple, which distributed the Uber app through its application store, iTunes, Consumer Watchdog said. Uber "geo-fenced" the area around Apple's headquarters so that Apple engineers there would not discover the tracking abuse.  Ultimately Apple engineers working from other locations discovered the secret tracking made possible by Uber's deceptive activities.   Apple CEO Tim Cook confronted Kalanick and threatened to remove the Uber app from iTunes app store unless the deceptive abuse stopped. Even if Uber complied with Apple's request the FTC should act, to enjoin Uber from such deceitful tracking and similar deceptive activities, Consumer Watchdog said. The complaint explained: "It is important that the Commission take a position to block this unfair and deceptive activity, for based on the company's record it is likely to engage in the activity again. Moreover, Consumers who were tracked likely suffered actual harm and Uber should be required to disgorge the money it received as a result of its unfair and deceptive acts. "In addition, the Commission should investigate what is happening with the Uber app designed for Android devices and distributed through Google's app store, Google Play.  While Uber may have discontinued deceitful tracking on iPhones, there is no reason to believe it is not conducting the same deceptive tracking on Android phones unbeknownst to consumers." Consumer Watchdog called on the Commission first to fully investigate both the iPhone and Android versions of Uber's app.  It said the FTC must first ensure that the unfair and deceptive tracking of users after they have deleted the Uber app, does not occur.  The Commission should then enjoin Uber from ever engaging in this deceptive tracking practice. Second, Consumer Watchdog said, the Commission should carefully scrutinize the Uber app's privacy policy to ensure that it accurately and clearly describes Uber's actual practices to consumers.  "Based on Uber's history, Consumer Watchdog believes it is extremely likely that privacy policy is not an accurate description of Uber's activities," the complaint concluded. "If this proves to be the case, the Commission must take appropriate action."

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Mobile iPhone 7 S and S Plus plans and iPhone 8 Release Date By Costea Lestoc. Published on April 27, 2017. 0 There are a couple of things in life that people expect without hesitation each year, like Christmas, the summer break and of course, the release of a new iPhone. Apple has been thorough since the iPhone’s launch back in 2007 about bringing out a new bad boy every single year. Some upgrades featured legitimate improvements that had no problem standing out while other editions featured downright copies of the previous model with very minor modifications.  This year, everybody is focused on what is believed to be Apple’s best work yet, the iPhone 8. Is there a block in the road? It would seem however that there might be some problems with the release of this heavily awaited device. Initially, the new gadget was expected to arrive sometime during the month of September therefore fans have marked their calendars. Now however, it would seem that the potential release date for the device has been moved from September to a bit later in the fourth quarter of the year. With the iPhone 8 slated for a release only close to the year’s end, many are wandering if there are any major problems that are causing this apparent setback. Newcomers in town That’s not all however, as more interesting pieces to the puzzles see the light of day. Apple has recently revealed that it plans to release two new iPhone models this year, in the form of the iPhone 7S and the iPhone 7S Plus. Surely you might be wondering what these devices are intended to do for the smartphone market and ultimately for Apple.  The fact that Apple might release the two alongside the iPhone 8 sometime this year is a theory that most fans discard because showing them side by side would just make the huge contrast between them visible. It just wouldn’t be a good business decision for the two S handsets. This led people to believe that the two might be coming as a plan B for Apple, in case something happens and the company is no longer able to provide the iPhone 8 in time. Although the two feature some modifications in comparison to the devices already available on the market, the spec lists clearly give away the fact that neither of them is the iPhone 8, a phone which has been going through an identity crisis throughout the community, no one knowing the official name of the phone. Speculations have brought forth a couple of names for the smartphone, like iPhone or iPhone Pro.

Apple recently released its iOS 10.3.1 update and the company’s confirmed an iOS 10.3.2 update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. The iOS 10.3.2 update is in beta ahead of a release later this year. While most people are focused on iOS 10.3.1 and iOS 10.3.2, others are looking ahead into the future. iOS 11 rumors have started to emerge and they’ve generated a ton of buzz amongst iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. The iOS 11 update still isn’t confirmed but there are a few things we think you should be aware of as we push deeper into the year. This iOS 11 release roundup covers some of the basics including the potential iOS 11 launch date and the iOS 11 release date. It also takes a look at the devices that could be left behind on iOS 10 and some of the early rumors. We’ll continue to add new information about the iOS 11 release to this roundup so check back for regular updates throughout the year. iOS 11 Launch Date Apple hasn’t announced an iOS 11 launch date yet but it’s easy to predict when we’ll see the company unveil its next operating system. For several years now, Apple’s announced new iOS software during its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) keynote. The company recently confirmed its WWDC 2017 dates so we now have an exact date in mind for the iOS 11 launch. WWDC 2017 is set for early June. WWDC 2017 is confirmed for early June with dates stretching from June 5th to June 9th. The event is moving from San Francisco to San Jose. June 5th is the date to circle on the calendar because that’s when Apple should deliver its annual keynote. Apple typically confirms new iOS software, release windows, and betas during its WWDC keynote announcement. iOS 11 Beta Apple typically releases an iOS beta shortly after the conclusion of its WWDC keynote so it’s safe to assume the company will release an iOS 11 beta in June. We expect the iOS 11 beta to mirror last year’s iOS 10 beta with a release for two different groups of testers. Look for the iOS 11 beta to come to paid developers first before shipping out to those in the free Beta Software Program. Apple’s beta software program is free for anyone with a working Apple ID and it lets the public test new iOS features and performance ahead of the official release date. iOS 11 Release Date Like the iOS 11 launch date, the iOS 11 release date is fairly predictable. Apple hasn’t confirmed a specific iOS 11 release date and its WWDC announcement will probably come and go without a firm date. Instead, we’ll likely get a fall release window like we did last year with the iOS 10 update.  That said, you can expect the iOS 11 release date to land sometime in the fall alongside Apple’s new iPhone models. The iPhone 8 is expected in September and you can expect the iOS 11 update to get certified and released shortly before its released to the public. Let’s recap all of that: iOS 11 launch in early June at WWDC 2017. iOS 11 beta release in June for developers. iOS 11 release in the fall alongside new iPhones. Will My Device Get iOS 11? “Will my device get iOS 11” is becoming a common question amongst our friends, family and our readers. Apple hasn’t confirmed anything yet but it’s fairly easy to predict which devices will get iOS 11 and which ones may not. Apple’s most recent iPhones and iPads are in. If you own an iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPad Pro, or iPad mini 4, there’s nothing to worry about. You’ll get iOS software updates for a couple more years at least. There are, however, a few devices that are on the fence. The iPhone 5, Apple’s aging former flagship, is one such device. Apple appears to be phasing out 32-bit support with iOS 11 which means 32-bit devices like the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and iPad 4 are probably on their way out. The first concrete clues started appearing in the iOS 10.2.1 beta and we’ve started to see the idea pickup steam as the year’s gone on. Clips, Apple’s new video editing application, doesn’t support the iPhone or iPhone 5c. It’s a 64-bit application which is another sign Apple’s preparing to kill support for 32-bit apps and devices. We will find out for sure in June. If Apple is dropping support for these devices, it won’t offer an iOS 11 beta. Other popular devices like the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3 should be safe from Apple’s axe. iOS 11 Update As for the iOS 11 update itself, details are still pretty scarce. A report from Business Insider claims Apple is planning to add “augmented reality technology into the iPhone’s camera app.” Apple is reportedly exploring AR and mixed reality but it’s unclear if they will make it to the iPhone and iOS in 2017.  One questionable rumor from Israeli site The Verifier suggests Apple will be baking Group FaceTime calls into iOS 11. The report cites “several people familiar with iOS development.” The feature will reportedly allow iOS 11 users to start multi-person calls via a group conversation in iMessage with up to five people allowed in on the call. The site notes that while Apple is working on the feature, it could opt not to release it on iOS 11 and save it for a future update. Another possibility? A full-fledged Dark Mode. Oh look what I found… #darkmodeconfirmed pic.twitter.com/RYcFc162I5 — Andrew Wiik (@Andywiik) June 16, 2016 The feature briefly emerged in the iOS 10 beta but didn’t make it into iOS 10’s final release in September. There’s a chance Apple revives it with iOS 11. The iOS 11 update could also include changes to the iPad. The company is reportedly working on expanded Apple Pencil support for the iPad Pro. According to Bloomberg, Apple “has considered allowing users to annotate objects in many applications across the whole operating system, including in Mail, the Safari web browser, and iMessage.” There’s also chatter about new video features for Apple Music. A profile about Jimmy Iovine in Bloomberg BusinessWeek claims Apple plans to “unveil a new edition of the Music app that better showcases video” alongside its next iOS update, presumably iOS 11. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 9 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 13 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 13 3 Responses 02/09/2017 Charlie Smith Reply Hi, I’m a blind iPhone 6 user, and what I’m hoping for, in iOS 11, is more voices for voiceover, the ability to use other text to speech engines, and more voiceover customization settings 02/19/2017 Stonewall012 Reply As of to date there is no 10.3.5. The iPhone 4s did not get ios 10. Please do your research before printing. 04/27/2017 Quinton Wilkerson Reply It would be atrocious if the mini 2 didn’t make the ios 11 cut seeing as how they JUST STOPPED SELLING IT the end of April of THIS YEAR!

Apple always announces its device shipments numbers during its quarterly earnings announcement, which is due to take place late on 2 May. Samsung doesn’t publish its numbers but tends not to even offer guidance to analysts until Apple has shown its hand, which makes it likely IDC has taken a bit of a punt on those too. IDC is forecasting overall global growth of 4.3% in smartphone shipments, driven almost entirely by Chinese vendors. Its early call on the Samsung and Apple numbers has them essentially flat, year-on-year, and the same goes for the long tail. Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, however, are all expected to grow their shipments by more than 20% year on year, with the latter two deriving pretty much all their sales from middle price tiers in the Chinese market. “Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets” said Anthony Scarsella of IDC. “Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies’ portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models. Companies have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment.” Fellow analyst firm Canalys recently published its view of the Chinese market, which has Huawei Oppo and Vivo now accounting for the majority of it. Since Canalys reckons the whole Chinese smartphone market grew by only 9% in Q1, the only way those three could have managed that kind of growth is by taking a lot of share from the likes of Xiaomi, Apple, etc. The IDC numbers are below. It will be interesting to see what adjustments may be made to them in a week’s time. “Data is preliminary and subject to change,” says a caveat underneath the data. “Some IDC estimates were made prior to financial earnings reports.” While it’s easy to see why IDC might be keen to get its numbers out before its competitors, publishing estimates as ‘preliminary data’ is a dangerous game to play.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Consumer Watchdog Files Complaint with FTC over Uber’s Unfair and Deceptive Tracking; Transportation and Technology Firm Followed Users Even After App Was Deleted from Device SANTA MONICA, Calif., April 27, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — Consumer Watchdog today filed a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission charging that Uber Technologies had deceptively tracked users of its app after people thought they had deleted it from their iPhone. „The Commission should not be surprised by Uber’s abuses. It is a renegade technology and transportation company whose executives pride themselves on a disruptive, rule-breaking approach to business,” wrote John M. Simpson, the nonprofit nonpartisan group’s Privacy Project Director. „It is long past time for the company and its CEO Travis Kalanick to be held accountable for their actions which regularly flout the law.” Read Consumer Watchdog’s formal complaint here: http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/ltrftc042717.pdf Consumer Watchdog’s complaint focuses on Uber and the mobile app that is the backbone of the company’s business.  According to the New York Times, Uber continued to track iPhone users who had once installed the Uber app even after they believed they had deleted it from their device. Uber was obviously aware of the deceptive nature of its activities because it went to great efforts to hide its activities from Apple, which distributed the Uber app through its application store, iTunes, Consumer Watchdog said. Uber „geo-fenced” the area around Apple’s headquarters so that Apple engineers there would not discover the tracking abuse.  Ultimately Apple engineers working from other locations discovered the secret tracking made possible by Uber’s deceptive activities.   Apple CEO Tim Cook confronted Kalanick and threatened to remove the Uber app from iTunes app store unless the deceptive abuse stopped. Even if Uber complied with Apple’s request the FTC should act, to enjoin Uber from such deceitful tracking and similar deceptive activities, Consumer Watchdog said. The complaint explained: „It is important that the Commission take a position to block this unfair and deceptive activity, for based on the company’s record it is likely to engage in the activity again. Moreover, Consumers who were tracked likely suffered actual harm and Uber should be required to disgorge the money it received as a result of its unfair and deceptive acts. „In addition, the Commission should investigate what is happening with the Uber app designed for Android devices and distributed through Google’s app store, Google Play.  While Uber may have discontinued deceitful tracking on iPhones, there is no reason to believe it is not conducting the same deceptive tracking on Android phones unbeknownst to consumers.” Consumer Watchdog called on the Commission first to fully investigate both the iPhone and Android versions of Uber’s app.  It said the FTC must first ensure that the unfair and deceptive tracking of users after they have deleted the Uber app, does not occur.  The Commission should then enjoin Uber from ever engaging in this deceptive tracking practice. Second, Consumer Watchdog said, the Commission should carefully scrutinize the Uber app’s privacy policy to ensure that it accurately and clearly describes Uber’s actual practices to consumers.  „Based on Uber’s history, Consumer Watchdog believes it is extremely likely that privacy policy is not an accurate description of Uber’s activities,” the complaint concluded. „If this proves to be the case, the Commission must take appropriate action.” Visit Consumer Watchdog’s website at www.consumerwatchdog.org To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/consumer-watchdog-files-complaint-with-ftc-over-ubers-unfair-and-deceptive-tracking-transportation-and-technology-firm-followed-users-even-after-app-was-deleted-from-device-300447350.html SOURCE Consumer Watchdog Related Links http://www.consumerwatchdog.org CategoriesUncategorized TagsAdvocacy Group Opinion, Federal Executive Branch & Agency, Not For Profit Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Annual DiversityInc Top 50 Awards Announcement Set for May 2 Next PostNext Statement of Betsy Ryan, President and CEO, New Jersey Hospital Association on Opposition to the Amended American Health Care Act Search Recent Posts Cubic Boron Nitride Market – Evolving Industry Trends 2024 Education Apps Market : Size, Share, Analysis, Industry Trend, Growth and Demand Audited annual information of Invalda INVL for 2016 Tamper Evident Packaging Market size in terms of volume and value 2016-2026 AB „Invalda INVL“ 2016 m. audituota metinė informacija Proudly powered by WordPress

(AFP/JUNG Yeon-Je) 28 Apr 2017 01:05AM Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail WASHINGTON: Samsung and Apple maintained their leadership in the smartphone market in early 2017 while Chinese-based Huawei's strong growth cemented its number three position, a market tracker said on Thursday (Apr 27). Research firm IDC said overall smartphone shipments grew 4.3 per cent in the first quarter, slightly better than its prior forecast, to 347 million units. "The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists," said IDC analyst Ryan Reith. "There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and the strong first quarter results certainly support this argument." Reith said the 2017 market will feel the impact of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship handset, and a widely expected announcement from Apple for its new iPhone later this year. Advertisement According to the survey, Samsung led the market in the first quarter with a 22.8 per cent share to 14.9 per cent for Apple, with little growth for the top two vendors. But Huawei's sales jumped 21.7 per cent to give it a 9.8 per cent share, and fellow Chinese makers Oppo and Vivo, the number four and five vendors, respectively, also boosted their sales. IDC said the bulk of smartphone growth is likely to come from low-cost handset makers. "Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets," said IDC's Anthony Scarsella. "Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies' portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models." He added that makers "have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment." The report is based on preliminary quarterly estimates, with Apple due to report sales figures next week.

Apple remaining steady comes as the rest of the market grew 4.3% during the quarter. IDC’s data shows Apple shipped around 51.6 million iPhones during the quarter, up very slightly from 51.2 million in the year ago quarter: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Apple remained essentially flat with shipments reaching 51.6 million units in the first quarter, up slightly from the 51.2 million shipped last year. The strong holiday fourth quarter carried into the month of January as the larger iPhone 7 Plus returned to stock across most channels in numerous regions. Apple introduced a refreshed iPhone SE with more storage capacity (32GB and 128GB) that puts the mid-tier device in line with the rest of the iPhone portfolio. The Cupertino-based giant also refreshed its flagship smartphone by bringing (Product)Red over to the iPhone which paints both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in a new red finish. Finally, rumors of a special edition 10th anniversary iPhone continue to grow as a pending new design, screen size, and performance upgrades all look to be in the works for the fall. Apple introduced its new Product (RED) iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models on March 21, but it’s unclear how many units it produced of the special edition model or how many sales of the device are reflected in IDC’s Q1 data. It also announced a refreshed iPhone SE model with increased storage options, and both went on sale March 24 (IDC’s data below tracks shipments up until April 27, 2017). Samsung also remained steady in the number one position during the quarter with 79.2 million units shipped as number three, Huawei, number four, OPPO, and number five, vivo all posted year-over-year gains while holding their rankings. Apple will officially reveal its iPhone sales for the quarter on May 2, the date scheduled for its fiscal Q2 2017 earnings call. Apple is providing guidance of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion for revenue following a strong holiday quarter where it reported $78.4 billion in revenue and sold 78.3 million iPhones, 13 million iPads, and 5.3 million Macs.

Sony A6500 iOS 10.3.2 beta 5 is currently only available in beta for registered developers. The public beta version of each update usually follows a few days after the developer version if not the same day. tvOS and watchOS are also available as beta updates, although public beta programs are not available. Apple’s iOS 10.3 release included Find My AirPods, a new APFS file system, CarPlay improvements, and much more. We’ll update with release notes and any changes shortly. Fixed in this Release SiriKit The new SiriKit car commands should now work as expected. Third-Party VPN Apps Third-party VPN apps should now work as expected. Siri Siri text responses should now be complete. Notes and Known Issues Managed and Shared Devices The ability to update devices from a remote server is in development and may not yet work as expected. openURL When a third party application invokes openURL: on a tel://, facetime://, or facetime-audio:// URL, iOS displays a prompt and requires user confirmation before dialing. SOS SOS is only supported in India. WebKit Safari now supports the prefers-reduced-motion media query. This query allows a web developer to provide alternate page styles for users who are sensitive to large areas of motion. Users can change their preference for reduced motion in the Accessibility section of System Preferences. The iOS 10.3 update removes support for SHA-1 signed certificates used for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in Safari and WebKit that are issued from a root Certification Authority (CA) included in the operating system default trust store. All other TLS connections will continue to support SHA-1 signed certificates until late 2017. SHA-1 signed root CA certificates, enterprisedistributed SHA-1 certificates, and user-installed SHA-1 certificates are not affected by this change.

The site recently posted an interview with Jimmy Iovine, Apple's music guru, who shared some of his aspirations for the streaming service. “A music service needs to be more than a bunch of songs and a few playlists,” says Iovine. “I’m trying to help Apple Music be an overall movement in popular culture, everything from unsigned bands to video. We have a lot of plans.” Apple is readying several forays into video including a Carpool Karaoke series (recently delayed), Planet of the Apps, and several documentaries. “We have the freedom, because it’s Apple, to make one show, three shows, see what works, see what doesn’t work until it feels good,” Iovine says. It's expected that Apple Music could release as many as 10 original series by the end of year and with iOS 11, it's app will be updated to highlight that content. When Apple introduces the next version of its smartphone software iOS later this year, the company plans to unveil a new edition of the Music app that better showcases video. “For a music streaming service,” Iovine says, “we’re building a very decent slate.” More details in the full interview linked below...

According to the survey, Samsung led the market in the first quarter with a 22.8 percent share to 14.9 percent for Apple, with little growth for the top two vendors. But Huawei's sales jumped 21.7 percent to give it a 9.8 percent share, and fellow Chinese makers Oppo and Vivo, the number four and five vendors, respectively, also boosted their sales. IDC said the bulk of smartphone growth is likely to come from low-cost handset makers. "Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets," said IDC's Anthony Scarsella. "Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies' portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models." He added that makers "have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment." The report is based on preliminary quarterly estimates, with Apple due to report sales figures next week.

Under Trump’s proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce have cheered the administration’s tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned “the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation.” Big US companies have nearly US$1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc has more than US$200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. “What we would do with it, let’s wait and see exactly what it is, but as I’ve said before we are always looking at acquisitions,” Cook told investors on the company’s first-quarter earnings call in January in response to an analyst’s question about the company’s thinking on acquisitions. Cook’s comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by US companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co, for example, has told investors that it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many US companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 percent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 percent for 2016, Standard & Poor’s said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in first-quarter profits, partly because of a 4-percentage-point drop in its tax rate. “At the highest level we’re a big supporter of tax reform,” Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call. “It’s going to drive jobs, it’s going to drive the US economy broadly speaking and it’s going to allow us to compete.” Boeing has been cutting jobs in the US, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. His administration has also been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while a bid to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress.

According to Recode, Apple has had some chats with potential partners in the payments industry about a service that lets iPhone users send money to other iPhone users. Inside sources told the tech site that Apple is also talking to Visa about offering a debit card — possibly in digital form only – that would be tied to the new peer-to-peer system. The Apple cards would be funded with money sent through the new service, and could be used to make purchases even before the money hits your bank account. Users could also tie the digital debit card to their Apple Pay digital wallet to buy things at physical stores. Whether or not this will all actually happen is unclear, as one person familiar with the matter told Recode that the platform could launch later this year, while another said the announcement and launch date may not be set yet. Apple and Visa declined to comment to Recode. It’s worth noting as well that a few months after reports first started popping up about an Apple peer-to-peer payment service, the company filed a patent application that would allow iMessage users to pay each other from within the messaging app itself, as well as from within other iOS features. If Apple does manage to succeed in getting something off the crowd, it will have plenty of competitors in the peer-to-peer payment arena: There’s PayPal’s Venmo, Square Cash, and many major banks, not to mention Facebook.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Leak  ⋮  Mobile Apple A11 Allegedly Leaked Geekbench Score Tears Through the Competition, Including iPhone 7 Plus By Omar Sohail 17 hours ago 15Shares Share Tweet Submit Update: The Geekbench score could be fake so remember to take it with a pinch of salt. The latest version of Geekbench running in iOS is version 4.1.0 while the version running here is version 4.0.3. Time and time again, we’ve seen the iPhone 7 Plus beat every flagship it stood up against, including the newly released Galaxy S8. This would mean that the possible contender to beat it in real-world and benchmarking tests would be the next-gen iPhone 8 and its Apple A11 SoC. Now if a leaked Geekbench test results are to be believed, then it looks like the iPhone 7 Plus is nowhere near the performance of Apple’s latest and greatest silicon. Apple A11 Obtains 4000+ Points in the Geekbench Benchmarking Run – Nearly Crosses 9,000 Points in Multi-Core Results A new benchmarking leak from Geekbench apparently reveals the performance of the A11 chipset. According to the specifications, the A11 will be running a quad-core processor which is similar to the configuration of the A10 Fusion. Apple could be using two high-performance cores (possibly running at 2.74GHz according to the information given in the image) that are paired with two energy efficient cores to tackle less intensive tasks. Related Alleged iPhone 8 Diagram Shows Four Miniature Cameras, Possibly for AR and Security Purposes Advertisement Coming to the benchmark, the single-core test results show the A11 running past the competition and it obtains a total score of 4,537 points and nearly reaching the 9,000-point figure in the multi-core test results. For reference, we ran a Geekbench test on our iPhone 7 Plus and posted the results below. These are impressive scores, to say the least, and they come at a time when the iPhone 8’s announcement is still months away. It an obvious thought that the A11 is going to be significantly faster than the A10 Fusion and thanks to its 10nm FinFET architecture, it is going to be even more efficient that its previous-gen 14nm FinFET process.

The Hollywood Reporter Movies TV Business Style Politics Tech Culture Awards Video Sites Heat Vision Live Feed Esq The Race Behind the Screen Bastard Machine Rambling Reporter The Fien Print Subscribe Site Tools Newsletters Daily Edition Reviews Box Office Heat Vision Coming Soon Puff Daddy's 'Can't Stop Won't Stop' Documentary Coming Exclusively to Apple Music 6:23 AM PDT 4/27/2017 by Andy Gensler, Billboard FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Courtesy of Bad Boy Entertainment 'Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story' The doc, which premiered at Tribeca, chronicles Combs' and his record label's precipitous rise in the mid-1990s as well as the challenges he faced in putting together last year's 20th-anniversary Bad Boy reunion shows. Sean "Diddy" Combs (aka Puff Daddy) is nothing if not a shrewd and determined business man. This is illustrated repeatedly in his powerful new documentary Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story, which chronicles Combs' and his record label's precipitous rise in the mid-1990s to the top of the music business, as well as the trials and tribulations he faced in putting together last year's 20th-anniversary Bad Boy reunion shows in two weeks' time and with artists who hadn't performed in years. But the rap mogul's acumen is also on full display in how he produced the new documentary. This can be seen in his decision to partner with two of most powerful music business entities on the planet to produce and distribute his film: Live Nation and Apple Music, respectively. On Thursday, the same day as the documentary's premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival (with performances by Combs, Mase, Lil Kim and Faith Evans, among others), it was announced that Apple Music will have the exclusive rights to Can't Stop, Won't Stop starting June 25. "I went to the [Bad Boy reunion] concert and thought it was incredible," Apple Music chairman and CEO Jimmy Iovine tells Billboard. "I think Puff and Bad Boy's story is incredible, and one that a lot of people can relate to in any genre or in any business. His story is powerful. He really overcame a lot to get to where he's at today, and the documentary shows that." While exact terms of the deal weren't disclosed, Apple Music will have exclusive rights to the doc for at least the next year. The music platform has already announced its plan to create exclusive video content for its users. This includes a deal with James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” franchise; Dr. Dre’s Vital Signs, a semi-autobiographical scripted series; and Planet of the Apps, a show featuring Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk, Jessica Alba and will.iam offering mentorship to app developers. "We have a bunch of other stuff that we can't talk about yet because the deals aren't done," Iovine says, "but we're starting to turn it up." The former head of Interscope and Beats says that most of the content will be things "that people are involved in with pop culture and that we think will be great for our audience." There's little doubt now in how compelling the new Diddy doc is, especially seeing the rap mogul in a more revealing and unvarnished light than ever before. "He's so vulnerable and human in this," says Live Nation Productions head Heather Parry, who also produced the recent Eagles of Death Metal documentary that HBO optioned. "The access we got was incredible," she says. "We were in the shower with him, we see him getting a B12 shot in his underwear and then how upset he is with how the first night of the show went. He's vulnerable, but you see how much he loves and cares for his Bad Boy family." And a sometimes fractious family it is. Bringing together the warring widows of Lil Kim and Faith Evans was no easy feat, but Combs seemed to deftly manage the situation as he might a disruption in the Ciroc supply chain. Same goes for a saved Mase and the support and encouragement he gives the reunion show's creative director and his longtime associate, who was under an inordinate amount of pressure to produce the Bad Boy shows in little time. The documentary itself seemed to mirror a similar time constraint. "[Combs] comes in to Live Nation to talk about the tour and and he was, like, 'It would be really great to document it,'" Parry recalls. "When we finally decided to do it, we had about three weeks to get our act together and find a director and we had to do that quickly. I have a great boss in [Live Nation CEO] Michael Rapino, who graciously funded it so we could get started." Combs had wanted to enlist Mark Romanek to direct, but he was unable. Though, as with many things about this project, serendipity seemed to have a hand in it. "I went to a friend's book release, which was a photo book, and there was Mark Romanek," Parry recalls. "I said, 'With all due respect, who is you that is available right now?' And Mark, who is so sweet and kind and generous, said, 'I actually have a guy for you.' The next day I met Daniel Kaufman, who became our director. Two days later, I gave a great treatment to Puff and he was hired and we were on our ways to Barclays [Center]." The film, too, has its chance moments. Barclays Center just happened to have a cancelation the night after the originally scheduled Bad Boy reunion show that also happened to fall on Biggie's birthday, which is when all the magic seemed to coalesce. Can't Stop, Won't Stop features a number of legendary music execs in addition to Iovine. Hearing Uptown Records' Andre Harrell (who is also one of the film's producers) recall how his then-intern Combs ran 10 blocks in a flash when he asked him to do an errand is incredibly revealing, as is hearing Arista's Clive Davis tell how Combs charmed him at a time when rap had yet to be universally accepted.  The film also contains a number of rare images and video. "We found a treasure trove in the Bad Boy offices," says Parry. "We have the young Puff on camera, a young Kim and Faith and stuff from Biggie [Smalls, aka Christopher Wallace], some of which has been seen before." Of course the death of Notorious B.I.G. hangs over the entire film, and shaped the Bad Boy family like nothing else. There's an incredibly poignant scene where Combs calls Smalls' mom Violetta just to check in, like he would his own mother. “I knew this was a story that should be shared with the world," Combs said in a statement. "Heather Parry and Live Nation Productions, and director Daniel Kaufman, helped create this very special documentary. Now I'm blessed to also be working with Apple to showcase the film and share Bad Boy's history and impact with fans. The support Live Nation, Apple and everyone on the team has given to this project is a true testament to the Bad Boy legacy." Spoken like the music business genius he is.

Research firm IDC said overall smartphone shipments grew 4.3 per cent in the first quarter, slightly better than its prior forecast, to 347 million units. "The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists," said IDC analyst Ryan Reith. "There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and the strong first quarter results certainly support this argument." Reith said the 2017 market will feel the impact of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship handset, and a widely expected announcement from Apple for its new iPhone later this year. According to the survey, Samsung led the market in the first quarter with a 22.8 per cent share to 14.9 per cent for Apple, with little growth for the top two vendors. But Huawei's sales jumped 21.7 per cent to give it a 9.8 per cent share, and fellow Chinese makers Oppo and Vivo, the number four and five vendors, respectively, also boosted their sales. IDC said the bulk of smartphone growth is likely to come from low-cost handset makers. "Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets," said IDC's Anthony Scarsella. "Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies' portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models." He added that makers "have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment." The report is based on preliminary quarterly estimates, with Apple due to report sales figures next week.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Family: 21-year-old man fatally shot in front of grandmother’s Apple Valley home Thursday Apr 27, 2017 at 9:44 AM Apr 27, 2017 at 2:05 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero APPLE VALLEY — The family of a Victorville man said he was fatally shot in his grandmother’s front yard as he waited for her to return home to wish her a happy 74th birthday. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials identified Johnny Octavio Lasoya, 21, as the victim in a shooting that occurred in front of a home in the 22300 block of Hurons Avenue on Wednesday evening. Sheriff’s officials said deputies found Lasoya in front of the home suffering from an apparent gunshot wound. He was rushed to St. Joseph Health, St. Mary, but was pronounced dead at 6:31 p.m. Wednesday. Family members said LaSoya was from Victorville. Lasoya’s cousin, Samantha Wilson, told the Daily Press she was out to dinner with her grandmother when they received a call informing them of the shooting. “Yesterday was my grandma’s 74th birthday and my cousin went to her house to drop off her birthday present,” Wilson said. “We were told that he went to the store, was followed back to my grandma’s house, jumped and eventually shot. The doctors said they tried and made every attempt to save his life, but nothing was successful.” Wilson said her grandmother is currently staying in a hotel because her home is considered an active crime scene. “She’s very strong willed but I think she is attempting to appear as if she is not hurt and prevent herself from having a nervous breakdown,” Wilson said. “We have so many unanswered questions and we just need closure and want to know why this happened. To our knowledge nobody has been arrested in connection to the shooting.” Sheriff’s officials said detectives determined that “several unidentified subjects” drove up to the home on Hurons Avenue and made contact with Lasoya. Within minutes, Lasoya began arguing with one subject and then a second subject shot at Lasoya, striking him in the upper body. The subjects fled in two separate gray-colored compact vehicles. No further descriptions were provided Thursday. Wilson describes her cousin as funny and always happy. LaSoya was the type of person who would offer the shirt off his back, according to Wilson. “He was family oriented,” she said. “He was the only boy out of five children and really loved his family. He had a lot of friends. We hope the community steps in if they know anything. We hope someone in the community steps in if they know anything and bring this to rest. This is going to always be a burden for the family, especially because of the day that his happened on and for something so drastic to happen in front of my grandmother’s home. We’re just really asking for the community’s help.” Wilson created a GoFundMe.com account to help raise funds for burial costs. Approximately $810 had been raised as of 2 p.m. Thursday. Sheriff’s officials said no additional information is being released at this time, and updates will be provided as new information becomes available. Investigators are actively working this case, sheriff’s officials said, and anyone with information is urged to contact Detective Mark Green with the Homicide Detail at 909-387-3589.

In an interview, Apple executive Jimmy Iovine said Apple is “building a very decent slate” for a music streaming service.

The tech giant could release as many as 10 original shows and documentaries, including will.i.am’s Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke, by the end of 2017. Apple is apparently also working on documentaries about hip-hop labels Bad Boy Records and Cash Money Records and another about music impresario Clive Davis. Iovine said he is focused on music-related video, including a possible sequel to R. Kelly’s Trapped in the Closet, a rap opera, and has discussed possible ideas with Brian Grazer, the producer of Fox’s Empire and Genius, and with director J.J. Abrams.

Kelly’s Trapped in the Closet may be coming to Apple Music by Micah Singleton@MicahSingleton Apr 27, 2017, 11:47am EDT share tweet Linkedin Photo by Daniel Boczarski/Getty Images In today’s edition of creepy men getting their projects potentially funded by multi-billion-dollar companies, Apple is considering putting the sequel to R. Kelly’s rap opera “Trapped in the Closet” on Apple Music, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The first five chapters of the series premiered on R. Kelly’s seventh album TP.3 Reloaded in 2005, and grew over the next seven years to encompass 33 chapters of the most ridiculous story, with some of the greatest twists and turns you’ve ever seen or heard heard. “Trapped in the Closet” was definitely entertaining, as evidenced by the somehow riveting first chapter: However, it doesn’t negate the fact that R. Kelly is a sexual predator who has been accused of having sex with girls as young as 14 and married the late R&B star Aaliyah when she was 15. When you take that into consideration — no matter how entertaining a sequel to “Trapped in the Closet” may be — R.

Apple Has Big Plans for Micro-LED Screens Don Reisinger Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide) April 26, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple won't be relying upon Samsung's OLED displays for long, according a new report. Apple has been rumored over the last several months to be working with Samsung Display on an OLED screen for its iPhone 8, expected to hit store shelves this fall. Apple has historically used LCD for its iPhones, making the shift to the more colorful OLED a big one for the company. Micro-LED displays may come to the Apple Watch and then iPhones. Credit: Jeremy Lips/Tom's GuideMore Micro-LED displays may come to the Apple Watch and then iPhones. Credit: Jeremy Lips/Tom's Guide However, Apple apparently is looking to the future and in 2014 acquired a company named LuxVue that was working on micro-LED technology. Later this year, Apple could start manufacturing a new display technology called micro-LED. The technology, which has been highly regarded for its detail and efficiency, could be used to replace OLED screens that would come baked into future Apple Watch and iPhone models, reports from Business Korea and Apple Insider say. MORE: iPhone 8 Rumors: What to Expect from the 10th Anniversary iPhone Micro-LED has been generally unknown to all but those who closely follow screen technology. It uses microscale LEDs to deliver what many say are better image quality than you might find in other screen technologies. Better yet, micro-LED doesn't cause too much of a battery drain. Display Daily reported in 2015 that at an industry trade show where micro-LED was shown off, it was called "the only potentially disruptive technology." Apple, then, appears to be in the right position. The company has a firm it's acquired that's working on micro-LED, and if it can find a suitable manufacturing partner, could soon have a stranglehold on the screen technology that could ultimately displace OLED. According to Business Korea, Apple's micro-LED work is causing some consternation in Korea, where Samsung Display and LG Display are hoping to grow their OLED business. If Apple can get micro-LED up and running and get suitable supply off the production lines, its reliance upon the OLED makers will diminish. Apple is said to be considering using micro-LED in the Apple Watch Series 3 that could make its debut later this year. If that goes well, Apple will attempt to build out production on the panels and may bundle the technology in future iPhones. Exactly when that might happen remains to be seen.

Is Apple almost ready to release its Siri-powered Amazon Echo rival? by Joe Roberts 15 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Apple has been rumoured to be working on its own smart speaker, and rival to Amazon's popular Echo device, for some time. Despite the rumours, last we heard was that the company had no interest in developing such a product, as a TIME column from industry consultant Tim Bajarin back in February claimed Apple was more concerned with bringing Siri to more and more existing devices. Executives allegedly implied to Bajarin that the firm was not developing a stand-alone Siri-powered speaker, but now, new claims from a well-known source have provided conflicting information. Related: Apple AR headset – What we know Sonny Dickson took to Twitter to provide a few updates, claiming Apple is "currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor". According to Dickson, the device will also come with Beats technology on-board, and "is expected to run a variant iOS". Dickson has a decent track record, accurately calling iOS 10's new-look lockscreen before it arrived – though he fails to provide any details on where he got this latest information from. Which means you should take it all with a pinch of salt for the time being, especially considering the earlier reports of Apple's disinterest in such a product. That said, commentators have argued Apple is losing ground in the smart home market, as rivals Amazon and Google push ahead with their own range of AI-assisted smart speakers. Just this week, Amazon added to its Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Tap lineup with a new device in the form of the Echo Look – a camera-packing device with Alexa that helps users organise their various outfits, as well as providing the usual smart speaker functionality. Amazon this week launched its new Echo Look – a camera-packing smart speaker Google has already launched its Google Home speaker in both the US and UK, and will no doubt be building its smart home range of products and services in the coming months. If Apple does push ahead with its own rival device, Dickson's latest update claims it will incorporate AirPlay support, which would allow users to stream music and podcasts to the device over Wi-Fi. Just what the Beats technology will be remains unclear, as does everything else about this. Apple is yet to confirm anything at this point but we could hear more soon. The company is gearing up for its Worldwide Developers Conference, which takes place from June 5 to June 9, so we could hear more about the rumoured smart speaker then. Stay tuned.

According to Bloomberg, the redesign reflects Apple’s big bets on video. Apple’s video plans span from the previously announced (and since delayed) “Carpool Karaoke” to a potential sequel to the classic R. Kelly hip hopera “Trapped in the Closet” to feature-length documentaries—Apple just won exclusive rights to Sean “Diddy” Combs’ documentary Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: A Bad Boy Story, produced by LiveNation. A show about Dr. Dre has been discussed. Producer Brian Grazer and director J.J. Abrams are brainstorming ideas. About 10 new original series are scheduled to debut on Apple Music this year. Apple has deep pockets and an A-list network to tap into. But so do other companies, like Netflix and Amazon. Where Apple can differentiate itself is its musical roots, which date back to the launch of iTunes 14 years ago, and the vision of longtime record executive Jimmy Iovine, who joined Apple when the company acquired his Beats headphones and streaming service in 2014. Iovine now leads Apple Music and has a staff of 300 working on every aspect of the business, which now extends to video. [ Further reading: The best media streaming devices ] Apple Spotify has also ventured into original video content with about a dozen TV series, but none have taken off. Video isn’t easy to discover or watch in the Spotify app, though the company launched its video feature two years ago with great fanfare (and a little help from “Broad City” stars Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson). According to Bloomberg, Iovine originally pitched Beats to Netflix as a potential acquisition, but the streaming giant reportedly told Iovine it wasn’t ready to move into music. If Apple nails video, making its exclusive content of the same caliber as Amazon and Netflix while also making it easy to find and watch, it could create the first successful music and video streaming service. But we’re still waiting to see if “Carpool Karaoke” is any good. The James Corden-hosted show was reportedly delayed from its April launch date because the series isn’t finished yet. There’s no official word yet on when that show and the will.i.am. reality series “Planet of the Apps” will premiere.

A new patent application from Apple published by the US Patent & Trademark Office (via Patently Apple) reveals how the company intends to improve the wireless circuitry systems of its devices through use of patch antennas. The patent application is Apple’s fifth wireless charging patent so far this year and indicates the importance of this technology to the company. Patch antennas are a type of radio antenna that can be mounted on a flat surface, and Apple intends to explore the possibility of using this technology as a means to transfer power wirelessly or communicate wirelessly with external equipment.

Apple had been working on this since 2010, according to the history of patent filings. You could review some of the particulars in our extensive report here. Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a continuation of their granted patent showing that the project is still alive in one of Apple's labs.   Continuation patents in general rarely if ever change the foundation of the summary and details of the patent filing. What changes is usually an extension of the original concept to cover new materials, different aspects of the design or direction of the invention. The changes are restricted to the patent claims, the most important part of a patent that defines the patent by protecting it by law. Patent infringement cases are usually all about the claims, so the carry a lot of weight.   In today's continuation patent revelations we're able to see that Apple is adding a dimension to the claims regarding the user's eyes. For instance, Apple notes that "determining a 3D frame of reference for the device based, at least in part, on the received positional data; receiving optical data from one or more optical sensors disposed within the device; determining a lighting condition in the environment of a user and a position of the user's eyes based, at least in part, on the received optical data; and generating a virtual 3D depiction of at least one graphical user interface object on a display of the device, wherein the at least one graphical user interface object is represented in a virtual 3D operating system environment, wherein the act of generating is based, at least in part, on the determined 3D frame of reference, the lighting condition in the environment of the user, and the position of the user's eyes.   Claim #2: The graphical user interface method of claim 1, wherein the act of generating further comprises ray tracing from the user's eyes through the display of the device and into the virtual 3D operating system environment.   Claim #3: The graphical user interface method of claim 1, wherein the act of generating further comprises applying an appropriate perspective transformation to the virtual 3D depiction of the at least one graphical user interface object on the display of the device, wherein the transformation is based, at least in part, on the determined 3D frame of reference and the determined position of the user's eyes.   Apple makes references to the user's eyes six more times in claim numbers 8, 10, 14 and 20.   While the 3D UI could be used on an iPhone used in a regular every day way, you have to understand that the claims of the 2016 granted patent covered a context of it also being associated with "eyewear or headgear worn by the user." That's covered in the granted patent claims 5, 12 and 19.   Apple's patent FIG. 10 noted above illustrates an exemplary gesture for activating the display of a smartphone to operate in a virtual 3D operating system environment mode.   This week we learned that Dr. Jeff Norris who led a team at NASA is now working as a manager in Apple's Augmented Reality team working on some form of eyewear of headset. So seeing Apple updating a potentially important patent about a next-generation 3D UI for the headset makes the project very exciting.   Today, some rudimentary headsets, like Samsung's Gear VR, may have 3D content played on displays that are really designed for a smartphone that fits into their headset. Apple on the other hand appears to be working on an optional new experience for users with a next-gen Apple headset. They don't want to limit users to simply viewing 3D and/or Augmented Reality content but also deliver a richly detailed 3D UI to make the whole experience a leap ahead of their competitor's headsets.   Of course it's a patent filing and not a guarantee that we'll ever see this come to market. But at least for today we have proof that the project that began in 2010 is still alive and well somewhere at Apple.   Apple's continuation patent application 20170115846 that was published today by USPTO was filed back in Q3 2016. The history of the patent goes back to at least 2010.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

The service would presumably exist under the Apple Pay umbrella, enabling users to easily and quickly transfer money to each other in a manner not too different from Square Cash and Venmo. According to a new report, Apple’s work on this payment transfer service still continues. Re/code reports that Apple has been having discussions with the payment industry about the service that it’s building. The report claims that this service might be launched as early as this year. Much like Venmo and its competitors, Apple’s new service would enable iPhone users to transfer money to each other quickly using their mobile phones. Apple has reportedly held talks with Visa for a prepaid debit card service which would be tied to peer-to-peer payment transfers. This might result in a Visa debit card co-branded with Apple which will enable the company’s users to even make purchases at retailers using their cards. It’s not like Apple is going to have an open playing field if it does launch such a service. The market is already crowded by companies like Square Cash, PayPal, Venmo, and even Facebook. Yes, Apple has the advantage of having hundreds of millions of iPhone users, but it’s not exactly going to be an easy ride for the company’s peer-to-peer payment transfer service.

At that time the rumor mill appeared to be in consensus that Apple was going to release this iPhone later on in 2017. Over the past few weeks, we’ve started seeing reports that question whether or not the iPhone 8 will be out this year. Various reasons are being provided, including but not limited to supply shortages of the OLED display panel. A new report brings gossip from Apple’s contract iPhone manufacturer from Foxconn which will have us believe that the iPhone 8 won’t be launched this year at all. The report, based on unsubstantiated gossip from inside Foxconn, claims that Apple is not going to release the iPhone 8 this year. Foxconn is Apple’s main contract manufacturer for the iPhone so it’s not like people who are working in its factories don’t know bits and pieces about what’s going on as far as new iPhone are concerned. The scuttlebutt from inside Foxconn will have you believe that Apple has only placed orders for the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus this year. It’s even claimed that the packaging materials for these units will start arriving in Foxconn’s factories by the end of June. Recent reports have claimed that supply issues might force Apple to delay the iPhone 8 to 2018. Whether or not that really ends up happening remains to be seen. It’s not like we can ever expect the company to comment on such rumors. New iPhones are normally announced in the fall and it’s likely to be the same this year as well. Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals “Apple Cash” money transfer service and virtual prepaid cards due in 2017? Christian Zibreg on April 27, 2017 1 Sources speaking with Recode reiterated today that Apple is still planning to debut its own money-transfer service akin to PayPal’s Venmo that could launch later this year. Tentatively named Apple Cash, the peer-to-peer service would zap payments from users’ checking accounts to recipients through their Apple devices, basically allowing iPhone owners to send cash to friends and family members digitally. The Cupertino giant could partner with Visa on a system that would let users obtain virtual Apple-branded prepaid cards. Running on Visa’s debit network, those digital cards could be tied directly into the firm’s rumored peer-to-peer thing. Moreover, users would be permitted to register them with Apple Pay to use when making credit-card and debit-card payments in stores with their Apple devices. The card number could also be used to make purchases on websites and in apps. Sources claim Apple’s recently held discussions with payments industry partners about introducing the service, which could arrive later this year. If so, and I’m just speculating here, Apple could announce it formally at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. “People would be able to use the Apple cards to spend money sent to them through the new service, without having to wait for it to clear to their bank account,” as per Recode’s report. The prospect of Apple getting its own debit card apparently isn’t sitting well with some bank executives, who might raise their concerns with Visa next week during an annual summit that the credit card company is hosting for its bank partners. “Banks spent heavily in insuring their cards were top of wallet when they all built and rolled out Apple Pay,” said Cherian Abraham, a digital payments executive at Experian. “So it’s justifiable to be concerned that Apple will have its own card and could potentially be top of wallet. If you are top of wallet, you are top of mind.” Apple’s plans could change, of course. Should it launch the service, the iPhone maker will go head-on against SquareCash, PayPal’s Venom for millennials which registered $17.6 billion in volume and is still doubling year-over-year, Chase’s QuickPay service that processed $28 billion in transfers last year and others. TUTORIAL: How to remove credit card information from your iPhone Unlike with Apple Pay, the company may not impose a fee on transactions. “Apple would likely not charge consumers to use the money-transfer service, meaning it might only be able to make money if they also use the Apple debit card tied to it,” writes Recode. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the service back in November 2015. It’s unknown if any of the major U.S. banks may have cut a deal with the Cupertino company and how the service might tie into the banking industry’s existing infrastructure. Apple and Visa spokespeople declined to comment.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple Finalizing Design Of Its Amazon Echo Rival By Adnan Farooqui on 04/27/2017 08:20 PDT Amazon proved with its Echo lineup of devices that there’s significant demand for devices in the market that are powered by artificial intelligence smart assistants and are always listening for the user’s voice commands. We’ve seen similar products from Google and even Microsoft is working on one that’s backed by its Cortana assistant. Previous reports have suggested that Apple is developing a similar product which will be backed by Siri. A new report claims that Apple is now close to finalizing the design of this device. The report claims that Apple is finalizing the design for its much-rumored Amazon Echo rival and that it’s going to have support for both Siri and AirPlay. If it does have support for AirPlay, the device will be able to allow users to stream their radio, music, and podcasts to Apple’s new device over Wi-Fi. It may even have Beats technology which will enable it to provide a quality audio experience. Apple may market this product as a Siri/AirPlay device. It may run a version of iOS. No further details have been provided about this product at this point in time so it’s too soon to be certain about its specifications. Apple has not yet said anything about such a device so take all information about its rumored Echo rival with a grain of salt until there’s something official to go on. Filed in Apple >Gadgets.

The service would be part of the company's mobile payments service, Apple Pay, and will let users send money to each other instantly—similar to how Venmo works. Venmo has become enormously popular among a younger crowd to make small, cashless transfers using a phone, like reimbursing a friend for dinner, paying a babysitter, or for paying one's share of the rent. In the first quarter of 2017, Venmo processed a record $6.8 billion in the first quarter, double the amount from the same period last year. Forrester Research estimates that the total peer-to-peer payments (P2P) payments market will reach $17 billion in transaction volume by 2019. This isn't the first time Apple (aapl) has been rumored to be working on a Venmo-rival. In November 2015, rumors swirled that the technology giant was developing a mobile P2P service. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Apple already operates its own digital wallet, Apple Pay, so adding another payments feature might make sense. Apple Pay was launched in 2014 as a way to let shoppers load their credit card and debit card information onto their iPhones in the form of “mobile wallets.” Customers can then use either their iPhone (or linked Apple Watch) to pay at retail stores equipped with point-of-sale registers supporting near-field communication (NFC) technology, which enables frictionless payments between smartphones and registers. People simply place their phones or watches near the point-of-sale register sensors for a payment to be made without swiping a card. Consumers can also use Apple Pay accounts to pay for items within apps and on the web. Google (goog) operates a competitive mobile payments service for Android phone users, called Android Pay. Apple is also reportedly in talks with credit card processor Visa (v) to create pre-paid cards that would be linked to a user's Apple Pay account.

It’s said that iOS 11 is going to bring a revamped version of Apple Music that’s going to focus more on video content. The report mentions that the revamped Apple Music might host up to 10 original series by the end of this year. Apple has evidently been working on shoring up its video content. It has created documentaries on Cash Money Records and Clive Davis, it acquired Carpool Karaoke, and it’s even producing a pitch-off series filled with celebrities. Apple has also announced that a show called Can’t Stop Won’t Stop from Live Nation will be exclusive to Apple Music as well. Bloomberg reports today that Apple is also developing a show based on the co-founder of Beats Music Dr. Dre. A possible sequel to R. Kelly’s rap opera Trapped in the Closet might be considered as well. Given that it’s going to increase its focus on emphasis, one can expect the app to get an overhauled user interface as well to put video content front and center. We can expect to hear more about these changes at the Worldwide Developers Conference 2017 this June.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE IDC: Smartphone shipments up 4.3% in Q1 2017, Apple gains on Samsung but both lose to Chinese firms Emil Protalinski@EPro April 27, 2017 7:52 AM Image Credit: Reuters / Dado Ruvic Smartphone vendors shipped a total of 347.4 million smartphones worldwide last quarter, up 4.3 percent from the 332.9 million units in Q1 2016. Looking at the top five vendors, Samsung and Apple both lost share while Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo all grew. In Q3 2017, the South Korean company once again shipped more smartphones than any other vendor. Its American counterpart managed to close the market share gap slightly, but only because the two saw flat shipments year-over-year. Meanwhile, the Chinese trio, as I like to call them, all shipped more smartphones than a year ago. The latest quarterly figures come from IDC, which summarized its findings in the following chart: As you can see above, Samsung’s market share fell 1.0 percentage points (from 23.8 percent to 22.8 percent) as it shipped the same number of smartphones: 79.2 million. Every quarter, Samsung owns about a fifth of the market, and that remained true for the start of 2017. IDC believes the success of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge was extended courtesy of substantial discounts meant to make room for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Samsung’s more affordable A Series and J Series continued to perform well in both developed and emerging markets. Apple, meanwhile, slipped 0.5 points (to 14.9 percent) as shipments were up by only some 400,000 units to 51.6 million. Put another way, Apple did not benefit much from Samsung’s woes, at least not in the short term. The higher-capacity iPhone SE and red iPhone 7 arrived at the end of the quarter, though nobody was really expecting either to move the needle. Huawei gained 1.4 points (to 9.8 percent), Oppo increased 1.5 points (to 7.4 percent), and Vivo grabbed 0.8 points (to 5.2 percent). While the Android and iOS duopoly doesn’t look like it’s going away, the Samsung-Apple duopoly keeps eroding. Chinese brands Oppo and Vivo last year pushed out previous fourth- and fifth-place players Lenovo and Xiaomi, and the Chinese pair don’t appear to be going away in 2017. As China’s smartphone market matures, these players are already looking to the worldwide stage. Their value-packed devices offer the latest features at a fraction of the cost, compared to market leaders Samsung and Apple. The latest smartphone trend of affordable high-end devices does not favor the duo. “Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets,” IDC research manager Anthony Scarsella said in a statement. “Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies’ portfolios geared toward affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models. Companies have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment.” ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Apple is currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device. — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 Apple's plans for an Amazon Echo-style speaker emerged a year ago. It was reported since that a new device will control your smarthome kit through Siri voice control. The company has allegedly been working on the project for more than two years, which explains why we've heard similar rumours previously, but it seems the research and development phase is now over. Mark Gurman at Bloomberg originally said that the new device will be able to control appliances, locks, lights and curtains via voice activation. Now Apple is thought to be making an Amazon Echo-like speaker with Siri Amazon Echo: What can Alexa do and what services are compatible? New Apple TV surfaces in FCC filing, has Bluetooth and, er, NFC? It was also suggested that an Apple speaker could trump the Amazon Echo. It was claimed that it'll feature more advanced microphone and speaker technologies. Early prototypes are said to have included facial recognition sensors, using tech Apple acquired when it bought both Faceshift and Emotient in the last couple of years. Apple has naturally declined to comment throughout, but considering Amazon has had great success with its Echo speaker, we can see why the Cupertino firm is so keen to nab a slice of the smarthome assistant market.

Recode says that Apple has also held talks with Visa about the possibility of creating virtual Apple prepaid debit cards. This would allow users to spend the money they get from the new peer-to-peer payments service instantly without having to wait for the money to clear in their bank account. The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here Essentially, the Apple prepaid cards would act as a proxy for the transactions taking place over Apple Pay. As Apple knows who paid who, it can temporarily foot the bill until all the backend payments clear. The virtual debit card would work in retail stores and online. It isn’t clear if the prepaid Apple debit card would only be accepted at places that take Apple Pay (although that seems likely). The idea of Apple Pay between friends has existed ever since Apple Pay launched back in 2014. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Apple was looking to launch person-to-person Apple Pay mobile payments last year, although obviously nothing came of it. Apple has also recently held discussions with Visa about creating its own pre-paid cards that would run on the Visa debit network and which would be tied to the new peer-to-peer service, sources told Recode. People would be able to use the Apple cards to spend money sent to them through the new service, without having to wait for it to clear to their bank account. Users could then add the debit card, which may only come in a digital form, to their Apple Pay digital wallet to use for tap-and-pay purchases at brick-and-mortar stores. The card number could also be used to make purchases on websites and in apps. Obviously, the peer-to-peer payments would only work between other Apple users as it will be tightly integrated into Apple Pay. Given the fact that iMessage and Siri already feature payment services from third parties, it would make sense that Apple’s offering would also integrate into its messaging and voice command services. Apple is unlikely to charge end-users for sending money to friends but it may profit from the prepaid debit card transactions by claiming fees from merchants. The report says banks are uneasy about the idea of Apple launching its own bank cards who have a vested interest in them being the default payment method in Apple Pay. They are worried that Apple will give its own debit cards preferential treatment. In terms of a launch schedule, the Recode report does not offer any guidance beyond ‘later this year’. Speculating, it seems likely that the feature would be rolled into iOS 11 and therefore could be announced in June at WWDC. Apple could wait and launch the feature at a later date, or scrap the idea entirely of course.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Steven Overly By Steven Overly April 27 at 10:31 AM Follow @stevenoverly (Sergio Perez/Reuters) An advocacy group known for challenging the tech industry on privacy called on the Federal Trade Commission Thursday to investigate media reports that Uber could identify specific iPhone devices even after users deleted the ride-hailing app. In a letter submitted Thursday, California-based Consumer Watchdog alleged that Uber’s practice would be considered “unfair or deceptive” to its users and therefore violates a statute in the Federal Trade Commission Act designed to protect consumers from substantial and avoidable harm. The nonpartisan group also asked Acting Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen and Commissioner Terrell McSweeny to determine whether Uber engaged in similar tactics on Android devices and scrutinize whether the company is abiding by its own privacy policies. “They have a track record of not paying any attention to the rules. That’s why it’s important, no matter what they’ve done with Apple, for the FTC to act,” John M. Simpson, Consumer Watchdog’s privacy project director, said in an interview. Simpson said the FTC should put an injunction in place to prevent Uber from using similar software in the future. Representatives for Uber did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A New York Times report this week revealed that Uber’s app could give iPhones a unique “fingerprint” so that the company could identify devices even if its app was deleted or the phone was erased entirely. The company intended to stymie account fraud in places like China, where some drivers would create multiple accounts to request and accept fake rides, according to the report. But the practice of tagging iPhones violates Apple’s rules for app makers, and Uber attempted to prevent engineers there from detecting the code by putting Apple’s Cupertino headquarters inside a “geo-fence,” meaning its software would appear differently when viewed in that location. When Apple discovered the deception, Apple chief executive Tim Cook personally told Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to knock it off or Uber’s app would be pulled from its store, the Times reported. “The fact that they apparently geo-fenced the Apple headquarters so the engineers there couldn’t figure out what was happening exacerbates the situation and implies they knew what they were doing and they were being deceptive about it,” Simpson said. In a statement provided to multiple media outlets earlier this week, an Uber spokesman denied that the company tracks users after they delete its app. “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app. As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone — over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.” Filing a formal complaint with the FTC does not guarantee the agency will investigate the claim or take action against a company. But Consumer Watchdog has a record of taking technology companies to task when it believes their practices harm consumers or violate their privacy. In December, it was one of two groups to complain that Google was building detailed profiles of its users by combining data from its various Web services, such as Google search and Google Maps. Another Consumer Watchdog complaint against Google, filed in 2012, accused the company of bypassing the privacy settings of people using Apple’s Safari Web browser on iPhones. That violation, which was discovered by a researcher at Stanford University, ultimately led the FTC to impose a $22.5 million fine. Thursday’s letter refers to Uber as “a renegade technology and transportation company whose executives pride themselves on a disruptive, rule-breaking approach to business.” The complaint is the latest criticism of Uber and its chief executive officer. Earlier this year, a former female engineer publicly accused the company of failing to address sexual harassment and discrimination claims, prompting an internal review spearheaded by former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder. Kalanick was also recorded in a terse exchange with an Uber driver over fares. Kalanick later told employees “I need leadership help,” and the board of directors immediately launched a search for a chief operating officer. Uber’s software has landed the company in trouble before. It was revealed earlier this year that Uber used “Greyball” software to identify and block regulators in cities where it was operating without permission. In March, Uber pledged to stop that practice. Another software program, dubbed “Hell,” reportedly allowed Uber to monitor the availability and location of drivers for its rival, Lyft, according to The Information. “Hell” also helped the company identify drivers using both apps. That revelation has inspired a class-action lawsuit from a former Lyft driver.

Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation." Advertisement Big U.S. companies have nearly US$1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc has more than US$200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. "What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions," Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January in response to an analyst's question about the company's thinking on acquisitions. Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many U.S. companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A MIXED BAG The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 percent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 percent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. "At the highest level we're a big supporter of tax reform," Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call Wednesday. "It's going to drive jobs, it's going to drive the U.S. economy broadly speaking and it's going to allow us to compete." Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. “A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump’s first 100 days in office," said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Zach Epstein @zacharye April 27th, 2017 at 10:08 AM Share Tweet I penned a piece on Wednesday in which I explained the five main reasons I could never switch to the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+ from my iPhone 7 Plus. While my in-depth Galaxy S8 review approached Samsung’s hot new flagship smartphones from a neutral viewpoint, this new supplemental piece offered a different point of view from me, as an end user. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Samsung has out-designed Apple with its new Galaxy S8, but in this post I covered key areas where Samsung still can’t even approach the iPhone. There’s one more reason I could never switch to the Galaxy S8 and ditch my iPhone 7 Plus, though, and it’s a reason I never thought I would have. Don't Miss: After two weeks with the Galaxy S8, I still think the iPhone 7 Plus is the world’s best phone I’ve received more than two dozen emails and a handful of mentions on Twitter since published that opinion piece on Wednesday. Oddly, nearly every single one was from a person nodding in agreement. It’s still early days, but I would wager that no Samsung phone released in the past few years has drawn more interest from iPhone users than the new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. It makes sense, of course, because they’re stunning. And yet from the messages I’ve received and the conversations I’ve had elsewhere, Samsung for the most part isn’t actually stealing these users away. Everyone seems to be intrigued by the Galaxy S8, which features an incredible new “Infinity Display” design. The Super AMOLED screens on the S8 takes up an impressive 83% of the phone’s face, which is the best screen-to-body ratio the world has ever seen on a widely available smartphone. Coupled with a curved front and back that make the S8 more comfortable and stylish than any other smartphone out there, and you’ve got yourself a winner. But is it enough to steal away many iPhone users? For me personally, there’s simply no chance I could bail on Apple’s ecosystem for the Galaxy S8. As I explained in yesterday’s post, Apple’s iPhone UX is still so much better than Android, it’s not even close. The OS is smoother, the third-party apps are superior in design and performance, Apple’s Continuity features are fantastic, and the iPhone itself outperforms every Android phone including the Galaxy S8. Add in the iPhone 7 Plus’ class-leading battery life and Apple’s unrivaled customer support, and you’ve got an experience that no other phone can match. Not even the Galaxy S8. There’s one more reason I am personally locked into the iPhone though, and I think millions of other iPhone users would probably agree. Smartwatches, in general, are awful. They have been awful for years. And when rumors began swirling that Apple was developing its own smartwatch, I figured it too would be awful. I knew the device would be popular, of course, since Apple users are a dedicated bunch. But in terms of features and design, I certainly didn’t think the Apple Watch would ever appeal to me. As anyone who has read my earlier Apple Watch coverage surely knows, I sang a different tune the moment I began using one. I’m a lifelong watch lover and collector who thought that there was no way a silly smartwatch could ever replace a mechanical watch on my wrist. Since buying my first Apple Watch shortly after it was released, I have sold almost every watch in my collection. In fact, over the past two years since I started wearing the Apple Watch, I’ve only gone for two or three days total without having it on my wrist. After testing every big-name Android (and Tizen) smartwatch that has been released over the past few years, I’m hesitant to lump Apple’s watch into the same category. Early Android watches were garbage. There’s no way around it. More recent offerings are vastly improved, and Samsung’s most recent Tizen watch pretty nifty as well. “Nifty” is about as much as I can say for them, sadly. The Apple Watch is far smoother and more streamlined than anything its rivals have managed to cook up. It’s also simpler, with a UX that practically anyone can figure out because just about everything makes sense. Simple doesn’t mean it lacks features, however, and I rely on Apple Watch features all day long. I have different Apple Watch faces that display different complications, giving me zero-touch access to real-time information. The Dark Sky complication shows me the current weather conditions and alerts me when it’s going to rain or snow. The Openfolio complication shows me exactly what my stock portfolio is doing. The Activity complication reminds me that I need to get off my butt and walk some more so I can meet the day’s goals. Then, there are a number of third-party apps I rely on as well. For example, the August app lets me unlock my front door with a tap, and the Newton Mail app gives me rich notifications so I can quickly read previews of new emails and then delete or archive them. That last one is key for me because I can get anywhere from 200 to 400 emails in any given day, but the majority of them are messages I don’t even need to read beyond the subject line to know I can delete them. With the Apple Watch, I tap one button and an email is deleted without having to pull my phone out of my pocket over and over. There are rival smartwatches that can handle some or even most of the tasks I perform on my Apple Watch, just as there are Android phones that can handle just about everything I do on my iPhone. But it’s not the same. After all these years, and after all of the features other companies have copied, Apple still offers user experiences that are leaps and bounds beyond its competitors.

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus combined to account for 68% of total iPhone sales in the U.S. last quarter, new data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) shows (PDF). However, that figure slid slightly from the year-ago quarter, when the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus—then the highest-end Apple handsets—accounted for more than 70% of sales. What's more, older iPhone models, including the iPhone 6s, sold better in the first quarter than Apple's legacy handsets have performed in years prior. "Despite upgraded features like each new flagship iPhone release, the legacy models accounted for almost a third of iPhones sold in the quarter, the highest percentage since Apple (aapl) started releasing two new phones each fall in 2014," CIRP partner and co-founder Josh Lowitz said in a statement. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Apple released its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models last fall. The handsets come with minor design upgrades compared to the previous year's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, but have a more powerful processor. Apple also made the controversial decision in the iPhone 7 line to eliminate the handset's headphone jack. However, few users have complained of the omission, and Apple has generally said that iPhone 7 sales are strong. The company hasn't, however, revealed exact sales figures. CIRP's data suggests there might be more for Apple to worry about than how its iPhone 7 compares to the iPhone 6s. Notably, the company found that just 10% of Americans who purchased an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus last quarter came from an Android-based device. In the first quarter of 2016, 26% of iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus buyers came from Android, the research firm said. However, CIRP said that Apple has an exceedingly loyal user base that doesn't often move to Android. Although the iPhone 7's performance was a bit of a mixed bag in the first quarter, CIRP noted that the larger iPhone 7 Plus model is increasingly growing its share of Apple handset sales. That has pushed Apple's average iPhone selling price up and could be good news for the company's bottom line. The CIRP study was conducted between April 1 and April 12. It includes responses from 500 U.S. Apple customers. Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc. All rights reserved.

By: Reuters | Updated: April 28, 2017 10:29 am Excitement around the iPhone 8 has boosted some Apple suppliers’ stocks so far this year. (Image for representation, Source: Reuters) AMS shares jumped as much as 20 percent a day after the Austrian chip maker reported first-quarter revenue above its own expectations, and said it might increase its mid-term revenue growth target on strong customer demand. AMS supplies smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung with optical sensors that help adjust the brightness and colours on screens. Excitement around the iPhone 8 has boosted some Apple suppliers’ stocks so far this year. AMS has been one of the biggest beneficiaries with its shares more than doubling. ZKB analyst Andreas Müller said AMS was also poised to benefit in the current quarter from the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8.AMS said on Monday it expected revenues of 174 million to 181 million euros ($197.13 million) for the second quarter, a big jump from 149.3 mln euros it reported in the first quarter. “AMS reported an impressive start to the year … the outlook demonstrates that demand is strong for its portfolio of sensing solutions, even more so than that previously forecast,” Barclays analyst Andrew Gardiner wrote in a note to clients.The company has also increased its capital expenditure forecast to ramp up capacities at its facilities, citing significantly increased customer forecasts and a higher revenue pipeline for 2017.Müller said he believed these capacity expansions were not just linked to the iPhones, but also to some new Chinese customers. Also Read: Apple services revenue expected to reach $7 billion this quarter AMS is now “more confident” that all projects are ramping, the company said in a conference call, but it declined to comment on customer specific project pipelines. Apple’s suppliers are also in the spotlight after Imagination Technologies revealed earlier this month that Apple plans to replace its graphics chips with parts it is developing in-house. Shares in another supplier Dialog Semiconductor were hit when an analyst report suggested it could lose a big Apple supply deal.AMS shares were last up 15 percent at 61.90 Swiss francs and topped the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.

Titled “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: A Bad Boy Story,” it chronicles Combs’ and his record label’s precipitous rise in the mid-90s to the top of the music business. Among other topics, the film deals with “the trials and tribulations” Combs faced in putting together last year’s 20th anniversary Bad Boy reunion shows in two weeks time and with artists who hadn’t performed in years, noted Billboard. He partnered with both Apple Music and Live Nation to produce and distribute the flick, which premiered at the TriBeCa Film Festival last night. Apple Music will have the exclusive rights to “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop” for at least the next year. The film, directed by Daniel Kaufman, will be free for Apple Music members beginning June 25. Jimmy Iovine, Apple Music chairman and CEO, said: I went to the Bad Boy Reuion concert and thought it was incredible. I think Puff and Bad Boy’s story is incredible and one that a lot of people can relate to in any genre or in any business. His story is powerful. He really overcame a lot to get to where he’s at today and the documentary shows that. There’s little doubt now in how compelling the new Diddy documentary is, especially seeing the rap mogul in what seems a more revealing and unvarnished light than ever before. Live Nation Productions head Heather Parry said they got “incredible” access to Combs. “We were in the shower with him, we see him getting a B12 shot in his underwear and then how upset he is with how the first night of the show went. He’s vulnerable but you see how much he loves and cares for his Bad Boy family,” Heather said. The film includes scenes about the death of Notorious B.I.G. Diddy said in a statement: I knew this was a story that should be shared with the world. Heather Parry and Live Nation Productions, and Director Daniel Kaufman, helped create this very special documentary. Now I’m blessed to also be working with Apple to showcase the film and share Bad Boy’s history and impact with fans. The support Live Nation, Apple and everyone on the team has given to this project is a true testament to the Bad Boy legacy. In addition to Iovine himself, Combs’ film contains a number or rare images and video and features several other music executives, including Uptown Records’ Andre Harrell, Arista’s Clive Davis and others. “We found a treasure trove in the Bad Boy offices” says Parry. “We have the young Puff on camera, a young Kim and Faith and stuff from Biggie some of which has been seen before.” Apple Music will have other exclusive video content for its users, like James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” franchise (recently delayed, now coming later this year), Dr. Dre’s semi-autobiographical scripted series “Vital Signs” and “Planet of the Apps,” a celebrities-laden show about apps and their makers. According to Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine, they have “a bunch of other stuff” in the pipeline, with most of the planned video content being things “that people are involved in with pop culture and that we think will be great for our audience.” Iovine recently detailed Apple Music’s efforts to become “an overall moment in popular culture.” Source: Billboard Tagged: Apple Apple Music Documentaries Music News MORE FROM iDB iOS 11 to bring new video features to Apple Music, 10 original series planned this year Issues with your Apple Music subscription or iCloud storage?

We haven’t played the game, but presumably it’s a fairly good game, or its userbase is so high it doesn’t matter. But either way, Apple has yanked it off the iOS store. A Questionable Policy This is far from the first time an app has been removed from the store because it somehow offended Apple’s delicate sensibilities. Apple tightly polices its marketplace to prevent spam and fraud, but it also appears to impose a certain moral strictness on any apps that appear. Whether this is because Apple is run by prudes or because Apple is worried about selling phones in places that don’t have freedom of speech, it happens quite a bit, and Weed Firm is just the latest example. A Questionable Response Manitoba Games has, in response, complained that you can do other illegal things in video games, like crash cars and shoot people. A response that would have a lot more weight if they weren’t, uh, editing the game so it can be posted back on the iOS Store. Honestly, everyone should have limited patience when stoners while about oppression, but to be honest it’s hard to take Manitoba’s outrage all that seriously when apparently growing cannabis is so secondary to the game itself it can be excised with little issue. So basically you’re complaining that Apple is removing your marketing gimmick? Still, An Issue That said, Manitoba does have a point in that adults should be able to decide what they do with their electronics, as long as it isn’t hurting anyone. It’s unlikely that Apple is going to change, though: The company has always been a notorious control freak. Which is yet another reason that, long term, it’s time to dump your iPhone.

While Iovine didn’t go into details on any unannounced projects, sources suggest that two will about the legendary hip-hop labels Bad Boy Records and Cash Money Records, while another is about Clive Davis. I’m trying to help Apple Music be an overall movement in popular culture, everything from unsigned bands to video. We have a lot of plans. We have the freedom, because it’s Apple, to make one show, three shows, see what works, see what doesn’t work until it feels good.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering his roots, Iovine remains focused on music-related projects at this point. A possible sequel to R. Kelly’s “Trapped in the Closet” is said to be in the works, and Iovine is developing another show “loosely based” on the life of Dr. Dre. However, Iovine notes that he eventually does plan to go beyond music and has already had discussions with Hollywood producer Brian Grazer and director J.J. Abrams. As Iovine describes it, “Apple music is nowhere near complete in my head,” but emphasizes that he plans to grow the service slowly “no matter what,” much like how he founded and built Interscope back in 1989, beginning with a couple of lesser-known artists and slowly growing into one of the world’s most successful record labels.   Comments « Apple releases fifth beta of iOS 10.3.2 Daily Deal: SFC30 Bluetooth Controller + NES Classic Bluetooth Receiver Exclusive Bundle » Related Stories New Puff Daddy Documentary will be another Apple Music exclusive Apple releases fifth beta of iOS 10.3.2 Apple executive talks using AI to boost human memory Apple rolling out ‘Today at Apple’ educational courses starting in May Apple delays ‘Carpool Karaoke’ release to ‘later this year’ Apple releases fourth betas of iOS 10.3.2, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1 Subscribe to iLounge Weekly Recent News New Puff Daddy Documentary will be another Apple Music exclusive Apple releases fifth beta of iOS 10.3.2 Report: Apple’s Jimmy Iovine still has ambitious video plans for Apple Music Apple executive talks using AI to boost human memory Apple rolling out ‘Today at Apple’ educational courses starting in May Smart home device maker iDevices acquired by Hubbell Apple delays ‘Carpool Karaoke’ release to ‘later this year’ Dutch court rules Apple can’t replace broken iPads with refurbished models Chinese blog claims Apple is only releasing two iPhone 8 models, no iPhone 7s or 7s Plus Apple releases fourth betas of iOS 10.3.2, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1 Recent Reviews Advanced Evo X & M4 Advanced Mezger aptX Bluetooth Receiver iDevices Wall Switch iDevices Wall Outlet Koogeek Wi-Fi SmartSocket for Apple HomeKit Sony MDR-1000X Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones FiiO i1 Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Adapter Blue Ella Headphones Apple iPad (Fifth-Generation) AudioQuest NightOwl Carbon Headphones Recent Articles Top Five: The Best Products for Building a Smart Home with HomeKit Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of watchOS 3 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of tvOS 10 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of iOS 10 Inside the betas: iOS 10 Photos gets Advanced Computer Vision Inside the betas: iOS 10 Music app delivers ‘clarity and simplicity’ Inside the betas: iOS 10 Maps gets a major redesign Inside the betas: iOS 10 shakes up the user experience Inside the betas: watchOS 3 promises a real speed boost Inside the betas: A sneak peek at what’s new in tvOS 10 Win Subscribe Buy ADVERTISE | CONTACT US Search Sign up for the iLounge Weekly Newsletter iLounge is an independent resource for all things iPod, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Apple TV, Mac, and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc. iLounge is © 2001 - 2017 iLounge, Inc.

The announcement comes after the documentary's premiere at the TriBeCa Film Festival yesterday. Can't Stop, Won't Stop documents the rise of Combs and his record label throughout the 1990s, and extends to the process Combs went through when he put together the 20th anniversary Bad Boy reunion show tour in 2016. The partnership with Apple Music began when Iovine attended one of those shows. "I went to the [Bad Boy Reuion] concert and thought it was incredible," Jimmy Iovine, Apple Music chairman and CEO, tells Billboard. "I think Puff and Bad Boy's story is incredible and one that a lot of people can relate to in any genre or in any business. His story is powerful. He really overcame a lot to get to where he's at today and the documentary shows that." Apple Music is said to have exclusive rights to the documentary for at least one year. According to Combs himself, he feels "blessed" to be working with Apple to show the impact that the Bad Boys have had on fans throughout the years, including the death of Notorious B.I.G. “I knew this was a story that should be shared with the world," Diddy said in a statement "Heather Parry and Live Nation Productions, and Director Daniel Kaufman, helped create this very special documentary. Now I'm blessed to also be working with Apple to showcase the film and share Bad Boy's history and impact with fans. The support Live Nation, Apple and everyone on the team has given to this project is a true testament to the Bad Boy legacy." In his interview with Billboard today, Iovine detailed near-term plans for Apple Music that would focus on original video content with music-related themes, a category that Combs' Can't Stop, Won't Stop fits right into. Brad Paisley also just announced a "visual album" coming as a timed exclusive to Apple Music tomorrow, April 28. Further down the line, Apple Music subscribers will have access to a much wider variety of shows, which might even include content from J.J. Abrams.

The title comes from a slogan/catch phrase Combs used on numerous tracks in the 90s. Don't give Swift (or anyone else) credit for creating things that they did not. ------ I'm not the biggest fan of Sean Combs but I might check this out; it could end up being pretty interesting since Bad Boy was one of the biggest labels in the commercial advent of hip hop.

The piece also describes more video-centric features in the iOS 11 version of Apple’s Music app than we’ve seen so far. Sony A6500 The two most prominent original series we’ve seen Apple Music promote so far include Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke, although neither have been released yet. Carpool Karaoke has been pushed back to ‘later this year’, however, while Planet of the Apps is due out this spring. Apple Music could release as many as 10 original series by the end of the year, including will.i.am’s Planet of the Apps and several documentaries. Iovine won’t say what they are, but people familiar with the matter say two are about the legendary hip-hop labels Bad Boy Records and Cash Money Records while another is about music impresario Clive Davis. “For a music streaming service,” Iovine says, “we’re building a very decent slate.” The Clive Davis bit mentioned likely refers to the documentary rights Apple acquired recently. The Bad Boy Records bit mentioned refers to a new P. Diddy documentary announced this morning: Live Nation Productions announced today that Can’t Stop Won’t Stop: A Bad Boy Story is coming exclusively to Apple Music. The film will have its World Premiere at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival and will be available to watch on Apple Music June 25, 2017. The piece also references the long-rumored series based loosely on Beats Music co-founder and artist Dr. Dre: For the moment, he’s mostly focused on music-related video, including a possible sequel to R. Kelly’s rap opera Trapped in the Closet. Iovine has had talks with Warner Bros. Television and is developing another show loosely based on the life of his longtime business partner Dr. Dre. Longer term, more content that doesn’t focus on music is a possibility including involvement with director J.J. Abrams: Eventually he plans to go beyond music and has discussed possible ideas with his friend Brian Grazer, producer of Empire and Genius, and director J.J. Abrams. “Apple Music is nowhere near complete in my head,” he says. The profile also teases out a tidbit about the next version of Apple Music, likely in iOS 11: When Apple introduces the next version of its smartphone software iOS later this year, the company plans to unveil a new edition of the Music app that better showcases video. We’ve already seen a preview of how Apple Music original video content including Carpool Karaoke and Planet of the Apps will look in the Apple Music app, although this description sounds more involved than the new video section previewed so far. Finally, there’s this interesting detail about Jimmy Iovine potentially selling Beats Music to Netflix before Apple bought it: Before selling Beats Music to Apple, Iovine spoke with Netflix. He’d seen firsthand how much it would cost for his music service to keep the lights on (let alone actually make money), and he would have had to raise money and dilute his share in the business. Netflix’s Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos told Iovine the company wasn’t ready for music, but Iovine didn’t surrender his belief that music and video are now inextricably linked.

Video Mingis on Tech: Energy microgrids, what's up with Apple TV -- and drones! The latest Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) survey results show that Apple’s iPhone 7 series smartphones are doing almost as well as the previous generation, except in one key metric: Android users aren’t switching to them as frequently. Though they are still switching The statistics claim around 26 percent of iPhone 6S series smartphones switched over from Android last time round, but this has fallen to around 10 percent with Apple’s latest model. [ Related: Video review: Apple's new AirPods ] This might represent a cooling of interest in iPhones among curious Android users, but I’d speculate it instead represents an intensification of interest in Apple’s next iPhone, given the hype surrounding the tenth-anniversary release. “We see very strong iPhone loyalty, and conversely continued lower switching from Android phones,” said CIRP co-founder, Josh Lowitz. “With only 10 percent of 7 and 7 Plus buyers switching from an Android phone, now 3-6 months after the launch of those models in September 2016, we see how the premiere iPhone models sell mostly to the installed base of iPhone owners. "The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus models have a higher percentage of Android switchers, and the entry level iPhone SE also brings in first-time smartphone buyers.” This might provide a little reassurance to Android device manufacturers, who find it incredibly hard to make any money out of the millions of units they are shifting, and have scant after-sales service income to buoy their efforts. Apple, meanwhile, seems to be facing weakness in some markets (particularly China), but its services income and comfortable ASP means its business remains sustainable, reading between the lines of recent figures from Gfk, Canalsys and others. Some iPhone statistics I’m not completely convinced by CIRP’s data as it’s based on a survey across just 500 iPhone users, but I have seen the data as quite a good barometer of switching habits in previous years. With that caveat, CIRP makes some interesting claims: Apple is selling iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in around the same quantities. The two new models accounted for 68 percent of U.S. iPhone sales this for the April 1 quarter. Sales of older models accounted for the highest percentage of iPhone sales since 2014. 15 percent upgraded from iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. The research also claim 41 percent upgraded from the two-year-old iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (that contrasts to a 49 percent this time last year -- does this also mean people are hanging on for iPhone 8?) Anecdotal evidence that this may be the case came when Samsung beat Apple in sales. Apple intelligence Pointing out the success of the premium model, CIRP co-founder, Mike Levin said: “Consumers have signaled a willingness to… purchase a more expense, larger model, which also helps Apple’s iPhone average selling price (ASP).” [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] I’ll add that if speculation Apple plans a $1,000 iPhone 8 is borne out, then we may well see a combination of interest, pent-up demand and brand loyalty make a success of the scheme. That interest is shifting to the next iPhone is confirmed by a few more data points. JP Morgan recently warned Apple’s June investor guidance may be “below expectations” as iPhone sales slow in anticipation of the next model, and this market flatness is likely to impact other smartphone vendors as they feel the impact of such consumer focus. If wishes were stars We don’t know for sure if we have any better reason than usual to look forward to the next Apple release. With VR as the killer app, watching the ebb and flow in the sea of rumor, we might have two or three models to look forward to, may see the high-end device delayed for weeks, and may, or may not, see Apple introduce OLED screens, wireless charging, and a radical new design, including a hidden Home button, better cameras, much faster processor and much more. Apple must be hoping the new releases will stimulate interest in its now veteran iPhone products, while manufacturers from the Android assimilations will be hoping the company fails to live up to the hype. Expect a slow smartphone summer while we wait to see the impact of the new device.

April 27, 2017 – According to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, phone companies shipped a total of 347.4 million smartphones worldwide in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17). In light of what might seem like a slowing market, consumers continue to show demand for smartphones and OEM flagship hype seems strong as ever. Worldwide smartphone shipments grew 4.3% in 1Q17, which was slightly higher than IDC’s previous forecast of 3.6% growth. “The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists,” said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. “There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and the strong first quarter results certainly support this argument. In addition to what shipped in 1Q17, big flagship announcements from Huawei with the P10 devices and Samsung with the Galaxy S8 devices show that innovation is still possible. And despite any formal announcements from Apple it is safe to say the industry is highly anticipating what comes from this year’s iPhone announcements.” When breaking down precisely where the first quarter growth came from, IDC continues to see the largest catalysts being a handful of Chinese OEMs. The clear leaders are Huawei, OPPO, and vivo, which have all well outpaced market growth for over a year now. And as these companies gain share in new territories the potential to continue this trend is high. “Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets” said Anthony Scarsella, research manager with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. “Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies’ portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models. Companies have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment.” Smartphone Company Highlights Samsung regained control as the leader in the worldwide smartphone market despite a flat first quarter (0% year-over-year growth). Substantial discounts on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge helped move last year’s flagships as they make way for the new S8 and S8+. Outside of the high end, the product mix continues to shift toward more affordable models. The J-Series and A-Series drove significant volumes in both emerging and developed markets thanks to flagship-like design at more affordable price points. A refreshed A7, A5, and A3 earlier this quarter, along with a recently updated J-Series, and new flagship S8/S8+ should give Samsung a well-balanced portfolio across all regions in the second quarter. An early positive response to the recently launched S8 and S8+ looks promising as it may have finally put Samsung’s Note 7 fiasco to bed. Apple remained essentially flat with shipments reaching 51.6 million units in the first quarter, up slightly from the 51.2 million shipped last year. The strong holiday fourth quarter carried into the month of January as the larger iPhone 7 Plus returned to stock across most channels in numerous regions. Apple introduced a refreshed iPhone SE with more storage capacity (32GB and 128GB) that puts the mid-tier device in line with the rest of the iPhone portfolio. The Cupertino-based giant also refreshed its flagship smartphone by bringing (Product)Red over to the iPhone which paints both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in a new red finish. Finally, rumors of a special edition 10th anniversary iPhone continue to grow as a pending new design, screen size, and performance upgrades all look to be in the works for the fall. Huawei sustained its dominance in China growing nearly 22% as shipments climbed from 28.1 million units last year, to 34.2 million units in the first quarter of 2017. Huawei once again demonstrated its stable position in the premium market with the P and Mate Series, and a strong presence in the affordable sector with its Y Series and Honor brand. Although Huawei announced earlier in the month that the Mate 9 has sold over 5 million units since it launched in November, here in the U.S. the device, as well as the brand, has failed to grab consumer’s attention. This U.S. attention is something they will need if they aspire to displace the two market leaders. The launch of the new P10 flagship and the new P10 Plus at the very end of the quarter presents consumers a valid third option (outside of Apple and Samsung) for the coming quarter thanks to both premium design and similar performance. OPPO’s midrange, camera-focused R9s was a crucial model in China that helped it to see strong shipments in the market. OPPO’s growth has in fact been stronger outside of China with nearly a quarter of shipments from international markets. In the rest of Asia and to a smaller degree in the Middle East and Africa regions, its strong retail presence has helped it to grow further in its business. It has been aggressive in both above-the-line and below-the-line activities in India, and stepped up with its after-sales service efforts in several Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia by increasing its number of service centers. vivo also relied on a key model with the x9 in China that continued to generate a lot of hype around its selfie camera features, targeted at the under-30 crowd. It stepped up with its marketing efforts in India and was as a sponsor of the Indian Premier League 2017, helping to increase vivo’s brand presence in the market, while also increasing the number of exclusive stores in India. In Southeast Asia, it continues to have its own promoters aggressively pushing its phones in the market. In Indonesia, it has also promised consumers single-day phone repairs as a differentiator to the competition.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 27, 2017 7:00 pm Apple Watch Series 3 will have a micro-LED display rather than an OLED screen as its predecessors. We’re months away from the launch of the next Apple Watch, and the rumour mill is going into overdrive. According to a report from Business Korea, Apple Watch Series 3 will have a micro-LED display rather than an OLED screen as its predecessors. The report claims Apple could start manufacturing a new display technology called micro-LED. For those who’re familiar, micro-LED uses microscale LEDs to deliver a better image quality and doesn’t cause too much of a battery drain. The micro-LED technology could be used to replace OLED screens that would come in the next-generation Apple Watch and iPhone models. It’s being said that Apple has been working with LuxVue for the past two years on producing its own micro-LED tech, the company it acquired in 2014. Also read: Apple Watch Series 3 to launch in the second-half of 2017: Report Micro-LED displays should be seen as an alternative to OLED screens. The big news is that if Apple fully embrace micro-LED screens, both Samsung and LG would lose around $1 billion a year. Developing its own display technology tech would allow the Apple to become less dependent on Samsung and LG. Business Korea reports that Apple will actually begin mass production of micro-LED for the next-generation Apple Watch in Taiwan at the end of the year. The company would replace the OLED displays used in the first and second-generation models, with micro-LED displays. As a result, LG – the exclusive provider of OLED screens for the Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2- is expected to take a hit over $200 million.   For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now First Published on: April 27, 2017 6:57 pm © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple No Comments.

(Glenn CHAPMAN / AFP) AFP Published Thursday, April 27, 2017 9:15AM EDT Intelligent machines of the future will help restore memory, mind your children, fetch your coffee and even care for aging parents. It will all be part of a brave new world of the not-so-distant future, in which innovative smart machines, rather than being the undoing of people -- as some technophobes have long feared -- actually enhance humans. Many expert say technology will allow people to take on tasks they might only have dreamed of in the past. "Super-intelligence should give us super-human abilities," said Tom Gruber, head of the team responsible for Apple's Siri digital assistant, during an on-stage talk at the prestigious TED Conference. Smarter machines, smarter humans "As machines get smarter, so do we," Gruber said. "Artificial intelligence can enable partnerships where each human on the team is doing what they do best," he told the popular technology conference. Gruber, a co-creator of Siri and artificial intelligence research at Apple, told of being drawn to the field three decades ago by the potential for technology to meet people's needs. "I am happy to see that the idea of an intelligent personal assistant is mainstream," he said. Now he has taken his innovative approach to smart machines, and is turning the thinking about the technology on its head. "Instead of asking how smart we can make our machines, let's ask how smart our machines can make us," Gruber said. Already smart technology is taking hold, with popular digital assistants like Apple's Siri, created Gruber. South Korean giant Samsung created Bixby to break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. Remembering everything Gruber envisions artificial intelligence -- AI -- getting even more personal, perhaps augmenting human memory. "Human memory is famously flawed -- like, where did the 1960s go and can I go there too?" Gruber quipped. He spoke of a future in which artificial intelligence remembers everyone met during a lifetime and details of everything someone read, heard, said or did. "From the tiniest clue it could help you retrieve anything you've seen or heard before," he said. "I believe AI will make personal memory enhancement a reality; I think it's inevitable." Such memories would need to be private, with people choosing what to keep, and be kept absolutely secure, he maintained. Surefooted robots Boston Dynamics robotics company founder Marc Raibert was at TED with a four-legged SpotMini robot nimble enough to frolic amid the conference crowd. He smiled but would not comment when asked by AFP about the potential to imbue program the gadget with the kind of artificial intelligence described by fellow speakers. Raibert did, however, note that the robots are designed to be compatible with new "user interfaces." Current virtual assistants have been described as a step into an era of controlling computers by speaking instead of typing or tapping screens. "I think it won't be too long before we're using robots to take care of our parents, or help our children take care of us," Raibert said from the TED Talk. The 'gorilla problem' Not everyone at TED embraced the idea of a future in which machines are smarter and more capable than humans, however. Stuart Russell, a University of California at Berkeley computer sciences professor, referred to the situation as the "gorilla problem" in that when smarter humans came along it boded ill for evolutionary ancestors. "This queasy feeling that making something smarter than your own species is not a good idea," said Russell, co-author of the book Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. As an AI researcher he supported research in the technology. However, he urged programming machines with robotic laws of behavior, in a shrewed spin on work of science fiction author Isaac Asimov. He gave the example of a robot being told to simply fetch coffee. A machine not constrained by proper principles might decide that accomplishing the task required it to defend against being shut down and remove all obstacles from its path by whatever means necessary. Russell counseled robot principles including altruism, humility, and making a priority of human values. "You are probably better off with a machine that is like this," Russell said. "It is a first step in human compatibility with AI."

Sean "Diddy" Combs (aka Puff Daddy) is nothing if not a shrewd and determined business man. This is illustrated repeatedly in his powerful new documentary Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story which chronicles Combs' and his record label's precipitous rise in the mid-90s to the top of the music business, as well as the trials and tribulations he faced in putting together last year's 20th anniversary Bad Boy reunion shows in two weeks time and with artists who hadn't performed in years. But the rap mogul's acumen is also on full display in how he produced the new documentary. This can be seen in his decision to partner with two of most powerful music business entities on the planet to produce and distribute his film: Live Nation and Apple Music, respectively. Today, just as the film tonight makes is premiere at the TriBeCa Film Festival (with performances by Combs, Mase, Lil Kim, Faith Evans among others), it was announced that Apple Music will have the exclusive rights to Can't Stop, Won't Stop which it will begin being shown to subscribers starting on June 25. "I went to the [Bad Boy Reuion] concert and thought it was incredible," Jimmy Iovine, Apple Music chairman and CEO, tells Billboard. "I think Puff and Bad Boy's story is incredible and one that a lot of people can relate to in any genre or in any business. His story is powerful. He really overcame a lot to get to where he's at today and the documentary shows that." While exact terms of the deal weren't disclosed, Apple Music will have exclusive rights to the doc for at least the next year. The music platform has already announced its plan to create exclusive video content for its users. This includes a deal with James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” franchise, Dr. Dre’s “Vital Signs, ” a semi-autobiographical scripted series as well as “Planet of the Apps,” a show with the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk, Jessica Alba, and will.iam offering mentorship to app developers. "We have a bunch of other stuff that we can't talk about yet because the deals aren't' done," Iovine says, "but we're starting to turn it up." The former head of Interscope and Beats says that most of the content will be things "that people are involved in with pop culture and that we think will be great for our audience." There's little doubt now in how compelling the new Diddy doc. is, especially seeing the rap mogul  in what seems a more revealing and unvarnished light than ever before. "He's so vulnerable and human in this," says Live Nation Productions head Heather Parry who also produced the recent Eagles of Death Metal documentary that HBO optioned. "The access we got was incredible," she says. "We were in the shower with him, we see him getting a B12 shot in his underwear and then how upset he is with how the first night of the show went. He's vulnerable but you see how much he loves and cares for his Bad Boy family." And a sometimes fractious family that is. Bringing together the warring widows of Lil Kim and Faith Evans is no easy feat but Diddy seems to deftly manage the situation as he might a disruption in the Ciroc supply chain. Same goes for a saved Mase and the support and encouragement he gives the reunion show's creative director and his longtime associate who is under an inordinate amount of pressure to produce the Bad Boy shows with little time. The documentary itself seemed to mirror a similar time constraint. "[Combs] comes in to Live Nation to talk about the tour and and he was like it would be really great to document it," Parry recalls. "When we finally decided to do it, we had about three weeks to get our act together and find a director and we had to do that quickly. I have a great boss in Michael Rapino [Live Nation CEO] who graciously funded it so we could get started." Diddy had wanted to enlist Mark Romanek to direct but he was unable. But, as with many things about this project, serendipity seemed to have a hand in it. "I went to a friend's a book release, which was a photo book and there was Mark Romanek," Parry recalls. I said with all due respect, 'Who is you that is available right now?' And Mark, who is so sweet and kind and generous, said, 'I actually have a guy for you.' The next day I met Daniel Kaufman who became our director. Two days later I gave a great treatment to Puff and he was hired and we were on our ways to Barclays." The film, too, has its chance moments. Barclays just happened to have a cancelation the night after the originally scheduled Bad Boy Reunion show that also happened to fall on Biggie's birthday, which is when all the magic seemed to coalesce. The film featues a number of legendary music exes in addition to Iovine. Hearing Uptown Records' Andre Harrell (who's also one of the film's producers) recall how his then-intern Sean Combs ran 10 blocks in a flash when he asked him to do an errand is incredibly revealing. As is hearing Arista's Clive Davis tell how Diddy charmed him at a time when rap had yet to be universally accepted.   The film also contains a number or rare images and video. "We found a treasure trove in the Bad Boy offices" says Parry. "We have the young Puff on camera, a young Kim and Faith and stuff from Biggie some of which has been seen before." Of course the death of Notorious B.I.G. (aka Christopher Wallace) hangs over the entire film and shaped the Bad Boy family like nothing else. There's an incredibly poignant scene where Diddy calls Biggie's mom Violetta just to check in, like he would his own mother. “I knew this was a story that should be shared with the world," Diddy said in a statement "Heather Parry and Live Nation Productions, and Director Daniel Kaufman, helped create this very special documentary.  Now I'm blessed to also be working with Apple to showcase the film and share Bad Boy's history and impact with fans. The support Live Nation, Apple and everyone on the team has given to this project is a true testament to the Bad Boy legacy." Spoken like the music business genius he is.

While the administration has not yet determined a rate at which those funds could be repatriated, Trump’s proposal unveiled Wednesday promises a “one-time tax on trillions of dollars held overseas.” U.S. companies had about $1.3 trillion in cash held in overseas accounts at the end of 2016, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Read: How Apple could bring overseas cash home to help fix America’s crumbling infrastructure Also: Trump paid $31 million in alternative minimum tax in 2005 — and now he plans to repeal it The following are the five companies with the biggest sums sitting overseas: Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.08% has the most cash overseas of any U.S. company at about $230 billion, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has said he would be willing to bring that money home if it were not subject to the current U.S. corporate tax rate of about 35%. The company has repeatedly borrowed in the capital markets to fund multibillion-dollar returns to shareholders. With interest rates at historically low levels, the company deemed it preferable to add debt to its balance sheet rather than incur a large tax bill. Overseas cash held by Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Oracle. Source: Moody’s Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.65% has the second-biggest cash pile at $113 billion, according to Moody’s. Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, +1.05% owns the third spot with $62 billion in overseas cash. Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.29% GOOGL, +0.26% takes fourth place with $49 billion. Oracle Corp.

Despite upgraded features like each new flagship iPhone release, the legacy models accounted for almost a third of iPhones sold in the quarter, the highest percentage since Apple started releasing two new phones each fall in 2014. There was, however, some good news that helped protect the Average Selling Price (ASP) … NordVPN More buyers opted for the more expensive Plus model. “Sales of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were about equal, which is good news for Apple,” added Mike Levin, CIRP Partner and Co-Founder. “The large-format Plus models accounted for 41% of total sales, a steady increase since the launch of the original Plus model in 2015. Consumers have signaled a willingness to not only purchase a more expense, larger model, which also helps Apple’s iPhone ASP.” Digging deeper, it seems that unwillingness to spend the extra money on the latest generation iPhone was strongest among those switching from Android handsets. “We see very strong iPhone loyalty, and conversely continued lower switching from Android phones,” added Lowitz. “With only 10% of 7 and 7 Plus buyers switching from an Android phone, now 3-6 months after the launch of those models in September 2016, we see how the premiere iPhone models sell mostly to the installed base of iPhone owners. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus models have a higher percentage of Android switchers, and the entry level iPhone SE also brings in first-time smartphone buyers.” This is likely also driven by Apple loyalists having greater awareness of Apple’s upgrade cycles, and being less willing to lay out the cash on the latest model halfway toward a new one. CIRP’s estimate of the split between iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales echoes that of a Cowen & Co estimate back in January, with just a 1% difference between the two companies. This year, flagship buyers are expected to be offered the best of both worlds, as a near-bezel-free iPhone 8 design is expected to squeeze the larger screen size into the smaller form-factor.

As long as you cut the iMessage cord, the process of switching over is easier than you think. Here’s how to make the transfer yourself and avoid waiting in a store. Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 27 April, 2017 21:34 - - - - print email Comments If the Infinity Displays on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ have you itching to jump off the iOS bandwagon, you aren't alone. I just made the switch from an iPhone 6 to the Galaxy S8 and it turns out it's easier than ever to switch from iOS to Android. But here are a few things you need to know before you start using your Galaxy S8. Disable iMessage Before you do anything, you need to deregister your phone number from iMessage. This is the most important step if you're switching from iOS to Android. If you forget to disable or deregister your number from Apple's servers, every other iPhone will still think you have an iPhone. When your friends with iOS send an iMessage, you'll never see it. Head into your iMessage settings on every iOS or MacOS device you own -- it will need to be disabled on every Apple device registered to your iCloud account. On a Mac, head into Messages -> settings. Remove your phone number and uncheck "enable this account." To disable iMessage on your iPad, head into settings -> messages and toggle the switch off next to "iMessage." To disable iMessage on your iPhone, head into settings -> messages and remove your phone number from the Send & Receive field. Finally, at the top of the iMessage settings, toggle the switch from on to off. If you find you're still missing messages from other iOS users on your Android device, you can deregister your phone number through Apple's website.

Navigate to the Samsung Smart Switch application to get started. It comes pre-loaded on every Galaxy S8 device. If you have an older Galaxy device that didn't come preloaded with the Smart Switch app, you can download the app in the Samsung App Store. Smart Switch can run in the background while you set up your phone. after you select the data you want to port over, it will give you an estimated time until it's finished. USB cable sync The easiest way to copy your iPhone data to your Galaxy S8 is using a USB cable. The Galaxy S8 ships with a USB Type A to C adapter, so you can use your iPhone cable to transfer data directly to the S8. Plug the Lightning cable into your iPhone and, using the USB Type-C converter, plug the other end into your Galaxy S8. A notice will pop up on your iPhone asking if you "trust" the device -- select "trust" to continue. If you backup your iPhone in iTunes with encryption, you'll need to turn it off to complete the data transfer. To do this, plug your iPhone into your notebook or wherever keep your iTunes backups. Turn off encryption and wait for a new iPhone backup to finish. Once it's done, plug the iPhone back into the Galaxy S8. When prompted in the Smart Switch app, choose USB as your data transfer method. Depending on how much data you have on your iPhone, the process can take up to 15 minutes. My 64GB iPhone 6 was nearly full and the process took about 10 minutes. After the S8 finishes searching your iPhone for data, you can choose to transfer apps, messages, documents, memos, calendars, contacts, videos, pictures, paid music, alarm settings, bookmarks, call logs and Wi-Fi Profiles. The app will let you know once it's safe to disconnect your USB cord and it will finish the process in the background. With some apps, you might find they aren't available in Android format, although this is far less of a problem now than in the past. Most apps are on both platforms now, but you may run into a few that won't cross the OS divide. [ Related story: Samsung targets the enterprise with Galaxy S8 and S8+ ] iCloud Sync Smart Switch supports iCloud backups with iOS 9 or later, which is an easy choice if you regularly back your iPhone up to iCloud or can't find a USB cable. You can transfer all the same data as in the previous method, including contacts, calendars, photos and videos. Open the Samsung Smart Switch app and choose "Wireless" when prompted. Choose iOS from the menu that pops up, enter your Apple ID and iCloud password used on the device you're transferring data from. Select which content you want to transfer over. Options include apps, messages, documents, memos, calendars, contacts, videos, pictures, paid music, alarm settings, bookmarks, call logs and Wi-Fi Profiles. Choose "start" to begin the process and wait until it finishes transferring data completely before using either device. Just as in the last method, the length of the process will depend on how much data you have backed up. Also, some apps might not have an Android counterpart, but again, you won't find this to be an issue in most cases. Now that your data is ported over, you can go about using your new Samsung Galaxy S8. Related Videos The Future State of the CIO - A Case of ‘Career Is Over’ or ‘Career Is Opportunity’?
