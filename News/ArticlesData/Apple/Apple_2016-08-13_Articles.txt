(NASDAQ:AAPL) is less than a month away from releasing its iPhone 7 which has led to numerous rumors regarding the upcoming smartphone device. One of the most talked about rumored feature on the upcoming iPhone 7 is the introduction of a lightening connector which will replace the standard 3.5mm headphone jack found on every previous iPhone model ever released. This rumored change has divided opinion but majority of the users cannot grasp the idea of Apple replacing the standard 3.5mm headphone jack with a lightening connector, especially considering the fact that majority of headphones come with a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. However, there just might be a method to Apple’s madness of incorporating a lightening port in its next generation iPhone model. There is no denying the fact that Apple is going to face a lot of backlash from users if the tech giant does indeed introduce a lightening port in place of the standard 3.5mm headphone jack on its upcoming iPhone 7. However, there is one popular theory that Apple actually would prefer a backlash now, so that users get accustomed to the lightening connectors in time for the launch of the iPhone 8. As we have already reported that Apple will bring huge changes to its 2017 iPhone model in order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone model. If Apple diverts the hate and abuse, caused by the introduction of lightening connectors, towards the iPhone 7 then users will be accustomed and better prepared for the change on the iPhone 8. So, Apple might be protecting and prioritizing the sales of its iPhone 8 over the iPhone 7 which is not expected to bring revolutionary changes for users anyways. Also, the age of the 3.5mm headphone jacks could soon officially come to an end as the sound produced on headphones through lightening connectors is superior to the one on a standard 3.5mm headphone port. Whether we like it or not, Apple is all set to replace the standard 3.5mm headphone jack with lightening connector on its upcoming iPhone 7 model. Surely, Apple will aim to justify the big shift in how it intends its users to use their headphones. September is only a few weeks away, so watch the space!

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH iPad mini 5 release date coming soon as Apple sells refurbished iPad mini 4? Hercules Reyes Aug 16, 2016 12:35 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Apple)The iPad mini 4's successor is long overdue. Could the rumors regarding the imminent arrival of the much-awaited iPad mini 5 tablet be true after all? In the past several weeks, the rumor mill had been suggesting that the iPad mini 5 would be released sometime this fall, with some reports claiming that the device might even launch alongside the iPhone 7 series. So far, Apple has not made any hint that an actual iPad mini 5 device would be coming, despite the fact that the iPad mini 4 had been released in the market long enough for it to be worthy of a successor. However, in the past few days, fans and users have seen what could be an indication that the long rumored device may be arriving sooner than what the rumors have been suggesting. Apple recently put refurbished models of the iPad mini 4 up for sale on its online store. Apple's Certified Refurbished Store is part of the Cupertino-based company's online store that caters to users who seek out Apple devices but would want to have them at a lower price than the regular retail value in the market. The devices featured on the store have been refurbished officially by Apple. While this does not serve as concrete proof that the iPad mini 5 would be released sooner than later, fans have still taken the move as a strong indicator of such. On a related note, rumors have it that if and when the iPad mini 5 releases, the device may not be called as such anymore. With the alleged focus of Apple on the "Pro" branding for its tablet devices, the new iPad mini 5 may end up as being called the iPad Pro mini instead. The iPad mini 5 or the iPad Pro mini — whatever it may end up being called as — is expected to be thinner than its predecessor and is said to sport 3D Touch technology. It is also expected to have the 32 GB variant as the base model instead of the usual 16 GB. Like Us on Facebook Hot News 'Destiny 2' may be set on Mars, featuring new subclasses of Guardians...

August 15, 20164:17pm Video Image iPhone 7 latest leaks1:04 The latest of the iPhone 7 rumoured leaks May 19th 2016 6 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Is it worth waiting an extra year for the iPhone 8. Brooke CrothersFox News Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend WHILE the upcoming iPhone 7 is expected to have some welcome improvements, the iPhone that Apple is planning for 2017 could be really different. First, let’s review what’s expected for the iPhone 7. Two recent reports from Bloomberg lay out a lot of the details. It’s expected to debut at an Apple event less than a month from now on September 7, but be physically similar to the iPhone 6/6s, a design first introduced in September of 2014. That means Apple will break from its past practice of doing a physical makeover every two years. The iPhone 7’s improvements and changes are expected to include a dual-camera system (possibly similar to Huawei’s P9 smartphone) on one model, a redesigned pressure-sensitive home button, and no headphone jack. Headphones would be connected via the charging port or Bluetooth. Wait for the iPhone 8? The iPhone 8 should be the device that moves Apple into the future. It may not be a coincidence that 2017 will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. So, it’s conceivable that Apple is waiting for that date to bring out an overhauled iPhone. So far, speculation points to a 2017 iPhone that could be based on a glass body, according to a report this week from Nikkei, Japan’s largest business newspaper. “Apple is expected to redesign the iPhone, including giving it a glass chassis,” Nikkei reported. That glass casing could be made by Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn, Nikkei said, citing a source with knowledge of Apple component suppliers in Taiwan. “Foxconn has been trying [to develop a] glass chassis since last year,” Nikkei quoted the source as saying. Old iPhone or iPad? Revive Them Now2:48 What if you could give that old smartphone or tablet a second life? WSJ's Geoffrey A. Fowler shows how to save money--and spare landfills--by putting them to work as home security systems, picture frames, second monitors and more. August 11th 2016 3 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ But probably the most stunning part of the redesign would be the rumoured move from the current LCD (liquid crystal) display to an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, which is a rumour repeated by Nikkei. That would theoretically enable Apple to revamp the iPhone’s physical look-and-feel and — as one possibility — offer a curved display with higher resolution and more vibrant colours. A major redesign along those lines is practically necessary for Apple because Samsung already offers the highly-praised Galaxy S7 Edge with an OLED display that’s curved along the two lengthwise edges of the phone. That gives Samsung a clear technological advantage over Apple. “Right now, the Galaxy Note 7 is far more advanced than what Apple offers and, my bet, more advanced than what the iPhone 7 will offer,” Todd Haselton, a writer for tech media site TechoBuffalo, told Foxnews.com in an email. “Several rumours have suggested Apple is moving toward an OLED display next year, which will be a good first step [toward closing the gap],” he added. Apple could also combine hardware improvements with new software and services, Rushabh Doshi, an analyst with market researcher Canalys, told FoxNews.com. “We expect Apple to focus strongly on service innovation. Artificial Intelligence would take centre stage in the coming years as the smart phone becomes a true ‘assistant’ to the user,” Doshi said. “[The] recent acquisition of Turi continues to underline the importance of AI for Apple,” Doshi said.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Home construction across the Victor Valley on the rise Sunday Aug 14, 2016 at 4:21 PM Aug 14, 2016 at 4:30 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — The Great Recession brought home building in the High Desert to a grinding halt, but eight years later things are finally starting to look up. Industry and community leaders said the improved economy, low interest rates, the affordability of land and the completion of road work on Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass has resulted in a rise in home construction across the Victor Valley. In Apple Valley, residential permits are projected to hit a nine-year high during the current fiscal year, with 117 permits pulled. This figure has town officials and developers smiling after the town issued only 62 permits in fiscal year 2007-08, and a dismal 32 four years ago. As the sound of hammers and saws echo through Apple Valley, the valuation of new home starts from January to June equals $9.1 million, with June alone coming in at nearly $2.5 million, according to a report shared by Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin. Hesperia spokeswoman Rachel Molina said the city issued 74 permits from January through July of this year, with 114 pulled during the last fiscal year. Hesperia Councilman Russ Blewett said the city is “moving in the right direction” after experiencing a “building drought several years ago.” Blewett said Hesperia issued a total of 144 permits from fiscal year 2013 to the end of fiscal year 2015, “a number that reflects how bad things were.” Blewett said Hesperia saw a housing boom after it lowered development impact fees in 2014 after issuing zero permits during fiscal year 2011-12 and only two the following year. Some developers said co-owner Alan Colantuono of Sorrento Homes opened the floodgates for tract development when he pushed the City Council to lower its development impact fees for unrecorded subdivisions/tracts after the fees were lowered for single-residential home projects. Since Colatuono’s push, Sorrento Homes has constructed and sold over 50 homes in Hesperia. “If you drive through Hesperia, you’ll see a tremendous amount of homes going up,” Blewett said. “Easy freeway access and affordable prices are drawing people to Hesperia.” In a report of calendar year figures provided by Victorville spokeswoman Sue Jones, the city issued 202 permit for the first seven months of 2016, compared to last year’s 244 permits. Jones said a total of 408 permits were pulled between 2011 and 2015, from KB Homes, Evergreen Homes, Watermarke Homes and Legacy Homes — big players in the development game. Jerry and Melissa McCarthy said they’re eyeing a piece of property in the northwest portion of Victorville, where they’re looking to build a 2,500-square-foot home. “We live in the Riverside area and we’re thinking of relocating to a much quieter place in Southern California,” said Jerry McCarthy, 66, a retired businessman. “We saved quite a bit so we’re in a good position to build.” In Adelanto, the city issued 486 permits from January through July of this year, with 920 permits issued for fiscal year 2015-16. Adelanto issued a total of 2,713 permits over the last five fiscal years. Oscar Wei, senior economist with the California Association of Realtors, said the number of single-family detached homes sold in February increased 4.5 percent when compared to the same time last year. He added that sales have been improving on a year-over-year basis for every month since March 2015. “The year 2015 was also the first year since 2009 that the market experienced a year-over-year gain in sales,” said Wie, in a recent Bradco Companies report. “With the economy expected to improve in the upcoming year, sales in the regional housing market should continue to grow with a mid-single digit in 2016.” Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

Aug 15 2016 at 9:08 AM Updated Aug 15 2016 at 1:49 PM Save article Print Who Apple's Tim Cook turns to for advice Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit Don't Play Replay Replay Video Icon Player help icon No more iPhone headphone jack? by Jena McGregor On a sleek white coffee table in Apple CEO Tim Cook's fourth-floor office in late July, beneath framed posters of Robert F. Kennedy, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr and Jackie Robinson, a rose gold iPhone 6s sits in its original box. Earlier that morning, Cook had stood in front of employees at Apple headquarters and held up the phone, which a staffer had hand-delivered from a store in Beijing to commemorate a notable occasion: Apple had sold its billionth iPhone. That celebratory milestone – Cook laughs when asked by a reporter if he'll stop counting, as McDonald's did with its hamburgers – aptly coincides with another big moment for the technology giant's chief executive. A few weeks later, Cook would mark the fifth anniversary of what has been the most closely watched transition of power in corporate history: On August 24, 2011, just six weeks before his death, Apple's iconic founder, Steve Jobs, permanently handed his chief operating officer the reins. Tim Cook with WWDC 2016 Scholarship program winners during the Apple World Wide Developers Conference in June. David Paul Morris "It's been a blur in a lot of ways," says Cook, who had filled in for Jobs during medical leaves. "It feels like it was yesterday in some respects."

View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements It is fitting that these two milestones arrive so close together. That's because the iPhone, launched by Jobs, has been the biggest driver of Apple's massive growth during Cook's tenure. It led the company to soaring valuations and accounted for nearly two-thirds of Apple's revenue in the past year. Just the tally on iPhone sales, almost $US141 billion ($184.2 billion) over the past four quarters, is more than the annual sales figures of Cisco, Disney and Nike – combined. But the iPhone has also been a source of recent disappointment, too. In its most recent quarter, iPhone sales fell 23 per cent from a year ago, contributing to a 14.6 per cent drop in overall revenue. It was Apple's second straight quarterly drop in sales after 13 years of growth. Just after Apple disclosed those results, Cook sat down with The Washington Post to discuss his first five years in one of Corporate America's most glaring spotlights. In two sprawling and highly self-reflective interviews – one in his office and another by phone just before he left for vacation in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks – Cook described why the visibility of the job has been "shocking", how he's learned to deal with the scrutiny, and who he's turned to for advice at pivotal moments (Warren Buffett, on his decision to return cash to shareholders, and Anderson Cooper about publicly disclosing he is gay). He spoke in candid terms about the mistakes he's made on the way, such as his first hire to run Apple's retail stores ("that was clearly a screw-up"). He fiercely defended Apple's tax policies. He touched on succession planning and the importance of grooming internal candidates. He was at his most spirited when talking about privacy and the long-term future of Apple and the iPhone – calling Apple's big presence in the smartphone industry "a privilege, not a problem" – and quieted considerably when talking about Jobs's memory. "I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point," he said, "but I had convinced myself that he would bounce." Cook, 55, chooses his words carefully, taking long pauses and speaking with a slight Alabama drawl. Though he has favourite phrases – many things are "deep," and Apple's mission is always its "North Star" – he eschews the jargon many CEOs use. And while he's quick to trumpet Apple, he is also unassuming, quickly noting, after saying his job can be "lonely", that "I'm not looking for any sympathy. CEOs don't need any sympathy." That reflects how Cook's imprint on Apple has often been described – making it more systematic, more transparent, more team-oriented, more humble. He has engaged on social issues more than most CEOs, writing op-eds on legislation that limits gay rights and making the extraordinary decision this year to oppose the FBI's request to unlock the San Bernardino killer's phone. As CEO, he gets high marks for managing the company's growth, keeping margins high and expanding further into markets such as China (Apple had four retail stores in China five years ago. Today it has 41.) He has pushed into the enterprise market, grown Apple's product lineup and positioned Apple to make more money off the devices it's already sold: Its services business, which includes things like iTunes, iCloud and a mobile payments service, is projected to be the size of a Fortune 100 business next year – all on its own. Apple remains the most valuable and most profitable company in the S&P 500 index. Yet as the company deals with declining sales in its major device categories and in markets like China, critics and some investors have fretted about Apple's innovation mojo under Cook. The first all-new device during his tenure, the Apple Watch, is not yet a mega hit. The iPhone juggernaut faces a saturated smartphone market, growing competition from low-cost upstarts in China and longer upgrade windows from consumers. Rumoured big concepts behind the curtain – such as a reported car project – appear to be years away. Some analysts say such impatience is shortsighted, and that the long-term potential for things like services, augmented reality and even a possible car could ultimately transform the way Cook's tenure is viewed. "Investors are so finicky that they lose track of the big picture," says Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray who covers Apple. "I think the wisdom and legacy of Tim Cook is going to be determined by what happens in the next five years." In the conversation below, Cook looks back as well as ahead at those next five years – hinting at augmented reality but refusing to comment about a car project, saying Apple believes people love a surprise. It has been edited for length and clarity. Your first day in this job, you sent a memo to employees that said, "I want you to be confident that Apple is not going to change." Five years later, it has to have changed. What qualities of Apple are immutable, in your view? The DNA of the company is really what I was talking about there. The North Star has always been the same, which for us, is about making insanely great products that really change the world in some way – enrich people's lives. And so our reason for being hasn't changed. Other things change. But that's the thread that ties everyone together. And what has changed? The obvious things are we have more employees in the company. The company is four times larger [by revenue since 2010]. We've broadened the iPhone lineup. That was a really key decision, and I think a good one. We've gone into the Apple Watch business, which has gotten us into wellness and in health. We keep pulling that string to see where that takes us. Lots of core technology work has been done. Are there ways the culture has evolved? We have stepped up our social responsibility. We have talked about things and been more transparent about what we're doing – not on products: We try to be as secretive as we've always been on products, although it's increasingly difficult to do that. The real test is: Are you creating a ripple that helps other people as well? An example of that is the environmental work. We've had environmental work going on at Apple for decades, but we didn't talk about it, and we didn't set aspirational kind of objectives. We used the same philosophy we do with our products, which is you unveil them when you've finished. But we stepped back and re-evaluated that and said, "You know, if we wait until you do that, we're not helping anyone else get there, too." You've said you don't want to be a traditional CEO. What do you mean by that? I think of a traditional CEO as being divorced from customers. A lot of consumer company CEOs – they're not really interacting with consumers. I also think that the traditional CEO believes his or her job is the profit and loss, is the revenue statement, the income and expense, the balance sheet. Those are important, but I don't think they're all that's important. There's an incredible responsibility to the employees of the company, to the communities and the countries that the company operates in, to people who assemble its products, to developers, to the whole ecosystem of the company. And so I have a maybe non-traditional view there. I get criticised for it some, I recognise. If you care about long-term shareholder return, all of these other things are really critical. You've got the billionth iPhone on the table here. One thing that has changed is that in 2011 about 44 per cent of the company's sales came from iPhone. Now it's close to two-thirds. How can Apple move forward when so much of its business is tied up in the iPhone and an industry that's cooling off? This is actually a privilege, not a problem. Think about this: What other products do you know where the ratio of people to the product, for a consumer electronics product, will be one-to-one over the long haul? I don't think there is another one. Meaning? The global sales of PCs each year are about 275 million right now. That number's been declining. The global market for smartphones is 1.4 billion. Over time, I'm convinced every person in the world will have a smartphone. That may take a while, and they won't all have iPhones. But it is the greatest market on earth from a consumer electronics point of view. Think about it: Families have a TV. Some families are fortunate enough to have multiple TVs. But if you looked at all the TVs in the world, it's not one-to-one, and it's not going to be one-to-one. Look at the core technologies that make up the smartphone today and look at the ones that will be dominant in smartphones of the future – like AI. AI will make this product even more essential to you. It will become even a better assistant than it is today. So where you probably aren't leaving home without it today – you're really going to be connected to it in the future. That level of performance is going to skyrocket. And there is nothing that's going to replace it in the short term or in the intermediate term either. I realise that the people who are focused on this 90-day clock say, "Oh, my God, the smartphone industry only grew by 1 per cent or decreased by 6 per cent." You know, the global economy's not that great right now. But if you're in it for the long haul, this is the best market on earth. I see enormous opportunity [in India]. There are still a fair number of people in this country who don't have smartphones. They're using flip phones or a feature phone. There are a lot of people switching from Android to iOS, and that's huge for us because they have a lot more market share than we do, from a unit point of view. Our goal has never been to make the most. It's always been to make the best. So to those who ask where's the next big, world-changing category for Apple – it's sitting on this $US231.5 billion pile of cash – are you saying there's nothing like the smartphone? Technology is one of these industries where every week there's a new shiny object that people are skating to. Netbooks – look back, everybody was writing like netbooks were this unbelievable thing, everyone was asking us, "Why aren't you making one?" Same thing with the PDA. Remember what happened with the PDA? Up and down. It was like the hula hoop. Technology is full of those. I'm not saying we're not going to do anything else. I'm saying this is still an unbelievable product category to be in, and not just for this quarter, year or for years. So I would not want anybody to think this, oh, this "better days are behind us" thing. Some analysts have said that. And it doesn't bother me. Because honestly, they were saying that about Apple in 2001. They were saying it in 2005. They were saying it in 2007 – 'this stupid iPhone, whoever dreamed up this thing?' Then they were saying that we peaked in 2010, then it was 2011. We got to $US60 billion [in revenue], and they said you can't grow anymore from this. Well, last year we were $US230 billion. And, yes, we're coming down some this year. Every year isn't an up, you know. I've heard all of it before. And I don't subscribe to it because it's traditional thinking in a lot of ways: You can't get large because you are large. How do you make the case that Apple is still a long-term growth company? In today's products we have services [iCloud, App Store, Apple Pay and the like], which over the last 12 months grew about $US4 billion to over $US23 billion [in sales]. Next year we've said it's going to be a Fortune 100 company in size. What else? IPad. The iPad Pro. What we saw in this past quarter is that about half of the people who are buying one are using it at work. We have an enormous opportunity in enterprise. Last year we did $US25 billion or so in it around the world. We're collaborating much better with key partners because it's important, if you're making a decision to use our products or anybody's products in the enterprise, that they work well together. And so we're working with Cisco because they're incredible with the network infrastructure. We're working with IBM, who's written a number of apps. We're working with SAP because they own the back of the house, in terms of the processing. They own three-quarters of the world's transactions, in terms of it running on their products. And then, of course, the markets. We have done fairly well in China. India is fast growing, but our base there is smaller. One of the big things that has held India back is the cellular infrastructure. They have two major carriers putting in a lot of investment to bring 4G. You can imagine if you didn't have 4G today. You can't enjoy video on a 3G. Periodically you can, but not consistently. This is a game changer. In India, there's no fixed line to home. So they're a mobile society. China's very much like that as well. And so I look at it and say: markets? Enterprise – huge. Geographies? India is one, but there are others. Products? We purposely don't talk about that one. But you can imagine. Step back and say what's Apple so great at? Apple is the only company that can take hardware, software and services and integrate those into an experience that's an "aha" for the customer. You can take that and apply to markets that we're not in today. There's not a limitation that we can only do that in the smartphone area or in the tablet or Mac or watch area. Do you feel any frustration with investor impatience? We welcome all investors, regardless of whether their horizon is short or long. But we try to be very clear that we are making our decisions based on long term. I think for investors that are focused on the long term, if you look at how we've done in the past five years, our total shareholder return is over 100 per cent. That's a pretty good number. And I think most people that have been in the stock for that period of time are probably pretty happy. You succeeded one of the icons of American business. What does it feel like to step into those shoes? To me, Steve's not replaceable. By anyone. [Voice softens] He was an original of a species. I never viewed that was my role. I think it would have been a treacherous thing if I would have tried to do it. When I first took the job as CEO, I actually thought that Steve would be here for a long time. Because he was going to be chairman, work a bit less after he came back up the health curve. So I went into it with one thought, and then weeks later – six weeks later, whatever – Quickly. It was very quickly. [The day he died] was sort of the worst day ever. I just – I had really convinced myself. I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point, but I had convinced myself that he would bounce, because he always did. What did you think you knew about leading Apple that turned out to be wrong? There's nothing like sitting in the chair, so to speak. I was reminded that customers have a really deep love for the company. I started just getting an avalanche of customer mail. I don't mean complaints. Email. Positive. Negative. Points of view. Not the 'hey, this broke, I'm mad.' Largely not that kind of stuff. Things much deeper than that. Moved by how they were treated in a store. Lots of people have written me about FaceTime and how they could be near their mother's or father's bedside before they died only because of it. But what about in terms of running the company? I learned that the scrutiny was much higher than I thought. Media interest and scrutiny – social networking was taking off at that time – and so a lot of the "love," so to speak, and interest from customers, I think transfers to media interest as well. And so there's a lot of visibility on the company. We can do very few things without it being reported somewhere. You and Alan Greenspan or Janet Yellen would probably have a lot to talk about. It seems like every word you say is scrutinised. How do you get used to that? You don't. You're both praised and criticised, and the extremes are wide – very wide. And that can happen all in a day. You build up – my skin got materially thicker after August 2011. And I don't mean in a bad way. I don't mean that I'm callous and don't care. I think I'm a bit better today about compartmentalising things and not taking everything so personally. That was just downright shocking to me, honestly. I thought the visibility went with Steve, not the company. And so I thought with a different CEO, with me, that would instantly change. It didn't. You've been more outspoken on social issues than any other CEO of a company your size. Do you think companies have a responsibility to publicly take on such issues as civil rights and climate change? I think everybody has to make their own decision about it. Maybe there are compelling reasons why some people want to be silent. I think for us, though – for a company that's all about empowering people through our products, and being a collection of people whose goal in life is to change the world for the better – it doesn't sit right with me that you have that kind of focus, but you're not making sure your carbon footprint isn't poisoning the place. Or that you're not evangelising moving human rights forward. I think every generation has the responsibility to enlarge the meaning of human rights. I do view that a CEO today of Apple should participate in the national discussion on these type of issues. Who were you thinking about when you decided to write the op-ed where you publicly came out as gay? I was thinking about kids. I was getting notes from kids who knew I was gay, or assumed I was, because of something they had read on the Web. And they were kids who were distraught. Some had been pushed out by their families. They thought they couldn't achieve anything. They couldn't do anything. They were seeing the national discourse around it and feeling isolated and depressed. And I just thought – I've got to do something. And you speaking out would do what? I thought it would minimally say you can do pretty good in this world and be gay. That it's not a limiter. It's okay to be. That it's okay to be honest about it. I figured if I could help one person, it would be worth it. It had been planned for quite a long time. It was not something that was done in a moment, by any means. It was probably a year. Just thinking through what to say, how to say it, where to say it, how to do that in a way that advanced what I was trying to do. I wanted it to be in a business [publication]. That's what I know, that's who I am. There was a lot of work there. I visited people. I talked to Anderson Cooper at length – multiple times. Because I thought that the way that he handled his announcement was really classy. I was getting advice from people who I thought were really great people who had really deeply thought about it. There are few jobs in corporate America that have the same scope, breadth and size as yours. Geopolitics. National security. Consumer retail. Global supply chains. The entertainment industry. It's mind-boggling. Where do you turn to for advice? Whoever I think can help me. When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn't have a bias? So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he's the natural person, and so I try to go through that process on everyone. That doesn't mean I always do what they say. But I think it's incumbent on a CEO to not just listen to points of view but to actually solicit them. Because I think, if not, you quickly become insular. And you're sort of living in the echo chamber. Who else? For the hearing [before the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about Apple's tax practices in 2013], I've never testified in front of Congress before. So I called up [Goldman Sachs CEO] Lloyd Blankfein, because I looked back to say who's done this before? I knew Lloyd and thought he'd be honest with me. I called up President Clinton. He knows a lot about the politics. I'd not met him through a political connection. I'd met him through the foundation. I went to Laurene, Steve's wife. Laurene has the lens of knowing me and deeply understanding Apple. And so, obviously, I get a lot of advice internal to Apple. But I think it's important on these things that are also new to the company to solicit some people outside, even if you conclude to not do what they say. With the fight with the FBI, did you have any idea what you were getting into? We knew it was going to be very, very difficult. And that the cards were stacked against us. But we spent a lot of time on "what is right here?" People who were really key on this decision are folks like [SVP of software engineering] Craig Federighi. This at its heart is a deep, deep technical question. You first have to understand that to do anything else. The lightbulb went off, and it became clear what was right when we did the first piece of work: Could we create a tool to unlock the phone? After a few days, we had determined yes, we could. Then the question was, ethically, should we? We thought, you know, that depends on whether we could contain it or not. Other people were involved in this, too – deep security experts and so forth, and it was apparent from those discussions that we couldn't be assured. The risk of what happens if it got out, we felt, could be incredibly terrible for public safety. We knew the positioning on the outside would not be public safety. It would be security vs. privacy – security should win. But we went through the deep, deep, deep discussions on that. It became clear that the trade-off, so to speak, was essentially putting hundreds of millions of people at risk for a phone that may or may not have anything on it, and that likely didn't, because of other things that we knew about. We thought this actually is a clear decision. A hard one, but a clear one. Then it became more of a matter of how do we explain this. Because this is not easy. You can imagine. You just hear: locked phone. Terrorist. People dead. Why aren't you unlocking this?

Photo / Andrew Burton On a sleek white coffee table in Apple CEO Tim Cook's fourth-floor office in late July, beneath framed posters of Robert F. Kennedy, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jackie Robinson, a rose-gold iPhone 6s sits in its original box. Earlier that morning, Cook had stood in front of employees at Apple headquarters and held up the phone, which a staffer had hand-delivered from a store in Beijing to commemorate a notable occasion: Apple had sold its billionth iPhone. That celebratory milestone - Cook laughs when asked by a reporter if he'll stop counting, as McDonald's did with its hamburgers - aptly coincides with another big moment for the technology giant's chief executive. A few weeks later, Cook would mark the fifth anniversary of what has been the most closely watched transition of power in corporate history: On Aug 24, 2011, just six weeks before his death, Apple's iconic founder, Steve Jobs, permanently handed his chief operating officer the reins. "It's been a blur in a lot of ways," says Cook, who had filled in for Jobs during medical leaves. "It feels like it was yesterday in some respects." It is fitting that these two milestones arrive so close together. That's because the iPhone, launched by Jobs, has been the biggest driver of Apple's massive growth during Cook's tenure. It led the company to soaring valuations and accounted for nearly two-thirds of Apple's revenue in the past year. Just the tally on iPhone sales, almost $141 billion over the past four quarters, is more than the annual sales figures of Cisco, Disney and Nike - combined. Continued below. Related Content What it's really like to work at Microsoft Uber sues over English exams Gear Friday: Double-take on the Huawei P9 But the iPhone has been a source of recent disappointment, too. In its most recent quarter, iPhone sales fell 23 per cent from a year ago, contributing to a 14.6 per cent drop in overall revenue. It was Apple's second consecutive quarterly drop in sales after 13 years of growth. Just after Apple disclosed those results, Cook sat down with The Washington Post to discuss his first five years in one of corporate America's most glaring spotlights. WATCH: 'The job itself is a lonely job' In two sprawling and self-reflective interviews - one in his office and another by phone just before he left for vacation in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks - Cook described why the visibility of the job has been "shocking," how he's learned to deal with the scrutiny, and who he's turned to for advice at pivotal moments (Warren Buffett, on his decision to return cash to shareholders, and Anderson Cooper about publicly disclosing he is gay). He spoke in candid terms about the mistakes he's made on the way, such as his first hire to run Apple's retail stores ("that was clearly a screw-up"). He fiercely defended Apple's tax policies. He touched on succession planning and the importance of grooming internal candidates. He was at his most spirited when talking about privacy and the long-term future of Apple and the iPhone - calling Apple's big presence in the smartphone industry "a privilege, not a problem" - and quieted considerably when talking about Jobs's memory. "I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point," he said, "but I had convinced myself that he would bounce." I'm not looking for sympathy. CEOs don't need any sympathy. Cook, 55, chooses his words carefully, taking long pauses and speaking with a slight Alabama drawl. Though he has favorite phrases - many things are "deep," and Apple's mission is always its "North Star" - he eschews the jargon many CEOs use. And while he's quick to trumpet Apple, he is also unassuming, quickly noting, after saying his job can be "lonely," that "I'm not looking for any sympathy. CEOs don't need any sympathy." That reflects how Cook's imprint on Apple has often been described - making it more systematic, more transparent, more team-oriented, more humble. He has engaged on social issues more than most CEOs, writing op-eds on legislation that limits gay rights and making the extraordinary decision earlier this year to oppose the FBI's request to unlock the San Bernardino, California, killer's phone. As CEO, he gets high marks for managing the company's growth, keeping margins high and expanding further into markets such as China (Apple had four retail stores in China five years ago. Today it has 41.) WATCH: Tim Cook says Steve Jobs was 'heat shield' for Apple He has pushed into the enterprise market, grown Apple's product lineup and positioned Apple to make more money off the devices it's already sold: Its services business, which includes things like iTunes, iCloud and a mobile payments service, is projected to be the size of a Fortune 100 business next year - all on its own. Apple remains the most valuable and most profitable company in the S&P 500 index. Yet as the company deals with declining sales in its major device categories and in markets like China, critics and some investors have fretted about Apple's innovation mojo under Cook. The first all-new device during his tenure, the Apple Watch, is not yet a mega hit. The iPhone juggernaut faces a saturated smartphone market, growing competition from low-cost startups and longer upgrade windows from consumers. Rumored big concepts behind the curtain - such as a reported car project - appear to be years away. Some analysts say such impatience is shortsighted, and that the long-term potential for things like services, augmented reality and even a possible car could ultimately transform the way Cook's tenure is viewed. "Investors are so finicky that they lose track of the big picture," says Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray who covers Apple. "I think the wisdom and legacy of Tim Cook is going to be determined by what happens in the next five years." In the conversation below, Cook looks back as well as ahead at those next five years - hinting at augmented reality but refusing to comment about a car project, saying Apple believes people love a surprise. It has been edited for length and clarity. Q. Your first day in this job, you sent a memo to employees that said, "I want you to be confident that Apple is not going to change." Five years later, it has to have changed. What qualities of Apple are immutable, in your view? A. The DNA of the company is really what I was talking about there. The North Star has always been the same, which for us, is about making insanely great products that really change the world in some way - enrich people's lives. And so our reason for being hasn't changed. Other things do change. But that's the thread that ties everyone together. Q. And what has changed? A. The obvious things are we have more employees. The company is four times larger [by revenue since 2010]. We've broadened the iPhone lineup. That was a really key decision and I think a very good one. We've gone into the Apple Watch business, which has gotten us into wellness and in health. We keep pulling that string to see where that takes us. Lots of core technology work has been done. Q. You've said you don't want to be a traditional CEO. What do you mean by that? A. I think of a traditional CEO as being divorced from customers. A lot of consumer company CEOs - they're not really interacting with consumers. I also think that the traditional CEO believes his or her job is the profit and loss, is the revenue statement, the income and expense, the balance sheet. Those are important, but I don't think they're all that's important. There's an incredible responsibility to the employees of the company, to the communities and the countries that the company operates in, to people who assemble its products, to developers, to the whole ecosystem of the company. And so I have a maybe nontraditional view there. I get criticized for it some, I recognize. But I've never wanted to be the stereotypical CEO. I don't think I'd be very good at it, honestly. And I don't think for Apple that would in the long run be good for the company. If you care about long-term shareholder return, all of these other things are really critical. Q. You've got the billionth iPhone on the table here. One thing that has changed is that in 2011 about 44 percent of the company's sales came from iPhone. Now it's close to two-thirds. How can Apple move forward when so much of its business is tied up in the iPhone and an industry that's cooling off? A. This is actually a privilege, not a problem. Think about this: What other products do you know where the ratio of people to the product, for a consumer electronics product, will be one-to-one over the long haul? I don't think there is another one. Q. Meaning? A. The global sales of PCs each year are about 275 million right now. That number's been declining. The global market for smartphones is 1.4 billion. Over time, I'm convinced every person in the world will have a smartphone. That may take a while, and they won't all have iPhones. But it is the greatest market on Earth from a consumer electronics point of view. Look at the core technologies that make up the smartphone today and look at the ones that will be dominant in smartphones of the future - like AI. AI will make this product even more essential to you. It will become even a better assistant than it is today. So where you probably aren't leaving home without it today - you're really going to be connected to it in the future. Look at the core technologies that make up the smartphone today and look at the ones that will be dominant in smartphones of the future - like AI. That level of performance is going to skyrocket. And there is nothing that's going to replace it in the short term or in the intermediate term, either. I realize that the people who are focused on this 90-day clock say, "Oh, my God, the smartphone industry only grew by 1 percent or decreased by 6 percent." You know, the global economy's not that great right now. But if you're in it for the long haul, this is the best market on earth. Q. So to those who ask where's the next big, world-changing category for Apple - it's sitting on this $231.5 billion pile of cash - are you saying there's nothing like the smartphone? A. Technology is one of these industries where every week there's a new shiny object that people are skating to. Netbooks - look back, everybody was writing like netbooks were this unbelievable thing, everyone was asking us, "Why aren't you making one?" Same thing with the PDA. Remember what happened with the PDA? Up and down. It was like the hula hoop. Technology is full of those. I'm not saying we're not going to do anything else. I'm saying this is still an unbelievable product category to be in, and not just for this quarter, year or for years. So I would not want anybody to think this, oh, this "better days are behind us" thing. Q. Some analysts have said that. A. And it doesn't bother me. Because honestly, they were saying that about Apple in 2001. They were saying it in 2005. They were saying it in 2007 - this stupid iPhone, whoever dreamed up this thing? Then they were saying that we peaked in 2010, then it was 2011. We got to $60 billion [in revenue], and they said you can't grow any more from this. Well, last year we were $230 billion. And, yes, we're coming down some this year. Every year isn't an up, you know. I've heard all of it before. And I don't subscribe to it because it's traditional thinking in a lot of ways: You can't get large because you are large. Q. How do you make the case that Apple is still a long-term growth company? A. In today's products we have services [iCloud, App Store, Apple Pay and the like], which over the last 12 months grew about $4 billion to over $23 billion [in sales]. Next year we've said it's going to be a Fortune 100 company in size. What else? The iPad Pro. What we saw in this past quarter is that about half of the people who are buying one are using it at work. We have an enormous opportunity in enterprise. Last year we did $25 billion or so in it around the world. We're collaborating much better with key partners because it's important, if you're making a decision to use our products or anybody's products in the enterprise, that they work well together. And so we're working with Cisco because they're incredible with the network infrastructure. We're working with IBM, who's written a number of apps. We're working with SAP because they own the back of the house, in terms of the processing. They own three-quarters of the world's transactions, in terms of it running on their products.

India is fast-growing, but our base there is smaller. One of the big things that has held India back is the cellular infrastructure. They have two major carriers putting in a lot of investment to bring 4G. You can imagine if you didn't have 4G today. You can't enjoy video on a 3G. Periodically you can, but not consistently. This is a game changer. And so I look at it and say: markets? Enterprise - huge. Geographies? India is one I've talked about, but there are others. Products? We purposely don't talk about that one. But you can imagine. Step back and say what's Apple so great at? Apple is the only company that can take hardware, software and services and integrate those into an experience that's an "aha" for the customer. You can take that and apply to markets that we're not in today. There's not a limitation that we can only do that in the smartphone area or in the tablet or Mac or watch area. Q. You succeeded one of the icons of American business. What does it feel like to step into those shoes? A. To me, Steve's not replaceable. By anyone. [Voice softens] He was an original of a species. I never viewed that as my role. I think it would have been a treacherous thing if I would have tried to do it. When I first took the job as CEO, I actually thought that Steve would be here for a long time. Because he was going to be chairman, work a bit less after he came back up the health curve. So I went into it with one thought, and then weeks later - six weeks later, whatever. Q. Quickly. A. It was very quickly. [The day he died] was sort of the worst day ever. I just - I had really convinced myself. I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point, but I had convinced myself that he would bounce, because he always did. Q. What did you think you knew about leading Apple that turned out to be wrong? A: There's nothing like sitting in the chair, so to speak. I was reminded that customers have a really deep love for the company. I started just getting an avalanche of customer mail. I don't mean complaints. Email. Positive. Negative. Points of view. Not the 'hey, this broke, I'm mad.' Largely not that kind of stuff. Things much deeper than that. Moved by how they were treated in a store. Lots of people have written me about FaceTime and how they could be near their mother's or father's bedside before they died only because of it. Q. But what about in terms of running the company? A. I learned that the scrutiny was much higher than I thought. Media interest and scrutiny - social networking was taking off at that time - and so a lot of the "love," so to speak, and interest from customers, I think, transfers to media interest as well. And so there's a lot of visibility on the company. We can do very few things without it being reported somewhere. Q. You and Alan Greenspan or Janet Yellen would probably have a lot to talk about. It seems like every word you say is scrutinized. How do you get used to that? A. You don't. You're both praised and criticized, and the extremes are wide - very wide. And that can happen all in a day. You build up - my skin got materially thicker after August 2011. And I don't mean in a bad way. I don't mean that I'm callous and don't care. I think I'm a bit better today about compartmentalizing things and not taking everything so personally. Apple is the only company that can take hardware, software and services and integrate those into an experience that's an "aha" for the customer. That was just downright shocking to me, honestly. I thought the visibility went with Steve, not the company. And so I thought with a different CEO, with me, that would instantly change. It didn't. Q. You've been more outspoken on social issues than any other CEO of a company your size. Do you think companies have a responsibility to publicly take on such issues as civil rights and climate change? A. I think everybody has to make their own decision about it. Maybe there are compelling reasons why some people want to be silent. I think for us, though - for a company that's all about empowering people through our products, and being a collection of people whose goal in life is to change the world for the better - it doesn't sit right with me that you have that kind of focus, but you're not making sure your carbon footprint isn't poisoning the place. Or that you're not evangelizing moving human rights forward. I think every generation has the responsibility to enlarge the meaning of human rights. I do view that a CEO today of Apple should participate in the national discussion on these type of issues. Q. Who were you thinking about when you decided to write the op-ed where you publicly came out as gay? A. I was thinking about kids. I was getting notes from kids who knew I was gay, or assumed I was, because of something they had read on the Web. And they were kids who were distraught. Some had been pushed out by their families. They thought they couldn't achieve anything. They couldn't do anything. They were seeing the national discourse around it and feeling isolated and depressed. And I just thought - I've got to do something. Q. And you speaking out would do what? A. I thought it would minimally say you can do pretty good in this world and be gay. That it's not a limiter. It's okay to be. That it's okay to be honest about it. I figured if I could help one person, it would be worth it. It had been planned for quite a long time. It was not something that was done in a moment, by any means. It was probably a year. Just thinking through what to say, how to say it, where to say it, how to do that in a way that advanced what I was trying to do. I wanted it to be in a business [publication]. That's what I know, that's who I am. There was a lot of work there. I visited people. I talked to Anderson Cooper at length - multiple times. Because I thought that the way that he handled his announcement was really classy. I was getting advice from people who I thought were really great people who had really deeply thought about it. Q. There are few jobs in corporate America that have the same scope, breadth and size as yours. Geopolitics. National security. Consumer retail. Global supply chains. The entertainment industry. It's mind-boggling. Where do you turn to for advice? A. Whoever I think can help me. When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn't have a bias? So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he's the natural person, and so I try to go through that process on everyone. That doesn't mean I always do what they say. But I think it's incumbent on a CEO to not just listen to points of view but to actually solicit them. Because I think, if not, you quickly become insular. And you're sort of living in the echo chamber. Q. Who else? A. For the hearing [in 2013 before the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about Apple's tax practices], I've never testified in front of Congress before. So I called up [Goldman Sachs CEO] Lloyd Blankfein, because I looked back to say who's done this before? I knew Lloyd and thought he'd be honest with me. He gave me great advice. I called up President [Bill] Clinton. He knows a lot about the politics. I'd not met him through a political connection. I'd met him through the foundation. And he was great. I went to Laurene, Steve's wife. Laurene has the lens of knowing me and deeply understanding Apple. And so, obviously, I get a lot of advice internal to Apple. But I think it's important on these things that are also new to the company to solicit some people outside, even if you conclude to not do what they say. Q. With the fight with the FBI, did you have any idea what you were getting into? A. We knew it was going to be very, very difficult. And that the cards were stacked against us. But we spent a lot of time on "what is right here?" People who were really key on this decision are folks like [senior vice president of software engineering] Craig Federighi. This at its heart is a deep, deep technical question. You first have to understand that to do anything else. The lightbulb went off, and it became clear what was right when we did the first piece of work: Could we create a tool to unlock the phone? After a few days, we had determined yes, we could. Then the question was, ethically, should we? We thought, you know, that depends on whether we could contain it or not. Other people were involved in this, too - deep security experts and so forth, and it was apparent from those discussions that we couldn't be assured. Photo / Getty Images The risk of what happens if it got out, we felt, could be incredibly terrible for public safety. We knew the positioning on the outside would not be public safety. It would be security vs. privacy - security should win. But we went through the deep, deep, deep discussions on that. It became clear that the trade-off, so to speak, was essentially putting hundreds of millions of people at risk for a phone that may or may not have anything on it, and that likely didn't, because of other things that we knew about. We thought this actually is a clear decision. A hard one, but a clear one. Then it became more of a matter of how do we explain this. Because this is not easy. You can imagine. You just hear: locked phone. Terrorist. People dead. Why aren't you unlocking this? Q. Did the FBI fight change how you view the mandate of your job? A. Customers should have an expectation that they shouldn't need a PhD in computer science to protect themselves. So I think they depend on us to do some things on their behalf. So with that responsibility comes an obligation to stand up. And, in this case, it was unbelievably uncomfortable and not something that we wished for, wanted - we didn't even think it was right. Honestly? I was shocked that they would even ask for this. That was the thing that was so disappointing that I think everybody lost in the whole thing. There are 200-plus other countries in the world. Zero of them had ever asked this. Q. You've talked about privacy being part of Apple's values. How personal is it for you? You're known as a very private person. You grew up gay in a red state. Did those early years have an impact on how you lead Apple and on your public stances about privacy? A. Undoubtedly, your childhood and your upbringing is a constant across your life in terms of the things you learn and your point of view. But in terms of privacy, I wouldn't link the two. There's a broader thing in play. Privacy, in my point of view, is a civil liberty that our Founding Fathers thought of a long time ago and concluded it was an essential part of what it was to be an American. Sort of on the level, if you will, with freedom of speech, freedom of the press. The other thing is how all this data sits out there in different places. I do worry about people not really understanding deeply about what kinds of things are out there about them. So it's really both of those - not really the growing up in the South. Q. Back in 2009, you said, "We believe in saying no to thousands of projects." Name one product or project in the past five years you have put on the shelf. A. [Laughs]. I don't know if I want to do that, because it gives competition some heads-up about things. But be assured that we have. More than one. Because the wonderful thing about Apple is there are many ideas about doing things. We have resources to do a few, but you can only do a few things deep and well, and so you have to say no and have debates about what things are in versus out. So more than one big thing has left the page. Q. When you look back, are there mistakes you've made that you've learned something from? A. Maps was a mistake. Today we have a product we're proud of. But we had the self-honesty to admit this wasn't our finest hour and the courage to choose another way of doing it. That's important. It's the only way an organization learns. The classic big-company mistake is to not admit their mistake. They double down on them. Their pride or ego is so large that they can't say we did something wrong. And I think the faster you do that, the better - change gears to something else. If you're honest, people will give you the benefit of the doubt. But if you have your head stuck in the sand and you just keep doing it, I think you lose your employees and your customers as well. Q. What else? A. I hired the wrong person for retail [former Dixons CEO John Browett] initially. That was clearly a screw-up. I'm not saying anything bad about him. He didn't fit here culturally is a good way to describe it. We all talked to him, and I made the final decision, and it was wrong. We fairly quickly recognized it and made a change. And I'm proud we did that. A lot of companies would have said, "Oh, he hasn't been here very long." But when you're looking at more time with [then] 50,000 people in retail - that's a lot of people that you're affecting in the wrong way. That was a mistake. I probably have a long list. We clearly are capable of doing it both from a management-depth point of view and a financial point of view. It's sort of a lonely job. The adage that it's lonely - the CEO job is lonely - is accurate in a lot of ways. I'm not looking for any sympathy. You have to recognize that you have blind spots. We all do. Blind spots move, and you want to not just have really bright people around you, but people who will push on you and people to bring out the best in you. People that amplify whatever you're good at. And then also the people who plug the parts that you're not and may never be. Q. What are you reading? A. I have two books going right now: One is the Bobby Kennedy book ["Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Icon," by Larry Tye] that just came out. The other is quite an old book. It's a Gandhi book ["Mohandas K. Gandhi, Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth"] that I got interested in because we went to the Gandhi museum when we were in India recently. I tend to like nonfiction and particularly reading about people and how they lived and how they fought, and what motivated them and their philosophy and so forth. Q. When Steve handed you the reins, he said Apple had never had an orderly transition of CEO, and he wanted that to happen. What are you doing now to make sure the next transition, whenever it happens, is orderly? A. At the end of every board meeting, I discuss succession with the board because I might step off the wrong curb or something. We have the good discipline to do that. Then my role is to make sure that the board has great candidates to pick from internally. And I take that role extremely seriously. Look around at the great people I get to work with - there's some really just superb talent in the company. Q. You've made more acquisitions at Apple, including the purchase of Beats, which was its largest ever, at $3 billion. At its current size, does Apple need big acquisitions like that to grow? A. Do we need them? No. But we always are looking for companies that have really talented people and great intellectual property, and when we find them we do acquire them. To put that into context, we've acquired 15 to 20 companies a year for the last four years. Q. Do you think there will be more at that size going forward? A. I think we'll continue to acquire companies. If you're asking me would we do another one the size of Beats - Q. Or bigger? You certainly could. A. We clearly are capable of doing it both from a management-depth point of view and a financial point of view. But we'd only do it if it were great for Apple strategically. We don't acquire for revenue. So the essential for us is the talent and/or [intellectual property]. Those are the things that we optimize around. Now with Beats, we also got revenue. But it wasn't the purpose of it. The purpose was that we were going into streaming - we'd already made a decision to do that. And we looked around at people who might be able to help us. I think we got Apple Music out probably a little sooner than we would have otherwise. It's infused some great talent on the team. Q. Sales in greater China were down 33 percent in the most recent quarter. Low-cost competitors like Huawei are getting into building premium phones. Let's talk about China. How much are you worried about competitive and regulatory threats there? A. We make our investment decisions based on long term. We have to report every 90 days because that's the rules, but it's not how we run the company. So as I look in the long term, I think China is an unbelievable market - not only from a demand point of view and the revenue potential there, but also as a great source of talent. We have over a million and a half developers there. The reach is unbelievable. There are, sort of, speed bumps now with the economy. In a year-ago quarter, we were up 112 percent. So I think you have to back up and put it in perspective. If you look at it over a two-year basis, we were up over 50 percent in the quarter. Q. We were talking about getting advice from people before your first testimony on Capitol Hill. That hearing focused on the corporate taxes Apple pays. Apple is now awaiting a European Union ruling on whether you owe billions in back taxes, and corporate tax reform is a big election-year issue. Does either a Trump or a Clinton campaign give you or the company any hope that there could be corporate tax reform anytime soon? A. I think it's in the best interest of the US to have corporate tax reform, regardless of which political party is in charge of the White House. Because if you look at it, the US rules today are that international companies like us and many others can keep their earnings that they earn overseas overseas, and then when they bring them back it triggers the tax liability. What I've always felt should happen is that every dollar should be taxed immediately with no deferral. But as a consequence of doing that, you should have free flow of capital. What would happen is if a system like that were put in place, it should have more investment going into the United States. We're the only major country in the world that has a system like this. It's not good for the US, it's not good for the economy, it's not good for jobs, it's not good for investments. I think there's wide agreement to that in both parties, by the way. There's a difference of view with different people about how to fix it, but I think everybody agrees the current system isn't working. So I'm optimistic that, in 2017, there will be some sort of corporate tax reform. The US needs to invest more in infrastructure - so what would be great is, if they take the tax proceeds of a corporate tax reform and invest it in infrastructure and roads and bridges and airports. Q. What do you say in response to Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz's comments on Bloomberg [television], where he called Apple's profit reporting in Ireland a "fraud"? A. I didn't hear it. But if anybody said that, they don't know what they're talking about. Let me explain what goes on with our international taxes. The money that's in Ireland that he's probably referring to is money that is subject to US taxes. The tax law right now says we can keep that in Ireland or we can bring it back. And when we bring it back, we will pay 35 per cent federal tax and then a weighted average across the states that we're in, which is about 5 per cent, so think of it as 40 per cent. We've said at 40 per cent, we're not going to bring it back until there's a fair rate. There's no debate about it. Is that legal to do or not legal to do? It is legal to do. It is the current tax law. It's not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic. It doesn't go that the more you pay, the more patriotic you are. And so what we've said - we think it's fine for us to pay more, because right now we're paying nothing on that and we leave it over there. But we - like many, many other companies do - wait for the money to come back. In the meantime, it's important to look at what we do pay. Our marginal rate, our effective rate in the US is over 30 per cent. We are the largest taxpayer in the United States. And so we're not a tax dodger. We pay our share and then some. We don't have these big loopholes that other people talk about. The only kind of major tax credit that we get is the R&D tax credit, which is available to all companies in the United States. That's important to know. The second thing I would point out is we have money internationally because we have two-thirds of our business there. So we earn money internationally. Q. Do you feel picked on by the EU? A. You know, they haven't ruled yet. I don't know how they will rule. I hope that we get a fair hearing. If we don't, then we would obviously appeal it. It's important for everyone to understand that the allegation made in the EU is that Ireland gave us a special deal. Ireland denies that. The structure we have was applicable to everybody - it wasn't something that was done unique to Apple. It was their law. And the basic controversy at the root of this is, people really aren't arguing that Apple should pay more taxes. They're arguing about who they should be paid to. And so there's a tug of war going on between the countries of how you allocate profits. Q. Let's jump to Apple's future. You made some statements in the earnings call about artificial intelligence that got a lot of attention. Can Apple catch up with the AI efforts from companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon? A. Let me take exception to your question. Your question seems to imply that we're behind. Let's take a look at that. We've been shipping Siri since 2011, and Siri is with you all of the time. Which I think most people would want an assistant with them all the time, whether they're at work or at home or in between or on the soccer field. You don't think of your to-do list, so to speak, only when you're in your kitchen. And the breadth of Siri is unbelievable. Increasingly, Siri understands things obviously without having to memorize certain ways to say things. The prediction of Siri is going way up. What we've done with AI is focus on things that will help the customer. And we announced in June that we're opening Siri to third parties, so third-party developers can now use Siri. So a simple example with that, whatever kind of ride-sharing app you might use, Uber or Lyft in the United States, you could just - using your voice - order the car. So third-party developers are writing tons of those that will be available to the public in the fall. And that's how we're broadening Siri in a huge way. But there are other things in there, like if you're typing in mail, the prediction capability of the next word or next phrase that you will use has just - Siri has gotten a lot smarter about that. The simple things, like do you drive to the airport? I haven't done that in a little while, but when I did, I always forgot where I put my car. Q. I just take a picture of the sign on the wall. A. But you don't even have to do that anymore because Siri will know where you parked. And so things like this really make a difference to people - we do all of that while protecting your privacy. Instead of passing all that information to the cloud, where we're maintaining it all, we do a lot of it on the device itself. So you're in control of your own data. Q. Do you have a concern about privacy as you push into AI? A. No. I think that talented people can come up with fantastic ways of using AI without violating privacy. There's a new technology called differential privacy which essentially looks at large data sets to predict user behaviors and requests without going to the precise individual, which might violate privacy. Now there are some things that we do look at - like if you buy songs, it's a reasonable expectation that we know what songs you buy because you buy them from us. And we use that information with machine learning to recommend other songs you might like. Q. What about augmented or virtual reality? A. I think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it's something we're doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about. [Laughs.] Q. You mentioned earlier about how much more difficult it is to keep things secret. There's been a number of reports about Apple's car project - the people who are being hired or moved into place to lead it. It gets enough attention that it almost seems like an open secret. Why not say something about it? A. I can't answer a question about something we haven't announced. [Laughs.] Q. But there's just constant attention about it. Is it tempting to share any kind of details? A. We've always viewed that people love surprises. We don't have enough anymore in our lives. Q. Sometimes it seems like Silicon Valley companies are all blending together - everyone's converging on the same big race. Self-driving cars, AI, Google is reportedly building a smartphone. In a tech industry where companies are trying to be "all things to all people," how does Apple's longtime philosophy of simplicity, and being very focused, move it forward? A. It's as important as it ever was. We're a bit larger today, so we can do a bit more than we could do 10 years ago or even five years ago. But we still have, for our size, an extremely focused product line. You can literally put every product we make on this table. That really is an indication of how focused it is. I think that's a good thing. Regardless of who you are, there's only so many things that you can do at a very high-quality and deep, deep level - personally and in business. And so we're not going to change that. That's core to our model and way of thinking. Q. Apple has really ramped up spending in research and development. One analyst noted your [incremental] R&D is now greater than the 14 largest automakers, combined. What's the most exciting technology out there to you right now? A. That one I don't want to answer, because it would give too much of an insight into the things we're doing. But we have ramped up R&D because we are heavily investing in the future - both in current product lines and things that aren't visible as well, including in services. In due time, some of those things will be visible. But there will always be other things that will replace those things that are invisible. Q. Any final reflections on your tenure? Moments that stuck out at you? A. I've got the best job in the world. I think about my day and weeks and months and years - I put them in three buckets: people, strategy and execution. I sort of move between those on a daily basis as to where I put my time. I always think the most important one of those is people. If you don't get that one right, it doesn't matter what kind of energy you have in the other two - it's not enough. - Bloomberg.

He also touches on the future of Apple, such as its Artificial Intelligence and and Augmented/Virtual Reality ambitions… But first, Cook noted some mistakes. He again acknowledged the disaster that was Apple Maps. On his first big hire John Browett, who ran the Apple Store for a short amount of time: He spoke in candid terms about the mistakes he’s made on the way, such as his first hire to run Apple’s retail stores (“that was clearly a screw-up”) Although the iPhone growth has stalled, Apple’s services business is huge: Its services business, which includes things like iTunes, iCloud and a mobile payments service, is projected to be the size of a Fortune 100 business next year — all on its own. What has changed at Apple? Bigger! The obvious things are we have more employees in the company. The company is four times larger [by revenue since 2010]. We’ve broadened the iPhone lineup. That was a really key decision, and I think a good one. We’ve gone into the Apple Watch business, which has gotten us into wellness and in health. We keep pulling that string to see where that takes us. Lots of core technology work has been done. On slowing iPhones: This is actually a privilege, not a problem. Think about this: What other products do you know where the ratio of people to the product, for a consumer electronics product, will be one-to-one over the long haul? I don’t think there is another one. This is interesting thinking. I wonder what Apple is doing to address the other 6B people who don’t yet own a smartphone. On replacing Steve Jobs: To me, Steve’s not replaceable. By anyone. [Voice softens] He was an original of a species. I never viewed that was my role. I think it would have been a treacherous thing if I would have tried to do it. When I first took the job as CEO, I actually thought that Steve would be here for a long time. Because he was going to be chairman, work a bit less after he came back up the health curve. So I went into it with one thought, and then weeks later — six weeks later, whatever —It was very quickly. [The day he died] was sort of the worst day ever. I just — I had really convinced myself. I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point, but I had convinced myself that he would bounce, because he always did. On coming out: I was thinking about kids. I was getting notes from kids who knew I was gay, or assumed I was, because of something they had read on the Web. And they were kids who were distraught. Some had been pushed out by their families. They thought they couldn’t achieve anything. They couldn’t do anything. They were seeing the national discourse around it and feeling isolated and depressed. And I just thought — I’ve got to do something. On testifying before congress in 2013: For the hearing [before the U.S. Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about Apple’s tax practices in 2013], I’ve never testified in front of Congress before. So I called up [Goldman Sachs CEO] Lloyd Blankfein, because I looked back to say who’s done this before? I knew Lloyd and thought he’d be honest with me. I called up President Clinton. He knows a lot about the politics. I’d not met him through a political connection. I’d met him through the foundation. I went to Laurene, Steve’s wife. Laurene has the lens of knowing me and deeply understanding Apple. Tim Cook deflected questions about upcoming products like Apple Car but interestingly he yet again mentioned AR: I think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about.

No Control: Thoughts On The End Of The Headphone Jack And The Future Of Digital Music Michael Nelson @nelsonicboom | August 12, 2016 - 11:29 am Share < br />this article: Do you know who Lyor Cohen is? This isn’t a rhetorical question. I have no perspective here. If you work in the music business, he’s a household name. If you don’t work in the music business, why the fuck would you care about some corporate executive? But maybe, in this case, you actually would care, because Cohen’s a significant enough figure that he sorta transcends that. Anyway, real quick: Lyor Cohen played an instrumental role in bringing rap to mainstream audiences in the ’80s. He headed up Def Jam Records in the ’90s. He was chairman and chief executive of Warner Music Group in the ’00s. He’s Jay Z’s mentor. That’s not just some unattributed thing people say because they heard someone else say it. That’s a thing Jay Z said in his own 2010 autobiography, Decoded. So maybe you already knew Lyor Cohen, maybe not, but either way, you know him now. Last week, The Guardian ran a lengthy feature on Cohen, which was full of anecdotes and insights, including this spicy bit of invective directed at another iconic corporate executive whom you definitely know: My firsthand experience with Steve [Jobs] was that he was determined and was going to get only what he wanted. And he was a bully. He was very seductive, but a profound bully. And oftentimes he did not say the truth. I.e., Jobs “did not say the truth” in regard to his dealings with the music industry at the dawn of the iTunes era. Now, Cohen is by no means the first C-suite guy to speak ill of Jobs. It was only nine months ago that Pandora CFO Mike Herring told us, “Steve Jobs eviscerated the music industry with the launch of iTunes and it’s been downhill ever since.” But something about what Cohen said struck a chord with me: a person who had zero firsthand experience with Steve Jobs, but was nonetheless in the trenches at that particular moment in time. Do you remember when iPods first came out? Back in the day, they came wrapped in this clear protective tape, on the front of which was printed the command: “Don’t steal music.” My friend Todd and I used to laugh about that. In the early 2000s, selling shiny new iPods to computer-literate music lovers and telling them, “Don’t steal music,” was like selling a giant pile of drugs to a couple of college sophomores and telling them, “D.A.R.E. to resist.” The message was either motivated by some bargaining-with-God-style karmic anxiety or intended as a 100-percent ironic endorsement to do the very opposite, but in any case, it was clearly not sincere, and in no way whatsoever did it intend or expect to serve as an actual deterrent. “Seductive”? Yes. “Did not say the truth”? Also yes. Anyway, thinking about old iPods and Lyor Cohen and Jay Z and Steve Jobs got me thinking about this tweet from Kanye West from a few weeks back: Apple give Jay his check for Tidal now and stop trying to act like you Steve. — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) July 30, 2016 But what if they’re not “acting” like anything? People always say that Tim Cook’s Apple has nothing in common with Steve Jobs’ Apple, but maybe, really, the two men’s respective styles are not so different? *** I’m not talking about Tidal. I’d love to, naturally, and we will absolutely get to that in the not-so-distant future, but today we’re just talking about Apple. Starting here: Earlier this week, Bloomberg Technology further substantiated something we’ve all been speculating about for a while now: The iPhone 7, which is set to arrive this fall (just in time for Boys Don’t Cry!), very likely won’t have a standard headphone jack. Per Bloomberg: “The new iPhones will remove the headphone jack in favor of connectivity via Bluetooth and the charging port. That will make room for a second speaker [according to people familiar with the matter, who didn’t want to be identified discussing unannounced features].” “Bully”? Yep. “Determined and going to get only what they want”? Again, yes. If the rumors are to be believed, when the new phones hit stores, they’ll be bundled with EarPods that connect to the charging port (aka the “Lightning Connector”) so iPhone users won’t be left with nothing. But EarPods are as close to nothing as you can possibly buy on the headphones market. Anyway, here’s what they’ll (supposedly) look like: If you listen to music on an iPhone and don’t care for bottom-of-the-market EarPods, this creates a whole lot of logistical problems on day one. The headphones you currently own are now basically obsolete. You do have a workaround there: You can buy a Lightning-to-3.5mm headphone jack adapter — called a “dongle,” in case you have to ask the guy at Best Buy where to find ‘em — but that’s far from ideal. First of all, those things won’t exactly be free; they’ll probably retail somewhere between $30 and $40. (That said, it’s not out of the question that you’ll get one for free — several sites have shared rumors that Apple will bundle a single dongle with each new iPhone.) Second, those dongles are gonna be real easy to lose, probably not all that hard to break, and will just be a general headache to keep track of in your pockets or bag or whatever. You’ll eventually be able to buy off-brand dongles at your local bodega or Duane Reade, but if you’ve ever bought an off-brand charger at your local bodega or Duane Reade, you know how that goes. (BTW, I am aware that the phrase “Apple will bundle a single dongle” sounds ridiculous, and I intentionally wrote it to sound as ridiculous as possible. I can’t even type the word “dongle” without feeling ridiculous, and when situations like that arise, IMO, you just gotta lean into ‘em.) So ANYWAY, let’s be real clear: The intention here is not for you to use a dongle. Alternately, you can switch to Bluetooth headphones — in fact, maybe you already use Bluetooth headphones. I do. I own a pair and I hate ‘em. Why? For starters, it’s no given that your phone will “find” your headphones, which can be pretty infuriating. Plus you have to be constantly vigilant about keeping the headphones’ battery charged … and of course, battery life diminishes over time. (I think I get eight hours of battery life out of my Bluetooth headphones, which are admittedly not the greatest.) Fail to stay on top of that and you run the risk of your headphones dying in the middle of a workout or a long walk or whatever. The intention here is also not for you to use Bluetooth headphones. I mean, one day? Sure. But not yet. No, the intention here is for you to buy new headphones — Apple-supported headphones that will be compatible with the iPhone’s Lightning Connector — and not just once but whenever: whenever you break a pair or lose a pair or forget to bring a pair on vacation… And you know who owns the biggest headphones brand in the world? Yeah you do. On that note, lemme throw this one to Bloomberg again: Apple started allowing headphone makers to build headphones that can connect via the iPhone’s charger connector in 2014, the same year the company acquired headphone maker Beats Electronics. That’s great, right? They “started allowing” it. You know who wasn’t so in love that idea? Headphone makers. As MacWorld wrote back in 2014, the rest of the audio industry largely resisted Apple’s invitation to revamp entire product lines to service a single piece of hardware that was bound to be updated again in a few years anyway. Still, as MacWorld noted, choosing not to participate came with its own set of risks: [Having acquired Beats Electronics], Apple will be able to trot out headphones of its own that use Lightning. Then, if others want in, they would be at a disadvantage, price-wise, because they’d have to pay licensing and royalty fees to enter Apple’s MFi (Made For…) program, while Apple/Beats would not. Sucks for those other guys, right? Not just them, though. *** Nobody has been more vocal in their antipathy for the jackless iPhone than Verge Editor-In-Chief Nilay Patel, who authored a pretty vitriolic essay on the subject a couple months ago titled “Taking The Headphone Jack Off Phones Is User-Hostile And Stupid.” Really, Patel’s piece wasn’t an essay so much as a list: six reasons why this practice is user-hostile and stupid. At the top of the list was this: 1. Digital audio means DRM audio I’m just gonna excerpt Patel here and then try to contextualize the best I can: For years the entertainment industry has decried what they call the “analog loophole” of headphone jacks, and now we’re making their dreams come true by closing it. Restricting audio output to a purely digital connection means that music publishers and streaming companies can start to insist on digital copyright enforcement mechanisms. We moved our video systems to HDMI and got HDCP, remember? Copyright enforcement technology never stops piracy and always hurts the people who most rely on legal fair use, but you can bet the music industry is going to start cracking down on “unauthorized” playback and recording devices anyway. We deal with DRM when it comes to video because we generally don’t rewatch and take TV shows and movies with us, but you will rue the day Apple decided to make the iPhone another 1mm thinner the instant you get a “playback device not supported” message. First, those acronyms: DRM is Digital Rights Management; HDMI is High-Definition Multimedia Interface, and HDCP is High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection. HDMI/HDCP is a pretty good point of reference here, but I’m not gonna go long on that, because this is plenty long already. If you want to learn more about HDMI and HDCP, here’s a pretty decent primer, and here’s the nut: “Unbeknownst to most consumers there’s an anti-piracy protocol [called HDCP] built right into the HDMI cable standard. Not only does it have a poor track record when it comes to piracy prevention it outright breaks the viewing experience for many people.” OK, so … DRM. On its face, DRM exists to protect copyrights holders against piracy, which is a worthy goal. It’s never proven effective in that capacity, but we’ll come back to that. Beyond that, DRM is vastly fucking complicated, because it’s an intersection of technology, law, business, and ethics, and you could write books on its implications in each of those areas. Well, someone could. Maybe you. Not me. In 2014, Cory Doctorow wrote a substantial feature on DRM for The Guardian, calling it “one of the most salient, and least understood, facts about technology in the contemporary world.” I’m doing you, him, and myself a disservice by reducing his 5,000-word story to its five broadest sentences, but it’s better than nothing, so here goes: DRM isn’t the right to prevent piracy: It’s the right to make up your own copyright laws. The right to invent things that people aren’t allowed to do — even though the law permits it — and to embed these prohibitions in code that is illegal to violate … DRM assumes that the computer’s owner is its adversary. For DRM to work, there has to be no obvious way to remove, interrupt or fool it. For DRM to work, it has to reside in a computer whose operating system is designed to obfuscate some of its files and processes: to deliberately hoodwink the computer’s owner about what the computer is doing. Look, I know. I know this stuff makes no sense. It’s supposed to make no sense. That’s not a bug, it’s a feature! But the thing is, there are plenty of bugs, too. It’s not that DRM is bad — copyrights holders absolutely should be protected — it just that at best it doesn’t do what it’s ostensibly intended to do. Here’s a real-life example: For the first six years of its existence, from 2003 through 2009, the iTunes store was forced by major labels to sell only DRM-encumbered song files. As Wired put it: “Terrified music labels essentially decided we were all thieves and couldn’t be trusted. Because of that paranoia, when the iTunes store launched, all the songs were wrapped in DRM.” But the labels slowly came around — in part because they realized they were giving up a whole lot more than they were getting. As Ars Technica’s Eric Bangeman wrote in 2006: It appears that the record labels are slowly beginning to realize that they can’t have DRMed music and complete control over the online music market at the same time. For years, the labels have insisted that nearly all music sold online contain DRM due to fears over piracy and file-sharing. That insistence ultimately left the labels reliant on other companies to come up with DRM solutions capable of pleasing both consumers and the music industry. Hence the dominance of Apple, the iPod, and the iTunes Store in the online music scene. So there you go. That’s one example of DRM not working. It started in 2003, and by 2006, people were “slowly beginning to realize” it was costing them. They waited a few more years to change it, and they’re still paying for it today. The real reason DRM became an untenable burden to the labels, though, is because it became an untenable burden to their customers, i.e., you. Music pirates continued to pirate music — partly because that’s what pirates do, but also because pirating was a better user experience, because those files had no restrictions. The DRM-encumbered files purchased on iTunes were restricted to usage on a maximum of five computers, and while they could be played back on as many iPods as you wanted, they could only be played back on iPods. No other MP3 device and/or software could play those songs unless the “owner” went through the labyrinthine process of burning the songs to CD, stripping them of their DRM, and then re-ripping the files from those CDs. Even after the labels finally gave up on DRM, those old files proved problematic: You still had to use iTunes Match to manually remove the protection yourself (a quick five-step process). Weirdly, when Apple Music launched, it incorrectly wrapped all the old files its users hadn’t bought from iTunes in DRM, meaning “the music you’ve accumulated over the years outside of iTunes becomes unplayable if you ever cancel your Apple Music subscription and don’t have iTunes Match to keep it with you.” (Fixing this required only a six-step process.) So in a way, you’re still paying for it, too. *** The most passed-around piece ever written in opposition to DRM audio was penned by none other than Steve Jobs himself: a 2007 essay called “Thoughts On Music.” The whole thing is worth reading, but I’m just gonna pull out a few key lines. Here’s one: When Apple approached [the “big four” music companies] to license their music to distribute legally over the Internet, they were extremely cautious and required Apple to protect their music from being illegally copied. The solution was to create a DRM system, which envelops each song purchased from the iTunes store in special and secret software so that it cannot be played on unauthorized devices. Here’s another: The problem, of course, is that there are many smart people in the world, some with a lot of time on their hands, who love to discover such secrets and publish a way for everyone to get free (and stolen) music. They are often successful in doing just that, so any company trying to protect content using a DRM must frequently update it with new and harder to discover secrets. It is a cat-and-mouse game. And one more: Why would the big four music companies agree to let Apple and others distribute their music without using DRM systems to protect it? The simplest answer is because DRMs haven’t worked, and may never work, to halt music piracy. In time, the labels came to agree with Jobs. And in 2009, the iTunes Music Store went DRM-free. This came as a result of a compromise with the labels, who agreed to abandon DRM-encumbered files only if Apple would agree to variable pricing in the iTunes store. As MacWorld wrote in 2009: “Did Apple cave to the recording industry? If you define ‘Apple caving to the recording industry’ as ‘prices increasing for new and popular tunes,’ then yes, Apple caved.” That’s not really “caving,” of course, because the higher prices meant additional revenue not only for the labels, but for Apple too. But it was kinda caving, because Apple wasn’t really in it for the royalties — Apple wanted to sell iPods, and needed the labels to be on board. Never forget: With that in mind, consider just one more line from Jobs’ “Thoughts On Music”: The [optimal] alternative is to abolish DRMs entirely. Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM-free music encoded in open licensable formats. In such a world, any player can play music purchased from any store, and any store can sell music which is playable on all players. This is clearly the best alternative for consumers, and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat. If the big four music companies would license Apple their music without the requirement that it be protected with a DRM, we would switch to selling only DRM-free music on our iTunes store. Every iPod ever made will play this DRM-free music. Two years after he wrote that piece, Jobs’ imaginary world was made real. And two years after that, he passed away. Fast-forward to 2015, a week before the launch of Apple Music and a year before the Verge’s Nilay Patel wrote the aforementioned “Taking The Headphone Jack Off Phones Is User-Hostile And Stupid.” That week, last June, Patel wrote a different essay, sorta foreshadowing the new one, titled “Apple Music And The Terrible Return Of DRM.” You should read that one in full, too, but here’s the key line: It’s no longer the labels pushing DRM on the music services; it’s the services themselves, because locking you into a single ecosystem guarantees you’ll keep paying their monthly subscription fees and hopefully buy into the rest of their ecosystem … Apple Music might be available on Android, but it probably won’t be as good, because Apple wants you to buy an iPhone. Whether by coincidence or design, Patel was right about Apple Music on Android: The app just exited beta last week, and version 1.0 is in the Play Store now with an average rating of 3.3 stars. Per TechCrunch: “[W]hen you look at the Play Store ratings, it says that the app is still crippled with bugs. Music doesn’t play, downloaded songs get randomly removed, and the app crashes a lot.” It’s also no secret that Apple hasn’t exactly made it easy for Spotify to establish a foothold among iPhone users. So I think Patel is right, too, in his broader assertions about Apple “locking you into a single ecosystem … and hopefully buy[ing] into the rest of their ecosystem.” Why wouldn’t they do that? After all, it is a huge ecosystem — just on the music end, right now, Apple is acting as a streaming service, a hardware manufacturer, a de facto record label, a record store (for now), a radio station, a PR firm, a video production agency, and an on-demand streaming video provider (am I missing anything?) — and its room for growth is equally massive. As Forbes notes, “Apple has upwards of a billion devices in use currently, and it also had about 800 million iTunes accounts with credit cards on file (as of April 2014). This implies that fewer than 2 percent of Apple’s iTunes account holders are actively paying for the Music service.” That’s a whole lot of credit cards not getting charged 10 bucks a month for an Apple Music subscription. Not yet. Would Steve Jobs have wanted to see Apple customers “locked into a single ecosystem”? Not if you believe “Thoughts On Music.” I mean, he doesn’t exactly say as much. He more or less just says it’s unreasonable for anyone to think that users could be locked into a single ecosystem. Well, I won’t paraphrase — this is what he says verbatim: Some have argued that once a consumer purchases a body of music from one of the proprietary music stores, they are forever locked into only using music players from that one company. Or, if they buy a specific player, they are locked into buying music only from that company’s music store. Is this true? Jobs then offers some compelling data, and finally arrives at the conclusion that “It’s hard to believe” this could be true. But it’s hard to believe anything, right? I keep going back to that Lyor Cohen quote from last week: My firsthand experience with Steve [Jobs] was that he was determined and was going to get only what he wanted. And he was a bully. He was very seductive, but a profound bully. And oftentimes he did not say the truth. So maybe Jobs wasn’t saying the truth in “Thoughts On Music” — not the whole truth, anyway. Or hey, give the guy the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was all true and Steve Jobs got exactly what he wanted before he died, only to have Tim Cook’s Apple upend everything immediately afterward. I dunno. It doesn’t matter. Either way, somebody is “going to get only what they want.” It just won’t be you.

(Charles Rex Arbogast/AP) Associated Press August 14, 2016, 5:19 PM Associated Press   August 14, 2016, 5:19 PM EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — New York Giants first-round draft pick Eli Apple has a strained knee and his status is being listed as day to day. Coach Ben McAdoo also said Sunday that wide receiver Victor Cruz is still being bothered by a groin problem and is day to day. Apple was hurt in Friday night’s preseason opener against the Miami Dolphins. The former Ohio State cornerback had an MRI on Saturday. He watched practice on Sunday. "I am fine," Apple said when asked if there was any swelling in his knee. "It was just an uncomfortable feeling. I just wanted to make sure to do what you have to do to get back to 100 per cent." Cruz, who missed all of last season with a calf injury and was limited to six games in 2014 by a knee injury, aggravated his groin in practice last week. He did not play against the Dolphins. "He'll get treatment tonight, and then we'll take a look at him tomorrow and see how he's feeling," McAdoo said. Cruz was not available to comment on his injury. Wide receiver Geremy Davis, who hurt his hamstring on Friday night, did not practice Sunday. Linebacker Keenan Robinson returned to practice after missing Friday's game because of a hamstring injury. Third-year defensive tackle Jay Bromley was taken off the physically unable to perform list after missing the first two weeks of training camp. He had surgery on his ankle to remove bone spurs this spring. "It got to the point where it was just really aggravated and I really couldn't deal with it on a day to day basis," Bromley said. "I went out there today and it felt great, so it was necessary." NOTES: OL Adam Gettis had a bad preseason game and was demoted to the third-string line. "Adam is going to have to fight his way back into the mix," McAdoo said. ... Backup quarterback Ryan Nassib also struggled in making a start. "He's a pro," McAdoo said. "He's a guy that is going to come in, he's going to prepare, he's going to go about his business the right way, and attack practice the same way he always has." %2Ffootball%2Fnfl%2Fgiants-eli-apple-victor-cruz-day-day-injuries%2F Join the Discussion EDITORS' PICKS RG3 takes another step toward possible return for Browns | 1 hour ago Bills GM expects Sammy Watkins to return to practice | 4 hours ago Colts preparing to go with backup plan against Steelers | 17 hours ago Why Kirk Cousins will get a big-time raise this off-season | 23 hours ago MOST DISCUSSED Leafs hand hot Hurricanes their fifth straight win 315 COMMENTS Senators score two quick in third, top league-best Canadiens 195 COMMENTS New NHL team named Las Vegas Golden Knights 197 COMMENTS Atkins: Encarnacion makes Blue Jays better if deal is right 451 COMMENTS Cam Talbot stops 31 as Oilers blank Blackhawks 291 COMMENTS Falcons' Neal returns to practice, injury sidelines Ishmael Panthers' DeHaven steps down as co-ordinator to battle cancer Sports NHL MLB NBA NFL CFL SOCCER CURLING TENNIS AUTO RACING More MAGAZINE TELEVISION RADIO TIM & SID INSIDERS SN WORLD SN NOW RSS Social FACEBOOK TWITTER YOUTUBE GOOGLE+ About SN MEDIA CENTRE COMPANY INFO ADVERTISE FAQ FEEDBACK © 2000-2016 Rogers Media.

Photo: Marc-André Julien/Unsplash If you’re thinking of buying a new iPhone right now, don’t do it! You could save yourself a small fortune by delaying that purchase until September, when Apple is set to unveil the next models of its world-conquering smartphones. Saying that any new device gets cheaper the longer you wait to buy it may sound like stating the obvious, but we’ve been digging into our research. We’ll tell you when and how far iPhone prices will likely fall after the iPhone 7 launch so you can get an idea of whether it’s really worth waiting. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will almost certainly be unveiled in early September. The rumor mill has been grinding for months already, suggesting the new iPhones might be water-resistant, have Touch ID built into the screen, feature an updated Home button, and come without a headphone jack. There’s little doubt they’ll sport improved cameras and faster performance, but it’s best to take the rest of the rumors with a healthy pinch of salt. You always pay a premium to get the latest tech. But whatever Apple unveils this fall, last year’s iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are still going to be great smartphones, and we’re expecting to see a healthy discount for both. After the Apple announcement, it’s cheaper to buy last year’s iPhones When Apple unveils a new iPhone, it generally drops the prices of the earlier models by $100. It has a tiered pricing system, so the latest phone is $649 to buy outright or $199 on a two-year contract, and you can buy last year’s iPhone for a one-time payment of $549 or $99 on contract. The iPhone Plus models work exactly the same way, but start at $749 to buy outright and $299 on a two-year contract. If you want to buy a new iPhone 6s or 6s Plus, whether you buy on contract or pay the full price up front, it will be $100 cheaper as soon as the next iPhone is announced. T-Mobile has disrupted the standard two-year contract model by offering any iPhone model without any money down — by simply splitting the cost of the handset across 24 months. So, you’ll pay a higher monthly fee, but it will cover service and the iPhone’s price tag. The other carriers have followed suit, but be careful to calculate the full price you’ll pay on any deal before you pull the trigger. Older iPhones are cheaper still In the past, Apple has also dropped an extra $100 off the next model down, so when the iPhone 6s was announced, the iPhone 5s was made available for no upfront fee and monthly installments totaling $450. However, the release of the iPhone SE has muddied the waters a little here. It effectively replaced the iPhone 5s and is being offered for a one-time payment of $399, or for nothing up front with an installment plan. We don’t expect to see any further price drops on the iPhone SE. The question is whether the iPhone 6 will drop to $449 and be made available for nothing up front with installments, which is a definite possibility. Retailers and carriers offer deeper discounts Retailers and carriers sometimes offer aggressive discounts to try and draw in customers, but iPhones tend to hold their value very well, so you have to watch out for such deals. Discounts of more than $10 or so are pretty rare in the first six months; however, we saw $90 knocked off the price of the 16GB iPhone 6s at Boost Mobile and $50 off the 64GB model from eBay sellers in February, five months after release. It was a similar story with the iPhone 6, which dropped about $40 after seven months and then fell by as much as $150 in September 2015, when the iPhone 6s was unveiled. In February of this year — 17 months after release — the iPhone 6 dropped to $380 at Boost Mobile, and by May this year it was $399 at Walmart. Plus-size deals are harder to find The iPhone 6 Plus was Apple’s first larger smartphone, and it took a long while before we saw any discounting on that model. It was eight months before we saw an eBay seller offering a $90 discount, but it dropped by over $200 after around 19 months. And by May this year, it was $499 at Walmart. We haven’t seen any discounts of note for the iPhone 6s Plus yet. Some eBay vendors have dropped $50 and $150 off the price of the higher-capacity 64GB and 128GB models respectively, but that’s it so far. (The 128GB 6s Plus still costs a whopping $800 even at $150 off.) These discounts might be slightly bested when the iPhone 7 debuts, but we probably won’t see much deeper discounts than that for quite some time. Carriers entice consumers with ‘buy one, get one free’ deals One eye-catching iPhone 6s deal that was available just three months after release was AT&T‘s “buy one, get one free” offer. It wasn’t advertised for the iPhone 6s, though that model was eligible. You had to add a second line and commit to 30 months, but it was possible to claim bill credits for the full price back after three months. (This deal is no longer available at AT&T.) Sprint is still offering a deal like this on the iPhone 6s or the iPhone 6s Plus, if you’re willing to sign up for a second line with the carrier. Deals on the iPhone 7 If you’re already an iPhone owner, then you’ll find some attractive deals on the new iPhone if you’re willing to trade in your old handset. It’s also worth seeing what you can get in the secondhand market, because iPhones hold their value better than any other smartphone. You will generally make more by selling your iPhone directly than you will for trading it in, and you can put that extra money toward the new one. It’s likely to be at least six months before we see any significant discounting on the new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. But if you and your partner both want a new iPhone, then it’s worth watching out for “buy one, get one free” offers. Readers, do you opt for the newest iPhone or buy discounted older models?

But Cook did talk about a lot of other things Apple is working on, from taking the reins from Steve Jobs to what comes after the iPhone to who he turns to for advice. Here are some highlights (1,775 words!) from Cook’s interview: On the market for iPhones: Close to two-thirds of Apple’s sales are from iPhones, and Cook said that’s a privilege, not a problem for the company, even though growth in the smartphone industry has been flat as of late. But Cook insists that if you’re in it for the "long haul, this is the best market on earth." In fact, he’s sure that smartphones will be the only consumer product where the ratio of people to product will be one to one. And as artificial intelligence progresses, Cook said, iPhones will become even more essential. "The global market for smartphones is 1.4 billion," Cook told The Washington Post. "Over time, I’m convinced every person in the world will have a smartphone. That may take a while, and they won’t all have iPhones. But it is the greatest market on earth from a consumer electronics point of view." "AI will make this product even more essential to you. It will become even a better assistant than it is today. So where you probably aren’t leaving home without it today — you’re really going to be connected to it in the future. That level of performance is going to skyrocket. And there is nothing that’s going to replace it in the short term or in the intermediate term either." On pleasing investors: It turns out that Cook isn’t fazed by analysts who say the better days of iPhones are behind Apple. That’s mostly, he said, because analysts have always doubted the company. "They were saying it in 2007 — ‘this stupid iPhone, whoever dreamed up this thing?’ Then they were saying that we peaked in 2010, then it was 2011. We got to $60 billion [in revenue], and they said you can’t grow anymore from this. Well, last year we were $230 billion. And, yes, we’re coming down some this year. Every year isn’t an up, you know. I’ve heard all of it before." But investors looking for a short-term return get impatient. While Cook said the company welcomes all types of investors, he makes it clear that the company is focused on the long-term. And the investors who stick around end up going home with a good chunk of change, he said. "I think for investors that are focused on the long term, if you look at how we’ve done in the past five years, our total shareholder return is over 100 percent. That’s a pretty good number. And I think most people that have been in the stock for that period of time are probably pretty happy." On succeeding Steve Jobs: When he took over as Apple’s CEO, Cook expected that his predecessor, Steve Jobs, would be around for a while as a chairman and adviser. He said he convinced himself that Jobs would bounce back, "because he always did." Cook wasn’t prepared to lose him so quickly. But he also isn’t trying to replace him. "To me, Steve’s not replaceable. By anyone. [Voice softens] He was an original of a species. I never viewed that was my role. I think it would have been a treacherous thing if I would have tried to do it. When I first took the job as CEO, I actually thought that Steve would be here for a long time. Because he was going to be chairman, work a bit less after he came back up the health curve. So I went into it with one thought, and then weeks later — six weeks later, whatever —" On being outspoken on social issues: Cook gave companies that choose not to be outspoken about particular social issues a pass, saying, "Maybe they have compelling reasons to be silent." But, given Apple’s mission to empower people through its products, it isn’t a company that can have a CEO that sits on the sidelines. It’s part of why Cook decided to write an op-ed about being gay for the Washington Post. According to Cook, he would receive letters from kids who were pushed out from their families, or faced other obstacles as a result of being openly gay. "I thought it would minimally say you can do pretty good in this world and be gay," Cook said. "That it’s not a limiter. It’s okay to be. That it’s okay to be honest about it." According to Cook, he thought about what to write in the op-ed for one year before publishing it. And he reached out to television newsman Anderson Cooper for advice, because he admired how Cooper himself came out as a gay man. "I wanted it to be in a business [publication]. That’s what I know, that’s who I am. There was a lot of work there. I visited people. I talked to Anderson Cooper at length — multiple times. Because I thought that the way that he handled his announcement was really classy. I was getting advice from people who I thought were really great people who had really deeply thought about it." On who he reaches out to for advice: Who does the CEO of a company like Apple turn to for advice? Warren Buffett, and former President Bill Clinton, apparently. "When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn’t have a bias? So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he’s the natural person, and so I try to go through that process on everyone. That doesn’t mean I always do what they say. " For advice on how to face Congress during the 2013 investigation of Apple’s tax practices, Cook turned to former president Clinton and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. On Apple’s public battle with the FBI: When the FBI asked Apple to unlock the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone, the first question the company asked itself was: Could they build a tool to unlock it? In a few days, the team at Apple, led by SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi, determined that they could technically build a tool to unlock the phone. Then it became a question of ethics. It boiled down to whether the unlocking technology could be leaked. "We thought, you know, that depends on whether we could contain it or not. Other people were involved in this, too — deep security experts and so forth, and it was apparent from those discussions that we couldn’t be assured. The risk of what happens if it got out, we felt, could be incredibly terrible for public safety." Cook said the cards were stacked against Apple, and the company was worried that, for the public, the question was a matter of security versus privacy. "It became clear that the trade-off, so to speak, was essentially putting hundreds of millions of people at risk for a phone that may or may not have anything on it, and that likely didn’t, because of other things that we knew about. We thought this actually is a clear decision. A hard one, but a clear one. Then it became more of a matter of how do we explain this. Because this is not easy. You can imagine. You just hear: locked phone. Terrorist. People dead. Why aren’t you unlocking this?" As for how the debacle changed Cook’s point of view on the government’s role: "Honestly? I was shocked that they would even ask for this. That was the thing that was so disappointing that I think everybody lost in the whole thing. There are 200-plus other countries in the world. Zero of them had ever asked this." On mistakes: Maps, apparently, was a big mistake. "Today we have a product we’re proud of. [But] we had the self-honesty to admit this wasn’t our finest hour and the courage to choose another way of doing it. That’s important. It’s the only way an organization learns. The classic big-company mistake is to not admit their mistake. They double down on them." And, so was hiring former Dixons CEO John Browett to replace Ron Johnson as the SVP of retail, who left the company after six months. "That was clearly a screw-up. I’m not saying anything bad about him. He didn’t fit here culturally is a good way to describe it. We all talked to him, and I made the final decision, and it was wrong. We fairly quickly recognized it and made a change. And I’m proud we did that." On successors: Cook said he is already looking for someone he could appoint to take over if something ever went wrong. In fact, he talks about who might succeed him at the end of every board meeting. "We have the good discipline to do that. Then my role is to make sure that the board has great candidates to pick from internally. And I take that role extremely seriously. Look around at the great people I get to work with — there’s some really just superb talent in the company." On artificial intelligence: In response to a question on how he would "catch up" with Google's, Amazon's and Facebook’s AI efforts, Cook said: 1) we’re not behind, and 2) Siri. Siri has been around since 2011, and it’s only getting smarter, Cook said. Siri’s predictive capabilities are getting better, and now that Apple has opened Siri up to third-party developers the feature’s capabilities are being broadened. "But there are other things in there, like if you’re typing in mail, the prediction capability of the next word or next phrase that you will use has just — Siri has gotten a lot smarter about that. I’ve been using it for a while, but if you haven’t used it you should try it. The ability to recognize faces in photos and put those into the modern equivalent of a photo album — we call this product Memories." Cook said he isn’t worried about privacy issues when it comes to AI, because "talented people" are on it. "There’s a new technology called differential privacy which essentially looks at large data sets to predict user behaviors and requests without going to the precise individual, which might violate privacy." On the "secret" Apple car project: "We’ve always viewed that people love surprises. We don’t have enough anymore in our lives." recode_divider More From Recode Recode Daily: Facebook built a censorship tool that could help it get back into China Can the journalists who work for Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner still cover the White House fairly?

While there are keyboard options for the iPad Pro out there that don’t double as a protective case, we like the ones that add extra protection. That way, you’re protecting your investment and you always have a keyboard handy when you need it. After all, the touchscreen keyboard just isn’t the same as a traditional one. Many of the cases will even make you feel like you’re using a touchscreen MacBook, with their very laptop-esque designs. They also come in a range of price points, so you don’t necessarily need to spend a lot to gain a physical keyboard. Related: The pen is mightier than the finger… at least if you opt for one of these styli Below are our picks for the eight best keyboard cases to consider for the 9.7 model, followed by eight more for the original 12.9-inch model. Keyboards for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro Apple Smart Keyboard We’d be remiss not to start out with Apple’s Smart Keyboard. The keyboard connects via the Smart Connector instead of Bluetooth, allowing you to avoid the virtual keyboard on the Pro in favor of something more physical. Each of the keyboard’s 64 keys is water-resistant and crafted with a durable, custom-woven fabric, providing durability as well as spring-like tension when pressed. It’s foldable, too, and outfitted with a conductive material that allows for the two-way flow of both power and data. No charging. No Bluetooth. Buy one now from: Apple Zagg Slim Book Pro If you want to go more for the traditional laptop feel when it comes to your keyboard case, Zagg’s Slim Book Pro is your best bet. The case is fashioned to look more like a notebook when attached to the iPad Pro, so it’s a bit bulkier than the first two options. The case’s unique hinge allows for 135 degrees of adjustment, while island-style keys let you comfortably type as if you were using a traditional keyboard. The keys are even backlit and make use of the integrated battery, which is conveniently designed to last for up to two years on a single charge. Buy one now from: Amazon Zagg Zagg Messenger Universal If the Slim Book Pro is a bit much, the cheaper Messenger Universal might be a worthy alternative. Like the Slim Book Pro, it grants you 135 degrees of adjustment and a 12-inch keyframe outfitted with island-style keys, but in a folio form factor that cuts down on some bulk. With the cheaper price comes a bit of trade-off, as reviewers report the keyboard isn’t as comfortable to type on and you lose the backlit keys. Buy one now from: Amazon Brydge BrydgePro Keyboard Another entrant for laptop-style cases is the Brydge BrydgePro. The case is made out of 100 percent aluminum, and on the 12.9-inch model, Brydge says the combined weight is less than the MacBook Air, so it weighs even less with the 9.7-inch model. The BrydgePro uses Bluetooth to connect to the iPad Pro, and it features backlit keys with adjustable brightness. One thing we really like is the hinge is able to swing 180 degrees, allowing you to use it as a tablet when you need to. Buy one now from: Amazon Best Buy Logitech Create Logitech partnered with Apple to design the Create, and it shows. But one place where the Create shines is in price, which is less than Apple’s for the same features. Like the Smart Keyboard, it uses the Smart Connector to connect to your iPad Pro, meaning it will automatically power on and pair with the Pro when you connect it via the direct magnetic connection. Another positive is that it’s a full-size keyboard and feels a lot more natural than Apple’s own keyboard, reviewers report. Buy one now from: Logitech Incipio ClamCase+ Incipio’s ClamCase+ is a little bit on the pricey side, but on style and functionality more than makes up for it. The case around the iPad adds very little bulk, so the overall thickness is not much more than a MacBook Air. It features a backlit keyboard and a smart hinge to put the iPad Pro to sleep and wake it automatically to maximize battery life. Buy one now from: Incipio Targus VersaType Keyboard and Case Are you one of those folks who appreciate an iPad case with a stand, but still need a keyboard to type in those notes or that next presentation? The VersaType might be the case for you. The case protecting the iPad actually swivels on the keyboard base, allowing you to place your iPad Pro in a variety of different display configurations depending on what you’re doing. It’s got great battery life, lasting 130 hours of use on a single charge according to Targus. Buy one now from: Amazon Best Buy Griffin SnapBook Griffin makes some bold claims about its SnapBook keyboard and case, claiming it will survive — and protect — your iPad from six-foot drops onto concrete. While its keyboard isn’t as comfortable or full featured as some of the other options on our list, it is ruggedized and made of a material that also doubles as protection for your screen. As for truth to the claims of toughness? We’ll let you test that out. Buy one now from: Amazon Griffin Next Page 1 of 2 Keyboards for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro Keyboards for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro

Giants WR Victor Cruz in Sunday's practice Rookie wide receiver Sterling Shepard was a full participant in Sunday's practice after leaving Friday's preseason opener with a sore groin. Shepard was evaluated after individual drills and cleared for team periods. "I think he was a little sore too, but he fought through it," coach Ben McAdoo said. "He got a little more than anticipated." Rookie cornerback Eli Apple was dressed for practice, but worked on the side with other injured players. Apple has a slight muscle strain in his left leg. The team's first-round pick underwent an MRI on Saturday and everything checked out. Apple was on the field taking mental reps during the walkthrough at the end of Sunday's practice. It's not clear yet when Apple will be fully cleared to return to action. "It is going to be fine and it is a matter of just taking it day by day," Apple said. Cruz limited by groin injury Apple worked alongside wide receiver Geremy Davis, who suffered a mild hamstring strain in Friday's preseason game, defensive end Kerry Wynn, who has been sidelined with a groin injury since last Thursday, and linebacker J.T. Thomas, who remains on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list with a hamstring injury. Thomas is the only player remaining on the PUP list after defensive tackle Jay Bromley returned to practice on Sunday. Bromley had been on the PUP list for the first two weeks of training camp after having bone spurs removed from his ankle. "It feels good to be back on the field finally," Bromley said. "It's been way too long." Middle linebacker Keenan Robinson also returned to practice after being sidelined for nearly a week with a groin injury. Tight end Will Johnson, who suffered a burner in Friday's game, was not at practice. Dan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @DDuggan21.

Jump to navigation You are here Home Report: MacBook Pro, iPhone 7 reveal on September 7 Submitted by Fred Straker on August 14, 2016 - 2:40pm It's been four years since Apple has significantly updated the MacBook Pro, and change is on the horizon. While media reports have pointed to some interesting features in the pipeline, there has been some debate over when Apple will choose to reveal the new model line. The Michael Report now states with certainty that Apple will launch the MacBook Pro and iPhone 7 at the same event. Not only this but their sources, who are said to be involved in the event planning, have confirmed an event date of Wednesday, September 7th. The news comes hot on the heels of several new leaks surrounding the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus design. New photos from Letem světem Applem (LsA) confirm the form factor will be similar to the current iPhone 6s. Shown above in gold, it's clear the iPhone 7 will feature redesigned antenna bands, however the bottom of the device cannot be seen. Apple is expected to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack, replacing it with another microphone and a symmetrical grille matching the speaker side. The larger iPhone 7 Plus sports a dual-camera, which can be seen in the wider camera lens opening at the corner of the device. Some reports indicate the iPhone 7 Plus will come in two different models, one with a standard camera and an iPhone Plus Pro with the dual-lens assembly. When it comes to the MacBook Pro, several improvements are expected: - A thinner profile - Updated processors and higher performance graphics - New colors including space gray and gold - A touch screen display strip above the keyboard that can change for each app Look for invites to this highly-anticipated Apple press event to hit soon, as the date is fast approaching. There's little doubt that more details on these upcoming products will surface over the next three weeks. tags:  News Rumors Macbook Pro iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus Apple Keynote More Like This iPhone 7: Larger camera assemblies confirmed iPhone 7 smart connector, dual-camera confirmed? iPhone 7 design confirmed in new photos [video] Report: iPhone 7 has TrueTone display, water resistance and more Apple sends invites to media event on September 7 Add new comment Main menu iphonefaq news faq guides tips search about contact Recent FAQs How do I set a song to repeat in the Music app on my iPhone?

Tim Cook Reflects on His First Five Years as CEO→ Linked By John Voorhees The Washington Post has an extensive interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook about his first five years leading the company. Jena McGregor, who writes a daily column about leadership for the Post, spoke to Cook twice, including shortly after the one billionth iPhone was sold. The interview is a great read and spans a wide array of topics that together paint a picture of how Cook approaches his role. Regarding his desire to not be a traditional CEO, Cook explained: I think of a traditional CEO as being divorced from customers. A lot of consumer company CEOs — they’re not really interacting with consumers. I also think that the traditional CEO believes his or her job is the profit and loss, is the revenue statement, the income and expense, the balance sheet. Those are important, but I don’t think they’re all that’s important. There’s an incredible responsibility to the employees of the company, to the communities and the countries that the company operates in, to people who assemble its products, to developers, to the whole ecosystem of the company. Asked about Apple's long-term growth prospects, Cook highlighted services and the iPad Pro, which is increasingly being used in enterprise environments: In today’s products we have services [iCloud, App Store, Apple Pay and the like], which over the last 12 months grew about $4 billion to over $23 billion [in sales]. Next year we’ve said it’s going to be a Fortune 100 company in size. What else? IPad. The iPad Pro. What we saw in this past quarter is that about half of the people who are buying one are using it at work. We have an enormous opportunity in enterprise. Last year we did $25 billion or so in it around the world. We’re collaborating much better with key partners because it’s important, if you’re making a decision to use our products or anybody’s products in the enterprise, that they work well together. On social issues, Cook discussed how Apple's stance on civil rights and climate change fit with its approach to customers and the products Apple creates: I think everybody has to make their own decision about it. Maybe there are compelling reasons why some people want to be silent. I think for us, though — for a company that’s all about empowering people through our products, and being a collection of people whose goal in life is to change the world for the better — it doesn’t sit right with me that you have that kind of focus, but you’re not making sure your carbon footprint isn’t poisoning the place. Or that you’re not evangelizing moving human rights forward. I think every generation has the responsibility to enlarge the meaning of human rights. When asked about mistakes made during his tenure as CEO, Cook echoed comments made to Fast Company regarding Maps, but also discussed the hiring of John Browett to lead Apple's retail team: I hired the wrong person for retail [former Dixons CEO John Browett] initially. That was clearly a screw-up. I’m not saying anything bad about him. He didn’t fit here culturally is a good way to describe it. We all talked to him, and I made the final decision, and it was wrong. We fairly quickly recognized it and made a change. And I’m proud we did that. McGregor's experience writing about leadership is evident from her interview with Cook. The questions go well beyond the kind of things Cook is typically asked about Apple, capturing more about him as an individual and his leadership style than most interviews that I've read.

Apple's CEO walked on stage at a special employee meeting that day, and said that the iPhone had become more than a constant companion. iPhone is truly an essential part of our daily life and enables much of what we do throughout the day. Last week we passed another major milestone when we sold the billionth iPhone. We never set out to make the most, but we've always set out to make the best products that make a difference. Thank you to everyone at Apple for helping change the world every day.' On that day the Washington Post sat down with Apple's CEO for an interview that was published today in a report titled "Tim Cook, the interview: Running Apple 'is sort of a lonely job.' A few weeks later, Cook would mark the fifth anniversary of what has been the most closely watched transition of power in corporate history. Cook stated that "It feels like it was yesterday in some respects."   It is fitting that these two milestones arrive so close together. That's because the iPhone, launched by Jobs, has been the biggest driver of Apple's massive growth during Cook's tenure. It led the company to soaring valuations and accounted for nearly two-thirds of Apple's revenue in the past year. Just the tally on iPhone sales, almost $141 billion over the past four quarters, is more than the annual sales figures of Cisco, Disney and Nike — combined.   Two Interesting Short Videos       Tim Cook: I thought a lot of the focus and interest from the media for Apple was mostly due to Steve [Jobs]. When I became CEO, particularly after his passing, that that scrutiny and interest level would go down. That more came because of him than the company itself. And boy was I wrong about that. And if anything it began to rise partly because the media environment, there more people that were journalists, social media was exploding and out of that folks can praise significant and they could flog significantly and you quickly learn that you have to develop a very thick skin – sort of a rhinoceros skin.   One of the things that I recognize is that Steve had done this for years, where its true that some of the praise would accrue to him, it was equally true that if somebody was not happy about something, that would also accrue, so in that regard, he was kind of a heat shield for us and provided a level of cover, so to speak, beyond what I had fully comprehended when I became CEO.       One aspect of the Washington Post article provides us with a look at Tim Cook in the bigger picture. On Cook's first day on the job he sent out a memo to company employees and said that "I want you to be confident that Apple is not going to change." And yet five years later we that Apple has most definitely changed under Tim Cook.   Under Tim Cook, Apple is now more systematic, more transparent, more team-oriented, more humble. "He has engaged on social issues more than most CEOs, writing op-eds on legislation that limits gay rights and making the extraordinary decision earlier this year to oppose the FBI's request to unlock the San Bernardino killer's phone.   As CEO, he gets high marks for managing the company's growth, keeping margins high and expanding further into markets such as China (Apple had four retail stores in China five years ago. Today it has 41.) He has pushed into the enterprise market, grown Apple's product lineup and positioned Apple to make more money off the devices it's already sold: Its services business, which includes things like iTunes, iCloud and a mobile payments service, is projected to be the size of a Fortune 100 business next year — all on its own. Apple remains the most valuable and most profitable company in the S&P 500 index.   Yet as the company deals with declining sales in its major device categories and in markets like China, critics and some investors have fretted about Apple's innovation mojo under Cook. The first all-new device during his tenure, the Apple Watch, is not yet a mega hit. The iPhone juggernaut faces a saturated smartphone market, growing competition from low-cost start-ups and longer upgrade windows from consumers. Rumored big concepts behind the curtain — such as a reported car project — appear to be years away."   Yet most believe that it's the next five years that will define Tim Cook's reign as Apple's CEO. One thing is for sure, Tim Cook still believes that Apple's North Star has always been the same: making insanely great products that really change the world in some way — enrich people's lives.   Cook noted at one point of the interview that "To me, Steve's not replaceable. By anyone. [Voice softens] He was an original of a species. I never viewed that as my role. I think it would have been a treacherous thing if I would have tried to do it. When I first took the job as CEO, I actually thought that Steve would be here for a long time. Because he was going to be chairman, work a bit less after he came back up the health curve. I thought that he would bounce back.   The Washington Post's article on Tim Cook is lenghy and a great Sunday read touching on a wide variety of topics including AI and beyond.

And when your profits totalled $53bn (£41bn) last year there aren’t many above you in the pecking order. So spare a brief thought for the bosses at Apple who, faced with a sales decline the size of which they haven’t seen for 15 years, are now tasked with inventing yet another reason for their fans to splash a week’s wages or more on a new gadget. For that is the task facing Tim Cook and co when, next month, Apple releases the 10th generation of the iPhone. The annual launch event is a key date in any techie’s calendar, even if many argue that the annual upgrades have become less exciting in recent years since most of the low hanging fruit – a bigger screen, downloadable apps, a better camera – have already been plucked, and consumers’ attention shifts to new software instead. This year, though, is different. Apple is told every year that its innovative streak is waning, but it has always been able to point to improving iPhone sales. Now they are diminishing for the first time. The company is hardly about to re-mortgage the estate of course, but investors would certainly like sales to start heading north again after two quarters of decline. Given that, the casual observer might take a cursory look at the Apple rumour mill and think the pressure has gone to executives’ heads. The flurry of leaks and whispers, which reaches fever pitch at this time of year, suggests that the next iPhone will have few cosmetic changes to get excited about. It will look largely the same as the last two years’ models, and not (that we know of) have a killer feature entice people to upgrade such as a fingerprint reader or Siri assistant. About | iPhone 7 Instead, it appears, the defining feature of the “iPhone 7” will instead be removing a key feature of not only every iPhone since 2007 but that has been a fixture in consumer electronics since the Sony Walkman made portable music possible in 1979: the humble headphone jack, which every set of headphones in the world supports. Instead, it will encourage listeners to use either headphones that connect via the phone’s charging port or wirelessly. In one fell swoop Apple will, if we are to believe the hype machine, render millions of pairs of headphones, many of them costing hundreds of pounds, obsolete (or at least require them to use a fiddly dongle). iPhone 7 - the rumour round-up Play! 02:26 Even before the new phone is actually announced, this has generated fierce resistance. 300,000 people have signed a petition urging the company to change its mind. And this is before most people even know it is happening. Imagine the response when it becomes official. Given that Apple is trying to reverse its first sales decline in 13 years, such a controversial move might it is not in the company’s best interest. But a look at its history shows it is a move right out of the Apple playbook. The 3.5mm headphone port – which appears on every computer, mp3 player and almost every smartphone – is more than 50 years old. It is based on technology that was invented in the 19th century. If you were to build a smartphone and set of headphones from scratch today, without any regard for current standards, you certainly wouldn’t invent the analogue port found on today’s iPhone. controversial decisions that made the iPhone better Apple has controversially dropped several technologies over the years: The laptop DVD drive, removable phone batteries, the floppy disk, Adobe Flash. Apple was ahead of the market in getting rid of all of these, allowing engineering improvements such as thinner devices or bigger batteries. With all of them, the transition was painful, but none of them do we really miss now, and Apple has. I would be that in a couple of years, the same is likely to be true of the headphone jack, which are likely to be replaced by less-fiddly wireless technology. It’s the sort of move that Apple, which tends to be followed by the rest of its field, is uniquely capable of pulling off. The analysts, at least, don’t believe it will be a step too far: UBS forecasts sales rising by 5pc next year, and 18pc the one after that. Amazon’s aerial ambition Nobody quite believed Jeff Bezos three years ago when he showed off tightly-held plans for an Amazon delivery drone, able to take parcels from warehouse to front door in less than half an hour. Many still don’t, even as the company begins advanced tests of the technology in Cambridgeshire. But increasingly, the project is rapidly looking not just like a reality, but a necessity. Even as the retailer’s sales continue to grow enormously, its profit margins could be a little healthier to put it mildly. About | Amazon’s drones A big reason for this is shipping costs, which have soared amid the rapid growth of the Prime memberships that allow next-day, same-day and, in some cities, next-hour delivery. The army of moped, van and truck drivers required for this does not come cheap: Amazon’s shipping costs, as a percentage of net sales, have soared from 7pc in 2009 to 11pc today. Bezos is putting many millions into his drone project if Amazon’s publicly-disclosed R&D spending, which outstrips that of Google, Apple and Microsoft, is anything to go by. But given its need to make delivery cheaper as shoppers demand ever-faster service, the expense could well be worth it.

By Ritesh Bendre | Published: August 14, 2016 7:39 PM IST Email @GadgetFreak4U comments Tags: Apple Apple iPhone 7 Apple iPhone 7 Plus News The Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus leaks and rumors are shaping up to be a never-ending mystery. Ahead of the rumored September 7 launch, new batch of iPhone 7 Plus photos have surfaced online — this time in the new black color that’s expected to launch. The newly leaked photos show off the iPhone 7 Plus from different angles. As we can see in the leaked photos, the front panel shows off the rumored pressure-sensitive Touch ID sensor. On the right edge, we can see the power / sleep button and the nano-SIM card tray, whereas the right edge shows off the volume buttons and the ring / silent button. Turn to the back and we can see the dual camera lens module along with LED flash on the top left, the Smart Connector pins at the bottom and redesigned antenna lines too. Also, the bottom panel shows off the lightning port flanked by speaker grill. The leaked photos once again confirm the lack of traditional 3.5mm audio port. ALSO READ: Apple iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus to reportedly launch on September 7 Now, here’s where the mystery begins. We first heard that Apple will release three smartphones this year – the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus with dual camera setup at the back and the iPhone 7 Plus with dual camera setup and Smart Connector pins to connect external accessories such as smart keyboard. Now, according to latest reports, the ‘pro’ model may not show up this year. However, with the latest photos showing off dual camera setup and Smart Connector pins, it remains to be seen if Apple will release all three smartphones or will it introduce the Smart Connector pins on the ‘plus’ variant. From rumors that we have come across, the new iPhones are likely to be powered by Apple’s A10 Chip, 2GB of RAM (3GB on Plus variant) and base storage could start at 32GB. A recent report also hinted that the new smartphones could get the resolution upgrade that they deserve. The iPhone 7 could come with 4.7-inch full HD (1080p) display and the iPhone 7 Plus could come with 5.5-inch QHD HD (1440x2560pixels) display. Both smartphones are also expected to come with improved water resistance capabilities. We expect to come details to pour in as the launch draws closer. Apple could host the launch event on September 7 and the sales are expected to kick-off starting September 16.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Apple iPhone 7 Latest Rumors: New Specs and Release Date Revealed in Leak By Neal A. Lasta Aug 14, 2016 | 9:34 AM Apple users have been anticipating for a long time what the iPhone 7 will look like. Pictures have been leaked, showing some of the iPhone 7's external features. The iPhone 7's new features and specs include the absence of a headphone jack and a refurbished home screen button. Here are some of the rumored new features of the iPhone 7 to date. No Headphone Jack According to Fast Company, the Apple iPhone 7 won't have a 3.5 mm headphone jack. With that, the smartphone will be much thinner than its predecessor. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Wired headphones can still be used through a Lightning cable port, which can also be utilized to transfer data and to charge. Wireless headphones are also an option. There are pictures circulating in the internet, showing the bundled Lightning earpods for the new iPhone. It looks similar to the earpods of the previous iPhones that use 3.5 mm jacks, but the main difference is the connector, which features a reversible Lightning port. Stereo Speaker Leaked photos reveal extra space in the iPhone 7 for another speaker, which implies that this next Apple smartphone might feature stereo speakers; a first among Apple iPhones. On the other hand, other rumors suggest there won't be stereo speakers in place of the missing headphone jack. Instead, the claimed schematics show that there are grills beside the lightning port, which are there for aesthetic purposes, but not speakers. Front Flash Assembly instructions have supposedly leaked from the plants manufacturing the latest iPhones. The leaks show that the iPhone 7 design is pretty much similar to that of iPhone 6, except for minor changes in the antenna lines design and the absence of the headphone jack. But these instructions also say "Strobe lens and LED," which may imply that the front-facing camera used for selfies may incorporate flash. Pressure-Sensitive Home Button New photos show the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus exteriors, showing screen assembly that doesn't have the standard home button cutouts. This probably means that the previous rumors are true; Apple will use Force Touch-like tech for the home button, combined with a sensor for fingerprint identification. Schedule of Release No one's 100% sure about the schedule of release, although this is a favorite topic in the iPhone 7 rumor mill. According to Evan Blass, a mobile reporter for Venture Beat, in a tweet, "iPhone 2016 release: week of September 12th." He followed up with a tweet saying, "Just to clarify, this refers to the retail release, not the launch event. To be even more specific, it should happen on Friday, Sept. 16th". Blass is seen as a reliable source for leaks, as he has demonstrated accurate predictions in the past.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) Share Written by Mike Murphy August 14, 2016 Reports are suggesting that the next iPhone may be a bit underwhelming, but at least—according to a new patent awarded to Apple—it might be waterproof. The patent, granted this week and first uncovered by Patently Apple, outlines a system for color-balancing photos shot underwater. Presumably if Apple is working on technology to make sure photos taken underwater come out looking good, the company would also be ensuring that the phones themselves are waterproof. The patent doesn’t really get into the mechanics of the devices that would be required to run this sort of underwater photography software, but it does mention that it could “operate on mobile devices,” specifically mentioning Apple’s iPhone and iPad lines. Currently, Apple doesn’t make any mobile devices that are waterproof, but there are many third-party iPhone cases that aim to make the phone waterproof. A scuba selfie—a scelfie? (US Patent and Trademark Office) While it’s possible that Apple could be working on software that helps non-waterproof phones take better photos underwater, it seems more likely that it would be working on software like this for forthcoming phones that are actually waterproof. And there are other indications that the company’s next phone, likely called the iPhone 7, will be waterproof. Reports are suggesting that Apple will be removing the headphone jack on the iPhone 7—one of the easiest places for water to seep into a smartphone. The rumored move to not include a headphone jack generated ire, suggesting that by shunning wired headphones Apple would effectively stop people from listening to pirated music. Headphone jacks are analog technology, whereas the iPhone 7 will likely use the Lightning charging jack to connect headphones, which is digital. As Nilay Patel argued for The Verge, Apple could easily include software that would prevent illegally downloaded or streamed content from being played through the Lightning port, something that wasn’t possible with the standard headphone jack. In the future, Instagram will be packed with images of fish like this. (US Patent and Trademark Office) As the patent images suggest, it might be nice to take decent photos of fishes while scuba diving on vacation. But consider what you’d be giving up to do that. Then again, other companies have managed to keep the standard headphone jack and make their phones waterproof. For example, all three of Samsung’s flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, and the Note 7, are water-resistant and work with regular headphones. There’s no guarantee that Apple is working on turning this patent into a working product, and the company wasn’t immediately available to comment on its plans for the patent. It’s looking like we’ll have to wait until the first week of September to find out what Apple has in store for the next iPhone, and whether we’ll be able to use it to take underwater photos, or pour champagne all over them, as Samsung suggests we do.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook calls Warren Buffett, Lloyd Blankfein, and Bill Clinton for advice Kif Leswing Aug. 14, 2016, 12:20 PM 25,361 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Running Apple is a lonely job, according to CEO Tim Cook. It's hard work, with long hours, and you have to make decisions that affect tens of thousands of employees.  But he has a few people he can turn to for advice, Cook revealed in a lengthy interview with The Washington Post.  Those people happen to be former President Bill Clinton, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, and investing legend Warren Buffett.  That's because they understand what Cook is going through, whether it's testifying before Congress or figuring out how big a dividend Apple should issue.  Cook said:  "When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn’t have a bias? So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he’s the natural person, and so I try to go through that process on everyone. That doesn’t mean I always do what they say. But I think it’s incumbent on a CEO to not just listen to points of view but to actually solicit them. Because I think, if not, you quickly become insular. And you’re sort of living in the echo chamber." He continued:  "For the hearing [about Apple’s tax practices in 2013], I’ve never testified in front of Congress before. So I called up [Goldman Sachs CEO] Lloyd Blankfein, because I looked back to say who’s done this before? I knew Lloyd and thought he’d be honest with me. I called up President Clinton. He knows a lot about the politics. I’d not met him through a political connection. I’d met him through the foundation. I went to Laurene, Steve’s wife. Laurene has the lens of knowing me and deeply understanding Apple." Cook isn't the only tech mogul to have Buffett's ear. Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Buffett have a famous friendship going back 25 years that not only includes philanthropic joint ventures but also sleepovers and cookies for breakfast.  Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, invested $1 billion in Apple earlier this year.  Cook has other connections to the Clintons, as well. Cook hosted a fundraiser for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the Bay Area last month.   Cook may have been introduced to Blankfein by Peter Oppenheimer, who used to be Apple's CFO until he retired in 2014. He now sits on the Goldman Sachs board of directors. Regardless, it's clear that Cook gets advice from some very powerful people.  The entire interview at The Washington Post is a fantastic, revealing read, that touches on Apple's augmented-reality ambitions, its tax strategy, Steve Jobs, and Cook's philosophy as CEO >>  SEE ALSO: Apple has a funny way of naming its holding companies NOW WATCH: Here’s where Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs started as interns Loading video...

According to Forbes, the iPhone 7 is slated for release on September 16 of this year, just over a month away. The Forbes report on an iPhone 7 release date originally sourced a Bloomberg article, which said the iPhone 7 would be announced on September 7 at an event hosted by Apple. The original wording of the Bloomberg article – which Forbes posted on its own site – says the following. “Somewhat burying the headline in an article about MacBook Pro upgrades [more on that shortly], Bloomberg has casually confirmed that Apple will launch the iPhone 7 at an event on September 7th… What’s more September 7th ties in perfectly with news last month from Evan Blass (aka @evleaks) that pre-orders for the iPhone 7 will begin on September 9th, with a subsequent release date of September 16th.” It is unknown why Bloomberg changed its article to remove the September 16 iPhone 7 release date, but it does not change its reporting on the expected iPhone 7 announcement on September 7. The iPhone 7 release date is expected to be September 16, according to reports. [Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] iPhone 7 Features So we have been reporting for some time that the iPhone 7 release date was expected to come in September 2016, at the earliest. But what will be the features of the new phone once the iPhone 7 release date is set in stone? According to Forbes, it will be disappointing for diehard Apple fans. Why? The reason why is the iPhone 8. Wait, you say. Why are we talking about the iPhone 8 when we just literally reported a supposed launch date for the iPhone 7? According to Forbes and other outlets that follow technology, the iPhone 8 is going to be the big, new device with all the fancy features. “Part of that disappointment comes from the leaks around the iPhone 8 that make it sound like the real ‘next generation iPhone,'” Forbes reported. “Why would anyone go for the incremental upgrade of the iPhone 7 when the iPhone 8 is updating so much more?” What could hurt sales of the iPhone 7 upon its release date is the expected 2017 launch of the iPhone 8. [Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images]They make a point that many iPhone users may agree with, but we have yet to see how the potential release of the iPhone 8 in 2017 – some 10 years after Apple co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the original ground-breaking iPhone to the world – could impact sales. No Stereo Speakers? While we know the iPhone 7 is likely for a release next month and we also know the iPhone 8 is likely to have the most advanced features – causing some users to hold off on an upgrade – what we do not know is what exactly the iPhone 7 will have that could be considered ground-breaking. That said, Mashable is reporting that it has discovered at least one interesting design feature rumored to be in the new iPhone 7 just in time for rumors about its expected release date. The feature is somewhat odd for people like me, who stream music out of their phone during the work day or in the evenings while we cook or read. But Mashable says no stereo speakers are expected in the new iPhone 7 upon its release in September. “With less space to fit components, it would be tough to squeeze in a secondary speaker into the already tightly packed iPhone.” “Stereo speakers would be a good, but not great reason to ditch the headphone jack. But if that’s not the reason, then what will be? It’s starting to sound like whatever the reason is, it won’t be one we’ll be thrilled with.” So you read that correctly. The iPhone 7 release date of September 16 could introduce users like me to a world without included stereo speakers we have come to love. Instead, for quality sound, we’d need to use either an iPad Pro or possibly – and this is a stretch – purchase external speakers that connect via Bluetooth. What do you think? Are you excited about the iPhone 7 release date or will you wait for the iPhone 8 in 2017? And should Apple ditch the stereo speakers in the iPhone 7? Tell us in the comments section below.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Latest iPhone 7 leak reveals Space Black, dual cameras, Smart Connector Adam Westlake - Aug 14, 2016 5 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit With Apple expected to announce the iPhone 7 in early September, we continue to see purported leaked images showing potential new colors, dual cameras on the rear of the larger Plus device, and of the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack. Another set of new images has surfaced this weekend, once again revealing a new, darker black color option, and a three-dot Smart Connector on the back. The images first appeared on the Chinese website MyDrivers, which is a known source of leaks from the supply chain. One of the first things that’s noticeable is that the device almost certainly the larger iPhone 7 Plus (or Pro). Also prominent is the dual-lens camera set-up, which we often hear will be exclusive to the Plus, while the regular iPhone 7 will stick with a single lens. Those who are looking forward to a darker color option than the Space Grey that Apple has stuck with for last few years will be happy to see more evidence that a true black iPhone is on the way. There were originally rumors and images indicating Apple was going to introduce a “deep blue” color option, a first for the iPhone, but it’s become clear that the Space Black from the Apple Watch is what will debut in September. The new photos also offer a clear look at the bottom of the device, revealing the standard headphone jack has been replaced with another grille. Recent evidence has suggested that it may not actually be a stereo speaker arrangement, but instead just a symmetric design. Lastly we see the rear of the iPhone 7 sporting a Smart Connector, which has only appeared on the iPad Pro before now. This feature is honestly the biggest mystery, as we sometimes hear it will be included on the Plus model, and other times that it won’t turn up at all. It’s also unknown exactly what the connector would be used for, but some possibilities include a new charging method, or as a way to attach accessories like external batteries. The good news in all this is that while we may have a solid idea of what to expect from the iPhone 7, we’re less than a month away from finding out for sure, so all the speculation and leaks will soon be over. Until next year, that is.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Apple has a funny way of naming its holding companies (AAPL) Sunday Aug 14, 2016 at 9:03 AM Kif Leswing AP Apple names some of its most opaque holding companies after kinds of apples. Apple is a vast company, with hundreds of subsidiaries, and operations in most countries. But the companies named after types of apples stand out.  Apple's made apple puns before. It named its line of computers after the Macintosh apple. But since then, the company hasn't named many products after apple varietals.  Instead, it names holding companies after the fruit — not for obvious types like Red Delicious or Granny Smith, but usually a more obscure type of apple. Apple has used some of these subsidiaries to reduce its tax bill, the New York Times reported in 2012, and Congress investigated in 2013, using a system called the Double Irish arrangement, which was eliminated in 2015.  Apple potentially faces what analysts have estimated to be as much as an $19 billion bill (or as little as $100 million) from European Union regulators over its Irish operations, although reportedly the EU investigation does not have anything to do with the Double Irish arrangement. That decision is expected to be handed down this fall.  Apple continues to employ holding companies named after apple types. Here are the ones we know about: Bramley General Partnership Wikipedia/Red58bill Apple created a new subsidiary called Apple Data Services Ireland in 2015. It's not immediately clear what falls under the subsidiary, but one possibility is that Apple is building a data center in Ireland which received approval earlier this week.  Apple Data Services Ireland was registered in late 2014 under the name Oconee. It lists Gene Daniel Levoff, Apple's VP of corporate governance, as a director. Wikipedia/Red58bill According to an annual report filed in July, there are 7000 shares of the company. Bramley General Partnership owns one of those 7000 shares. Its address is listed in Delaware, at a location it shares with hundreds of thousands of other companies. The address is also shared with Coca-Cola, Walmart, and American Airlines.  Because it is registered as a partnership, the Delaware government does not have records of who its directors are.  Apple did not respond to a request for comment.  Bramley is a sour variety of apple that is usually cooked, according to the U.K. National Fruit Collection.  Akane LLC Wikipedia/Daniel VILLAFRUELA The other company listed as an owner of Apple Data Services Ireland is Akane LLC. It's listed at the same Delaware address as Bramley GP and it was first registered in early 2015.  It owns 6,999 shares of Apple Data Services Ireland.  Akane is "one of the best early-season apples," according to Orangepippin.com, and was originally developed in Japan in 1937. Most people eat Akane apples fresh and out of hand.  Braeburn Capital Wikpedia The most famous of Apple's apple-y subsidiaries is Braeburn Capital, which manages and invests Apple's money. It's based in Reno, Nevada, because the state has a corporate tax rate of zero. Apple lists it as a subsidiary on SEC forms.  Instead of turning to asset managers like Vanguard or Pimco, Apple prefers to manage its own money.  Because Apple has so much money, Braeburn manages tens of billions of dollars — competitive with many hedge funds. It buys a lot of shorter-term bonds, according to Bloomberg.  According to the New York Times, it's a small office with only a few employees, mostly financial analysts.  Braeburn is a sweet and tart type of apple that is thought to be a cross between Granny Smith and Lady Hamilton, according to the U.K. Apple Association.  Baldwin Holdings Unlimited GRIN Baldwin Holdings Unlimited is listed on most of Apple's major Irish subsidiaries as a member and owner. Apple Operations International, for example, lists in an annual report filed in 2015 that there are 726,059 shares of the company. Apple Inc holds 700,053, Apple UK holds 26,005, and Baldwin Holdings Unlimited holds one share.  Baldwin Holdings Unlimited is a nominee shareholder with a Virgin Islands address, and the New York Times reported in 2012 that Peter Oppenheimer, former Apple CFO, was the company's only listed director. From the Times:  "Moreover, the second Irish subsidiary — the “Double” — allowed other profits to flow to tax-free companies in the Caribbean. Apple has assigned partial ownership of its Irish subsidiaries to Baldwin Holdings Unlimited in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven, according to documents filed there and in Ireland." Baldwin apples are "coarse, textured and juicy but lack flavor," according to the U.K. National Fruit Collection. They ship well and are hearty.  See the rest of the story at Business Insider See Also:The unpredictable and dramatic story of Jay Z's Tidal, the music service trying to fight Apple and Spotify10 tips for living small from tiny home ownersEarly Apple employee Mike Markkula is selling his California ranch for $45 million SEE ALSO: Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'Companies should have values, like people do' About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscribe Yellow Pages Vacation Hold Market Place Classifieds Find Independence jobs Cars Real Estate FindNSave Boats Magazine Online Submissions Engagements Weddings Births Anniversaries Sister Publication Boonville Daily News Linn County Leader Lake Sun Leader Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune The Examiner Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Brian Feroldi (TMFTypeoh) Aug 14, 2016 at 8:44AM Image source: Getty Images. One sound investing strategy is to buy shares of dividend-paying companies that are temporarily out of favor with Wall Street. After all, if the investment community is down on a company's stock, then its share price is likely to be cheap and its dividend yield artificially high. If the company can prove that its business is still fundamentally strong, then investors can bank both a high yield and price appreciation. With that in mind, here's a list of three dividend-paying stocks that Wall Street hates right now but I think can safely be purchased. A dirt-cheap biotech Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) shares have been in the discount bin for quite some time now, and it's not hard to understand why. A few years back, the company launched two hepatitis C cures -- Harvoni and Solvaldi -- that grew like wildfire and went on to produce tens of billions in revenue for the company. Now, other pharma companies have caught up and have offered hepatitis C cures of their own. In response, Gilead has been offering its treatments at a discount to maintain market share, which is crushing its growth. Last quarter, declining hepatitis C revenue caused companywide sales to shrink by 5.7%. Net income plunged by an even sharper 22.2%, and the company even cut its full-year sales guidance to a range of $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion, from its prior outlook of $30 billion to $31 billion. Image source: Gilead Sciences. Shares are now trading for less than seven times trailing earnings as a result, pushing the company's dividend yield to over 2.3%. However, despite all the doom and gloom, I still believe there are reasons to be optimistic, especially at today's discounted share price. First, lower hep-C treatment prices are causing reimbursement restrictions to fall away, which could go a long way toward building volume and helping offset pricing concessions. Second, the company just launched its next-generation hep-C drug, Epclusa, to market. This drug treats all six hep-C genotypes, which eliminates the need for genetic testing ahead of time. That could give it a clinical edge, especially if it launches in international markets. Third, Gilead's bread-and-butter HIV/AIDS franchise continues to show strength. Sales just jumped 11% last quarter thanks to a handful of next-generation drug launches. Finally, there's plenty of optionality ahead in the company's pipeline. Gilead is working on new drugs that could eventually treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. There's also its war chest of more than $24 billion, which could be used for a game-changing acquisition. Gilead's days of fast growth might be a thing of the past, but with shares trading for so cheap, I think investors can still make good money by buying shares today. A beaten-up Apple supplier Sales of Apple's iPhone have been on the decline over the past two quarters, causing the market to sell off many companies that count themselves as suppliers. That list includes Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), a supplier of specialized semiconductor chips. And I think its downturn affords investors a great entry price. For the record, I'm a firm believer that the vast majority of components suppliers should be avoided completely, but I think that Skyworks is the exception. The company has proved itself to be such an important supplier that it's done something very few Apple suppliers can claim -- grow revenue without sacrificing profitability. Have a look at the company's gross, operating, and profit margins over the past few years to see what I mean. SWKS Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. Skyworks is also looking for ways to reduce its dependence on Apple. The company is pushing hard to be a player in the Internet of Things trend, and with each passing quarter it announces new design wins in growth markets such as industrial GPS tracking, smart homes, wearables, and more. Right now Wall Street is squarely focused on the smartphone market, which is why shares are currently down more than 38% from their 52-week high. That's pushed the company's dividend yield up to 1.7%, a respectable number for a company that's been paying a dividend for only a few years. While Wall Street is dumping shares because of the smartphone slowdown, analysts still believe that the company's bottom line will grow by roughly 17% over the next five years. That's an incredibly fast rate for a company that's currently selling for less than 11 times next year's earnings. A pipeline of profits It's no secret that energy stocks have been mauled over the past 18 months, given the precipitous decline in commodity prices. And yes, there's value to be found in the space. One of my favorite companies from the sector, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), has taken investors on a wild ride over that period, but with shares currently yielding 2.46%, now could be a good time to jump in. Kinder Morgan currently claims the title of largest energy infrastructure company in North America. That's because it owns a massive network of natural gas pipelines that crisscross the U.S. and are crucial to bringing supply into markets that have demand. There's a lot to like about Kinder Morgan's business. For one thing, the vast majority of the company's profits don't fluctuate with the price of oil or natural gas, which gives the company tremendous cash-flow stability. For example, last quarter, cash flow was basically flat year over year and earnings grew by 4%. Those are results that nearly every other energy company would kill to have.  However, Kinder Morgan's share price still hasn't recovered from concerns late last year over its debt load. That ultimately forced the company to slash its payout by 75%, which alienated a huge amount of its investor base that was in the stock solely for income. However, I think it was the right strategic move, as it gives the company flexibility to reduce its leverage, right-size its business, and think about ways to return cash to shareholders once the energy markets fully recover. The shares are far from risk-free, but the company is expecting to show about $4.7 billion in distributable cash flow for the full year. Compare that figure with its market cap of about $46 billion, and you can still see that the stock is trading at a huge discount. Once the company returns to its history of raising the dividend, I think investors will once again warm up to the stock, so buying today could prove to be profit-friendly.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Apple iPhone 7 Reportedly Set to Come Out on September 7 with Current Technological Trends Held Back! Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: August 15, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» The next flagship smartphone of the American tech giant, the Apple iPhone 7, shall reportedly come out on September 7 and shall be made available for pre-ordering two days later. Eleven days after its official launch, the iPhone 7 shall officially hit the retail markets, details Forbes. However, what seems to be killing the excitement about the Apple iPhone 7 are the reports saying that the American tech company has actually held back current technological trends on its upcoming iPhone, preferring to wait it out and load it all on the iPhone 8. As such, critics has been saying that the iPhone 7 will indeed come out competent and good but it is not bound to change the world the way that the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S7 did it last year and this year, respectively. It has already been reported previously that the iPhone 7 shall not be a huge leap forward, no matter the exponential graphs of processing power Apple may present. Coming out with two more devices The latest rumors are also saying that the Apple iPhone 7 shall come out on September 7 along with the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro and the Apple Watch 2. The latest notebook and smart wearable have previously been reported to come out in March this year, and then again in June during Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), but they were both no-shows at both events. That leaves the Apple iPhone launching event next month as the only other possible unveiling opportunity for the two other highly-anticipated Apple devices, notes 9to5mac. Reports have it that the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro shall come out with an OLED touch panel in its keyboard. It shall also feature a Touch ID functionality into its power button. There are also rumors saying that in addition to the three devices, the Apple September event shall also feature the launch of the iOS 10, the watchOS and the macOS. But all these remain as speculations pending the confirmation or denial from Apple which is very unlikely so fans should just wait in September to get the real score from the American tech giant. A third variant of the iPhone 7 Meanwhile, reputable leakster Evan Blass has previously tweeted the release date of the next flagship smartphone from Apple, the iPhone 7, and he said that it is going to be on September 16. Interestingly, the rumors are now rife that instead of the usual launching of two iPhones, there shall reportedly be three variants of the iPhone 7 to come out by then. Accordingly, in addition to the Apple iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, there shall be a third variant to be known as the iPhone 7 Pro. However, all these remain as speculations pending the confirmation from Apple. Thus far, the American tech giant has yet to send out invitations for its iPhone launching event in September. Apple has deviated from its usual two-year change in design strategy where a new handset is launched after an S year. Based on current speculations, the iPhone 7 shall have a similar look to the iPhone 6S, which in turn took its design cues from the iPhone 6, the last major design change by Apple. However, there are also reports saying that although the external features of the iPhone 7 do not show major design changes, the company is said to be making major hardware changes to the handset. Among those major changes in the hardware include the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack and a few upgrades to the camera. Apple’s major change this year is the addition of a third variant, the iPhone 7 Pro, which will feature a significant change in the year’s look for the iPhone including a dual camera lens setup.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jena McGregor August 12 Follow @jenamcgregor CEO Tim Cook says Apple has tried to be more transparent under his watch. Except for one thing: “We try to be as secretive as we’ve always been on products, although it’s increasingly difficult to do that.” (Andrew Burton/For The Washington Post) On a sleek white coffee table in Apple CEO Tim Cook’s fourth-floor office in late July, beneath framed posters of Robert F. Kennedy, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jackie Robinson, a rose gold iPhone 6s sits in its original box. Earlier that morning, Cook had stood in front of employees at Apple headquarters and held up the phone, which a staffer had hand-delivered from a store in Beijing to commemorate a notable occasion: Apple had sold its billionth iPhone. That celebratory milestone — Cook laughs when asked by a reporter if he’ll stop counting, as McDonald’s did with its hamburgers — aptly coincides with another big moment for the technology giant’s chief executive. A few weeks later, Cook would mark the fifth anniversary of what has been the most closely watched transition of power in corporate history: On Aug. 24, 2011, just six weeks before his death, Apple’s iconic founder, Steve Jobs, permanently handed his chief operating officer the reins. “It’s been a blur in a lot of ways,” says Cook, who had filled in for Jobs during medical leaves. “It feels like it was yesterday in some respects.” It is fitting that these two milestones arrive so close together. That’s because the iPhone, launched by Jobs, has been the biggest driver of Apple’s massive growth during Cook’s tenure. It led the company to soaring valuations and accounted for nearly two-thirds of Apple’s revenue in the past year. Just the tally on iPhone sales, almost $141 billion over the past four quarters, is more than the annual sales figures of Cisco, Disney and Nike — combined. But the iPhone has been a source of recent disappointment, too. In its most recent quarter, iPhone sales fell 23 percent from a year ago, contributing to a 14.6 percent drop in overall revenue. It was Apple’s second straight quarterly drop in sales after 13 years of growth. Just after Apple disclosed those results, Cook sat down with The Washington Post to discuss his first five years in one of corporate America’s most glaring spotlights. In two sprawling and self-reflective interviews — one in his office and another by phone just before he left for vacation in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks — Cook described why the visibility of the job has been “shocking,” how he’s learned to deal with the scrutiny, and who he’s turned to for advice at pivotal moments (Warren Buffett, on his decision to return cash to shareholders, and Anderson Cooper about publicly disclosing he is gay). He spoke in candid terms about the mistakes he’s made on the way, such as his first hire to run Apple’s retail stores (“that was clearly a screw-up”). He fiercely defended Apple’s tax policies. He touched on succession planning and the importance of grooming internal candidates. He was at his most spirited when talking about privacy and the long-term future of Apple and the iPhone — calling Apple’s big presence in the smartphone industry “a privilege, not a problem” — and quieted considerably when talking about Jobs’s memory. “I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point,” he said, “but I had convinced myself that he would bounce.” Cook, 55, chooses his words carefully, taking long pauses and speaking with a slight Alabama drawl. Though he has favorite phrases — many things are “deep,” and Apple’s mission is always its “North Star” — he eschews the jargon many CEOs use. And while he’s quick to trumpet Apple, he is also unassuming, quickly noting, after saying his job can be “lonely,” that “I’m not looking for any sympathy. CEOs don’t need any sympathy.” That reflects how Cook’s imprint on Apple has often been described — making it more systematic, more transparent, more team-oriented, more humble. He has engaged on social issues more than most CEOs, writing op-eds on legislation that limits gay rights and making the extraordinary decision earlier this year to oppose the FBI’s request to unlock the San Bernardino killer’s phone. As CEO, he gets high marks for managing the company’s growth, keeping margins high and expanding further into markets such as China (Apple had four retail stores in China five years ago. Today it has 41.) He has pushed into the enterprise market, grown Apple’s product lineup and positioned Apple to make more money off the devices it’s already sold: Its services business, which includes things like iTunes, iCloud and a mobile payments service, is projected to be the size of a Fortune 100 business next year — all on its own. Apple remains the most valuable and most profitable company in the S&P 500 index. Yet as the company deals with declining sales in its major device categories and in markets like China, critics and some investors have fretted about Apple’s innovation mojo under Cook. The first all-new device during his tenure, the Apple Watch, is not yet a mega hit. The iPhone juggernaut faces a saturated smartphone market, growing competition from low-cost start-ups and longer upgrade windows from consumers. Rumored big concepts behind the curtain — such as a reported car project — appear to be years away. Some analysts say such impatience is shortsighted, and that the long-term potential for things like services, augmented reality and even a possible car could ultimately transform the way Cook’s tenure is viewed. “Investors are so finicky that they lose track of the big picture,” says Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray who covers Apple. “I think the wisdom and legacy of Tim Cook is going to be determined by what happens in the next five years.” In the conversation below, Cook looks back as well as ahead at those next five years — hinting at augmented reality but refusing to comment about a car project, saying Apple believes people love a surprise. It has been edited for length and clarity. Apple CEO Tim Cook talks about when it's important to seek out advice, and who he turns to when he does. (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post) Your first day in this job, you sent a memo to employees that said, “I want you to be confident that Apple is not going to change.” Five years later, it has to have changed. What qualities of Apple are immutable, in your view? The DNA of the company is really what I was talking about there. The North Star has always been the same, which for us, is about making insanely great products that really change the world in some way — enrich people’s lives. And so our reason for being hasn’t changed. Other things do change. But that’s the thread that ties everyone together. And what has changed? The obvious things are we have more employees. The company is four times larger [by revenue since 2010]. We’ve broadened the iPhone lineup. That was a really key decision and I think a very good one. We’ve gone into the Apple Watch business, which has gotten us into wellness and in health. We keep pulling that string to see where that takes us. Lots of core technology work has been done. Are there ways the culture has evolved? We have stepped up our social responsibility. We have talked about things and been more transparent about what we’re doing — not on products: We try to be as secretive as we’ve always been on products, although it’s increasingly difficult to do that. The real test is: Are you creating a ripple that helps other people as well? An example of that is the environmental work. We’ve had environmental work going on at Apple for decades, but we didn’t talk about it, and we didn’t set aspirational kind of objectives. We used the same philosophy we do with our products, which is you unveil them when you’ve finished. But we stepped back and re-evaluated that and said, “You know, if we wait until you do that, we’re not helping anyone else get there, too.” You’ve said you don’t want to be a traditional CEO. What do you mean by that? I think of a traditional CEO as being divorced from customers. A lot of consumer company CEOs — they’re not really interacting with consumers. I also think that the traditional CEO believes his or her job is the profit and loss, is the revenue statement, the income and expense, the balance sheet. Those are important, but I don’t think they’re all that’s important. There’s an incredible responsibility to the employees of the company, to the communities and the countries that the company operates in, to people who assemble its products, to developers, to the whole ecosystem of the company. And so I have a maybe nontraditional view there. I get criticized for it some, I recognize. But I’ve never wanted to be the stereotypical CEO. I don’t think I’d be very good at it, honestly. And I don’t think for Apple that would in the long run be good for the company. If you care about long-term shareholder return, all of these other things are really critical. Tim Cook holds up the billionth iPhone sold as he shares the news with employees at Apple headquarters in July 2016. (Apple/Apple) You’ve got the billionth iPhone on the table here. One thing that has changed is that in 2011 about 44 percent of the company’s sales came from iPhone. Now it’s close to two-thirds. How can Apple move forward when so much of its business is tied up in the iPhone and an industry that’s cooling off? This is actually a privilege, not a problem. Think about this: What other products do you know where the ratio of people to the product, for a consumer electronics product, will be one-to-one over the long haul? I don’t think there is another one. Meaning? The global sales of PCs each year are about 275 million right now. That number’s been declining. The global market for smartphones is 1.4 billion. Over time, I’m convinced every person in the world will have a smartphone. That may take a while, and they won’t all have iPhones. But it is the greatest market on Earth from a consumer electronics point of view. Look at the core technologies that make up the smartphone today and look at the ones that will be dominant in smartphones of the future — like AI. AI will make this product even more essential to you. It will become even a better assistant than it is today. So where you probably aren’t leaving home without it today — you’re really going to be connected to it in the future. That level of performance is going to skyrocket. And there is nothing that’s going to replace it in the short term or in the intermediate term, either. I realize that the people who are focused on this 90-day clock say, “Oh, my God, the smartphone industry only grew by 1 percent or decreased by 6 percent.” You know, the global economy’s not that great right now. But if you’re in it for the long haul, this is the best market on earth. So to those who ask where’s the next big, world-changing category for Apple — it’s sitting on this $231.5 billion pile of cash — are you saying there’s nothing like the smartphone? Technology is one of these industries where every week there’s a new shiny object that people are skating to. Netbooks — look back, everybody was writing like netbooks were this unbelievable thing, everyone was asking us, “Why aren’t you making one?” Same thing with the PDA. Remember what happened with the PDA? Up and down. It was like the hula hoop. Technology is full of those. I’m not saying we’re not going to do anything else. I’m saying this is still an unbelievable product category to be in, and not just for this quarter, year or for years. So I would not want anybody to think this, oh, this “better days are behind us” thing. Some analysts have said that. And it doesn’t bother me. Because honestly, they were saying that about Apple in 2001. They were saying it in 2005. They were saying it in 2007 — this stupid iPhone, whoever dreamed up this thing? Then they were saying that we peaked in 2010, then it was 2011. We got to $60 billion [in revenue], and they said you can’t grow any more from this. Well, last year we were $230 billion. And, yes, we’re coming down some this year. Every year isn’t an up, you know. I’ve heard all of it before. And I don’t subscribe to it because it’s traditional thinking in a lot of ways: You can’t get large because you are large. How do you make the case that Apple is still a long-term growth company? In today’s products we have services [iCloud, App Store, Apple Pay and the like], which over the last 12 months grew about $4 billion to over $23 billion [in sales]. Next year we’ve said it’s going to be a Fortune 100 company in size. What else? IPad. The iPad Pro. What we saw in this past quarter is that about half of the people who are buying one are using it at work. We have an enormous opportunity in enterprise. Last year we did $25 billion or so in it around the world. We’re collaborating much better with key partners because it’s important, if you’re making a decision to use our products or anybody’s products in the enterprise, that they work well together. And so we’re working with Cisco because they’re incredible with the network infrastructure. We’re working with IBM, who’s written a number of apps. We’re working with SAP because they own the back of the house, in terms of the processing. They own three-quarters of the world’s transactions, in terms of it running on their products. And then, of course, the markets. We have done fairly well in China. India is fast-growing, but our base there is smaller. One of the big things that has held India back is the cellular infrastructure. They have two major carriers putting in a lot of investment to bring 4G. You can imagine if you didn’t have 4G today. You can’t enjoy video on a 3G. Periodically you can, but not consistently. This is a game changer. And so I look at it and say: markets? Enterprise — huge. Geographies? India is one I’ve talked about, but there are others. Products? We purposely don’t talk about that one. But you can imagine. Step back and say what’s Apple so great at? Apple is the only company that can take hardware, software and services and integrate those into an experience that’s an “aha” for the customer. You can take that and apply to markets that we’re not in today. There’s not a limitation that we can only do that in the smartphone area or in the tablet or Mac or watch area. Do you feel any frustration with investor impatience? We welcome all investors, regardless of whether their horizon is short or long. But we try to be very clear that we are making our decisions based on long term. I think for investors that are focused on the long term, if you look at how we’ve done in the past five years, our total shareholder return is over 100 percent. That’s a pretty good number. And I think most people that have been in the stock for that period of time are probably pretty happy. Tim Cook and Steve Jobs worked closely together for years. “Steve’s not replaceable,” Cook says. (Kimberly White/REUTERS) You succeeded one of the icons of American business. What does it feel like to step into those shoes? To me, Steve’s not replaceable. By anyone. [Voice softens] He was an original of a species. I never viewed that as my role. I think it would have been a treacherous thing if I would have tried to do it. When I first took the job as CEO, I actually thought that Steve would be here for a long time. Because he was going to be chairman, work a bit less after he came back up the health curve. So I went into it with one thought, and then weeks later — six weeks later, whatever — Quickly. It was very quickly. [The day he died] was sort of the worst day ever. I just — I had really convinced myself. I know this sounds probably bizarre at this point, but I had convinced myself that he would bounce, because he always did. What did you think you knew about leading Apple that turned out to be wrong? There’s nothing like sitting in the chair, so to speak. I was reminded that customers have a really deep love for the company. I started just getting an avalanche of customer mail. I don’t mean complaints. Email. Positive. Negative. Points of view. Not the ‘hey, this broke, I’m mad.’ Largely not that kind of stuff. Things much deeper than that. Moved by how they were treated in a store. Lots of people have written me about FaceTime and how they could be near their mother’s or father’s bedside before they died only because of it. Apple CEO Tim Cook describes how co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs acted as cover for Apple, taking both praise and blame for the company. (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post) But what about in terms of running the company? I learned that the scrutiny was much higher than I thought. Media interest and scrutiny — social networking was taking off at that time — and so a lot of the “love,” so to speak, and interest from customers, I think, transfers to media interest as well. And so there’s a lot of visibility on the company. We can do very few things without it being reported somewhere. You and Alan Greenspan or Janet Yellen would probably have a lot to talk about. It seems like every word you say is scrutinized. How do you get used to that? You don’t. You’re both praised and criticized, and the extremes are wide — very wide. And that can happen all in a day. You build up — my skin got materially thicker after August 2011. And I don’t mean in a bad way. I don’t mean that I’m callous and don’t care. I think I’m a bit better today about compartmentalizing things and not taking everything so personally. That was just downright shocking to me, honestly. I thought the visibility went with Steve, not the company. And so I thought with a different CEO, with me, that would instantly change. It didn’t. “I think every generation has the responsibility to enlarge the meaning of human rights,” Tim Cook says. “I do view that a CEO today of Apple should participate in the national discussion on these type of issues.” (Andrew Burton/For The Washington Post) You’ve been more outspoken on social issues than any other CEO of a company your size. Do you think companies have a responsibility to publicly take on such issues as civil rights and climate change? I think everybody has to make their own decision about it. Maybe there are compelling reasons why some people want to be silent. I think for us, though — for a company that’s all about empowering people through our products, and being a collection of people whose goal in life is to change the world for the better — it doesn’t sit right with me that you have that kind of focus, but you’re not making sure your carbon footprint isn’t poisoning the place. Or that you’re not evangelizing moving human rights forward. I think every generation has the responsibility to enlarge the meaning of human rights. I do view that a CEO today of Apple should participate in the national discussion on these type of issues. Who were you thinking about when you decided to write the op-ed where you publicly came out as gay? I was thinking about kids. I was getting notes from kids who knew I was gay, or assumed I was, because of something they had read on the Web. And they were kids who were distraught. Some had been pushed out by their families. They thought they couldn’t achieve anything. They couldn’t do anything. They were seeing the national discourse around it and feeling isolated and depressed. And I just thought — I’ve got to do something. And you speaking out would do what? I thought it would minimally say you can do pretty good in this world and be gay. That it’s not a limiter. It’s okay to be. That it’s okay to be honest about it. I figured if I could help one person, it would be worth it. It had been planned for quite a long time. It was not something that was done in a moment, by any means. It was probably a year. Just thinking through what to say, how to say it, where to say it, how to do that in a way that advanced what I was trying to do. I wanted it to be in a business [publication]. That’s what I know, that’s who I am. There was a lot of work there. I visited people. I talked to Anderson Cooper at length — multiple times. Because I thought that the way that he handled his announcement was really classy. I was getting advice from people who I thought were really great people who had really deeply thought about it. There are few jobs in corporate America that have the same scope, breadth and size as yours. Geopolitics. National security. Consumer retail. Global supply chains. The entertainment industry. It’s mind-boggling. Where do you turn to for advice? Whoever I think can help me. When I was going through [the question of] what should we do on returning cash to shareholders, I thought who could really give us great advice here? Who wouldn’t have a bias? So I called up Warren Buffett. I thought he’s the natural person, and so I try to go through that process on everyone. That doesn’t mean I always do what they say. But I think it’s incumbent on a CEO to not just listen to points of view but to actually solicit them. Because I think, if not, you quickly become insular. And you’re sort of living in the echo chamber. Warren Buffett offered advice on returning money to shareholders when Tim Cook turned to him. (John Peterson/AP) It took about a year of planning and long conversations with Anderson Cooper before Tim Cook came out publicly as gay — the first Fortune 500 CEO to do so. (Charles Sykes/AP) Who else? For the hearing [in 2013 before the U.S. Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about Apple’s tax practices], I’ve never testified in front of Congress before. So I called up [Goldman Sachs CEO] Lloyd Blankfein, because I looked back to say who’s done this before? I knew Lloyd and thought he’d be honest with me. He gave me great advice. I called up President Clinton. He knows a lot about the politics. I’d not met him through a political connection. I’d met him through the foundation. And he was great. I went to Laurene, Steve’s wife. Laurene has the lens of knowing me and deeply understanding Apple. And so, obviously, I get a lot of advice internal to Apple. But I think it’s important on these things that are also new to the company to solicit some people outside, even if you conclude to not do what they say. With the fight with the FBI, did you have any idea what you were getting into? We knew it was going to be very, very difficult. And that the cards were stacked against us. But we spent a lot of time on “what is right here?” People who were really key on this decision are folks like [senior vice president of software engineering] Craig Federighi. This at its heart is a deep, deep technical question. You first have to understand that to do anything else. The lightbulb went off, and it became clear what was right when we did the first piece of work: Could we create a tool to unlock the phone? After a few days, we had determined yes, we could. Then the question was, ethically, should we? We thought, you know, that depends on whether we could contain it or not. Other people were involved in this, too — deep security experts and so forth, and it was apparent from those discussions that we couldn’t be assured. The risk of what happens if it got out, we felt, could be incredibly terrible for public safety. We knew the positioning on the outside would not be public safety. It would be security vs. privacy — security should win. But we went through the deep, deep, deep discussions on that. It became clear that the trade-off, so to speak, was essentially putting hundreds of millions of people at risk for a phone that may or may not have anything on it, and that likely didn’t, because of other things that we knew about. We thought this actually is a clear decision. A hard one, but a clear one. Then it became more of a matter of how do we explain this. Because this is not easy. You can imagine. You just hear: locked phone. Terrorist. People dead. Why aren’t you unlocking this? Did the FBI fight change how you view the mandate of your job? Customers should have an expectation that they shouldn’t need a PhD in computer science to protect themselves. So I think they depend on us to do some things on their behalf. So with that responsibility comes an obligation to stand up. And, in this case, it was unbelievably uncomfortable and not something that we wished for, wanted — we didn’t even think it was right. Honestly? I was shocked that they would even ask for this. That was the thing that was so disappointing that I think everybody lost in the whole thing. There are 200-plus other countries in the world. Zero of them had ever asked this. You’ve talked about privacy being part of Apple’s values. How personal is it for you? You’re known as a very private person. You grew up gay in a red state. Did those early years have an impact on how you lead Apple and on your public stances about privacy? Undoubtedly, your childhood and your upbringing is a constant across your life in terms of the things you learn and your point of view. But in terms of privacy, I wouldn’t link the two. There’s a broader thing in play. Privacy, in my point of view, is a civil liberty that our Founding Fathers thought of a long time ago and concluded it was an essential part of what it was to be an American. Sort of on the level, if you will, with freedom of speech, freedom of the press. The other thing is how all this data sits out there in different places. I do worry about people not really understanding deeply about what kinds of things are out there about them. So it’s really both of those — not really the growing up in the South. Back in 2009, you said, “We believe in saying no to thousands of projects.” Name one product or project in the past five years you have put on the shelf. [Laughs]. I don’t know if I want to do that, because it gives competition some heads-up about things. But be assured that we have. More than one. Because the wonderful thing about Apple is there are many ideas about doing things. We have resources to do a few, but you can only do a few things deep and well, and so you have to say no and have debates about what things are in versus out. So more than one big thing has left the page. A week after launching the iPhone 5, Tim Cook apologized for Apple Maps, a software app included on the new phone that was met with widespread complaints. A month later, Cook pushed out software executive Scott Forstall and retail chief John Browett. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) When you look back, are there mistakes you’ve made that you’ve learned something from? Maps was a mistake. Today we have a product we’re proud of. But we had the self-honesty to admit this wasn’t our finest hour and the courage to choose another way of doing it. That’s important. It’s the only way an organization learns. The classic big-company mistake is to not admit their mistake. They double down on them. Their pride or ego is so large that they can’t say we did something wrong. And I think the faster you do that, the better — change gears to something else. If you’re honest, people will give you the benefit of the doubt. But if you have your head stuck in the sand and you just keep doing it, I think you lose your employees and your customers as well. What else? I hired the wrong person for retail [former Dixons CEO John Browett] initially. That was clearly a screw-up. I’m not saying anything bad about him. He didn’t fit here culturally is a good way to describe it. We all talked to him, and I made the final decision, and it was wrong. We fairly quickly recognized it and made a change. And I’m proud we did that. A lot of companies would have said, “Oh, he hasn’t been here very long.” But when you’re looking at more time with [then] 50,000 people in retail — that’s a lot of people that you’re affecting in the wrong way. That was a mistake. I probably have a long list. The adage that it’s lonely — the CEO job is lonely — is accurate in a lot of ways. I’m not looking for any sympathy. You have to recognize that you have blind spots. We all do. Blind spots move, and you want to not just have really bright people around you, but people who will push on you and people to bring out the best in you. People that amplify whatever you’re good at. And then also the people who plug the parts that you’re not and may never be. What are you reading? I have two books going right now: One is the Bobby Kennedy book [“Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Icon,” by Larry Tye] that just came out. The other is quite an old book. It’s a Gandhi book [“Mohandas K. Gandhi, Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth”] that I got interested in because we went to the Gandhi museum when we were in India recently. I tend to like nonfiction and particularly reading about people and how they lived and how they fought, and what motivated them and their philosophy and so forth. When Steve handed you the reins, he said Apple had never had an orderly transition of CEO, and he wanted that to happen. What are you doing now to make sure the next transition, whenever it happens, is orderly? At the end of every board meeting, I discuss succession with the board because I might step off the wrong curb or something. We have the good discipline to do that. Then my role is to make sure that the board has great candidates to pick from internally. And I take that role extremely seriously. Look around at the great people I get to work with — there’s some really just superb talent in the company. Apple paid $3 billion for Beats in its largest acquisition ever. (Adam Berry/Getty Images For Apple) You’ve made more acquisitions at Apple, including the purchase of Beats, which was its largest ever, at $3 billion. At its current size, does Apple need big acquisitions like that to grow? Do we need them? No. But we always are looking for companies that have really talented people and great intellectual property, and when we find them we do acquire them. To put that into context, we’ve acquired 15 to 20 companies a year for the last four years. Do you think there will be more at that size going forward? I think we’ll continue to acquire companies. If you’re asking me would we do another one the size of Beats — Or bigger? You certainly could. We clearly are capable of doing it both from a management-depth point of view and a financial point of view. But we’d only do it if it were great for Apple strategically. We don’t acquire for revenue. So the essential for us is the talent and/or [intellectual property]. Those are the things that we optimize around. Now with Beats, we also got revenue. But it wasn’t the purpose of it. The purpose was that we were going into streaming — we’d already made a decision to do that. And we looked around at people who might be able to help us. I think we got Apple Music out probably a little sooner than we would have otherwise. It’s infused some great talent on the team. How do you think about content being part of that services business going forward? We are producing radio shows for Beats. We are producing some original content on video. We started that with a concert kind of video with Taylor Swift. We’ve got “Planet of the Apps,” kind of a cool show. We’ve got a few things that are focused on Apple Music. We do view that the future of TV is apps. And if there’s a way we can be a catalyst into that happening faster or better, then that would interest us in content. Customers look at iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone SE mobile phones in an Apple Store in Beijing. (HOW HWEE YOUNG/EPA) Sales in greater China were down 33 percent in the most recent quarter. Low-cost competitors like Huawei are getting into building premium phones. Let’s talk about China. How much are you worried about competitive and regulatory threats there? We make our investment decisions based on long term. We have to report every 90 days because that’s the rules, but it’s not how we run the company. So as I look in the long term, I think China is an unbelievable market — not only from a demand point of view and the revenue potential there, but also as a great source of talent. We have over a million and a half developers there. The reach is unbelievable. There are, sort of, speed bumps now with the economy. In a year-ago quarter, we were up 112 percent. So I think you have to back up and put it in perspective. If you look at it over a two-year basis, we were up over 50 percent in the quarter. We were talking about getting advice from people before your first testimony on Capitol Hill. That hearing focused on the corporate taxes Apple pays. Apple is now awaiting a European Union ruling on whether you owe billions in back taxes, and corporate tax reform is a big election-year issue. Does either a Trump or a Clinton campaign give you or the company any hope that there could be corporate tax reform anytime soon? I think it’s in the best interest of the U.S. to have corporate tax reform, regardless of which political party is in charge of the White House. Because if you look at it, the U.S. rules today are that international companies like us and many others can keep their earnings that they earn overseas overseas, and then when they bring them back it triggers the tax liability. What I’ve always felt should happen is that every dollar should be taxed immediately with no deferral. But as a consequence of doing that, you should have free flow of capital. What would happen is if a system like that were put in place, it should have more investment going into the United States. We’re the only major country in the world that has a system like this. It’s not good for the U.S., it’s not good for the economy, it’s not good for jobs, it’s not good for investments. I think there’s wide agreement to that in both parties, by the way. There’s a difference of view with different people about how to fix it, but I think everybody agrees the current system isn’t working. So I’m optimistic that, in 2017, there will be some sort of corporate tax reform. The U.S. needs to invest more in infrastructure — so what would be great is, if they take the tax proceeds of a corporate tax reform and invest it in infrastructure and roads and bridges and airports. What do you say in response to Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz’s comments on Bloomberg [television], where he called Apple’s profit reporting in Ireland a “fraud”? I didn’t hear it. But if anybody said that, they don’t know what they’re talking about. Let me explain what goes on with our international taxes. The money that’s in Ireland that he’s probably referring to is money that is subject to U.S. taxes. The tax law right now says we can keep that in Ireland or we can bring it back. And when we bring it back, we will pay 35 percent federal tax and then a weighted average across the states that we’re in, which is about 5 percent, so think of it as 40 percent. We’ve said at 40 percent, we’re not going to bring it back until there’s a fair rate. There’s no debate about it. Is that legal to do or not legal to do? It is legal to do. It is the current tax law. It’s not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic. It doesn’t go that the more you pay, the more patriotic you are. And so what we’ve said — we think it’s fine for us to pay more, because right now we’re paying nothing on that and we leave it over there. But we — like many, many other companies do — wait for the money to come back. In the meantime, it’s important to look at what we do pay. Our marginal rate, our effective rate in the U.S. is over 30 percent. We are the largest taxpayer in the United States. And so we’re not a tax dodger. We pay our share and then some. We don’t have these big loopholes that other people talk about. The only kind of major tax credit that we get is the R&D tax credit, which is available to all companies in the United States. That’s important to know. The second thing I would point out is we have money internationally because we have two-thirds of our business there. So we earn money internationally. How long are you willing to keep unrepatriated income overseas? Honestly, I believe the legislature and the administration will agree that it’s in the best interest of the country and the economy to have tax reform. So I don’t think I have to make that decision. I’m optimistic that it will take place next year. Tim Cook appeared before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to discuss Apple’s tax practices. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) Do you feel picked on by the E.U.? You know, they haven’t ruled yet. I don’t know how they will rule. I hope that we get a fair hearing. If we don’t, then we would obviously appeal it. It’s important for everyone to understand that the allegation made in the E.U. is that Ireland gave us a special deal. Ireland denies that. The structure we have was applicable to everybody — it wasn’t something that was done unique to Apple. It was their law. And the basic controversy at the root of this is, people really aren’t arguing that Apple should pay more taxes. They’re arguing about who they should be paid to. And so there’s a tug of war going on between the countries of how you allocate profits. Let’s jump to Apple’s future. You made some statements in the earnings call about artificial intelligence that got a lot of attention. Can Apple catch up with the AI efforts from companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon? Let me take exception to your question. Your question seems to imply that we’re behind. Let’s take a look at that. We’ve been shipping Siri since 2011, and Siri is with you all of the time. Which I think most people would want an assistant with them all the time, whether they’re at work or at home or in between or on the soccer field. You don’t think of your to-do list, so to speak, only when you’re in your kitchen. And the breadth of Siri is unbelievable. Increasingly, Siri understands things obviously without having to memorize certain ways to say things. The prediction of Siri is going way up. What we’ve done with AI is focus on things that will help the customer. And we announced in June that we’re opening Siri to third parties, so third-party developers can now use Siri. So a simple example with that, whatever kind of ride-sharing app you might use, Uber or Lyft in the United States, you could just — using your voice — order the car. So third-party developers are writing tons of those that will be available to the public in the fall. And that’s how we’re broadening Siri in a huge way. But there are other things in there, like if you’re typing in mail, the prediction capability of the next word or next phrase that you will use has just — Siri has gotten a lot smarter about that. The simple things, like do you drive to the airport? I haven’t done that in a little while, but when I did, I always forgot where I put my car. I just take a picture of the sign on the wall. But you don’t even have to do that anymore because Siri will know where you parked. And so things like this really make a difference to people — we do all of that while protecting your privacy. Instead of passing all that information to the cloud, where we’re maintaining it all, we do a lot of it on the device itself. So you’re in control of your own data. Do you have a concern about privacy as you push into AI? No. I think that talented people can come up with fantastic ways of using AI without violating privacy. There’s a new technology called differential privacy which essentially looks at large data sets to predict user behaviors and requests without going to the precise individual, which might violate privacy. Now there are some things that we do look at — like if you buy songs, it’s a reasonable expectation that we know what songs you buy because you buy them from us. And we use that information with machine learning to recommend other songs you might like. What about augmented or virtual reality? I think AR [augmented reality] is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology. So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about. [Laughs.] You mentioned earlier about how much more difficult it is to keep things secret. There’s been a number of reports about Apple’s car project — the people who are being hired or moved into place to lead it. It gets enough attention that it almost seems like an open secret. Why not say something about it? I can’t answer a question about something we haven’t announced. [Laughs.] But there’s just constant attention about it. Is it tempting to share any kind of details? We’ve always viewed that people love surprises. We don’t have enough anymore in our lives. Sometimes it seems like Silicon Valley companies are all blending together — everyone’s converging on the same big race. Self-driving cars, AI, Google is reportedly building a smartphone. In a tech industry where companies are trying to be “all things to all people,” how does Apple’s longtime philosophy of simplicity, and being very focused, move it forward? It’s as important as it ever was. We’re a bit larger today, so we can do a bit more than we could do 10 years ago or even five years ago. But we still have, for our size, an extremely focused product line. You can literally put every product we make on this table. That really is an indication of how focused it is. I think that’s a good thing. Regardless of who you are, there’s only so many things that you can do at a very high-quality and deep, deep level — personally and in business. And so we’re not going to change that. That’s core to our model and way of thinking. Apple has really ramped up spending in research and development. One analyst noted your [incremental] R&D is now greater than the 14 largest automakers, combined. What’s the most exciting technology out there to you right now? That one I don’t want to answer, because it would give too much of an insight into the things we’re doing. But we have ramped up R&D because we are heavily investing in the future — both in current product lines and things that aren’t visible as well, including in services. In due time, some of those things will be visible. But there will always be other things that will replace those things that are invisible. Any final reflections on your tenure? Moments that stuck out at you? I’ve got the best job in the world. I think about my day and weeks and months and years — I put them in three buckets: people, strategy and execution. I sort of move between those on a daily basis as to where I put my time. I always think the most important one of those is people. If you don’t get that one right, it doesn’t matter what kind of energy you have in the other two — it’s not enough. business Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Apparently, most of the Apple Watch Stainless Steel variants are marked “Sold Out” on the site, with the Marine Blue Classic Buckle and the White Leather Loop having stocks to sell in four to six weeks’ time. As for the Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Hermès, most of their variants are all listed as “Sold Out.” To people who are planning to buy their very own Apple Watch this month, this sounds pretty alarming. However, there could actually be one big reason why Apple Watch supplies are depleting, and it is none other than the imminent launch of its successor, the Apple Watch 2, this September.  Related Stories Apple To Release Health-Centric Apple Watch Next Year According to Engadget, the Cupertino tech company has the tendency of regulating the supplies of its products when it is about to launch new versions. But usually the company does this so subtly. With the Apple Watch however, it’s very conspicuous since there are so many variants.  Rumors about the release of the Apple Watch 2 this year have begun ever since new straps were introduced in March 2016 and the new Hermès straps were released not too long ago. Per earlier rumors, the Apple Watch 2 could come with better waterproofing, cellular connectivity, GPS and enhanced internals. No word yet on other specs and features, but it is very likely that Apple is keeping the physical design of its previous iteration.  What is being expected for its software is the the WatchOS 3, which is said to be faster and more functional than WatchOS 1 and 2. Yahoo! Tech even opined that with the WatchOS 3, the Apple Watch 2 will be the smartwatch that Apple intended to showcase to the world two years ago.  When it comes to its release date, no specific date has been mentioned yet. What is only known so far is Apple is going to launch its new iPhone 7 smartphones during its September event, and this is said to be the same event where the company is possibly announcing the Apple  Watch 2.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries Cars Jobs Homes MEMBER REWARDS Classifieds Life log in Filler: They want to censor our emojis! Sunday Aug 14, 2016 at 2:00 AM Apple is now editing our thoughts on our iPhones, starting with our beloved emojis. By LANE FILLERNewsday If you are reading this on an Apple device, I can only hope the electronics company hasn’t put its foot down about my egregious use of the word snugglebunnies or the expression “heaving calves.” If Apple has decreed that such expressions are bad for society, God only knows what the screen says now. If the term God is even still OK. That word could someday appear on iPhones as “spirit warrior.” Or “Most Exalted Hillary.” Because Apple is now editing our thoughts, starting with emojis. Emojis started with smiley faces. Now there are images for angry faces, sad faces, hearts, animals, objects and a bewildering array of mostly fattening foods. And there has been a handgun next to a cartoony bomb, crossed swords and a cigarette. But the company has announced that under its new operating system, the revolver is being replaced with a water gun. It’s a pointless change that won’t help curb gun violence or the threat of it, unless hoodlums are getting so lazy that they’d give up on crime rather than bother to type, “I’m going to shoot you.” Once users of Apple devices download the new operating system, every past text or communication on their devices that included the handgun emoji will show the water gun. Apple will significantly alter the meaning of past communications. That’s an extraordinary violation of intellectual freedom and honesty. Imagine a son keeping a text from a recently passed father that included a revolver emoticon to reminisce about target shooting together. Now imagine that text is altered. And in this age of trigger warnings, pleas to criminalize “hate speech” and jeremiads against offensive ideas and language, will it stop there? Many people consider “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” the greatest American novel. Yet teachers and professors who assign the book come under fire, partly because it contains so many uses of a racist word for black people. To change such a word in an existing work would be a lie and a revision of history. And it would serve racists by allowing them to pretend that the slave South was less ugly than it was. But if Apple is banning the handgun, why would it let such a horrid racial slur, or any hurtful term, appear on its products? Nasty words for Hispanics, Jews, Italians or women all could be altered. Changing terms like “tramp” or “@#$%¢” or “fat four-eyed hack newspaper columnist” into more benign expressions couldn’t be done with exactly the same technological changes that will morph old handgun emojis into water guns, but it could be done. This is a terrible precedent. And it makes me so mad I could sunshine smile rainbow a Mother’s Day puppy right up Apple’s flower bouquet of joy. Reach Lane Filler at lane.filler@newsday.com.

Rumor has it Apple is getting ready to launch a new Apple Watch line while Samsung, it's main rival in all things mobile, has sent out invitations to members of the press for what it strongly hints will be a smartwatch announcement. The invitation doesn't actually mention a smartwatch, but unless it's planning to release a clock, there's little else it could be. Samsung's press conference is scheduled to take place on Thursday, September 1, at IFA 2016. The invitation has clock hands, which we presume to mean the launch of the Gear S3. The rumored Gear S3 will allegedly feature the same round design as its predecessor, along with the rotary bezel found on the Gear S2. There will also be three variants of the Gear S3, including the Gear S3 Classic, Gear S3 Frontier, and Gear S3 Explorer. This time around there will be a bigger focus on fitness, as seems to be popular among wearable devices. The watches will sport an altimeter, barometer, speedometer, and an integrated GPS as found in the Gear Fit 2. Barring a major surprise, the Gear S3 will again use Samsung's own home brewed Tizen OS, not Android Wear. Samsung initially had big plans for Tizen, at one point hoping it could compete with Android in the smartphone space, but that didn't happen. However, Tizen seems to have found its niche in the smartwatch market, as Samsung's Gear line has been fairly well received. One interesting side note—there's been talk of there also being a luxury version of the Gear S3. It's worked for Apple and rumor has it Samsung will give the luxury market a try as well, though not at IFA 2016. If such a model is in the works, it would debut next month at the World Watch and Jewelry Show.

UPDATE: iPhone 7 to launch on September 7th: Here’s all you need to know about the latest rumours 0 By Staff Writer on 2016-08-14 Mobile A A A Apple will launch the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus on September 7th after sending out press invites to annual media event to be held in San Francisco.  The event kicks off at 1am on Thursday morning Thailand time and will be streamed live on the Apple website. The news comes as yet more leaked images seem to confirm the latest rumour that the iPhone 7 will include a pressure sensitive home button, a whopping 256GB storage option and could even be shipped with new wireless “EarPods”. Of course the interweb rumour mill has been in overdrive ahead of the announcement of the iPhone 7. Everyday new leaks and images hit the news supposedly reporting on another new feature of the Apple’s upcoming handset – it can sometimes be hard to keep up! With this in mind, ThaiTech has gathered up all the latest rumours and news surrounding the iPhone 7 ahead of its launch later this week. Design Don’t expect anything radical here. The iPhone 7 is expected to look pretty much the same as the iPhone 6S – minus the antenna bands on the back. Critics have said that the fact the iPhone 7 will look similar to the iPhone 6S means Apple is finished, but you just watch the Cupertino company shift tens of millions of its latest handset in the months after its launch. The iPhone 7, which will be available in 4.7 and 5.5 inch versions, (although there have been rumours of an even bigger version) is expected to be only an iterative update prior to Apple completely overhauling its iPhone line up in 2017. With that being said, Apple is rumoured to offer new blue colour option on the iPhone 7. Name While it is widely expected to be called the iPhone 7, there have been rumours that the new iPhone will actually be called the iPhone 6SE. The rumour was first reported on a German tech site who claimed to have spoken to source involved in Apple’s supply chain in China that had seen packaging which included the name iPhone 6SE. Dual cameras iPhone 7 Dual camera render from feldvolk.com via 9to5 Mac One of the first rumours surrounding the iPhone 7 is that it will come with a dual camera, similar to that found on the Huawei P9, which will be able to produce sharper images and perform better in low light. More recent rumours claim the dual camera will only be available on the iPhone 7 Plus, with the iPhone 7 set to include a single lens camera but which is significant upgrade to the one found on the iPhone 6S. One thing seems certain is that dual cameras will feature on at least one, and maybe even both versions of the iPhone 7. Headphone jack and new “AirPods” or “EarPods” Perhaps the most controversial of all rumours is that Apple will apparently remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7. So how will you listen to music? Apple will include headphones that will now attach to a new smart connector that will then attach to the phone. This will mean that you will still be able to use your existing headphones to listen to music on the iPhone 7 but in order to do so will now need to use this extra adapter. It could also mean that Apple may offer up wireless headphones that connect via Bluetooth. This may also mean that Apple will also include wireless charging, similar to that found on the Apple Watch. What is likely is that you will have to pay extra for the smart connect or adapter. Last week details emerged of some wireless headphones that Apple have already developed called AirPods, while other reports claimed that the iPhone 7 will ship with wireless EarPods, with the regular in ear headphones being discontinued.   Home button Leaked images show no home button in the iPhone 7 Some of the most recent rumours that have really started to gain momentum this week is that both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will include a new pressure sensitive home button that will sit flush on the front of the device. Rather than being a physical button, it will instead use sophisticated haptic feedback that makes it feel like it clicks whenever you tap it. The same technology is used in the trackpads on Apple’s MacBooks. The new home button will apparently also offer up different on screen options or functions depending on how hard it is pressed. Specs The iPhone 7 will arrive with iOS 10 and an improved processor so there will be even better performance and battery efficiency. The iPhone 7 is widely expected to include the A10 chipset but there are yet to be any rumours on what kind of battery the handset will include. Reports coming out of Korea suggest that Apple has been in discussions with Samsung about supplying OLED screens for the iPhone 7, which would be a major shift from the LED screens used currently. The inclusion of OLED screens would make for a more vibrant display which would be better for gaming or watching video but which could impact on battery performance. Regarding storage, Apple is widely expected to drop the 16GB option on the iPhone 7 in favour of 32GB and could even add a whopping 256GB option to the line up. That is double the storage available on the entry level MacBook Air and would potentially make the iPhone 7 one of the smartphones with the highest internal storage capacity, alongside the ASUS Zenfone 3 Deluxe. Waterproof iPhone 7 waterproof concept by Herman Haidin The pain of your iPhone being damaged by water could soon be over, with some rumours suggesting the iPhone will be completely waterproof. According to a report in Chinese media, Apple has been developing a new “compound material” that is capable of repelling water, and which is expected to be used in the iPhone 7. The new material will also remove the need for Apple to include the two antenna bands across the back of the handset, which currently feature on the iPhone 6S. This may suggest that the body of the new iPhone will actually be all metal, but could be made from some other material that allows radio waves to transmit through it. Apple Watch Apple is widely expected to unveil the Apple Watch 2.0 at the same time as the iPhone 7 at the event on September 7th. The current first generation of the Apple Watch is now two years old and overdue a refresh. The new version is said to look similar to the first generation but will have much improved specs, be faster and will include a GPS radio and better barometer. Apple is expected to go big on the health and fitness features available on the Apple Watch when it releases the new version. Price Regardless of the rumours, one thing for certain is that the iPhone 7 is unlikely to be easier on your bank balance than any of its predecessors. Especially with Apple set to introduce new bigger storage options, expect prices to start at around 30,000 baht. Staff Writer Share.

No 16GB version could mean that the base price of the new iPhone could go up by almost Dh400 By Joseph George Published Sunday, August 14, 2016 Get ready to shell out more for your next iPhone as the new devices are going to be more expensive. The new iPhones are expected to be unveiled on September 6 or 7 and according to rumours, Apple could discontinue the base 16 GB model for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. It is even rumoured that Apple could unveil two new variants of the iPhone 7 Plus - one of them with a dual lens. The drop of 16GB version could, however, mean that the base price of the new iPhone could go up by almost Dh400. Apple has currently priced a 16GB iPhone 6s at Dh2,599 while an iPhone 6S Plus starts at Dh2,999. Currently there is no 32GB version. You can however buy the device much cheaper from various online stores. iPhone 7 UAE impact: iPhone 6S prices begin dropping If Apple does decide to discontinue the 16GB version - Samsung did just that with the Note 7 - the base price of a new iPhone could suddenly see a spike. According to latest rumors, emerging from China, Apple could price the new iPhone 7 at 5288 yuan (Dh2,923) , while 7 Plus will be priced at 6088 yuan (Dh3,366). A 64GB version of the iPhone 6S now costs Dh2,999 and 64GB iPhone 6s Plus costs Dh3,399. In comparison the Galaxy Note 7 is currently priced at Dh2,999 while the 32GB Samsung S7 is priced at Dh1,899 while an S7 Edge is priced at Dh2,399. It should be noted that reports have indicated that the new iPhone could lose its headphone jack but gain dual speakers and a USB type C charging, which means that you will not be able to use the older chargers. Samsung also introduced a similar change into its new Note 7 but provided users with an adapter for compatibility with older chargers.   Share with a friend or colleague Your e-mail address: Recipient's e-mail address: Message Related Articles UAE iPhone price crash: iPhone 6 @ Dh1,849, 5c @ Dh699, 5 @ Dh799 Samsung Note 7 leak before launch today: All you need to know Apple's new UAE launch date of iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c; confirms pricing ‘Pocket rocket’ iPhone SE in UAE stores from April 5 iPhone 6 launch impact: iPhone 5s, 5c UAE prices sinking fast Business Dubai announces crude oil price for February The Department of Oil Affairs of the Government of Dubai has announced that it has notified customers that the official HTC 10 Evo ushers in the next evolution in smartphones Pulse-pounding audio that adapts to the unique structure of your own ears.

Giants rookies Apple, Shepard banged up in preseason opener ART STAPLETON, Staff Writer 11:06 p.m. EDT August 13, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share USA TODAY Sports' Nicole Auerbach breaks down the biggest events on Day 9 of the Olympic Games. USA TODAY Sports Giants wide receiver Sterling Shepard reaches over Dolphins defensive back Brandon Harris but can't make the catch in the end zone during the first quarter of Friday’s preseason game. (Photo: AP) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE EAST RUTHERFORD - Eli Apple and Sterling Shepard have been linked from the moment they walked into the Giants’ training facility back in the spring. They squared off in rookie mini-camp in a memorable showdown with Apple ending up with an interception, but not before Shepard blew past him at the line of scrimmage. Seemingly every one of their practice meetings – Apple, a first-round cornerback, and Shepard, a second-round wide receiver – has been chronicled in some way. So perhaps it was fitting and completely unwelcomed by the Giants that their top two picks of the current draft class found themselves together at halftime in Friday’s preseason loss to the Dolphins, their first professional game. “We were sitting right next to each other (in the training room),” Shepard said after the game. “That’s my boy. We looked at each other and we’re like, ‘This is nothing. We’ll be all right.’ ” He paused before adding: “No, that’s not where either one of us wanted to be.” Apple was diagnosed with a lower-leg strain after undergoing X-rays, which were negative. Shepard departed because of a sore groin. His removal was precautionary. Both players talked in the locker room after the game and expressed relief that the injuries were minor. “It’s early. It doesn’t look to be anything serious at this point,” Giants coach Ben McAdoo said after the game. In a conference call Saturday, McAdoo said Apple was sent for further evaluation and a scan of his left knee. Shepard is expected to participate in individual drills during today’s practice. Victor Cruz will also return to practice, continuing his quest to come back after 22 months without football today after dealing with groin tightness the past week. The Giants are counting on Apple and Shepard to contribute this season. The former worked primarily on the outside opposite Janoris Jenkins with Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie sliding to slot with the first team. Apple did well on the opening drive, stopping Dolphins receiver Kenny Stills two yards shy of the first-down marker with a technically-sound tackle. He later recovered a fumble on special teams. “You know, you get into a groove a little bit playing a lot of plays, playing on special teams and defense and then you want to stay out there a little bit,” Apple said. “But I just knew I wasn’t 100 percent and I just didn’t want to cost my team or anything.” Shepard caught one pass for 24 yards, but the reception was a memorable one. The former Oklahoma star made a nice move on a deep corner route, and he ended up making a sliding catch near the right sideline. Rashad Jennings scored the only touchdown on a 3-yard run for the Giants one play later. “It’s just something I know I can do,” Shepard said. “It came up big in the situation, but that’s what I’m supposed to do. That’s what I get paid to do. That’s what I expect of myself.” Shepard was the headliner in a receiving corps that was without Odell Beckham Jr., who was held out of the game after a 50-minute weather delay, and Cruz. In the locker room following their pro debut, albeit in the preseason, neither Apple nor Shepard appeared concerned. In fact, leaving the locker room late Friday night, Shepard offered up a final message to the Giants’ fan base – very similar to the one he gave to Apple a few hours earlier. “It’s nothing too serious,” he said with a smile. “So don’t freak out.” Art Stapleton is a staff writer for The Record of Bergen NJ 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE TOP VIDEOS Achieving the Dream - Charles Woodson 3:40 Ex-USA gymnastics doctor arraigned on sex charges 2:01 Tom Crean diagnoses Fort Wayne loss 2:14 Blackmon talks Fort Wayne upset 1:25 Statistical oddities from the NBA's first month 1:52 Why the Los Angeles Clippers are rolling 1:36 Bruce Arena replaces Jurgen Klinsmann as USMNT coach 1:07 Celeb Pick 'Em with Miles Teller 3:25 NBA weekend in review: Clippers continue to roll 1:40 Jurgen Klinsmann fired as USMNT coach 0:48 More Stories Jackson '01 pulls off shocker in Greatest Teams Tourney Nov. 23, 2016, 7:13 a.m. Red Zone Road Show: Toms River South vs. Lakewood Nov. 23, 2016, 11:53 a.m. For Wall and Manasquan, state championship talk on hold Nov. 22, 2016, 10:32 a.m.

Its 120-watt One M Wireless Speaker (Amazon) has been sitting on my desk for the last few weeks, and like Sonos, it brings easy-to-configure wireless audio streaming to any room in the house. Raumfeld sent me two speaker setups to test, the aforementioned single speaker One M, and the Stereo Cubes — an option that delivers a wider sound stage. I’m still putting the Stereo Cubes to the test, but have used the One M for long enough that I feel comfortable speaking about its pluses and minuses. If you subscribe to one of the unit’s supported streaming services, and are aware of its shortcomings, then the One M can be an excellent pick. Let’s first address the elephant in the room. As of now, Raumfeld’s speakers don’t work with Apple Music or Google Play Music, although support for Google Cast is scheduled to land sometime soon. The lack of Apple Music support hurts, though, especially when Sonos, the top dog in the multi-room audio game, has it. It’s possible to stream music that you’ve manually synced or purchased from iTunes, and it’s also possible to play downloaded music from iTunes Match, but that still doesn’t make up for the lack of Apple Music support. Hands-on video Subscribe to our YouTube channel for more reviews Whether Raumfeld’s speakers will ever gain support for Apple Music is anyone’s guess. If Apple’s streaming service is an absolute must-have, then you’ll need to look elsewhere, at least for the time being. And keep in mind that these speakers do not feature AirPlay or Bluetooth support, so you can’t use either of those technologies as workarounds to play Apple Music. If you’re a Spotify Premium or Tidal subscriber, however, then the One M gets a lot more interesting. The benefit of an Internet-connected wireless streaming speaker is that the connection is between the speaker and the Internet. Thus, it can continue playing even if your phone leaves the network, receives a phone call, etc. Raumfeld’s wireless speaker model lineup Model Price Image One S $ One M $$ Stereo Cubes $$$ Stereo M $$$$ Stereo L $$$$$ Build quality and design The One M is a 5-driver 2-way stereo single-speaker solution that comes with a built-in down-firing subwoofer for awesome sound throughout the whole frequency range. The speaker rests on two feet that are positioned so that the high and mid-range drivers fire at a slight upward angle. The feet also serve to give the down-firing subwoofer room to breathe. At just a hair under 9 pounds, and dimensions of 16.1 x 7.9 x 7.1 inches, the One M is a solidly built speaker that will remain firmly planted wherever it is stationed. The speaker housing is constructed out of black or white MDF with a non-removable mesh speaker grill. Beneath the drivers rests brushed metal accents and buttons for controlling power and volume. You’ll also find four handy preset buttons near the bottom of the speaker for quick one-touch access to favorite Internet radio stations, albums, or playlists. One thing that I appreciate about Raumfeld’s speakers is that they are clearly designed to take a front-and-center role in the living space. With brushed metal accents and knobs, it’s a look that’s purposely designed to be seen and shown off. I’d feel totally comfortable placing the One M on my living room mantle, in my bedroom, in my office, or in virtually any other living space. Connectivity Although the Raumfeld One M is designed to work wirelessly, it does feature an Ethernet jack to connect directly to a router. I’ve tested the One M using an Ethernet connection and it worked well, but doing so disables its wireless connectivity. If you ever plan on moving the speaker around the house, you’ll want to stick with wireless connectivity for the most flexibility. Right above the Ethernet jack, on the rear of the One M, rests a pair of RCA line inputs. These inputs can be used for line level connectivity for an external device, such as a record player, CD player, MP3 player, mixer or other analog source. The great thing about the line input is that it can be shared across the network to other Raumfeld speakers in a multi-room setup. I’ll discuss that more in a follow-up post. Lastly, you’ll find a USB port for sharing music from a USB drive. The same port also has the ability to charge your iPhone. Raumfeld app If you’ve never used a multi-room wireless speaker before, it might seem strange that it doesn’t come with a remote. This is because your iPhone, iPad, or other smartphone functions as the remote. You’ll need to download the Raumfeld app to both set up and control your One M. The setup process is relatively easy, and involves pressing the setup button on the rear of the speaker cabinet, and going through a few initial steps inside the app. The Raumfeld app lends access to a variety of music streaming services, which include the following: TuneIn Tidal Rhapsody SoundCloud Spotify Coming soon: Google Play Music (Google Cast), Pandora, iHeartRadio, Deezer. As mentioned earlier, conspicuously missing from the currently supported list is Apple Music and Google Play Music. Considering that these are the two flagship music services for Apple and Android users, such omissions have to be carefully considered for anyone looking to delve headfirst into the Raumfeld ecosystem. The good news is that Google Cast support should be coming soon via a software update. Like the Sonos app, the Raumfeld app integrates many of these services directly within the app itself. This means that you can, for instance, control SoundCloud music and Tidal music from a single unified interface. Unfortunately, the same thing can’t be said about Spotify. Although you can control Spotify playback via the Raumfeld app, you can’t actually search for Spotify songs, or directly select which song you wish to play. To fully control Spotify, you’ll need to open the Spotify app and use its Connect feature, which is only available for Spotify premium subscribers. The app needs work… The app’s initial setup process is fairly straightforward, but I found that its navigation could use some additional polish. The app is too cluttered, and filled with nooks and crannies that give it a steep learning curve. I’ve also ran into occasional glitches and hiccups that forced me to restart the app to restore its normal functionality. This especially occurs when playing back music using Spotify, and attempting to switch to another streaming service. If you’re primarily a Spotify Premium user, then you won’t have to worry much about navigating around the Raumfeld app, since Spotify playback is managed via its own app. Of course, you’ll still need to use the Raumfeld app to control speaker settings, adjust equalizer settings, rename the speakers, disable LED indicator lights, etc. …but it has potential That’s not to say that the app is terrible, because it’s not. If you’re a Tidal user, then you’ll enjoy the fully integrated experience with that particular music service. You can also mix and match songs from multiple music services to combine them into a single playlist that plays back as if it were all coming from one source. Of course, the most glaring flaw with the entire Raumfeld ecosystem is the lack of support for two of the top streaming services — Apple Music and Google Play Music. I’m not trying to sound like a broken record, but if Raumfeld hopes to compete in a space traditionally dominated by Sonos, it needs to eventually rectify this issue. Sound quality is ridiculously good If there’s one thing that the One M excels at over everything else, it’s easily the sound quality. The sound pumped out of the One M’s 5-driver setup is seriously impressive. Even at low volume levels, the speaker filled my entire office with crystal clear sound. Not only does the One M push forth clear highs and mids, but you get awesome low end sound thanks to the built-in down-firing subwoofer. The sub, as you might imagine, makes a world of difference when compared to similarly-sized speakers that lack such a feature. That said, it’s best if you can place the unit in a corner to hear (and feel) the full benefit of the subwoofer. The One M gets super-loud, certainly louder than my ears could stand when I cranked the volume dial all the way up. Although I was satisfied with the out-of-the-box sound, I did opt to widen the sound stage — a preference found inside of the app’s settings. Out of the box, the sound stage is a bit narrow, which may be noticeable depending on speaker placement and room size. The bottom line is that One M’s sound quality is phenomenal, which goes a long way towards making it easier to overlook the app’s shortcomings. An app can be improved and iterated on, while the speaker hardware can not. Fortunately, Raumfeld got it right on the first try hardware-wise. Preset buttons The front panel of the One M features four preset buttons that can be assigned to specific albums, playlists, or radio stations. For example, while listening to a radio station on TuneIn, simply press and hold the desired preset button for 3 seconds. You’ll hear a little chime to let you know that the preset was set successfully. Presets allow you to quickly begin music playback without needing to interface with your iPhone. It’s especially great for radio stations, but works fine for playlists across many of the music services registered in the Raumfeld app. Sadly, there’s no way to skip tracks or go back to the previous track without launching the app, which seems like a missed opportunity in my opinion. Conclusion It’s disappointing that there’s no support for Apple Music or Google Cast as of yet, and the app itself can be quite frustrating and finicky at times. The lack of AirPlay support may also be a deal breaker for many. That said, Raumfeld knocks it out of the park when it comes to the most important feature for a speaker in this price range: sound quality. If I’m just starting off with establishing a wireless speaker setup at home, then I’m seriously considering Raumfeld’s ecosystem, especially if Apple Music isn’t a prerequisite. The build quality, styling, and most of all, sound quality, make it a worthy Sonos competitor from a pure sound perspective. In a follow-up hands-on, we’ll discuss Raumfeld’s Stereo Cube speakers, talk about establishing a multi-room setup via the app’s preferences, and showcase streaming line level analog audio to other rooms. You can purchase Raumfeld’s One M from Amazon for $499.

Cryptography Experts Say Apple Needs to Replace iMessage Encryption GO iMessage receives several fixes following mammoth research Aug 14, 2016 01:00 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Apple has added a series of short- and long-term defenses to the iMessage protocol following the private disclosure of several issues discovered by a team of researchers from the Johns Hopkins University led by Christina Garman, a group that also included famous cryptography expert Matthew Green. The five-man research team has presented their findings at the recently concluded Usenix Security Symposium. This is the same research that fueled a series of articles in the international press last March, about a zero-day in the iMessage protocol that allowed attackers to decrypt images and videos sent through iMessage apps. In a technical paper made available after the symposium's conclusion, the team reveals that at the basis of their research is a "chosen ciphertext attack" on the iMessage protocol's encryption. Attack is hard to pull off, reserved only for state-level actors Researchers say that their attack allows them to retrospectively decrypt certain types of iMessage payloads and attachments, if either the sender or receiver is still online. Their proof-of-concept attack on the iMessage protocol encryption can be carried out remotely and silently, and while it requires a high-level of technical expertise on the attacker's side, it's nothing that state-sponsored actors can't achieve. The researchers also discovered several flaws in how iMessage handles device registration and key distribution mechanisms. The attack scenario requires the attacker to be in a position to intercept iMessage traffic using stolen TLS certificates, or have access to Apple's servers, by legal or illegal means. This is possible because Apple stores undelivered iMessage data on its servers for up to 30 days and because some older iOS and Mac OS X versions don't employ certificate pinning on Apple Push Network Services (APNs) connections, allowing attackers with stolen TLS certificates to obtain a Man-in-the-Middle position. Attack can be used on historical, backed-up iMessage data After reverse-engineering the iMessage protocol, researchers also found that Apple doesn't rotate encryption keys at regular intervals, like modern encryption protocols such as OTR and Signal. This means that attackers can use this very same attack on iMessage historical data, which is often backed up inside iCloud and stored on Apple's servers. Law enforcement can force Apple trough a court order to provide access to iCloud backups and deploy this attack to decrypt older iMessage data. Their chosen ciphertext attack works only on ciphertexts containing gzip compressed data, which explains why only certain types of iMessage data can be recovered from its encrypted form. Because of this, the researchers named their attack the Gzip Format Oracle Attack. Other encryption protocols may be vulnerable to this attack as well Researchers believe that the Gzip Format Oracle Attack can also work on other encryption protocols that handle encrypted data in a gzip format. One of them is the Handoff service used to exchange data between Apple devices via Bluetooth LE, which Apple describes as using encryption "in a similar fashion to iMessage." Other technologies may include OpenPGP encryption as implemented by GnuPG. “  Overall, our determination is that while iMessage’s end-to-end encryption protocol is an improvement over systems that use encryption on network traffic only (e.g., Google Hangouts), messages sent through iMessage may not be secure against sophisticated adversaries. Our results show that an attacker who obtains iMessage ciphertexts can, at least for some types of messages, retrospectively decrypt traffic.  ” Apple fixed some of the flaws, but a major iMessage overhaul is needed The good news is that the research team said that the vulnerabilities were straightforward to repair, which Apple did after they were notified in November 2015. Since then, Apple has been pushing mitigations recommended by the researchers through monthly updates to several of their products. Most of the repairs were included in iOS 9.3 and OS X 10.11.4, which shipped in March 2016. A full list of short- and long-term mitigations that researchers proposed can be found in their researcher paper called Dancing on the Lip of the Volcano: Chosen Ciphertext Attacks on Apple iMessage, in section 7. Apple implemented most of their suggestions, like removing gzip compression and adding duplicate RSA ciphertext detection, but the researchers do recommend that Apple replaces the iMessage encryption mechanism in the long run. #iMessage#Apple#encryption#iMessage encryption#security update subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news DiskFiltration Attack Steals Data via HDD Sounds GATT Attack Affects Bluetooth-Enabled IoT Devices Microsoft Secure Boot Bypass Is the Backdoor the Government Has Always Wanted Microsoft Deprecates RC4 Support in Edge and Internet Explorer iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    iMessage encryption needs a facelift Related Apps Mullvad: A virtual private network application that conceals your computer's real IP address, hiding your identity while navigating online PDF Protection Remover: Fast, easy-to-use and straightforward software application designed to help users decrypt and remove any protection from PDF files Clean Space: Keep your privacy intact with the help of this software solution that makes it possible for you to clear your history and many traces of your online activity VPN Gate Client Plug-in: A plugin for SoftEther VPN, whose main purpose is to easily hide your online identity via a network of relay proxy servers that conceal your IP address Encoding Decoding Free: Easily protect any file on your computer, by using various encryption algorithms, with this simple and intuitive piece of software Secret Disk: Create a virtual disk that can be hidden and password-protected, in order to keep your data private and safe from the prying eyes of others Treek's Password Manager: Store your account credentials locally or in the cloud, synchronize your data and access passwords with a couple of mouse clicks, by using this lightweight application Reader comments Load old comments   Adobe Fined $1 Million for 2013 Hack That Affected Millions of Users more on: Adobe i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Saturday, August 13, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Learning From Apple’s Failures Rick Tetzeli (via John Gruber): Under Cook’s leadership, Apple has come to seem quite fallible to many people. Its recent products have seemed far less than perfect, at least compared to the collective memory of its astonishing iPod–iPhone–iPad run from 2001 to 2010. There are the public embarrassments, like its 2012 introduction of Maps, or those 2014 videos of reviewers bending, and breaking, an iPhone 6 Plus. Apple Pay hasn’t become the standard for a cashless society, and the Apple Watch “is not the watch we expect from Apple,” according to John Gruber, editor of Daring Fireball, the preeminent Apple-centric website. Then there are the design flaws: Apple Music has been saddled with too many features, as if it were something designed by, God forbid, Microsoft; the lens on the back of the iPhone 6 extrudes; the new Apple TV has an illogical interface and confusing remote control. Perhaps, say the worriers, Apple is doing too many things at once, cranking out multiple editions of the watch, endless varieties of watchbands, iPhones, and iPads in numerous sizes, proprietary earbuds alongside headphones from Beats. Credible reports that the company is spending billions of dollars in R&D to explore the possibility of designing a car only heighten the fear that Apple is spread too thin. Steve Jobs had been the company’s editor, proud of saying no to features, products, business ideas, and new hires far more often than he said yes. Apple’s seemingly diffuse product line reinforces the argument that Cook is not as rigorous. Eddy Cue on Apple Maps: The advantage of us coming to this later in the game is that, yeah, we have to do some of that, but in order to stay updated we’re trying to use the iPhone itself, and the data it’s giving us. Let me give you a good example: a golf course. How do we know when a new golf course opens up? We’re not exactly driving around looking for golf courses. But we know it’s there, because there are all these golf apps that get used at a golf course. If we see that all these golf apps are being used at a particular location, and we don’t show that as a golf course, we probably have a problem. You can discover that pretty quickly. This is a cute example, but is that really how Apple updates Maps? It doesn’t seem like this technique really scales. Eddy Cue: And look, we made some significant changes to all of our development processes because of it. For example, the reason you as a customer are going to be able to test iOS is because of Maps. We were never able to take it out to a large number of users to get that feedback. So, to all of us living in Cupertino, Maps seemed pretty darn good. Right? The problems weren’t obvious to us. Now we do a lot more betas. Todd Ditchendorf: I lived on a major thoroughfare < 5mi from Apple Campus when Maps was released - it misplaced my address by ~3mi. The “It worked for us near campus. How could we know it was crap elsewhere?” narrative is useful for recounting in interviews but it’s false Jeremiah Lee: And Apple Maps still sucks. It doesn’t have the newer streets in Mission Bay that have been there for over a year. I keep reporting… Craig Federighi: A world where people do not care about the quality of their experience is not a good world for Apple. A world where people care about those details and want to complain about them is the world where our values shine. That is our obsession. He’s saying the right things, but I’m not seeing this consistently come through in the products. Apple seems too unfocused, spread too thin, still in denial of how buggy their software has become. The iOS 9.3.4 update still hasn’t fixed the Camera audio bug, and it made my iPhone stop charging, at a very inconvenient time, so that I thought its Lightning port was damaged. Preview, long a reliable app, now regularly has drawing glitches and hangs. One of my apps hasn’t been up-to-date in the Mac App Store since May, and it is currently removed from sale, because of multiple backend store bugs. True or not, the perception is that the reality TV show and the car are distracting the company from working on the aging Mac lineup. Schiller’s triumphant “Can’t innovate anymore, my ass” line has become a punchline. The removal of the iPhone’s headphone jack seems like a parody of an Apple design decision. I want a new MacBook Pro, but at this point I’m more worried about the new keyboard and that Apple might do something more to make it less Pro, like remove Thunderbolt or the SD slot, than I am excited about what new features it might offer. Benjamin Mayo: What I think is interesting is how much Federighi and Cue play up the benefits of data collection elements, I’ve never seen them emphasise it like this before. Usually, it’s very quaint with endless assurances about privacy and anonymity. In this interview, though, they admit that the data they do collate is enough to accurately pinpoint new sports venues. Mitchel Broussard: Towards the end of the interview, Cue and Federighi mentioned the largely similar work relationship seen with both Tim Cook and former CEO Steve Jobs. Although the approach each took in tackling the job has been “completely different,” Cue said there’s one common factor he’s had with both: “I never wanted to disappoint Steve. I never want to disappoint Tim.” Peter N Lewis: Eddy Cue’s “We want to be there from when you wake up till when you decide to go to sleep” sounds disturbingly like the Microsoft of the 90s. Update (2016-08-13): McCloud: Regarding Todd Ditchendorf’s tweets: I once tried to use Apple Maps to go from One Infinite Loop to a UPS store, took me to Marriott. Update (2016-08-15): Nick Heer: It doesn’t really matter whether there’s a real decline in Apple’s software quality, or if it’s mostly an exaggeration bolstered by a larger user base and increased media coverage. What is concerning is the sentiment I perceive in Cue’s explanation — that a bug affecting 1% of users is comparable in 2016 to one affecting 1% of users in, say, 2006 or 1996. But, as he says, there’s an enormous chasm in the actual number of users affected, and that’s what’s particularly concerning. If Apple is pushing out, to be generous, one-quarter of the number of these bugs as they were ten years ago, that means that they’re still affecting orders of magnitude more users. My perception is that it’s not just the larger user base. I personally encounter a lot more Apple bugs than I used to. Apple Apple Maps Apple Software Quality Craig Federighi Eddy Cue History Interview iOS iOS 9 Mac App Store Maps Preview.app Tim Cook 3 Comments 3 Comments Roy August 17, 2016 1:49 AM Sadly, "still in denial" is a good way of putting it, and accurately describes the takeaway I got from the interview. Lukas August 17, 2016 4:17 AM >"I want a new MacBook Pro, but at this point I’m more worried about the new keyboard and that Apple might do something more to make it less Pro" Yep. It used to be that updates to Apple's products were exciting. Now, all they make me think is "I wonder if *this* is the time that Apple finally forces me to switch to Windows or Linux full-time." Also, related to software quality: a few months ago, both of the MacBook Pros that I use actively (and regularly update to the latest version of macOS) have started throwing up the "Your system has run out of application memory" message about twice a week, at which point I have to try to manually unpause all apps, save any data if apps still unpause for long enough, and restart the computer. Subjectively, at least for me, my Macs are now reaching Mac OS 9 levels of crazy behavior.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     IPhone 7 Will Have Touch Based Home Button Posted: Aug 13 2016, 11:55am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple   mobipicker   We can add an iPhone without its signature circular physical home button to our list of all the things we didn’t think were possible but turned out to be otherwise. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals This isn’t the first time that rumors about such a move by Apple have circulated and recent murmurs from industry insiders makes this seem a realistic possibility. So instead of the physical home button we have now we will have a touch sensitive button which will serve as Apple’s fingerprint scanner not to mention additional tap and press detection functionality. All this is dependent on Apple’s wish to maintain the feedback sensation that pressing a button gives. One way Apple might be able to kill two birds with one stone could be to introduce hepatic feedback within the new touch sensitive button. This move serves well with Apple’s over all aim to have a flat iPhone without and curves or bumps. The recent removal of the 3.5 mm jack is a step in this direction. Another reason why this move might be on Apple’s agenda is waterproofing that it wants to guarantee for its iPhones.

Shepard left the game with a sore groin, while Apple exited with what was called a lower leg strain.  "Sterling, we don't think it's serious. He's a guy that we're going to put through individual drills tomorrow, we're going to wrap him up, and see if he can practice after the individuals," McAdoo said Saturday during a conference call with reporters.  "Eli went to get a scan. I don't have anything new on Eli at this point. ... I haven't heard anything since the scan." How the rookies fared Both Apple and Shepard spoke to reporters after the game, and downplayed their injuries. Apple said he was "feeling fine," while Shepard told fans not to "freak out." Apple's mother, Annie Apple, has tweeted twice since the game that he is OK. McAdoo had said after the game Apple's injury "doesn't look to be anything serious at this point." Apple did have X-rays after the game.  McAdoo also said wide receiver Geremy Davis (hamstring) and fullback/tight end Will Johnson (burner) are unlikely to practice Sunday. "Geremy Davis, it does not look like he's going to practice tomorrow. But he has a mild strain," McAdoo said. "Will Johnson, we're waiting to here more back there, but it looks like he'll be out at this point." James Kratch may be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @JamesKratch.

All of the team's draft picks got plenty of action. Here's a review of how they did in their first game: (Hit the share button above to send this to a fellow Giants fan) Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com CB Eli Apple The Giants' first-round pick had an eventful first game. Apple played on the opening drive with the first-team defense, entering in the nickel package and playing left cornerback. Apple immediately gave up a short completion on third down but made the tackle short of the first down marker. Apple played 19 snaps on defense and finished with two tackles. Apple also was active on special teams, playing 10 snaps in the kicking game. Apple alertly recovered a fumble by Giants punt returner Bobby Rainey. Apple left the game with a lower leg strain, which is not considered serious. Rich Schultz | Getty Images We get it, it's preseason, but come on. This catch by the rookie @sterl_shep3 is ridiculous. #MIAvsNYGhttps://t.co/DZgYObgpbe — NFL Network (@nflnetwork) August 13, 2016 WR Sterling Shepard Shepard played with the first-team offense, operating mostly out of the slot. His one catch was a tremendous diving grab for 24 yards along the right sideline on the opening drive of the game. Shepard was open on a few other targets, but quarterback Ryan Nassib was off the mark with his passes. Shepard left the game early with a sore groin, but he said he was fine after the game. FS Darian Thompson As expected, Darian Thompson started at free safety. Thompson led the starters with 28 defensive snaps. It was a relatively quiet night for Thompson, who finished with one tackle. Quiet is not necessary a bad thing for a free safety because it means Thompson didn't allow any big plays. It was a good first step for Thompson, who will play a ton this season. Ed Mulholland | USA TODAY Sports LB B.J. Goodson Stuck behind veterans Jasper Brinkley and Kelvin Sheppard on the depth chart at middle linebacker, Goodson flashed the talent that made him a fourth-round pick out of Clemson. Goodson was flying around the field, making seven tackles with two tackles for loss. He added a tackle on special teams. Goodson won't leapfrog the veterans just yet, but his performance offered some optimism about his potential. James Kratch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com RB Paul Perkins As he has throughout camp, Perkins looked sharp carrying the ball on Friday night. The fifth-round pick had seven carries for 36 yards, including a 14-yard burst. But Perkins fumbled what appeared to be a clean handoff from Logan Thomas in the fourth quarter. Poor ball security is a surefire way for the rookie to earn a spot on the bench. Ray Stubblebine | AP Photo TE Jerell Adams Adams was solid on Friday after a shaky start to training camp. The sixth-round pick caught the only pass thrown his way for seven yards. Adams saw action as one of three tight ends in the jumbo package with the first-team offense at the goal line in the first quarter. Adams was also involved in the kicking game, logging 11 snaps on special teams. William Hauser | USA TODAY Sports Offensive undrafted free agents The Giants' offensive undrafted free agents have made some noise in training camp, but they were quiet in the preseason opener. Wide receiver Roger Lewis (pictured) worked with the first-team offense and logged 32 snaps. He had one catch for nine yards. Lewis will need to pick up his production as he battles for a roster spot. Running back Marshaun Coprich had two carries for six yards and one catch for five yards. He is buried on the depth chart in a crowded backfield. Receivers Darius Powe and K.J. Maye failed to catch a pass in limited action.   James Kratch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Defensive undrafted free agents Defensive tackle Greg Milhouse carried over his surprisingly strong camp into the opener. Milhouse was a disruptive presence in the middle, recording four tackles and a sack as he continues his push for a roster spot. Plucky cornerback Donte Deayon (pictured) had three tackles, including one tackle for loss. The odds are stacked against Deayon making the roster, but he continues to make the most of his opportunities. Safety Andrew Adams and defensive end Romeo Okwara each recorded four tackles to round out a solid effort by the defensive undrafted free agents.

Saturday, August 13, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] iPad Unfinished Business Jean-Louis Gassée: On the surface (pun unintended), Apple proffers the iPad Pro as a computer. We don’t begrudge Apple its right to ‘performance bragging’: Witness Apple’s rightfully proud statements about its powerful homegrown Ax line of processors and the impending A10 64-bit processors that easily outperform Seymour Cray’s supercomputers. But simply promoting the iPad to ‘computer’ avoids the real issue: Is the iPad Pro a PC replacement? Can we toss out our laptops and move wholly to our iPads? Dan Counsell: The problem with the iPad is both hardware and software related. Anything work related you can do on an iPad can, in most cases be done faster on a Mac. No question. […] This is still one of the fundamental problems with having the iPad attached to a keyboard — when you need to interact with the screen, you have to raise your arm out in front of you to interact with apps, it’s cumbersome and gets tiring very quickly. iPads are great to use while you’re lounging on the couch. However, they are not so great to use for extended periods of time at a desk. Dean: Remember when @tim_cook talked about android tablet apps being blown up phone apps? Tim Oliver: The new Apple Store app on iPad is just the iPhone version blown up to fit the screen. Come on… iOS iOS 9 iPad iPad Pro Mac 1 Comment 1 Comment Lukas August 17, 2016 4:05 AM > "when you need to interact with the screen, you have to raise your arm out in front of you to interact with apps, it’s cumbersome and gets tiring very quickly." Does it, though? Maybe for some people, but I think a lot of the people complaining about "arm fatigue" have never actually used a setup like this extensively. I'm using a Surface Book regularly, and I never use the mouse to interact with it, and I've never had any kind of problem with it being cumbersome, or tiring. In fact, when I use a MacBook, I have to actively remind myself that I can't touch the screen. "Arm fatigue" seems to be a mostly theoretical problem that doesn't really occur in practice. Now, if your dual 27-inch Mac Pro setup had touch screens, that might be more of an issue, but for something more MacBook-sized? I doubt most people would notice any kind of issue.

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH Apple Watch 2 release date, specs rumors: more functional features expected for 2nd-gen smartwatch Jude Abastar Aug 15, 2016 7:14 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (REUTERS/Robert Galbraith)A lineup of Apple Watch devices are displayed in a San Francisco retail store. With the enormous popularity of practically every product it makes, Apple made it a point to join the emerging smartwatch industry with the introduction of the Apple Watch back in April of last year. And just like the iPhone, MacBook lineup of laptops, and iPad, there was a lot of fanfare and expectation for the smartwatch. And now, the second generation Apple Watch 2 has some big shoes to fill. So what is to expect from this year's Apple Watch 2? Yahoo noted that probably the most important improvement of this second generation watch is the integration of the watchOS 3, which according to the report, is a lot more sophisticated compared to the previous two operating systems. The fact is the first two versions of the watchOS were decent, but it didn't provide the device the kind of real usability. The same report claimed that the user interface of the first watch was "painfully slow" and wasn't really that great. A quite interesting thing about the Apple Watch 2 is that although it is claimed to be finally free of the iPhone pairing in order to do stuff like receiving calls or short messaging, it actually could be released together with the upcoming flagship smartphone, the iPhone 7. Accordingly, the watch could be equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) for the very first time — a feature that many believe will make it stand out and separate itself from the rest of the competition. Aside from the GPS function, the upcoming smartwatch is also rumored to be waterproof, which actually makes sense because Apple is trying to advertise the product as a smartwatch that is designed for athletes, more like a fitness tracker. Meanwhile, a thinner body and frame should also make it a more interesting competition to various fitness trackers and watches in the market. While there still is no official word from Apple, it is likely that the Apple Watch 2 will be released in the company's big event this fall.

NEWS > Watch Giants vs. Dolphins Highlights > Instant Analysis: Giants fall 27-10 > Giants Postgame Reactions PHOTOS > From the Sidelines: Giants vs. Dolphins VIDEOS > Diving catch by Sterling Shepard Eli Apple and Sterling Shepard contributed as reserves, posted modest numbers – and put a scare into the team’s hierarchy by sustaining injuries that proved to be minor in the Giants’ 27-10 preseason loss to the Miami Dolphins in MetLife Stadium. Apple strained his lower left leg, and Shepard had a sore groin. >> WATCH GIANTS VS. DOLPHINS HIGHLIGHTS “I kind of just tweaked it a little bit on special teams, punt return,” said Apple, the cornerback from Ohio State who had two solo tackles. “Just got a little bit off balance and I was trying to hold up the guy that was blocking and kind of just tweaked it. But I’m feeling fine. It’s just a lower leg strain, it’s gonna be fine.” Apple, who said it was “throbbing” on the outside of his knee, wasn’t sure if he will work when the Giants next practice on Sunday. He said the injury gave him a scare. “Initially it did, because I’ve never had that feeling before,” he said. “I never had like knee problems but just after a while, just thinking and dealing with the trainers and getting a little treatment on it and getting the X-Rays and all that, it was fine.” Shepard – who had one reception for 24 yards on the Giants’ game-opening touchdown drive – seemed even less concerned about his injury. >> INSTANT POSTGAME ANALYSIS “I feel good,” he said. “It’s just sore from practice, but it’s all good now.” Shepard was asked if he was aware that “everyone kind of freaked out” because he and Apple left the game at about the same time. “I can see that happening, especially when Eli and (me) both (are being tended to),” he said. “But it’s nothing too serious, so don’t freak out.” Okay, we won’t. •  The start of the game was delayed for an hour because of a severe weather threat that prompted officials to clear the MetLife Stadium seating bowl. The fans were permitted to return to their seats after a 46-minute wait. The teams took the field at the same time, and had a second, abbreviated warmup period. “We changed a couple of things,” coach Ben McAdoo said. “We adjusted and improvised with the delay.” Perhaps the most notable decision was to not play Odell Beckham Jr. “He came out, we had intentions of playing him in a handful of plays,” McAdoo said. “We got back in, we had the delay and I decided not to play him.” •  Andre Williams led the Giants with 41 rushing yards on nine carries. But Shane Vereen had the ground game highlight of the night when he used a nifty spin move to pick up 19 yards on the first series. •  Second-year defensive end Owa Odighizuwa had 2.0 sacks among his three solo tackles. He had three quarterback hits and was the most prominent contributor on an active defensive line. •  Linebacker Mark Herzlich led the Giants with eight tackles (six solo)…Brad Wing had a 37.7-yard net average on seven punts. •  Bobby Rainey was the Giants’ primary kickoff and punt returner. He brought back two kickoffs for 36 yards and three punts for 17 yards. But he fumbled twice.   •  The Giants announced Friday morning that Eli Manning would not play. Manning was in uniform on the Giants’ sideline. •  The Giants are 0-7 in preseason games vs. the Dolphins. •  The Giants had five game captains: Ryan Nassib and four former Dolphins (Olivier Vernon, Kelvin Sheppard, John Jerry and Orleans Darkwa).

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Pokemon Sun And Moon Apple Pokemon Sun And Moon news Pokemon Go Update iPhone 7 Update: New Apple Device To Be Released On September 16; Disappointing New Features Unveiled Ray Pilares First Posted: Aug 13, 2016 05:10 AM EDT Appl iPhone (Photo from hurk/Pixabay) The release of the latest iPhone has always been seen as a major event in the tech industry. Apple fans and those who follow the latest trends in gadgets are eager to know what the tech giant has in store for them. The same thing is true for the upcoming iPhone 7 release on September 16.  There is a lot of excitement and anticipation for the latest Apple smartphone, but according to an article on Forbes, analysts are saying that fans should not expect too much or they could face disappointment. The rumored features of the iPhone 7 might seem exciting and all. Rumors about the iPhone 7 came out as early as 2015 when the iPhone 6s was released. Speculations suggest that it would have 3 GB of RAM and that it would probably run on the A10 processor of Apple. Other speculations suggest that it would have dual-lens camera, which is something that got many Apple fans excited. There are also suggestions that the iPhone 7 would be coming out as a waterproof device. Another thing that could be different with the latest iPhone is the fact that it could be available in blue. While none of these features have been officially confirmed, there are those that suggest that the iPhone 7 could disappoint. According to Tech Times, the latest iPhone may not live up to the hype. It looks too similar to iPhone 6s. The popularity of the Apple smartphone is also declining. Analysts also say that Apple could be reserving the big feature changes for the rumored iPhone 8 which is supposed to come out in 2017, the 10th year anniversary of Apple's flagship product. Rumors about the iPhone 8 makes it sound so radical, with an all glass chassis. Who would want to buy an improved iPhone 6s when a glass iPhone will come out after a year?

And no, that's not our veiled attempt at calling Apple the Evil Empire, we're simply noting the return of an all-black handset, at least if a series of a leaked photos from a Chinese-language website prove legit. Or maybe what we're seeing is a darker version of what Apple calls "Space Gray" in its lineup. That's a color SKU that Apple offers in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s lineups, only those handsets are considerably lighter in color than the presumed iPhone 7 Plus that apparently starred in an unsanctioned photo shoot ahead of its official unveiling next month. It might also be an iPhone 7 Pro model. The person who posted the pics refers to the handset as an iPhone 7 Plus, but rumor has it there will be a dual camera array on the iPhone 7 Pro model, one of three iPhone 7 SKUs (iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus being the others). In the shot above you can make out the dual-cameras, which are nestled in a slight hump in the upper left-hand corner of the handset, along with an LED flash that sits flush with the iPhone. One of the other leaked photos shows the bottom of the handset with a Lightning port and speaker arrangement with speaker grills on both sides. Notice there's no 3.5mm headphone jack—it's been rumored that Apple's getting rid of the audio port and using the Lightning port for the included set of earbuds. You also get a glimpse of the Smart Connector, those three little dots that sit on the backside of the chassis right above the Lightning port. This is a feature that already exists on both iPad Pro models as a way to connect a keyboard accessory, something that's not really needed for a smartphone, though it's possible that its inclusion on the iPhone 7 will be for wireless charging and/or third-party accessories. In any event, we'll know more details soon. Word on the web is that Apple will hold an iPhone 7 launch event on September 16.

Credit: AppleMust More like this WWDC 2016: Apple’s 8 key enterprise stories WWDC 2016: Apple’s Swift 3.0, star of the show IBM says: ‘Swift is now ready for the enterprise’ Video 5 Easy Data Visualizations in R Designed solely for the purpose of server-side Swift development, Perfect is a Web application server for OS X and Linux created by a lesser known Canadian startup historically connected to Apple, PerfectlySoft. Swift increase Apple introduced Swift at WWDC 2014, making it open source in December 2015. The language has enjoyed “meteoric” growth since launch, and has also been adopted for enterprise applications by IBM. That historical connection and the company’s deep understanding of Apple’s programming philosophy meant the Canadian firm was able get Swift running on a server marginally before IBM accomplished it. The number of jobs requesting Swift in the last full year versus the previous full year climbed by 600 percent. Apple’s decision to announce Swift Playgrounds will stimulate even more interest when it ships in fall. What is Perfect? So what is Perfect?In simple terms it is a framework for developing Web and other REST services in Swift. It provides a framework and an HTTP/HTTPS server for creating such services for both client-facing and server-side applications. To learn a little more about Perfect’s significance and history I spoke with the company CEO, Sean Stephens, at WWDC. “The history of Perfect is anchored in the history of the Lasso programming language,” he began. In the late 1980s, Claris was formed as an Apple spinoff to provide business users with the software they needed. Those products included the likes of MacPaint, MacDraw, and FileMaker. Claris acquired the rights to Lasso, a still very popular programming language that maintains its own passionate developer community and in which Stephens has extensive experience. He is also CEO of LassoSoft. “Perfect is a Swift-based development framework. Without the Swift programming language, Perfect would not exist,” he said. Lasso Swift The first version of Perfect appeared in December 2015, ten days before Apple officially declared Swift an open source language. “When Apple said it would make the Swift programming language open source, an alarm bell went off in my mind,” he said. “Because much of what is Swift is strikingly similar to Lasso, it was easy for CTO Kyle Jessup to begin building the Perfect framework in and for Swift, so developers can use Swift and Perfect together to write server apps.” Fractionalization He thinks his language matches current developer needs. “There’s a real desire among developers for less fractionalization in programming,” he explains. This is the trend among developers to want development tools to be as easy to use as the applications they develop, and a desire to be able to achieve great results using fewer languages. Perfect lets developers use Swift to build an entire project, including both front- and back-end services, Stephens claims. Developers interested in taking a look at what’s on offer can visit Perfect’s Github repository and explore the company’s clear and extensive resources site. “Most of the programming languages that are widely used today are a decade old or more such as Java – a proprietary language that does not provide developers with a joyful user experience,” Stephens said. Enterprise opportunity The implications of Swift on enterprise IT will be highly significant. “The vast majority of applications (especially business applications) require server-side software to pass data back and forth,” he said. “More often than not, most server apps today run on an old proprietary language like Java. Swift has a lot of potential to change that because it's got that Apple pedigree, it’s open source, and developers love using it for building mobile apps for the iPhone and iPad.” Looking around video chat app, Smirkee might be a nice example of an accessible mobile app built using Perfect and Swift. It uses server side algorithms to identify people’s facial expressions in real time. Perfect 2.0 will ship once Apple introduces Swift 3.0, probably in September. Move over Java, Perfect’s in town With Apple rapidly becoming a key player in the evolution of the digital enterprise, and with key partnerships in place to extend its influence in the space, Stephen’s sees good opportunity for Perfect and Swift in enterprise IT. After all, when every enterprise is a digital enterprise, then a cross platform server side open source developmental language can only become more popular. Google+?

 Apple's pricey data center finally gets the green light Sam Shead Aug. 12, 2016, 11:36 AM 4,087 facebook linkedin twitter email print A computer generated image of Apple's data centre. Apple Apple has been given the green light to build the first data hall for a huge new data center on a 197-hectare site near the west coast of Ireland. Irish planning body An Bord Pleanála gave Apple's first data hall the go ahead on Wednesday despite opposition from a number of individuals and local businesses. The planning body said the data center will provide the area with a significant economic boost, adding that they took into account how hard it is to find sites that are able to accommodate huge data centers that need to be connected to the national grid. Apple has received planning permission to build just one data hall but it hopes to build a total of eight on the site over the next 10-15 years. The iPhone maker will have to apply for planning permission every time it wants to open a new data hall. The facility will be built in the middle of a forest just outside the small town of Athenry in County Galway. It will initially consist of a single data hall, an administration building, and other associated developments. Over 200 people will be employed in the building of the data center, while a significantly smaller number of IT workers and data center technicians will operate the facility when it's built. The data center — which Apple says will be totally powered by renewable energy — will be built on land that state forestry company Coillte used for growing and harvesting non-native trees. Apple plans to restore native trees to Derrydonnell Forest and create an outdoor education space for local schools, as well as a walking trail for the community. Apple Maps/Skitch/Sam Shead Apple's Irish data center plans were approved last September by Galway County Council but they were held up after a number of appeals were made to An Bord Pleanála. Appellants raised concerns over the impact on the local wildlife, the data center's energy usage, and flooding, among other things. Apple wants to use the data center to store European user data and to help power online services including the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, Maps, and Siri for customers across Europe, according to a press release announcing the development in February 2015. The Cupertino company was hoping to have the facility up and running by early 2017 but that target date now looks unrealistic given Apple is yet to start any building work. Some 5,500 of Apple's 18,300 European staff are based in Ireland, which is also home to its European headquarters. The company has pledged to hire an additional 1,000 staff in Ireland before 2017. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have also built data centers in Ireland, and Facebook also has one planned. Elsewhere in Europe, Apple is planning to build a data center in Denmark on the same scale as the one in Ireland. The company does not reveal where all of its data centers are but reports suggest Apple also has data center facilities in Newark, Santa Clara, and Cupertino on the west coast of the US, as well one in Maiden on the east coast. Business Insider contacted Apple about the data center completion date but did not immediately hear back. NOW WATCH: How to supercharge your iPhone in 5 minutes Loading video...

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Can banks gain a share of mobile payments market? By Jonathan Duffy (sian@brightbee.co.uk) Shares Mobile payments are gaining momentum in the UK. Apply Pay had the initial monopoly, with Android Pay launching in the UK a year later. A week after Android Pay launched in the UK, 460,000 payments had been accepted. Countries across the globe are increasingly moving towards cashless societies thanks to advances in contactless payments. Instead of carrying a physical wallet with cash and bank cards, mobile wallets are becoming an increasingly popular method of payment. What role will banks play in this new era? The death of the wallet The number of smartphone users worldwide is predicted to grow to 6.1 billion by 2020 according to the 2015 Mobility Report from Ericsson. With the growth of smartphones across the globe and the consequential shifting consumer habits, mobile payments are a natural step beyond plastic cards. Smartphones have become an extension of ourselves; they are always on and we always have them with us. According to payments technology company Adyan, in Q3 2015 47 per cent of UK online transactions were made through mobile devices. Additionally, a report from Mobile Ecosystem Forum tells us that now, an estimated that 69 percent of mobile users globally conduct at least some of their banking using their mobile device. While mobile banking and payments is increasing, on the flip-side the use of cash is dropping. Last year, less than half of consumer payments in the UK were made using cash, according to Payments UK. In 2015, cash made up 45 per cent of payments, compared with 64 per cent in 2005. This number is expected to continue to fall to around 25 per cent by 2025. With millennials being digital-natives and mobile-first, they put online and convenience above physical presence and traditional banking services. Mobile payment apps have added a new and convenient way for people to pay for goods and services. The total value of proximity mobile payments is seeing significant growth in 2016 and has the power to revolutionise the shopping experience, making payments more convenient and faster. It is an attractive option for brands and customers alike as it makes a smoother payment journey for the customer. It is not surprising that major phone-technology players from Apple to Google and Samsung are pushing forward with their mobile wallets, but where does this leave the banks? It is no secret that banks have concerns about the tech giants Apple and Google entering their sectors with mobile wallets and payment solutions. Don’t be the next MVNO The risk of banks losing market share is very real, especially as the likes of Apple build on their consumer relationships to make further progress into mobile payments. Banks need to innovate and explore ways to retain their brand position and their customers’ loyalty or face becoming sidelined. Decreasing revenue and increasing costs are forcing banks, including high-street names, such as Lloyds and Barclays, to lay off employees and automate functions. This tactic of slashing costs can be helpful up to a point, but what about exploiting new markets and technologies to create business and healthier balance sheets? Banks must now compete on technology in order to stay relevant. According to a 2015 survey by software firm Temenos, 27 per cent of senior bankers reported tech companies as the greatest threat to their business. Take Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) as a recent example of a sector overtaken by technology. In the early 2000s they had all the influence over their customers. Fast-forward to 2007 and Apple iPhone is launched. Exclusive contracts with operators were signed (AT&T in the US and O2 in the UK) and the operators’ worst nightmare of becoming ‘dumb pipes’ began turning to reality. Gone are the MVNO heydays; Apple and Google are now the brands most synonymous with mobile innovation. How do banks avoid the same fate? Play tech firms at their own game Banks can ward off tech firms and disrupt the industry if they look at innovative ways to use existing technology quickly. There are a few early movers such as Danske Bank in the Nordic countries which has the MobilePay app using a phone agnostic beacon payment technology, based on Netclearance’s mBeaconPay, to accept payments at retailers. It has over 2.9 million active users and has been installed on an estimated 90 per cent of Denmark’s smartphones. The payment system has also been rolled out to Norway and Finland. Dankse Bank’s mobile wallet is the third most popular app in Denmark and Norway and over 90 million transactions were made through MobilePay in 2015. Cashless societies Denmark is well on its way to becoming the world’s first cashless society and MobilePay shows that frictionless, tech agnostic and highly secure POS systems are winning the hearts and minds of the customer, and delivering real value to merchants. It is enabling banks to retain or even grow their customer base. Tech-savvy consumers, world-leading smartphone penetration and progressive banks have kept the Nordic countries ahead of the game with mobile payments. Mobile payments platforms are providing retailers with an intuitive customer experience via inexpensive technology and remove costly merchant fees as the technology takes transactions direct from bank to retailers, changing the value chain. Without requiring tokenised card details to be held on a database somewhere, the technology is inherently more secure. By directly engaging their customers, banks can also create additional brand loyalty as well as providing a desirable feature to entice new customers. Banks have access to huge, proprietary data about their customers’ spending habits, which some have begun using to offer customers more personalised experiences and recommendations. When combined with partnerships with outside retailers and firms, this data could be used to drive spending and create customer satisfaction on a larger scale than the loyalty program from a single company. Customers want an app that allows them easy access to products they like and so far the big technology firms have all failed to deliver. Frictionless first At its core, mobile payments are about making payments easy and creating a process that is as frictionless and simple as possible whilst also being secure and adding value to the end user. Banks have the ability to provision this through mobile beacon technology and the time is now to start using it in order to stop the tech giants getting there first. Topics Apple Pay.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Aug 13, 2016 at 6:41AM In light of some of the recent staffing changes reported at Project Titan, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) automotive ambitions seem more likely to become reality than ever before. Image source: Getty Images. Apple's purported attempt to disrupt the automotive industry holds out the promise of a torrent of fresh revenue for the company and its suppliers. Considering what we know, Apple's likely automotive entry turns its possible partners into intriguing potential buys ahead of Project Titan becoming a reality -- particularly Magna International (NYSE:MGA). Apple's coming assembly partner? Contract assembly remains far more the exception than the norm across the automotive industry, and that's where Magna comes in for Apple's Project Titan. The global supply chain of automotive-parts manufacturers remains diverse and somewhat fragmented, much like the smartphone component space. However, when it gets down to assembling an automobile into a finished product, almost all of the world's largest carmakers own and operate their own assembly plants -- leaving Apple in need of a partner to help bring Project Titan to market. Though owning their own plants provides certain advantages for automakers, it also requires massive capital investments. With slightly more than $162 billion in net cash and investments on its balance sheet, Apple could easily pay for its own plant, but it would probably also crimp margins and return on capital to an unpalatable degree. That's where Magna International comes in, as one of the only companies to offer contract auto-manufacturing services. Many sources have cited Magna's Streyr unit as the most likely place for Apple to turn to. In fact, Magna Steyr's potential to work with tech companies like Apple prompted on Morgan Stanley analyst to describe the firm as a possible "Foxconn of cars" in a note to investors last May, a tag many in the industry throw around in relation to Steyr. If Project Titan takes off and leads to Apple cars, and if Magna is the chosen manufacturer, ramping up would require Magna to undertake a massive expansion of its assembly scale, but Apple could finance it. If a relationship happens here, Magna's undervalued stock becomes all the more intriguing today. A deal today? Magna appears undervalued on both a relative and absolute basis, as its trading multiples reveal. See for yourself. P/LTM EPS P/LTM Normalized EPS 8.2 10.1 Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. P = price. LTM = last 12 months. EPS = earnings per share. For context, the S&P 500 currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of slightly more than 25. Of course, any discussion of a company's valuation needs to incorporate its business outlook, and Magna's relatively constrained valuation implies some serious headwinds. However, a quick scan of its business shows that the outlook appears pretty favorable, relative to its seemingly gloomy valuation. It's risky to bet on a stock based on what might happen in the future, but Magna isn't solely a play on what might happen with Apple.  What Does Magna Do? Magna International is one of the largest manufacturers of modular auto parts in the world. Per its 10-K filing, Magna's core competencies include "producing body, chassis, exterior, seating, powertrain, electronic, vision, closure and roof systems and modules, as well as complete vehicle engineering and contract manufacturing" to the global auto industry . The company generates over 50% of its revenue from providing the above components to auto giants Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler, making any potential assembly with a would-be competitor like Apple a difficult balancing act for the company. Fully assembling complete automobiles represents less than 10% of Magna's total sales, though reports have already linked Apple and Magna's Steyr unit to discussions presumably tied to Project Titan .  Equally interesting, Magna has repeatedly demonstrated an interest in moving deeper into full-fledged automobile manufacturing, though it has been met with resistance from its powerful automaker customers. A tech company like Apple seems like an ideal fit for a company with Magna's demonstrated ambitions. However, even outside of its upside potential with electric vehicles, even the near-term outlook for Magna appears far rosier than its depressed multiples would have you think. Among the 17 sell-side research analysts covering Magna International stock, their estimates are all varying degrees of bullish. For its current fiscal year, the average of their estimates calls for a sales increase 12.3% to $36.1 billion, and even the lowest estimate calls for the company's sales to grow just over 10% year over year. The same goes for Magna's bottom line, though to a lesser degree. Here, analysts expect Magna's earnings per share to grow slightly more than 4%, and not a single analyst forecasts an EPS decline for the company. Either way, given the apparently healthy outlook for its business, Magna's compressed valuation metrics don't make a lot of sense, and that doesn't even factor in potential meaningful catalysts -- such as Apple's Project Titan -- that could come on line in the medium or longer term. Investors may be concerned that U.S. auto sales might not live up to their record-setting 2015, but if so, analysts' estimates aren't reflecting it. Aside from that potential headwind, Magna could be an interesting investment candidate, especially if its rumored role as a manufacturing partner for Apple comes to fruition.

Here are some of the most innovative apps that make your smartphone do things you’ve never imagined. 1. Measure your heart rate Instant Heart Rate is an app that uses your phone’s camera and flash to take a reading of your pulse. Just place your index finger on the camera and the app will automatically measure your heart rate by detecting color changes. The app also collects data from each reading to create charts that help you monitor your heart rate over time. Plus, you can add tags and notes such as “Just woke up,” “Before bed,” “Exercising,” and “Resting," to make your tracking more effective. You don’t have to be a fitness enthusiast to benefit from this app. It’s also helpful if you have a medical condition such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes and need to monitor your heart rate closely. When I tested the app, it was within a beat or two of manually measuring my heart rate. A free basic version is available for both Apple and Android users. However, there is also a Pro version (Apple, $2.99/Android, $1.99) that’s ad-free and offers unlimited data tracking.

But the news left some experts wondering why Apple was so late to the party. AP Photo/Vincent Yu, File)   Andrea Peterson Washington Post WP Bloomberg     Apple will finally start paying out cash rewards to researchers who find security problems in their products, the company announced at the BlackHat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas Thursday. But the news left some experts wondering why Apple was so late to the party. So-called "bug bounty" programs are now standard among most tech giants. They can help keep consumers safe by encouraging independent researchers to help companies fix security flaws. When a researcher finds a legitimate problem, rewards can range all the way up to the six figures. But Apple historically had a different approach -- offering a tip line where people could report security problems, but not handing out any reward other than putting the researcher's name on a thank you page on its website. "It was kind of an insult," said Matthew Green, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University who has previously told Apple about security problems in its products and didn't know why it took them so long to launch a bounty program. "Maybe after San Bernardino they felt there was some pressure to acknowledge that it wasn't enough to give people a pat on the back -- even if they can't pay enough to compete with the free market," he said. Apple's lack of a bug bounty program drew criticism earlier this year when the FBI paid an unknown entity more than $1 million for help breaking into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. Without a bug bounty program, some argued, the only way researchers could make money from finding bugs in Apple's products was selling them off to the highest bidder -- in this case, the FBI. But now, Apple has a chance "to compete for the type of exploits available and control how they'll be used," said Jeff Pollard, principal analyst focused on IT security at Forrester Research. Apple's new rewards program will launch in September, but won't be open to anyone. Instead, it will be invite-only -- at least in the beginning. But researchers who approach the company with a major problem also will be invited to join. Most programs are open to all researchers. The program will only reward researchers for finding a few categories of problems at launch. The biggest payouts will be for bugs affecting software built into components that help Apple's devices start up securely: Researchers who find one of those could get up to $200,000. That makes Apple's bug bounty program one of the most lucrative out there. Google's program, which launched in 2010, upped its largest bounty -- for breaking the security of its Chromebooks -- to $100,000 this March. Microsoft's largest per bug payout is also $100,000. Apple's potential big rewards may be aimed at convincing researchers to turn to the company when they find a problem, rather than the open market where vulnerabilities might be bought up for use in criminal or state-sponsored hacks. But even with Apple's hefty new payouts, other places may still pay a better premium for ways to hack into the company's products. Last year, Zerodium, a company that deals in buying zero-day vulnerabilities from researchers and selling them to large corporations and government agencies, said it paid $1 million to researchers who were able to remotely hack into the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. The company doesn't offer the same massive payouts for problems in other products. "No software other than iOS really deserves such a high bug bounty," Zerodium founder Chaouki Bekrar told The Post last year, citing Apple's strong security built into its products. That internal focus on security may be one reason Apple held out against an official bug bounty program so long while, even as other sectors like the automotive industry, airlines and the Department of Defense started to get in on the game. The rise of Apple Pay may be another factor that pushed the company to be more aggressive about getting help from the larger security community, according to Green. "They really need to know that system is secure" because there's actual money at risk, he said. "I think a lot of researchers would rather hand vulnerabilities over to Apple than to someone who is going to use it to steal people's payment information."

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Microsoft’s employees more innovative than Apple’s: Study Microsoft’s employees more innovative than Apple’s: Study For the study the team analysed the data gained from quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. By: IANS | San Francisco | Updated: August 13, 2016 5:17 pm According to the study Microsoft, which is often perceived as less innovative than its rivals– Facebook, Google, IMB and Apple– has more innovative employees the other tech giants. (File Photo) Microsoft’s employees are more innovative than Apple’s, and Facebook’s staff are less creative than most tech workers, says a study led by Indian-origin entrepreneur. The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. “The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple’s, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook, or IBM employees,” Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. “They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn’t require them to personally be innovative,” Birwadker said. Genelia Deshmukh On Being A Mother And Bollywood Career Bigg Boss 10 November 22 Review: Bani Lashes Out At Swami Om, Manoj Punjabi Demonetisation: Supreme Court Refuses To Stay Proceedings Why Is Jammu Kashmir’s Machil Sector Seen As A Safe Passage For Infiltrators Amartya Sen No Longer Part Of Nalanda University Board Government Plans To Bring GST Bills As Money Bills: Here’s Why Demonetisation: Relief For Common Man: Find Out More Salman Khan And Family Celebrate Helen’s Birthday At Galaxy Apartments Demonetisation: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Defends Government’s Move Aamir Khan’s Dangal Pales In Comparison To Surroundings Of Mahavir Singh Phogat’s Village J&K: 3 Soldiers Killed, Body Of One Mutilated In Machhal Sector PM Narendra Modi Asks People To Rate Demonetisation Ex-Gujarat Energy Minister Has Financial Interest In 8 Onshore Oil Blocks: Find Out More US President-Elect Donald Trump Lays Out Agenda For First 100 Days Modi Keynote Prank App Spurns Several Clones “They (Facebook) invented social networks, and there’s always been this layer of innovation,” Birwadker explained adding, “but with more pressure on revenue, and especially on mobile and advertisements, I think we are seeing a lot less risk taking and adventurousness by their employees.” On the other hand, Microsoft is often perceived as less innovative, because the more established tech giant has lagged behind the growth of its competitors. Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organised way, the study said. “But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realised that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B,” Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft’s latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work “fun”, the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren’t necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. “You can’t have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there,” Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave. In the study, published by Good&Co, the team analysed the psychometric data gained from anonymous personality quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of what they believe are perceived as the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. In total, the two-year-long study also analysed 10 million responses from 2,50,000 users. Questions ranged from thoughts and feelings about networking to how they handle problems at work.

However, leaked schematics reveal that the speaker grills previously seen are purely cosmetic.  ( NowhereElse.fr ) Advertisement Multiple rumors and leaks point to the fact that Apple's upcoming flagship smartphone, the iPhone 7 will have dual speakers. However, leaked schematics reveal that this might not be the case. It has been previously reported that the iPhone 7 will be dropping the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of Lightning earphones. With the headphone jack out of the way, Apple is expected to fill out the space with a second speaker, with numerous leaked designs of the smartphone showing that there are speaker grills on either side of the Lightning port at the bottom of the iPhone 7. However, according to the documents, which were first spotted by French website NowhereElse.fr, the additional holes at the bottom of the iPhone 7 may be purely cosmetic, with Apple deciding to fill out the bottom of the smartphone with the second set of speaker grills to maintain symmetry. According to the Chinese text of the schematics, the area that is currently occupied by the headphone jack on iPhones will contain only a microphone and microphone mesh on the iPhone 7. There is no mention if there will be a speaker in that area, with most of the holes of the speaker grill seemingly without any function whatsoever. Only the one furthest to the right will have a function, as it will be serving as a microphone. Further adding to the discovery is a pair of images shown by MacRumors on the design of the iPhone 7 casing. The drawings reveal that the holes of the left speaker grill are not cut all the way through, except for one which would serve as the microphone hole. However, as with any other rumor in advance of an official announcement, the report could still turn out to be untrue or simply incomplete. While the second speaker grill could house the microphone, there is still seemingly enough space to fit in a second speaker module. As such, Apple users who have been looking forward to the iPhone 7 having stereo speakers should not lose hope just yet, but still ready themselves to be disappointed if this report turns out to be true. Another recent leak on the iPhone 7 revealed that Apple will be replacing the option of a space gray color with space black, which will be offered in addition to the rose gold and gold options. Market experts have warned that the iPhone 7 might not be able to live up to expectations, with the smartphone to post lower sales compared with its predecessors despite several new features, as it is being seen as a minor upgrade to the iPhone 6s without any new groundbreaking improvements.

The study led by  an Indian-origin entrepreneur further says that Facebook staff are less creative compared to other tech workers. The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. "The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple's, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook , or IBM employees," Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. "They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn't require them to personally be innovative," Birwadker said. "They (Facebook) invented social networks, and there's always been this layer of innovation," Birwadker explained adding, "but with more pressure on revenue, and especially on mobile and advertisements, I think we are seeing a lot less risk taking and adventurousness by their employees." On the other hand, Microsoft is often perceived as less innovative, because the more established tech giant has lagged behind the growth of its competitors. Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organised way, the study said. "But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realised that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B," Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft's latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work "fun", the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren't necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. "You can't have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there," Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave. In the study, published by Good&Co, the team analysed the psychometric data gained from anonymous personality quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of what they believe are perceived as the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google , Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. In total, the two-year-long study also analysed 10 million responses from 2,50,000 users. Questions ranged from thoughts and feelings about networking to how they handle problems at work.

After two injuries in preseason debut, rookie WR says 'don't freak out' Big Black and Blue again? Giants rookie WR says 'don't freak out' Pat Leonard NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Saturday, August 13, 2016, 2:47 AM facebook Tweet email While Ben McAdoo sits Eli Manning and Odell Beckham in Week 1 of the preseason (Rich Schultz/Getty Images) Pat Leonard NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Saturday, August 13, 2016, 2:47 AM The Giants, plagued by injuries in recent seasons under Tom Coughlin, had to be thinking ‘here we go again’ when highly-touted rookies Eli Apple and Sterling Shepard went down with injuries in the first half of their first preseason game. Fans were freaking out. But Shepard said the fans shouldn’t worry. “I mean, I can see that happening, especially with Eli (Apple), us both (being evaluated),” Shepard said with a smile. “But it’s nothing too serious, so don’t freak out.” If training camp and Friday’s game have demonstrated anything about Apple and Shepard, it’s that first-year coach Ben Follow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. "Like" us here. McAdoo intends to feature both rookies. The Giants announced late in the first half of the preseason opening 27-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins at MetLife Stadium that their top two draft picks from April had sustained injuries. Shepard already had made a highlight-reel catch, and Apple had recovered a fumble on special teams and made two tackles, providing evidence of the types of exciting contributions the Giants can expect. The prospect of their absence, though, shows how valuable they could be. Shepard (sore groin) assured he was “just sore from practice” and his injury is “nothing serious at all.” Apple (strained lower left leg) said he had “tweaked” the outside of his left knee holding up a Dolphins blocker on a punt return, and while he thought at first the unfamiliar feeling might be serious, he is “not concerned.” “Initially it did (scare me) because I never got that feeling before; I never had knee problems,” Apple said. “But after a while of being with the trainers and getting a little treatment, getting X-rays, it was fine.” Highly-touted first round pick Eli Apple leaves Friday night's game with an injury. (Rich Schultz/Getty Images) Those words surely made Giants management exhale, especially after Shepard waited not even five minutes into his first NFL game of any kind to make a highlight-reel, 24-yard diving catch of a Ryan Nassib pass toward the right sideline on the game’s opening drive. “That’s what I’m supposed to do,” Shepard said. “That’s what I get paid to do. That’s what I expect of myself.” A few months ago, who would have predicted that a receiver not named Odell Beckham or Victor Cruz would have opened the Giants preseason with a Top-10-worthy reception? Here’s the thing, though: Eli Manning throws to Shepard often in practice. The second-round pick is not just a fallback in the slot for Cruz if the veteran can’t stay healthy. Shepard is a weapon McAdoo intends to unleash. “I know what I see out of (Shepard) in practice. That’s not a surprise,” said top running back Rashad Jennings, who finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run. “That’s a routine kind of catch for him. He’s a really good player. He wants to be good, and I find him trying to be the last guy out kind of guy, understand the playbook inside-out. Put him anywhere.” Neither rookie was perfect, but both players refreshingly were constructively critical of their own errors. Shepard admitted he could have prevented a Nassib interception slightly underthrown in his direction, that he could have “at least disrupt(ed) that ball.” Apple acknowledged he “played a little out of control sometimes” and lost contain on one outside Dolphins run. Giants rookies were making plenty of noticeable plays on Friday, though, including linebacker B.J. Goodson, a fourth-round pick who made six tackles before leaving the game late with minor cramps. Shepard’s big play was the flashiest, the most tempting of bigger things to come, and the best example of why the Giants would be losing so much if any of these players went down. “If you show you’re capable of making those types of plays, they’re not gonna hesitate to feed you the ball,” Shepard said. “It’s just preseason, so we’ve got a lot of work to do. I still have a lot of work to do. We’ll see what happens in the regular season.”  Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

While Apple is set to launch its new iPhone 7 devices early on, HTC is preparing to debut its new handsets in the later part of the month.  Earlier today, famous Twitter leakster Evan Blass revealed in a VentureBeat report that someone from HTC has come forward to reveal what the Taiwanese company is planning for its September event. According to the informant, HTC is expanding its HTC 10 line with two new Desire handsets, the Desire Pro Lifestyle and the Desire 10 Pro 10.  The informant revealed the specs and features of the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle, which based on its name will be targeting people with different lifestyles. The handset is revealed to come in different colors, but all variants will come with metallic gold trims on the edges and surrounding the camera lens, flash and antenna cutouts. Unlike the current Desire models, the Desire 10 Lifestyle will have matte, solid color finishes.  Related Stories Android 7.0 Nougat ‘Coming Soon’ To HTC Nexus 9 The HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle, which is a mid-range offering, is expected to sport a 5.5-inch display with 720p resolution. Underneath, the handset will rock a still unknown quad-core processor. There will be two versions based on memory, a 2GB RAM/16GB onboard storage variant and a 32GB RAM/32GB onboard storage variant, according to GSM Arena.  As for its camera system, the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle will feature a 13-megapixel back camera with single LED flash and a 5-megapixel front camera. Both have backside-illuminator sensors (BSI) and are capable of taking 1080p videos.  While the informant revealed most of the specs and features of the Android 6.0 Marshmallow-running Desire 10 Lifestyle, the person did not discuss what consumers can expect from the HTC Desire 10 Pro, which is going to be the higher-end offering.  The revelation about HTC’s plan to debut two new Desire 10 smartphones in September comes in the wake of T-Mobile’s decision to remove its flagship HTC 10 from the market. The HTC 10 was apparently removed from T-Mobile’s site back in July, and this is only reported now after a Reddit user took notice of the flagship’s disappearance from the list of smartphones the carrier is offering. This is in spite of the HTC 10 getting the title of “the best Android flagship of 2016” from Ars Technica. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Printing from an iPad can be somewhat confusing, as you'll have to use Apple's wireless AirPrint tech in order to cut out the faff of sending a file to your Mac just to get a hard copy. And unless you're familiar with AirPrint, you might struggle, at first, to figure out how to get the job done. What if your printer doesn't support AirPrint? Luckily we're here to help. Here's everything you need to know in order to print directly from your iPad. BUY NOW: Epson Expression Photo XP-860 with AirPrint from Amazon for £142.98 BUY NOW: Canon MAXIFY MB2050 Printer with AirPrint from Amazon for £79.99 How to print from an iPad – Using AirPrint Firstly, you can find out if your printer supports Apple's proprietary wireless printing tech by heading over to the official site, where a full list of compatible devices should tell you all you need to know. AirPrint is available for both iOS and OS X, or MacOS as it's soon to be known. Related: Best Printers If you've got a printer that plays nice with AirPrint, all you have to do is make sure it's connected to the same network as the iPad you want to print from. In iOS, you can simply hit the Print button, which appears in applications that support printing, usually above the Share button or within the Share menu. If you've set your printer up correctly, the iPad should find it automatically, and you can simply follow the on-screen instructions to print out your email, document, or whatever it is you need to transform into a physical version. Related: iPad Mini 4 review Here's the process in its simplest form, as explained on the Apple site: 1. Open the app you want to print from. Find the print option by tapping the app’s share icon or settings icon. If you can’t find the print option, check the app’s User Guide or Help section. Not all apps support AirPrint. 2. Tap the Print symbol or 'Print'. 3. Choose an AirPrint-enabled printer. 4. Choose the number of copies. 5. Tap Print. Anything you choose to print can be viewed by using the App Switcher, enabled by double-tapping the Home button and tapping on Print Centre. If you want to cancel a print job, tap Cancel Printing from within the Print Centre. How to print from an iPad – Using a printer without AirPrint support The above is all well and good, but what if your specific printer doesn't support Apple's wireless technology? All is not lost. An easy way to get around this is to simply use a third-party app to connect to wireless printers. Related: iOS 10 One option when it comes to printing apps is Print n Share, which will allow you to connect your iPad to any wireless printer directly. Plus, it gives you the option to print via your Mac to any wireless, USB-connected, or Bluetooth printer. You've also got the added ability to print via 3G – a nice touch. Another decent offering which comes with all the functionality of Print n Share is PrintCentral, which is slightly cheaper than the former and does all the same stuff. Other top printing apps include Printer Pro, Print Agent PRO for iPad , and, on the more affordable side, Print Utility. Some of these apps will require you to install software on your Mac or PC if you want to use your iPad to print via your computers. Related: Best tablet Of course, there is the option of using dedicated apps from Printer-makers, such as HP ePrint, Xerox Print Portal, and Epson iPrint. Using these manufacturer-specific apps should give you an experience which is closer to using AirPrint than it would be with any of the aforementioned apps. How to print from an iPad – Print servers Another approach, is to use Mac or PC software which functions as a print server – essentially making your Wi-Fi or USB-connected printer discoverable to your iPad. The difference between these programs and some of the apps mentioned in the previous section is that this software is installed directly on the Mac or PC only - allowing your computer to essentially turn a USB or Wi-Fi connected printer into an AirPrint-enabled device. Printopia is one such example of this type of software, and seems to be quite a polished offering, though we're yet to review it ourselves. So there you have it – all you need to know to start churning out hard copies from your iPad. These techniques should also work for iPhones (basically, anything that uses iOS). We'll add more to this piece as new methods for printing from an iPad become available. Watch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week Got any more tips or solutions?

Photo: Getty Images More On: new york giants The secret to Eli Manning's success revealed Giants expect best offensive lineman back — in nick of time Politician to Odell Beckham Jr.: The Bronx more than a strip club Giants' 'quiet assassin' is waking up and looks worth every penny First-round pick Eli Apple and second-round pick Sterling Shepard played in their first NFL preseason game Friday night, but neither was around at the finish, as both rookies were forced out in the first half of a 27-10 Giants loss to the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium with injuries that neither player believes is serious. Apple got hurt covering a punt and was diagnosed with a left lower leg strain and Shepard came out of the game with a sore groin. Shepard opened eyes with a diving catch for a 24-yard completion and Apple showed plenty of athleticism during his time on defense. “I kind of just tweaked it a little bit, got a little bit off balance and I was trying to hold up the guy I was blocking and kind of just tweaked it,” Apple said. “I’m feeling fine, just a lower leg strain. I’m not concerned.” Initially, though, Apple was concerned, and scared. “Initially it did because I never got that feeling before, I’ve never had like knee problems,” Apple said. “It was just throbbing kind of like outside of my knee. Have to put some ice on it and some good treatment on it.” Shepard said he came out of practice this week with sore groin muscles and it carried over into the game. “It’s just been sore, both of ’em been sore, it’s nothing serious at all,” Shepard said. For the first time in his career, Eli Manning did not play in the preseason opener, as new head coach Ben McAdoo broke with tradition and sat his starting quarterback, sending out backup Ryan Nassib. “I made the decision not to play Eli tonight,” McAdoo said. “We have a pretty good idea of what Eli can do.” This was the seventh preseason game (out of 50) Manning has missed in his career. He missed two games in 2005 with an elbow strain and a game in 2010 after getting 12 stitches in his forehead the previous week. The other three missed games were coaches’ decisions, but none were the first preseason game. Receiver Victor Cruz missed the game with tightness in his groin. McAdoo said “Hopefully Sunday” when asked about a possible return to practice for Cruz. … LB Keenan Robinson (groin) and DE Kerry Wynn (groin) did not play. McAdoo did not call the plays in his first game, as offensive coordinator Mike Sullivan held the large play chart and relayed the plays into Nassib and then Logan Thomas. Bobby Rainey, who arrived with a history of ball-security issues, fumbled a punt in the first quarter that Apple alertly recovered. Late in the second quarter, Rainey fumbled a kickoff return before recovering the ball himself. Putting on the ball on the ground is going to get Rainey cut. Late in the third quarter, Rainey overran the play in punt coverage, leading to a big Dolphins return. LB Ishaq Williams of Brooklyn helped himself with a good hustle play on special teams. … WR Geremy Davis was forced out with a hamstring injury. … Rookie RB Paul Perkins lost the handle on a handoff from Logan Thomas in the fourth quarter for a turnover. … FB/TE Will Johnson came out of the game with a burner. … Stansly Maponga had a sack.

As it stands, the Apple Watchs inventory is running low with little intention of restocking. 9to5Mac compiled a list of Apple Watch models that are currently either out of stock or backordered. Then again, there are so many individual configurations for the Apple Watch, its no wonder they arent keeping up with all of them. There are currently 6 Sport models (out of 22 total) out of stock, 6 stainless steel models (out of 16) either sold out or backordered, and only 2 of the Hermes models are available in a small size, the rest of them (8 total) are sold out. This suggests that the Apple Watch is due for an update quite soon which could be announced alongside the new iPhone to be released in September. So everyone is advised to wait for the next iteration of the Apple Watch before investing into Apples wearable. The latest rumors say that the Apple Watch 2 should feature a faster CPU, improved immersion protection, GPS, and cellular connectivity . Are there any Apple Watch owners out there? What do you want to see with the Apple Watch 2? Source | Via Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version
The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Microsoft most innovative place for tech workers: Study Microsoft most innovative place for tech workers: Study Microsoft's employees are more innovative than Apple's, and Facebook's staff are less creative than most tech workers By: IANS | San Francisco | Published:August 13, 2016 11:45 am Microsoft’s employees are more innovative than Apple’s, and Facebook’s staff are less creative than most tech workers Microsoft’s employees are more innovative than Apple’s, and Facebook’s staff are less creative than most tech workers, says a study led by Indian-origin entrepreneur. The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. “The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple’s, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook, or IBM employees,” Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. “They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn’t require them to personally be innovative,” Birwadker said.

Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organised way, the study said. Also Read: Sree Sreenivasan: I look at my job as chief listening officer of New York “But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realised that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B,” Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft’s latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work “fun”, the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren’t necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. “You can’t have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there,” Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave. In the study, published by Good&Co, the team analysed the psychometric data gained from anonymous personality quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of what they believe are perceived as the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. In total, the two-year-long study also analysed 10 million responses from 2,50,000 users. Questions ranged from thoughts and feelings about networking to how they handle problems at work.   Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPakistan says three of its soldiers killed in cross border firing; 'response to ceasefire violations,' says Army BusinessHuge surge in Jan Dhan account deposits, Rs 21,000 crore mobilised IndiaNavjot Kaur Sidhu, Pargat Singh will join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Singh IndiaDemonetisation logjam: Govt reaches out to Opposition, PM likely to attend RS tomorrow BusinessFormer Tata Steel honcho rebuts Cyrus Mistry charges on Corus buy EntertainmentAlia Bhatt is like Jennifer Lawrence: a star who’s also terrific actor EntertainmentBefikre's song Khulke-Dhulke: Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and a Bollywood Punjabi wedding, watch video EntertainmentBaahubali 2 leaked scene may have done more good than harm EntertainmentSalman Khan meets his onscreen son Ali Haji after nine years.

For many in this classroom, this is the first time they have touched an iPad. Sara Snyder, USA TODAY A student plays with an iPad donated by Apple during a summer class at the East Oakland Youth Development Center in Oakland, Calif. (Photo: Jessica Guynn, USA TODAY) OAKLAND — On a sunny morning, kids bounce in their chairs and rock their heads rhythmically to infectious beats their classmates are mixing on GarageBand software. "Give her a thumbs up for her beat," exhorts instructor Jeffrei Pettaway and an enthusiastic sea of hands juts into the air. For many in this classroom, this is the first time they have touched an iPad. This six-week, hands-on summer class exposes kids ages 7 to 12 to technology — and the 21st century skills that come with it. With a few swipes, the tablets on the tables in front of them — a gift from technology giant Apple — open up worlds miles away from this hardened stretch of East Oakland, Calif. The kids have ventured on virtual scavenger hunts in Africa and researched what life is like in India, each project making them more familiar and at ease with the software that is transporting them. "This is bringing a whole new world inside their backyard in a way that's safe for them to explore," Regina Jackson says as she watches the students absorb the morning lessons. Jackson is president of the East Oakland Youth Development Center. Equal parts sanctuary and springboard, it was founded nearly four decades ago by former Clorox CEO Robert Shetterly to lift the fortunes of a neighborhood overburdened by sky-high rates of poverty, crime and violence. Of the students in this class, about 90% qualify for free lunch and live within blocks of the center. They come here for rare access to opportunity in the form of free after-school tutoring, college preparation courses, music and arts lessons, health and wellness education programs and the hardwood that such NBA greats as Gary Payton and Jason Kidd once played on. The community center's goal: to give children the same shot at success they would have in wealthier parts of the city. Increasingly, that means the digital literacy they will need to successfully navigate the world.

USA TODAY Intel pilots $5 million 'scholars' program in Oakland, Calif. schools Jackson installed computer labs to connect more kids to technology and offer year-round computer classes. And, this summer, she teamed with Apple, which is reaching across the digital divide into Oakland, starting with this donation of 40 iPads to expose 180 kids to the technology that will shape their lives and careers. The East Oakland Youth Development Center eventually wants to teach coding classes to help youth develop the skills they would need to work at a company such as Apple. "We know how transformative technology can be in education and throughout communities," said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, who first visited the East Oakland Youth Development Center in June. "Every child deserves the right to a great education. These students are working on everything from learning to code to writing résumés, and we can’t wait to see what they will do in the world.” A student at the East Oakland Youth Development Center plays with software on the iPad.  (Photo: Jessica Guynn, USA TODAY) Silicon Valley, the high-tech corridor that stretches between San Francisco and San Jose, has come under broad criticism that its outreach efforts have overlooked Oakland, a diverse city across the Bay where African Americans and Latinos make up more than half of residents. No critic has been more vocal than Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader who has led the campaign for Silicon Valley to hire more African Americans and Latinos, two groups sharply underrepresented in Silicon Valley tech companies. His advocacy led to Intel forming a five-year partnership with the Oakland Unified School District designed to touch the lives of 2,300 students and graduate 600 students in computer science and engineering programs at two high schools. Apple CEO Tim Cook  (Photo: Gabrielle Lurie, AFP/Getty Images) Jackson says he proposed to CEO Tim Cook that Apple invest in Oakland after an Apple shareholder meeting. Apple's workforce is 9% African American and 12% Hispanic, a single-percentage point increase from last year. It's pushing to make progress. Out of a U.S. workforce of 80,000, 27% of new hires in the last year were underrepresented minorities, according to the company. Apple is far from alone. Tech companies in Silicon Valley have made pledges to do better, but their numbers have barely budged. Apple is more diverse than some tech companies because of lower-paid workers in its retail stores, though it did post a 1% increase in African Americans in technical jobs. Rev. Jesse Jackson  (Photo: Mark J. Terrill, Associated Press) " 'Tim, all these companies say they can't find talent,' " Rev. Jackson recalls telling Cook. " 'Oakland is the most multiracial, multiethnic, multicultural city on the West Coast. It's within shouting distance of most of these tech companies. They say 'we can't find them,' Well, they aren't looking in the right places. Come to Oakland. You'll find one of the most creative, innovative, spirited talent bases right in the backyard of Silicon Valley.' " USA TODAY Oakland tech hub fights for diversity This summer, Apple staffers came to the East Oakland Youth Development Center to set up the equipment and offer training on the iPads and use of Apple software such as Keynote and GarageBand. Already, the program is sparking imaginations and ambitions. Tyrese Jackson, 9, dreams of one day making gaming apps like the pair of seventh-grade girls on the Nickelodeon sit-com Game Shakers. Building games is on Raul Sanchez's bucket list, too. The 9-year-old wants to add a third Super Marios brother to the classic video game. "For most of these kids, this is the first time ever being around an iPad," says Pettaway, their 17-year-old college-bound instructor. "What I am trying to do is start their digital footprints early."

And the Giants' first round pick had no problem admitting it after the fact - he was scared when it happened.  Odell Beckham puts on pregame catch display "Initially, it did (scare me), because I've never gotten that feeling before. I've never had knee problems," Apple said after the Giants' preseason-opening loss to the Miami Dolphins on Friday night. The rookie cornerback was able to recount the immediate moments after he sprained his lower left leg because that's all it is - a sprain that head coach Ben McAdoo said "it doesn't look to be anything serious at this point." "After meeting with the trainers and getting a little treatment on it and getting X-rays, it was fine," Apple said.  "I just tweaked it a little bit on special teams, punt return. I got a little bit off balance, and was trying to hold up the guy I was blocking. I'm feeling fine. It's going to be fine." The Giants received injury scares with their top two draft picks in the 27-10 loss to the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium. Apple's sprained knee, and second-round pick Sterling Shepard's sore groin. But Shepard is fine - he told fans not to "freak out" after the game - and Apple is too. Apple is not sure if he'll practice Sunday after Saturday's off day. But he said all needs to do with the sprain is "put some ice on it and have some good maintenance on it." And that's welcomed news for the Giants. Takeaways from the game Before the injury, Apple was putting together a solid first NFL game. He played outside cornerback with the first-team nickel defense, and had a third down tackle to force a Miami punt. He also was working with the second-team defense, and playing special teams.  "You get into a groove a little bit, playing a lot of plays, playing on special teams and defense, and you want to stay out there a little bit," Apple said. "But I knew I wasn't 100 percent, and I didn't want to cost my team or anything. "I played OK. I played a little out of control sometimes, I can be a little better with my technique, and on special teams as well. Keeping my attention to detail on the little things." Apple finished the game with two tackles and a fumble recovery on special teams. He said he felt he lost leverage playing the run at times, and he may have made a few miscues on special teams.  Apple's first tackle was a big one, though. Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill hit wideout Kenny Stills in the flat on third-and-9, and Apple tackled him two yards short of the first down, forcing a punt.  "I had good initial coverage on him, he kind of pushed off a little bit at the top," Apple recalled. "I thought it was a first down, and I said, 'Oh man. I can't believe it.' But then I looked, and I saw the sticks, and he was about two yards short of it." Just another thing that felt bad at first, but ended up working out quite all right for Apple and the Giants.

Photo: AP More On: new york giants The secret to Eli Manning's success revealed Giants expect best offensive lineman back — in nick of time Politician to Odell Beckham Jr.: The Bronx more than a strip club Giants' 'quiet assassin' is waking up and looks worth every penny The Giants’ defense was so bad last season that any sign the 2016 version can be markedly better is welcomed like a cool breeze cutting through oppressive humidity. And so, when the starting defense took the field Friday night for two series and exited after six plays, 14 total yards and no first downs allowed, it was a most promising signal that all the time, effort and money spent will pay dividends. The strong cameo was the best takeaway for the Giants in their 27-10 preseason-opening loss to the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium. Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. sat this one out, and when the other starters were in the game, the Giants dominated on both sides of the ball and took a 10-0 lead. Once the backups began infiltrating the field, things deteriorated quickly in Ben McAdoo’s first game as head coach. The game was delayed 49 minutes at the start as a summer storm approached, with fans instructed to “leave the Seating Bowl area and take shelter inside MetLife Stadium because of severe weather in the area.’’ McAdoo already had made the decision to sit Manning, and after the delay, the coach opted to give Beckham the night off as well. “[Beckham] came out with the intentions of playing a handful of plays, then we got back in, we had the delay and I decided not to play him,’’ McAdoo said. Ryan Nassib, subbing for Manning, was solid early with the first-team offense, but struggled once he was surrounded by reserves. Nassib threw two first-half interceptions and did not exactly convince anyone he could take over, if needed, for Manning. Nassib played the first three quarters and finished up 7 of 15 for 75 yards, plus a fumble. To be fair, Nassib often was running for his life behind a shaky second-string offensive line. In all, the Giants fumbled six times, losing two of them. “I think overall as an offense, Ryan was right in line with everybody else. It was a sloppy performance, any time you have six balls on the ground and two INTs is not what we’re looking for,’’ McAdoo said. As far as health, the Giants watched their first- and second-round draft picks, cornerback Eli Apple and Sterling Shepard, forced out with injuries not considered to be serious. In a small sample, the Giants’ defense looked light-years better than the shabby 2015 unit. In fact, on the first series it seemed they applied more pressure on the quarterback than they did in a month last season. Free agent addition Olivier Vernon nearly sacked Ryan Tannehill and Owa Odighizuwa, a second-year defensive end coming off an injury-filled rookie year, hit the Dolphins quarterback on the next play. Vernon made his presence felt again on the next defensive series, hounding Tannehill in the end zone — and he might have had a sack if he was not bumped by Jason Pierre-Paul. Linebacker Jonathan Casillas nearly had an interception of Tannehill, but came down out of bounds. “It was very encouraging,’’ Casillas said, who had an interception off Matt Moore late in the first quarter. “I feel like it was a good showing for the first team guys, they didn’t really get anything on us.’’ Asked if he took any positives out of the defensive performance in the first game, Pierre-Paul said, “Somewhat.’’ Newcomer Damon “Snacks’’ Harrison was more effusive. “I saw the defensive ends flying around.,’’ Harrison said. “This one play, I look, [Olivier Vernon] shot out of the stands like lightning and JPP was on the other side, Hank [Johnathan Hankins] was in the backfield.’’ As for getting through his first game as head coach, McAdoo was not happy with the sloppy play, but his starters — minus Manning and Beckham — did not have any problems. “Yeah, I was excited,’’ McAdoo said. “I think everybody in the locker room was excited. It was the first time to get out and go against another team, it always provides some good energy.’’ Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under ben mcadoo ,  eli manning ,  new york giants ,  odell beckham jr. ,  ryan nassib Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Jets' Quincy Enunwa loves Dennis Rodman comparisons Read Next Jets' Quincy Enunwa loves Dennis Rodman comparisons Most Popular This Week 1 Donald Trump's media summit was a 'f−−−ing firing squad' 2 Melania and Barron Trump won’t be moving to the White House 3 College kids are proving Trump's point 4 Did this astronaut warn of aliens before attempting suicide? 5 Trump may not be able to work in the Oval Office for over a year 6 Bus driver asked kids if they were 'ready to die' before fatal crash: mom Share Selection Columnists Mike Vaccaro Ralph Branca gave Shot Heard ’Round the World its perfect dignity Mark Cannizzaro The secret to Eli Manning's success revealed SEE ALL COLUMNISTS The Post Line NBA NCAAB NHL NCAAF NFL Wednesday Favorite Line Underdog ORLANDO OFF (OFF) Phoenix CLEVELAND 11½ (218½) Portland INDIANA OFF (OFF) Atlanta San Antonio 3½ (199½) CHARLOTTE Memphis 4½ (196½) PHILADELPHIA DETROIT 4½ (190) Miami Boston 7 (214) BROOKLYN HOUSTON 3 (218) Toronto DALLAS OFF (OFF) LA Clippers UTAH OFF (OFF) Denver NEW ORLEANS 1 (210) Minnesota SACRAMENTO 2½ (208) Oklahoma City GOLDEN STATE OFF (OFF) LA Lakers Wednesday Favorite Line Underdog KENTUCKY 28½ Cleveland St Michigan 3½ SOUTH CAROLINA VILLANOVA 20 Coll.

Sell This Quarter? Here's what to expect this quarter from Apple's most-important segment. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Aug 12, 2016 at 9:06PM iPhone 6s. Image source: Apple. In Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) third fiscal quarter of 2016, iPhone units and revenue were down 15% and 23%, respectively. This was an extension of a similar quarter of declines for the segment in the prior quarter. Apple investors are still getting used to this new dilemma, as iPhones sales didn't start to decline until this year. Unfortunately, Q4 will likely deliver more of the same. Here's what to expect from Apple's iPhone segment this quarter. An iPhone sales forecast for Q4 Apple doesn't provide a forecast for quarterly iPhone sales, so the best way to get an idea of what management might expect from the segment is to look at management's guidance for total revenue. Because iPhone sales represent about 57% of revenue, the trajectory of iPhone sales during a quarter strongly drives the trajectory of Apple's total revenue -- so their trajectories should be similar. For Q4, Apple guided for revenue between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion, representing a 7.8% to 11.7% decline compared to Apple's revenue of $51.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. If iPhone revenue follows a similar trajectory, Q4 iPhone revenue will be somewhere around $29 billion -- down from $32.2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Where would this put iPhone unit sales? Taking into consideration the fact that iPhone revenue will likely decline at a slightly steeper rate than iPhone units because Apple's lower-cost iPhone SE, which was introduced in March, is driving average selling prices lower, the trajectory of Apple's guidance suggests that iPhone unit sales will likely be somewhere around a range of 43.5 million to 45 million units. This is down from 48 million units in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015. Notably, if Apple's guidance for total revenue does reflect the company's expected trajectory for iPhone revenue during the quarter, Q4 would mark a moderation to Apple's trend of declining iPhone revenue compared to the previous two quarters. Will the quarter get a boost from an early iPhone launch? However, even if Apple expects a smaller year-over-year decline in iPhone sales in Q4, this may not be indicative of improving comparisons for the iPhone 6s cycle. Another potential explanation for a smaller expected decline during the quarter could simply be an earlier launch for its flagship iPhone, which usually launches toward the end of the tech giant's fiscal fourth quarter. Image source: Apple. Industry blogger Evan Blass, which AppleInsider asserts has a solid track record speculating about upcoming smartphone releases, said on Twitter that iPhones will be available in stores, and ship to customers, on Friday, September 16, giving Apple's new flagship phone about one extra week in the quarter to sell. In 2015, for instance, it wasn't until September 25 that the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus began shipping to customers. An extra week for Apple's newest iPhone to ship to customers during the company's fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 could give iPhone sales during the quarter a significant boost. If Blass is right about Apple planning for an early iPhone launch, it's worth wondering just how steep the year-over-year decline in the company's guidance for Q3 would have been without the help of an extra week of sales of the upcoming flagship iPhone. Looking beyond fiscal 2016's fourth quarter, Apple's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 will likely be even more interesting, as it will help investors get an idea of whether the tech giant expects iPhone sales to continue to decline, even after it launches its newest smartphone.

EAST RUTHERFORD — The Giants' got an encouraging glimpse of their top two draft picks in Friday's preseason opener at MetLife Stadium. And then the other shoe dropped, although it appears the team only received a slight scare. Cornerback Eli Apple, a first-round pick, and wide receiver Sterling Shepard, a second-round pick, left Friday's exhibition game against the Miami Dolphins with injuries. The Giants announced late in the second quarter that Apple was having his left knee examined and Shepard had a sore groin. The Giants announced at the start of the fourth quarter that Apple has a strained lower left leg. Apple returned to the sideline during the third quarter. He was still in uniform and stood with the rest of the cornerbacks on the sideline.  A "sore groin" wouldn't seem to indicate a serious injury for Shepard. He was sitting on the sideline in the fourth quarter with the other wide receivers. Additionally, the Giants announced in the fourth quarter that starting wide receiver Geremy Davis was out with a hamstring injury. Davis was sitting on the bench in the fourth quarter with his left leg heavily wrapped. Shepard played with the first-team offense and immediately showed why he has generated so much buzz this offseason. On the Giants' opening drive, Shepard made an outstanding diving catch along the right sideline on a pass from quarterback Ryan Nassib. It was Shepard's only catch of the game. We get it, it's preseason, but come on. This catch by the rookie @sterl_shep3 is ridiculous. #MIAvsNYGhttps://t.co/DZgYObgpbe — NFL Network (@nflnetwork) August 13, 2016 Apple didn't start, but saw immediate action when the nickel defense took the field on the Dolphins' first drive. Apple was targeted on his first play, making the tackle on a 7-yard completion to Kenny Stills on third-and-9. Apple was the left cornerback with starter Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie moving inside to the slot in the nickel defense. Apple finished the half with two tackles. He also had an alert fumble recovery when Bobby Rained coughed up a punt return in the first quarter. Dan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @DDuggan21.

Apple was just awarded its very first vehicle-related patent from the U.S. patent office. The release of the patent is the first concrete evidence we have that Apple is in fact working on some sort of vehicle program. If this patent will actually be used on a future Apple car, it would go directly against recent claims that the tech-giant is favoring a more software focused approach. Clearly this evidence suggests Apple is set on producing a physical car. The patent filed jointly by Apple and BAE Systems is for a steering device for an articulated vehicle and also covers the invention of an articulated vehicle. An articulated vehicle, for those unfamiliar, is a vehicle that is designed to turn in a sharper radius thanks to a permanent or semi-permanent pivoting join at the center of its construction. The other name on the patent is BAE Systems, known for producing military vehicles such as infantry fighting and armored all-terrain vehicles. We highly doubt Apple is creating a military vehicle, however. It's more than likely simply partnering with BAE in order to use its articulated vehicle expertise. It would be an extremely risky proposition for Apple to release a tracked vehicle as its first foray into the car world, although everyone thought Tesla was crazy when it released its first electric vehicle. Apple has a track record of coming up with interesting designs so we can't wait to see what this patent will mean for the future of the Apple car.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Apple Plans New Heart-monitoring Wearable Device Posted: Aug 12 2016, 8:07pm CDT | by IANS, Updated: Aug 12 2016, 8:12pm CDT, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Tech giant Apple has filed a patent application for a wearable device that can measure electrocardiographic (ECG) signals to monitor the health of your heart, a media report said on Friday. Don't Miss: The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals The filing, published by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), shows commitment on Apple's part to enter the health care industry, qz.com reported. The device may look like a ring or a bracelet. Apple's design makes the traditional ECG machine redundant. To calibrate the device, users should undergo an “enrollment” process where readings are taken from different parts of the body before using the device. “It can use those measurements to correct abnormalities resulting from the device's location on a person's body,” the report added. Apple last year released ResearchKit, an open source software framework to help doctors gather data from participants using iPhone apps. In a recent interview with The Telegraph, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he didn't want to “put the [Apple] Watch through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process,” but he “wouldn't mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it.” You May Like The Author IANS The Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) was established in 1986, initially to serve as an information bridge between India and its thriving Diaspora in North America.

Since then, Apple has been releasing new bands instead of releasing a brand new Watch. However, this fall, we expect Apple to release a brand new Watch. With the new Watch coming so soon, the stock for bands and Apple Watch bundles are going out of stock. On Apple’s website a lot of bands and Watch bundles (Watch + band), are being listed as “Sold Out” though some of them are still available in a few retail locations, though, those are rare. With us being so close, we highly doubt Apple will bring any of these bands back in stock until the new Watch is released. We expect Apple to release the new model during its September iPhone event, so we wouldn’t recommend anyone to purchase the Watch at this point. Here’s the list: Sport: 42mm Silver Aluminum Case with Yellow Sport Band – Sold Out 38mm Silver Aluminum Case with Royal Blue Sport Band – Sold Out 42mm Silver Aluminum Case with Royal Blue Sport Band – Sold Out 38mm Rose Gold Aluminum Case with Royal Blue Woven Nylon – Sold Out 42mm Rose Gold Aluminum Case with Royal Blue Woven Nylon – Sold Out 38mm Gold Aluminum Case with Gold/Red Woven Nylon – Sold Out Stainless Steel: 42mm Marine Blue Classic Buckle – 4-6 weeks 42mm White Leather Loop – 4-6 weeks 42mm Milanese – Sold Out 42mm Link Bracelet – Sold Out 42mm Space Black Milanese Loop – Sold Out 42mm Space Black Link Bracelet – Sold Out Hermès: Double Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Large Fauve Barenia Leather Band- Sold Out Double Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Large Etain Leather Band – Sold Out Double Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Small/Medium Capucine Leather Band – Sold Out Double Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Large Capucine Leather Band – Sold Out Double Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Large Bleu Jean Leather Band – Sold Out Single Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Fauve Barenia Leather Band – Sold Out Single Tour, 42mm Stainless Steel Case with Fauve Barenia Leather Band – Sold Out Single Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Capucine Leather Band – Sold Out Cuff, 42mm Stainless Steel Case with Fauve Barenia Leather Band – Sold Out Individual bands: 38mm Stone Sport Band 38mm Apricot Sport Band 38mm Lilac Sport Band 38mm Royal Blue Sport Band 38mm Turquoise Sport Band 38mm Vintage Rose Sport Band 38mm Pink Sport Band 42mm Apricot Sport Band 42mm Lavender Sport Band 42mm Lilac Sport Band 42mm Royal Blue Sport Band 42mm Turquoise Sport Band 42mm Vintage Rose Sport Band 42mm Green Sport Band 42mm Gold/Royal Blue Woven Nylon 38mm White Classic Buckle 38mm Marigold Classic Buckle 38mm Blue Jay Classic Buckle 38mm Midnight Blue Classic Buckle 38mm Storm Gray Classic Buckle 38mm Marine Blue Classic Buckle 38mm Black Classic Buckle 38mm Red Classic Buckle 42mm White Classic Buckle 42mm Blue Jay Classic Buckle 42mm Midnight Blue Classic Buckle 42mm Storm Gray Classic Buckle 42mm Marine Blue Classic Buckle 42mm Black Classic Buckle 42mm Red Classic Buckle 42mm Storm Gray Leather Loop – Medium 42mm Storm Gray Leather Loop – Large 42mm Black Leather Loop – Medium 42mm Black Leather Loop – Large Band 38mm Marigold Modern Buckle – Small 38mm Blue Jay Modern Buckle – Small 38mm Blue Jay Modern Buckle – Medium 38mm Blue Jay Modern Buckle – Large 38mm Midnight Blue Modern Buckle – Medium 38mm Black Modern Buckle – Small 38mm Soft Pink Modern Buckle – Large 42mm Link Bracelet 42mm Space Black Link Bracelet Hermès – 38mm Feu Double Tour – Small/Medium Hermès – 38mm Blanc Double Tour – Small/Medium Hermès – 38mm Bleu Paon Double Tour – Small/Medium Hermès – 38mm Bleu Saphir Double Tour – Small/Medium Hermès – 38mm Fauve Barenia Double Tour – Large Hermès – 38mm Capucine Double Tour – Large Hermès – 38mm Etain Double Tour – Large Hermès – 38mm Bleu Jean Double Tour – Large Hermès – 38mm Fauve Barenia Single Tour Hermès – 38mm Feu Single Tour Hermès – 38mm Blanc Single Tour Hermès – 38mm Bleu Paon Single Tour Hermès – 38mm Bleu Saphir Single Tour Hermès – 38mm Noir Single Tour Hermès – 42mm Fauve Barenia Single Tour Hermès – 42mm Feu Single Tour Hermès – 42mm Bleu Saphir Single Tour Hermès – 42mm Noir Single Tour Hermès – 42mm Fauve Barenia Cuff Tags: Apple Watch, Apple Watch 2 About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Megha Kedia First Posted: Aug 14, 2016 08:06 AM EDT Microsoft Surface Phone unlikely to get a 2016 release date. (Photo : Sean Gallup / Getty Images) While Microsoft has never ever admitted working on an alleged Surface Phone 2016, rumors about the highly anticipated smartphone's release date, possible pecs, and price have flooded the internet. Advertisement New reports suggest Microsoft wants its upcoming Surface smartphone to stand out in comparison to its competitors Apple and Samsung. In fact, if reports are to be believed the upcoming Microsoft Surface Phone 2016 will give direct competition to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's highly successful Galaxy S range smartphones. According to MCrunch, one Weibo user Nokibar has claimed that the software giant has already begun working on the new handset. He also posted alleged leaked pictures of the upcoming Surface Phone on its Weibo account. It remains to be seen whether or not the pictures are valid. Previous reports suggested that the Redmond will roll out three high end Surface smartphones with superior hardware configurations and impressive features. Reports claim that the new Surface phones will primarily target the business sector. The entry level model is expected to pack a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and 3GB of RAM, the midrange model is rumored to get 6GB of RAM, and the high-end variant is expected to feature a massive 8GB of RAM and 512GB of built-in storage. It is also rumored that this time the Microsoft made handsets will run Android OS and not Windows, reported Ecumenical News. Among other specs, all the three Microsoft Surface Phone 2016 variants are expected to feature an aluminum and magnesium casing along with a 5.5-inch AMOLED display, a USB Type-C port and liquid cooling technology. The handsets are expected to get a 20-megapixel Carl Zeiss rear camera coupled with Surface Pen functionality. Fingerprint reader, accelerometer, gyro, compass, barometer and proximity sensors are also among rumored features. The Microsoft Surface Phone 2016 price range will hover around $700-$1100, depending on the model. We would advise our readers to take the information with a big grain of salt as nothing yet about Microsoft Surface Phone 2016 release date, specs and prices have been announced.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Drew Harwell August 14 Follow @drewharwell Australian chef Daniel Churchill films a series of cooking videos on the main stage at Tastemade on Aug. 12. (Emily Berl/For The Washington Post) SANTA MONICA, Calif. — With the solemnity of a priest, Tastemade programming chief Oren Katzeff paces near his TV-grade studio kitchen and assesses his media giant’s latest creation: apple-pie latkes, baked on camera for five seconds of Snapchat fame. In four years, his video network has transformed food porn designed for digital natives into a global juggernaut. But the competition is fierce — and the demands are endless — if he wants Tastemade to stay one of the most-watched media empires on the Web. “There is something about being maniacal, right?” Katzeff says outside the soundstage during one of the day’s half-dozen recipe shoots. “We are so laser-focused on all this stuff. We don’t sleep that much.” Short, viral videos have become more than digital-age curiosities. They are a central economy of the Web and a serious business on which future media fortunes will be gambled, won and lost. Autoplay recipe videos on Facebook are inescapable, and they all seem to follow the same basic steps. We break down how one gets made. (Jayne Orenstein,Randolph Smith,Kara Elder/The Washington Post) Many leading the charge aren’t traditional TV media giants. Instead, they’re start-ups such as Tastemade, which since launching as a tiny YouTube food network has exploded to become the fifth-most-watched video publisher on Facebook. In June, Tastemade racked up more than 700 million views — three times the online audience of its rival, the Food Network, according to data from video analytics firm Tubular. Pumped out cheaply and quickly, most Web and mobile videos make a fraction of the money of a Hollywood film. But they also carry a fraction of the risk: For their makers, a flop doesn’t break the bank — and a hit can mean everything. “In terms of eyeballs and time spent, there’s an increasing war for your time and attention,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst with investment firm BTIG. “Web video, mobile video, is still in its infancy, but I wouldn’t mistake being early for being wrong. In 1980, basic cable was really early, too.” ‘Slacker milkshakes’ Web video’s rise has sparked a growing tension for media’s most established players, who must retool and compete for a new generation of viewers on an increasingly insatiable Internet. In June, a Facebook vice president called video “the best way to tell stories in this world” and said that the world’s biggest social network, with 1.6 billion users, would be “probably all video” within five years. The players are fighting over billions of screens in people’s pockets, where advertisers are moving en masse. Spending on digital ads in the United States is expected to surpass TV ads this year for the first time, research firm eMarketer said. Web-video ad spending grew to $10 billion this year, having doubled since 2014. Two years ago, the “Ice Bucket Challenge,” which raised money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research, proved that simple social video could bloom into a cultural phenomenon. Producers, networks and news organizations have been racing to publish more videos, because advertisers will pay more to sponsor them than digital offerings such as banner ads. The companies on Web video’s front lines do not have the reliable channel placement, traditional audiences or big commercial payouts of TV’s goliaths. Many, including Tastemade, are not profitable or keep their revenue under wraps. Yet their growth has been enough to encourage alliances that a few years ago would have seemed far-fetched. In December, Tastemade secured $40 million in investments led by Goldman Sachs. Backers included the venture arm of Comcast, the world’s biggest cable company, as well as TV giant Scripps Networks, owner of the Food Network. Tastemade specializes in short, colorful cooking segments of quinoa burgers, Nutella cheesecakes and other millennial-bait cuisine. Unlike traditional food TV, many of its videos are delightfully un-gourmet: Tastemade’s most-watched recipe on YouTube involves blending seven ice cream sandwiches into a “slacker milkshake.” Many of the old hallmarks of television’s craft don’t apply. Celebrity cameos, high production values and long stories are out, while colorful sets, simple ideas and short, “snackable” moments are in. (Tastemade/YouTube) The videos are built to go viral, not to win awards, so volume is paramount, and long-accepted signatures of traditional video are ignored. Many videos are shot not wide-framed but vertically to fit how younger viewers see the world: through cellphone screens. The videos’ sound is deemed less important; many viewers watch them muted, anyway. On Facebook, Tastemade has become an unstoppable force, with more “likes” from loyal subscribers than the New York Times and Washington Post combined. Even so, Tastemade is a traffic underdog to Tasty, BuzzFeed’s competing food-video giant. In August, Tastemade was added to Snapchat’s top media-company lineup, Discover, putting it a swipe and a tap away from every user on one of the fastest-growing social apps on the planet. Coca-Cola was one of the firm’s first sponsors. 7 billion views and counting Founders Steven Kydd, Joe Perez and Larry Fitzgibbon launched the network in 2012 after meeting at Demand Media, a Web “content farm” whose business depends on getting clicks from Google searches. But within three years, Tastemade had become one of the rare additions to Snapchat’s heavy-hitters list that was not a household name. Its neighbors include CNN, ESPN and People magazine. The pressure was on: A month earlier, Tastemade’s more-established peers, including Warner Music Group and Yahoo, had been booted from Snapchat’s invite-only Discover rankings on the thought that they had not been pulling their viral weight. But the company has become a veritable video factory: 7.1 billion views of 3,739 videos and counting, with no signs of slowing down. In December, Tastemade pledged to publish three original videos a day, every day. This spring, the company aimed even higher, saying it would produce more than 100 cooking shows, recipe guides and travelogues every month exclusively for Facebook’s live-video streaming service. Key to Tastemade’s success are its “tastemakers,” the 1,000 or so global freelancers who contribute recorded shorts or recipes. None are traditional celebrities, although their followings can be robust, and Tastemade invests heavily in winning their allegiance. One of Tastemade’s three dozen online job openings seeks an “unflappable” Influencer Acquisition Representative — known internally as a “treasure hunter” — working to recruit from within YouTube’s amateur army of popular chefs and quasi-stars. Julie Nolke, a 25-year-old “tastemaker” in Toronto, started making movie-inspired food videos for YouTube while working a desk job at an investors’ association. With her short red hair, easy laugh and oddball acting, she became like a Lucille Ball of the food-video Web, and she signed on with a Tastemade “partner manager” to get help optimizing and sharing her videos while splitting ad revenue. (Julie Nolke/YouTube) A year ago, after Tastemade’s demands heated up, the firm signed her and other top tastemakers up directly. She and her boyfriend quit their jobs to make videos full time: They shoot and edit three videos a week, produce show ideas and work on “branded content,” including a series sponsored by Starbucks. Tastemade pays the couple $1,000 a video — good money, she says, considering that they earned far less relying solely on ad revenue. But “everything we were doing before has entirely revved up,” she said: Every short video — from grocery shopping to food prep to video editing — takes about 14 hours to make. The couple work from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., seven days a week. Fans ask Nolke for pictures on the street — an odd feeling for an acting-school graduate who struggled during auditions to land traditional roles. But now, she finds herself dealing with a new kind of stardom. “I literally make videos in my house. I don’t know if I talked to anyone else today but you,” Nolke said. “This is not what the celebrity life looks like. This is a whole other brand of thing. But it’s really, really cool.” Web video has not supplanted the titans of TV and film, but its early successes have shown what kinds of content best resonate on an always-on platform free from traditional length, style and cost constraints. “TV has all the money, and the TV ecosystem has an older consumer,” said Laura Martin, a senior analyst at Needham & Co. “But the data you can get online — on younger audiences, short-form programming — is really important, too. [They can show] how certain verticals are making it work.” To cash in, Web-video giants still rely on TV’s classic moneymakers, including riffs on product placement and regularly scheduled commercial breaks. Tastemade’s revenue has come from “brand integrations” with corporate sponsors, including Google, Grey Goose and REI, some of whose executives said they have paid “seven figures plus” to insert their products onscreen. Hyundai sponsored a pork-and-pigskin feature, “The Grill Iron,” that programming chief Katzeff defined as “auto meets college football meets tailgating, but not in a ‘bro’ sort of way.” The executives acknowledge the natural tension between a hip, Web-friendly food network seeking to expand into a corporate trough. But they say they offer advertisers an irresistible deal: Young viewers bored by or disinterested in the behemoth of prime-time TV. “The audience that’s not watching TV, the audience that’s not watching commercials,” Katzeff said, “is the audience that’s looking at Tastemade content every day.” The Internet is going crazy for super satisfying videos, or videos that feature objects being crushed, destroyed, put together or taken apart.

It isn’t just secretive, the way Apple is, but in a deeper sense, Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce and cloud-storage giant is opaque. Amazon rarely explains either its near-term tactical aims or its long-term strategic vision. It values surprise. To understand Amazon, then, is necessarily to engage in a kind of Kremlinology. That’s especially true of the story behind one of its most important business areas: the logistics by which it ships orders to its customers. Over the last few years, Amazon has left a trail of clues that suggests it is radically altering how it delivers goods. Among other moves, it has set up its own fleet of trucks; introduced an Uber-like crowdsourced delivery service; built many robot-powered warehouses; and continued to invest in a far-out plan to use drones for delivery. It made another splash last week, when it showed off an Amazon-branded Boeing 767 airplane, one of more than 40 in its planned fleet. These moves have fuelled speculation that Amazon is trying to replace the third-party shipping companies it now relies on — including UPS, FedEx and the US Postal Service — with its homegrown delivery service. Its logistics investments have also fed the general theory that Amazon has become essentially unbeatable in American e-commerce — no doubt one reason Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, felt the need this week to acquire an audacious Amazon rival, Jet.com, for $3.3 billion. So what’s Amazon’s ultimate aim in delivery? After talking to analysts, partners and competitors, and prying some very minimal input from Amazon itself, I suspect the company has a two-tiered vision for the future of shipping. First, it’s not trying to replace third-party shippers. Instead, over the next few years, Amazon wants to add as much capacity to its operations as possible, and rather than replace partners like UPS and FedEx, it is spending boatloads on planes, trucks, crowdsourcing and other novel delivery services to add to its overall capacity and efficiency. Amazon’s longer-term goal is more fantastical — and, if it succeeds, potentially transformative. It wants to escape the messy vicissitudes of roads and humans. It wants to go fully autonomous, up in the sky. The company’s drone program, which many in the tech press dismissed as a marketing gimmick when Bezos unveiled it on “60 Minutes” in 2013, is central to this future; drones could be combined with warehouses manned by robots and trucks that drive themselves to unlock a new autonomous future for Amazon. There are hurdles to realising this vision. Drone delivery in the United States faces an uncertain regulatory future, and there are myriad technical and social problems to iron out. Still, experts I consulted said that a future populated with autonomous drones is closer at hand than one populated with self-driving cars. “It’s a vastly easier problem — flying than driving,” said Keller Rinaudo, the co-founder of Zipline, a drone-delivery startup that will begin deploying a system to deliver medical goods in Rwanda this fall. “If we had regulatory permission, we’d be delivering to your house right now,” he added, referring to the San Francisco Bay Area. If Amazon’s drone program succeeds (and Amazon says it is well on track), it could fundamentally alter the company’s cost structure. A decade from now, drones would reduce the unit cost of each Amazon delivery by about half, analysts at Deutsche Bank projected in a recent research report. If that happens, the economic threat to competitors would be punishing — “retail stores would cease to exist,” Deutsche’s analysts suggested, and we would live in a world more like that of “The Jetsons” than our own. Shipping has always been at the core of Amazon’s strategic investments. In its earliest days, as part of an effort to avoid collecting sales tax from most customers, Amazon purposefully placed warehouses in low-tax, low-population states, and then shipped goods to populous areas within three to five days. The 2005 introduction of Amazon’s Prime subscription program, which gives customers two-day delivery on many goods for an annual price of $99 (Rs 6,610), changed Amazon’s shipping needs. Prime encouraged customers to buy a lot more stuff, and it also forced Amazon to deliver packages more quickly. That explains why Amazon abandoned its tax-avoidance strategy earlier this decade and began building dozens of warehouses in populous areas. It also ramped up a system called “postal injection,” in which it uses prediction algorithms and complicated network analysis to figure out how to deliver every package to the US postal facility nearest a customer’s house. According to Deutsche, postal injection has allowed Amazon to slash the cost of the most expensive leg of shipping an item, the “last mile” from a warehouse to customers’ homes. So despite shipping most goods faster, between 2010 and 2015 Amazon cut its shipping costs from $5.25 (Rs 351) per box to $4.26 (Rs 267), Deutsche estimates. But that’s still not low enough. Though Amazon has released a string of stellar earnings reports recently, its shipping costs are rising, and it faces capacity constraints. During the holidays two years ago, a surge of online orders overwhelmed UPS, leading to missed deliveries. A more severe problem looms in the long run: The transportation infrastructure in the United States is aging, and the Department of Transportation has warned that unless urgent and expensive fixes are made, roads, waterways, airports and other systems will become alarmingly clogged by the 2040s. For Amazon, that projected future is catastrophic: Pretty much all of Amazon’s current investments in shipping — in trucks, planes and crowdsourced delivery cars — depend on the traditional shipping infrastructure. All, that is, except for drones — which explains why they are integral to Amazon’s vision of the future of retail. I was first clued in to the importance of Amazon’s drone initiative, called Amazon Prime Air, when I met Gur Kimchi, the head of the program, at an industry conference a few months ago. Though our conversation was off the record, Kimchi’s detailed answers to my questions suggested I had been too quick to dismiss the initiative. When I began talking to others in the drone industry about Amazon’s interest in autonomous flight, they all pointed out that drones offer a way to leapfrog roads. Because they operate in a new, untrammeled layer of physical space — below 400 feet, an airspace that is currently unoccupied in most of the country — they open up a vast new shipping lane. Beyond posting several videos, Amazon has not revealed much publicly about its drone program, but it has been working with regulators worldwide to set up tests of the system. It envisions drones being able to deliver packages up to five pounds in weight, which account for 80 to 90 percent of its deliveries. Amazon also said it has built many different kinds of prototypes for different delivery circumstances. The first rollouts will likely be in low- and medium-density areas like suburbs, where a drone might land in a backyard to drop off shoes. But the company said it was also working on systems to deliver to cities — for instance, drones could deliver packages to smart lockers positioned on rooftops. As it happens, the shipping company DHL has tested just such a drone-to-locker delivery system in Germany; a representative told me that the test was a success and that it plans to expand the technology depending on regulatory approval. Amazon’s patent filings hint at even more fanciful possibilities — drones could ferry packages between tiny depots housed on light poles, for example. Others project even wilder ideas. Ryan Petersen, the founder of the logistics software company Flexport, pointed out that Amazon had filed patents that envision using trucks as mobile shipping warehouses. Such self-driving trucks, prestocked with items Amazon has determined a given neighborhood might need, could roam around towns. When an order comes in, a drone might fly from the truck to a customer’s house, delivering the item in minutes. Scenes like that are most likely in the far-off future. But according to Amazon, the earliest incarnation of drone deliveries will happen much sooner — we will see it within five years, somewhere in the world.

The News Recorder Headlines World US News Business Education Entertainment Tech Sports Technology Samsung Galaxy Note 7 And iPhone 7 Plus Compared, Can You Tell Us Which One Is Better? By Vaibhav Singh - August 14, 2016 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is set to be launched on all major carriers in the United States on Aug. 19. The upcoming flagship smartphone for the South Korean electronics conglomerate is surrounded by a lot of hype, pushed forward by its top-end features and specifications and an aggressive marketing campaign by Samsung. It should be remembered, however, that the Galaxy Note 7 is actually the successor to the Galaxy Note 5. Samsung decided to skip a number in the series to eliminate inconsistencies in its product line, as it released the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge earlier this year. However, the bigger reason is that Samsung thought naming the device as the Galaxy Note 6 will make customers think that it is inferior to Apple’s upcoming flagship smartphones, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are expected to be released by September or October, with the larger model expected to go head-to-head with the Galaxy Note 7 in the cutthroat smartphone market. For customers looking to purchase a high-end, large-display smartphone, should they grab the Galaxy Note 7 this month, or wait a month or two for the iPhone 7 Plus? A quick comparison of the specifications and features of the two smartphones should give customers a better idea on which device they should purchase. It should be noted, however, that with no official announcement yet for the iPhone 7, the details presented below are only rumored ones, though coming from reliable sources. In terms of display The Galaxy Note 7 packs a 5.7-inch dual-curved Super AMOLED display with high QHD resolution, a display that has been tagged as the best smartphone display ever. The 5.5-inch Retina display of the iPhone 7 Plus, meanwhile, is expected to largely be the same as the iPhone 6s Plus, though possibly with an upgraded sharpness to 1,080p. Powering the Galaxy Note 7 are the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 or Samsung Exynos 8890 processors that were used for the Galaxy S7 line, with the chipset used depending on the region of the smartphone. The Galaxy Note 7 also has the same 4 GB of RAM as the Galaxy S7 line. The iPhone 7 Plus is expected to come with 3 GB of RAM, compared with only 2 GB of RAM of the iPhone 7 and its predecessors iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The device will be powered by Apple’s A10 processor, which is the successor to the A9 chipset used for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. In terms of camera, The Galaxy Note 7 also features the same camera as the Galaxy S7 line, with a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera. The iPhone 7, meanwhile, is said to be featuring a dual-lens rear camera system, which is the reason for the RAM upgrade. In terms of storage, The internal storage of the Galaxy Note 7 starts at 64 GB, compared with the native storage of 32 GB for the Galaxy S7. The Samsung smartphone, however, also features expandable memory through a microSD card slot that will add up to 256 GB in storage. The iPhone 7, for the first time in the history of Apple’s smartphone line, will drop the 16 GB storage option, making the 32 GB option the lowest option in addition to 64 GB and 256 GB models. The iPhone 7, like all other iPhones, will not feature expandable memory. Some other changes in the smartphones this time around will include, Other important features for the Galaxy Note 7 include the trademark S Pen stylus, which has been upgraded to make it water-resistant and more accurate, a USB Type-C connector and an iris scanner for added security. The iPhone 7 Plus, on the other hand, is said to be coming with a redesigned Force Touch Home button, with the 3.5mm headphone jack replaced by a Lightning connector. The antenna lines of the smartphone are also said to have been redesigned to give the device a cleaner look. In terms of price, The Galaxy Note 7 will come with a price tag of $849 once it launches in the United States, while the 32 GB iPhone 7 Plus is rumored to be coming with a price tag of around $900. We leave it up-to you to decide which smartphone is better than the other. The good thing about the decision is that whichever smartphone you decide to purchase, you will surely end up with a high-quality premium smartphone with powerful specifications and the latest features. This is it for now, stay tuned for further updates and do tell us about which smartphone you think is better.

Petersen, age 92, died peacefully with family near on July 12, 2016, in the Collier Hospice Center in Wheat Ridge, CO. From her birth in Bellingham, WA, on June 22, 1924, to her death, she lived with courage, integrity, and faith. She was the nurturing hub of an extended family and the mother of six children; her first-born child died of crib death. She was born to Ora E. and Mary M. (Merchant) Overton and was the middle of three children raised in Chelan, WA. After graduating from Chelan High School in 1943, she attended nursing school in Spokane, WA. Her life’s passion, as a wife and mother, began when she married her husband of 45 years: F. Ross Petersen on Jan. 10, 1948, in Chelan, WA. During their life together, they made their home in Chelan, WA (Apple & Trucking), Savona, B.C.(X-J Guest Ranch), Wilder, ID (Apple & Dairy farm), and Caldwell, ID (town jobs and retirement). Since the 1970’s, Raina was an active member of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church in Caldwell, ID. Independent by nature, she resided, alone, for 23 years, as a widow. She sold her Caldwell home and moved to Colorado, arriving on March 24, 2016, to be with her son and daughter-in-law. Left to honor Raina and remember her love are Raina’s four living children: F. Steve (Bernice) Petersen of Wheat Ridge, CO, Les (Sherry) Petersen of Burlington, WA, Cynthia (Frank) Julian of Ravena, NY, and John (Evelyn) Petersen of Glendale, CA; seven grandchildren: Cassandra (Marshall) Rommel, Monte (Nicole) Petersen, Jamie Dunham, Julie (Mike) Dickinson, Corey Petersen, Miriam Petersen, Andrew Petersen; seven great-grandchildren: Porter, Betty, Kylie, Levi, David, Che, and Adrian; and many nieces, nephews, extended family members, and friends. Raina was preceded in death by her parents; brother, Waldene; sister, Beryl; husband, Ross; sons, Richard and Kenneth; grandson, Taylor; and cherished friend, Field Harris. Raina will be remembered for the unique light of her love and her life-long mothering. A Memorial Service will be held on Sunday, August 28, 2016, at 1:00 p.m. at the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, 2106 E. Linden St., Caldwell, ID, with Pastor Jim Berglund officiating. A meal and time to visit will follow in the SDA Community Center next door. The Petersen family would like to extend our gratitude to the staff at the Collier Hospice Center in Wheat Ridge, CO, for their attentiveness and loving care. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made in Raina’s name to the Church Community Services of the Caldwell SDA Church. Her children plan to inter her ashes in Chelan, WA. Questions about commenting?

"Our investment in Sharp has completed all necessary reviews by the relevant governments, and our company and Sharp will now move to complete the transaction in accordance with our agreement as soon as possible," Foxconn said. Like Us on Facebook Advertisement Sharp confirmed that it has received the cash infusion from Foxconn, or Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, in new syndicated loans from two Japanese banks. At the same time, the Taiwanese company assumed a 66 percent stake in the Osaka-based firm. With the deal completed, Sharp's CEO Kozo Takahashi, who apologized to shareholders in June for failing to live up to their expectations, resigned from his post and Tai Jeng-wu, the right hand of Foxconn founder Terry Gou, was appointed following a board meeting scheduled on Saturday. The Financial Times reported that under Foxconn, Sharp is bracing for radical changes with Guo signaling the need to cut down the Japanese company's workforce. This contrasts his statement before the deal about the need to keep employees. Sharp, which is famous for its consumer-electronic products, incurred massive losses for the second-straight year in the year which ended in March. It faced hurdles as its consumer-electronics business encountered fierce competition from other Asian brands and it also became too dependent on the volatile display panel business for growth, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Hongkiat.com Main Menu Design / Dev Technology Inspiration Social Commerce All Deals Search Hongkiat for: Reveal Search Form Reveal Off-canvas Navigation Mobile App Design/Dev: Beginner’s Guide to jQuery Mobile Published by Jake Rocheleau,in Coding Over the past 2-3 years we’ve seen a tremendous growth in browser and OS support for mobile websites. Most notably Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android platforms come to mind. But others such as PalmOS and Blackberry are still in the mix. Up until recently it was very difficult to match a single mobile theme into all of these platforms. Pin it JavaScript was a start, but there hasn’t been any truly unified library until now. jQuery Mobile takes all the best features of jQuery and ports them over to a mobile-based web source. The library is more like a framework which includes animations, transition effects, and automatic CSS styles for basic HTML elements. In this guide I hope to introduce the platform in a way that you can feel comfortable designing your own jQuery mobile apps. Recommended Reading: Mobile App: Custom Themes with jQuery Mobile Features & OS Support The reason I suggest learning jQuery Mobile over any other frameworks is simplicity. The code was built on the jQuery core and has an active team of developers writing scripts and editing bugs. Of the many features include HTML5 support, Ajax-powered navigation links, and touch/swipe event handlers. Support is varying between phones and is broken into a chart of 3 categories from A-C. A is the top tier which boasts full support of jQuery Mobile, B has everything except Ajax while C is basic HTML with little-to-no JavaScript. Luckily most of the popular operating systems are fully supported – I added a list below of just a few examples. Apple iOS 3-5 Android 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 Windows Phone 7 Blackberry 6.0, Blackberry 7 Palm WebOS 1.4-2.0, 3.0 If you want to learn more try reading up on their official docs page. It’s not written in gibberish and actually feels very easy to follow along. Now let’s focus on the basics of writing a jQuery mobile page and how we can build a small application! The Standard HTML Template To get your first mobile app working there is a set template you should start with. This includes the jQuery base code along with the mobile JS and CSS, all external hosted from the jQuery CDN. Check out my example code below. <!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
	<head> 
	<title>Basic mobile app</title> 
	<meta charset="utf-8">  
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> 
	<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">  

	<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0rc2/jquery.mobile-1.0rc2.min.css">
	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0rc2/jquery.mobile-1.0rc2.min.js"></script>
</head> 
<body> 

</body>
</html>
 The only foreign elements here should be the two meta tags. The top viewport tag updates mobile browsers to use a full zoom effect. Setting the value width=device-width will set the page width at exactly the width of the phone screen. And best of all it doesn’t disable the zoom features since jQuery Mobile can adapt to shifting layouts. The next meta tag X-UA-Compatible just forces Internet Explorer to render the HTML in it’s most recent iteration. Older browsers and especially mobile will try to get around unfamiliar rendering bugs. Constructing the Body Content Now this is where jQuery mobile can get tricky. Each HTML page isn’t necessarily 1 page on the mobile site. The framework makes use of HTML5’s data attributes, which you can create at a whim by appending data- beforehand. In a similar fashion data-role="page" can be set to multiple divs in a single HTML file, giving you more than one page. You would then move between these pages with anchor links and a unique ID. This setup is a good idea for basic, simple apps. If you only need 3-5 pages then why not store it all in a single file? Unless you have a lot of written content, in which case try using PHP includes to save time. Check the code example below if you’re lost. <body>
<div data-role="page" id="index">
	<header data-role="header">
		<h1>Top title bar</h1>
	</header>
	
	<div data-role="content">
		<h3>Show another page??</h3>
		<p>hint: click the button below!</p>
		<p><a href="#about" data-role="button" data-theme="c">About us</a></p>
	</div>
	
	<footer data-role="footer">
		<h2>&copy; footer here.</h2>
	</footer>
</div>

<div data-role="page" id="about">
	<header data-role="header">
		<h1>Page 2 Here</h1>
	</header>
	
	<div data-role="content">
		<p>just some extra content as well.</p>
		<p>I mean, you can <a data-rel="back" href="#index">go back</a> at any time.</p>
	</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
 Take a look at the anchor link from the index page for a moment. Notice I added the attribute data-role="button" to setup the link as a button. But instead of using the default styles we include data-theme="c". This switches between 1 of 5(themes a-e) templates which come packaged by default as CSS styles within jQ Mobile. Pin it My button also spans the entire page width. To remove the behavior we need to set the element from block to inline display. The attribute for doing this is data-inline="true" which you could append onto any anchor button. Header and Footer Bars Along the very top and bottom of your applications you should append header and footer content. This design style is often attributed with iOS apps which first became popular using Apple’s mobile App Store. jQ Mobile uses attributes of data-role to define the header, footer, and page content. Let’s take a brief look at these areas. Top Bar Buttons By default the top bar supports a set of two(2) links in a similar fashion to other mobile apps. iOS defaults to using a “back” button to the left and often an “options” or “config” on the right. <div data-role="page" id="about" data-add-back-btn="true">
	<header data-role="header">
		<a href="index.html" data-icon="gear" data-theme="b" class="ui-btn-right">Settings</a>
		<h1>Page 2 Here</h1>
	</header>
 The code above is just focusing on the div container for our About page along with header content. The additional HTML attribute data-add-back-btn="true" will only work when added onto a page data role. The purpose is to automatically include a back button which works similar to your browser’s back button. Pin it We could have added a back button manually with similar code as we used in the content area. But I feel this takes a lot longer to setup especially on multiple pages. All anchor links within the header section will default into left/right button positions. By using class="ui-btn-right" this re-positioned my Settings button so there is free space for the back button. Also I’m using the secondary theme styles to give it some extra spunk! Footer Navigation The footer area many not feel very useful at first. It’s a place where you can store copyright stuff and more important links, but this could just as easily be added at the bottom of your content area. So what good is using the footer? Well the best example I’ve seen utilizes footer space as a navigation system where tab links appear to control the page navigation. There are plenty of options where you can select fullscreen effects, add icons, adjust placement, and a few other attributes as well. But let’s just build a simple footer nav with 3 buttons to get an idea of how this works. Preview Live Demo <footer data-role="footer" class="ui-body-b">
	<div data-role="navbar">
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#index" data-direction="reverse">App Homescreen!</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.google.com/" data-rel="external">Google Me</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/" data-rel="external">Hongkiat Blog</a></li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</footer>
 So here is some footer code for the about page section. data-role="navbar" should be added onto the container element housing an unordered list and NOT the UL element itself. Each link within the list is treated as a tab bar, which then gets equally divided based on the total number of links. The additional class of ui-body-b just adds aesthetic effects as we switch between the few available styles. Pin it If you notice on the first button I have the attribute data-direction="reverse". Even though I could use the back button setup as before to return onto the home page, I’ve instead used the page ID of #index. By default the app window will transition to the right which looks pretty tacky since you expect the animation to move backwards. You can play around with even more of these animated effects if you have time. Check out the transitions info page in the jQuery documentation. Ajax & Dynamic Pages The first segment has really opened up the key points to building a mobile app with jQuery. But I want to start a new app which loads data from an external page. I’ll be using a very simple PHP script to attain the $_REQUEST[] variable and display a small Dribbble shot accordingly. The screenshow below should give you an idea what we are going to build. Pin it First I’ll make an index.html page set on the default template. For this home screen I’m using a list view setup to display each link in order. This is done in the content area with a data-role="listview" attribute on the list container. Cutting out the same header stuff as before, I added all my code from this new index page below. <body> 
<div data-role="page" id="img-listing">
	<header data-role="header">

 Each of the anchor links in my list view point to the same file – index.php. But we’re passing in the parameter imgid as a request variable. On the image.php file we take the ID and test it against 4 preset values. If any match up we use the matching image URL and title, otherwise we just display a default Dribbble shot. Image Loader Script The image.php script still has the default jQuery mobile template added into the code. It actually shares a very similar header and footer, except for the addition of our back link attribute data-add-back-btn="true". Notice this button will only show up if we come from index.html first! Try directly loading image.php and nothing will appear since there’s no “back” to move to. I think we can make a bit more sense of the code by examining my PHP logic first. We use a switch / case method to check against the 4 different IDs and provide a header title, image URL, and original artist source link. <?php
$theid = $_REQUEST['imgid'];

switch($theid) {
	case 1:
		$heading = "Wunderkit";
		$origin  = "http://dribbble.com/shots/297593-Wunderkit-tasks";
		$source  = "wunderkit.png";
		break;
	case 2:
		$heading = "College";
		$origin  = "http://dribbble.com/shots/298643-Colleeeeeeeeeeeeege";
		$source  = "college.jpg";
		break;
	case 3:
		$heading = "Forum app";
		$origin  = "http://dribbble.com/shots/298649-Forum-app-for-Facebook";
		$source  = "forum-app.jpg";
		break;
	case 4:
		$heading = "Twitter";
		$origin  = "http://dribbble.com/shots/298069-Twitter";
		$source  = "twitter.png";
		break;
	default:
		$heading = "Abandoned lighthouse";
		$origin  = "http://dribbble.com/shots/298615-Abandoned-lighthouse";
		$source  = "lighthouse.jpg";
}
?>
 All seems fairly straightforward – even a novice PHP dev should be able to follow along! And if you don’t understand it’s not important to the jQuery code anyway, so don’t worry. We should switch now and take a look at the template I’ve built within this new page. All the HTML code is added after that whole PHP block above. I used the ID of “images” for the container and even setup the header to change with each new photo. <div data-role="page" id="images" data-add-back-btn="true">
	<header data-role="header">
		<h1><?php echo $heading; ?></h1>
	</header>
	
	<div data-role="content">
		<p><strong><a href="<?php echo $origin; ?>" data-rel="external">View the Original</a></strong></p>
		<p><a href="<?php echo $origin; ?>" data-rel="external"><img src="img/<?php echo $source; ?>" /></a></p>
	</div>
	
	<footer data-role="footer"><h3>www.dribbble.com</h3></footer>
</div>
 You can probably see how simplistic this demo is. But the whole purpose is to demonstrate the scalability of jQuery mobile. PHP can easily be added into the mix and you can churn out some really neat apps with just a few hours of development. Fancy Design with List Thumbnails One last added effect we can implement is the use of thumbnails to liven up listing page. I’m also going to split text into a heading and description box to display both the artwork title and artist’s name. Pin it To begin open up Photoshop and create an 80×80 px document. I’m going to quickly re-size each image and save thumbnails to match each one. Then updating the list view items we should include a few more elements. Check out the code below and my demo example to see what I mean. [Preview Live Demo] <div data-role="content">
	<ul data-role="listview" data-theme="c">
		<li><a href="image.php?imgid=1">
		<img src="img/wunderkit-t.png" class="ui-li-thumb" />
		<h3 class="ui-li-heading">Wunderkit tasks</h3>
		<p class="ui-li-desc">by Sebastian Scheerer</p></a></li>
		
		<li><a href="image.php?imgid=2">
		<img src="img/college-t.jpg" class="ui-li-thumb" />
		<h3 class="ui-li-heading">Colleeeeeeeeeeeeege</h3>
		<p class="ui-li-desc">by Scott Hill</p></a></li>
		
		<li><a href="image.php?imgid=3">
		<img src="img/forum-app-t.jpg" class="ui-li-thumb" />
		<h3 class="ui-li-heading">Forum app for Facebook</h3>
		<p class="ui-li-desc">by Ionut Zamfir</p></a></li>
		
		<li><a href="image.php?imgid=4">
		<img src="img/twitter-t.png" class="ui-li-thumb" />
		<h3 class="ui-li-heading">Twitter</h3>
		<p class="ui-li-desc">by Sam Jones</p></a></li>
	</ul>
</div>
 The classes for ui-li-heading and ui-li-desc are added by default into the jQuery Mobile stylesheet. This is similar to the image class ui-li-thumb which automatically re-sizes each list view bar according to the image height. Now from here you could build more on the frontend with animations, page effects, stylesheets, etc. Or alternatively you could begin constructing a backend system to upload new images and automatically trim thumbnails to include in the list. There is so much flexibility with jQuery Mobile you almost can’t label it solely as a JavaScript library. It’s more of an entire HTML5/CSS/jQuery framework for building quick and scalable mobile apps. Conclusion As of writing this article the jQuery Mobile team has officially put out RC1.0 of the code library. This means most if not all of the major bug fixes have been squashed and now testers are gearing up for a full release. Because of this you won’t find a whole lot of information on the web. But as the months advance web developers are sure to pick up on the trend. Mobile applications and even mobile web layouts are growing in popularity with the huge increase in smartphones. Web developers don’t have the time to learn a full programming language for building Android/iOS apps. Thus jQuery Mobile is a slim alternative which includes support for a majority of the mobile industry software, and continues growing each day with an active developer community.

VESPA CITY GUIDES The Vespa Guide To The Top 5 Gay-Frisky Spots In New York Posted on August 13, 2016 Charles Wang Vespa Travel Expert @ Unicorn Booty No Comments Even before New York legalized statewide same-sex marriage in 2011, gay men in the Big Apple already enjoyed its thriving gay scene.

I just updated Windows 10 and now my computer keeps crashing after I start it. What's wrong? A: You're not alone. Hundreds of people have reported this issue after downloading the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. Microsoft's team believes third-party software is interfering with the startup process. To fix this, run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter, which automatically corrects minor bugs and notifies you of larger issues.

I've heard you talk about AC routers before, but what makes them different? A: AC routers are a step up from the older B, G and N models. They're the way to go if you want better performance for your home network. These advanced routers have a maximum spectral bandwidth of around 8 x 160MHz, compared to the 4 x 40MHz standard of N routers. In other words, the increased bandwidth allows more data to be transmitted without slowing things down.

Don't buy a new iPad this weekend Q: I heard you say on your national radio show that it's a horrible time to buy an iPad. Why is that? A: Unless you've found an amazing closeout deal, August is a horrible time to buy a new iPad — or any Apple product, for that matter. Apple's new lineup of products is expected to roll out in September. If you must buy a new tablet this weekend, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is a good option. It’s a scaled-down version of last year's 12.9-inch model, but it packs a powerful punch with Touch ID, four-speaker audio and a FaceTime HD and iSight camera. It’s available with 32, 128 or 256 GB and starts at around $600. When you buy your new iPad, you'll need to tweak a few settings to get up and running. Here are three handy iPad tricks you need to know. Protecting your gadgets from water damage Q: My son loves surfing but he keeps ruining his phone while trying to take videos for social media.

It also has a neck strap, so it won't get lost. The Kroma Cell Phone Dry Bag costs around $18 and can be purchased on Amazon. For more fun on the water, click here to see some waterproof earphones and other waterproof gadgets. Bonus: Sync the speakers on multiple devices Q: My wife and I are tired of hauling our Bluetooth speaker around when we travel. Is there an easier way to play music? A. Try an app called AmpMe. It's a free download for both Apple and Android that syncs the speakers on more than one device. To make it work, download the app onto both of your phones. Then one of you needs to tap "Start a new party." Once a party has been set up, you can join in from other devices. The music will play from each gadget's speakers and the sound gets louder as more people join. AmpMe currently plays music from YouTube, SoundCloud or from your own music library.

The photos show the handset in its rumored new Space Black color option, in addition to a Smart Connector port and no 3.5mm headphone port.  ( MyDrivers ) Advertisement Details surrounding Apple's next-generation iPhones continue to leak online. Images of what is reportedly the Space Black iPhone 7 Plus show the new color, Smart Connector port and absence of a 3.5mm headphone port. Apple recently announced that it has officially sold more than 1 billion iPhones since the original model was released in 2007. While the news was positive, the announcement comes at a time when many analysts continue to predict declining iPhone sales, which not only affects Apple but is also having a major impact on its suppliers and third-party companies. The company is counting on its upcoming iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, in addition to strong sales of the iPhone SE, to help turn things around. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are expected to launch and be released in September, alongside iOS 10. The smartphones have been making headlines for months in the form of rumored features and leaked images. Most recently, images of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus leaked and provided us with a look at the handsets in various color options, including the new Space Black variant that is widely rumored to replace Space Gray in Apple's iPhone color palette. New images of what is reportedly the Space Black iPhone 7 Plus have been published online and the photos provide a close-up look at the smartphone's redesigned case that is virtually identical to that of its predecessor, the iPhone 6s Plus. As you can see in the image above, the Space Black iPhone 7 Plus features a black bezel around its display and a reported 3D Touch black Home button. It is also darker than the Space Gray color Apple currently uses on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series. While a previous report claimed Apple has abandoned using its iPad Pro's Smart Connector on the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus, the port does appear on these latest images. Apple has shipped the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus with more advanced rear cameras than its smaller 4.7-inch counterparts and these images once again show the company will use a more feature-rich shooter on the larger smartphone and in the case of the iPhone 7 Plus, that will consist of a dual-lens rear camera. In May, we reported that Apple was reportedly going to ship the iPhone 7 Plus with 3 GB of RAM as opposed to the 2 GB of RAM on the iPhone 7 and the reason was attributed to image processing required by the advanced dual-lens camera. A smartphone believed to be the iPhone 7 Plus made a recent appearance on Geekbench and backed up the claims of a larger amount of RAM. The newly leaked Space Black iPhone 7 Plus images also back up previous claims that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus would ship without a 3.5mm headphone port and instead include Lightning EarPods in the box of the devices, which were recently shown off on video. As usual, take these images with a huge grain of salt for now, as there have been so many conflicting reports on Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. We'll update you on any new information as it becomes available. TAG Apple, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 7 © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Here's the Answer Ever Wondered What Are those White Lines on Your Smartphone? Here's the Answer By: Chakri Kudikala Updated: Wednesday, August 17, 2016, 10:48 [IST] Smartphones design has evolved a lot in recent times with several manufacturers such as Apple, Motorola, Google, HTC, Sony taking the initiatives in manufacturing a good looking smartphone. Also Read:This is what the dot on your Samsung earpiece indicates! The trend these days have been the unibody metal design which is becoming the next plastic thing for the smartphones. There are a lot of smartphones ranging from flagship to entry-level segment to come with the metal body. We are speaking about only the metal bodied smartphones. But why? Because the metal body smartphones usually have stripes on their back. We don't say all of them have the stripes over the back, but most of the smartphones have that and the other metal body smartphone have this stripes along their sides. Also Read: How to Wisely Make a Choice While Buying In-Ear Earphones You might be wondering on what does these stripes indicate, right? Well, look after the sliders below to know more the white lines. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! What Actually Are Those White Lines? The answer to this question is a simple one. The White Lines on all metal bodied smartphones are 'Antenna Bands'. Antenna Bands are the things usually the antenna in radios or other electronic devices which convert the electric power signals to radio signals and vice versa. This is bit technical. In simple words, the antenna bands are used to receive and transmit signals. Who Started This? Previously, there used to some other design policy where the antenna bands are not visible, however, it is worth noticing that the old age smartphones didn't use metal to build on. Instead, there are iPhones with glass on front and back. Now, this White lines trend was started by Apple with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Soon, it was followed by other manufacturers. It is worth noticing that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were heavily criticised for their design language.   Are they harmful? Absolutely, No. They are just antenna bands to send and receive signals. According to us, manufacturers designed in that manner to make the smartphone look better. Followed by? Apple always leads from the front in innovating and they are the same with this. Following the footprints of Apple, there are many manufacturers such as OnePlus, HTC, Meizu, etc who added the same design language to their smartphones. However, some of them look really good such as the OnePlus 3, Meizu MX6. Asus Manufactured the Invisible Band Smartphone Asus is the first manufacturer who launched a metal smartphone with invisible bands. The ZenFone 3 Series are the first smartphones in the world to launch with invisible bands even with the metal body. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

Photo: J.C. Rice Relief from the heat and humidity scorching the Big Apple is on the hazy horizon — but New Yorkers will have to shvitz through Sunday first. The city’s temperature climbed to 96 degrees on Saturday — with a blistering “real feel” of 118 degrees. An excessive-heat warning expires at 10 p.m. Sunday. Saturday marked the 13th day of temps in the 90s this summer in the city, according to AccuWeather. In the same span last year, the mercury reached 90 just seven times. Sunnier dispositions should kick in as the work week returns. AccuWeather meteorologist Ed Valle said that Monday — though still in the mid-90s — will be less humid and more comfortable. New Yorkers looking for a reprieve may want to hail a taxi. Cabdriver “MacGyver” Al-Mamun is helping New Yorkers beat the heat by rigging his front-seat air conditioner with duct tubing to funnel air to passengers in the back.

While he enjoyed every minute of it, it required frequent traveling making it impossible to look after his indoor garden. After several failures with auto-watering solutions available on the market, he decided to solve this problem on his own. This led to him joining forces with Silicon Valley engineer, Alex Yevdakov, and together they formed 7sensors Inc The two went to work and quickly realized, not only can watering be automated, the entire growing process can be dramatically improved. Today, 7sensors Grow Box is a fully automated environment that not only waters your plant; it provides lighting that has the proper intensity and spectrum, as well as controls temperature, humidity and airflow. Best of all, Grow Box does it all seamlessly with the energy consumption of a single light bulb. Once you receive the Grow Box, simply plant a seed or a plant clone into the soil and add water to the tank. Pick a plant type on your smartphone and the setup is complete. Your next required interaction with the product is to refill a large water tank, which is about once a month depending on the plant stage. Now you can truly grow the plants you want, without any gardening experience. Grow Box has a transparent design so everyone can enjoy a fresh plant year-round. Since the environment is enclosed and the air entering and exiting the box is filtered, there is no need for pesticides or genetically modified, disease resistant plants; this means you will get the tastiest, healthiest and organic produce possible. The conditions inside the box are precisely controlled, the plant of your choice is kept at its optimal growing conditions ensuring best possible development and avoiding unpredictable environmental factors. One of the 7sensors experimental grows yielded more than 30 bell peppers from a single plant. The proprietary LED array has an adjustable spectrum and intensity controlled in real-time with Grow Box’s logic. In addition, the light is designed with optimal reflectors tailored specifically to box’s growing area volume minimizing light and, as a result, energy losses. If your plants are in a sorry shape or you forgot what nature looks like, you can now bring it home with 7sensors. After years in development, the grow box is now fine-tuned and ready for production.

By Krixia Zhienelle Subingsubing Aug 13, 2016 | 1:51 AM With Samsung set to launch the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 as its latest flagship phone this August, and its tech rival Apple to release the iPhones 7 and 7 Plus the following month, the market for the ideal mobile phone continues to blow wide open. But before that, two of the best smartphones of this year - the Galaxy S7 Edge and the LG G5, both flagships of their respective brands - continue to slug it out to be the "best smartphone" in the market. So, if you're still wondering about which phone is the better buy, we've done a pretty comprehensive comparison between the two phones. Camera: LG G5 Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit As far as flagship phones go, they're supposed to carry the best camera the brand has to offer. Users are particularly picky about cameras that shoot well in low-light conditions, of course, as the true test of the camera's true capabilities. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has a bit of advantage with its HDR capabilities. It's able to adjust the images where shadows and highlights are too dark. It reflects color more accurately than most as well, and has shutter speed control for motion images. LG G5, on the other hand, suffers slightly from overexposing in bright light conditions. It also interprets color quite inconsistently. It does have a wider aperture than the S7 Edge with f/1.8. However, its biggest advantage over the Galaxy S7 Edge is its dual-camera set-up, with its secondary camera at a wide-angle lens which allows it to take amazing photos. Battery life: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Both phones use Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor to support Quick Charge, but the LG G5 is the one with the removable battery - allowing for more longevity should its original one run out. It also runs on 2800 mAh, while Galaxy S7 Edge runs on 3600 mAh which allows it to run higher screen-on times (7-10 hours) as opposed to the G5's 3-4 hours. The Samsung device also allows wireless charging. How cool is that? Hardware: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Both smartphones use fingerprint scanners. The LG G5 boasts of its new modularity, having completely diverged in terms of design from its predecessors, while the Galaxy S7 Edge polished its S6 to a finish. However, the Samsung titan has more tricks up its sleeve: an AMOLED screen with perfect color contrast, a 5'5" screen over the G5's 5'3", and a water-resistant body graded IP68. Software: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Both smartphones run on Android Marshmallow and there's basically not much difference, but this one has to go to Samsung, which stripped it down to a much more fluid Android experience. Overall: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Overall, the Galaxy S7 Edge provides a more holistic experience. However, it does not mean that the LG G5 is not worth a shot, especially with that A+ camera.

Siri Gives Funny Responses To Pokemon Go Questions Matthew Mueller - 08/13/2016 3 comments share Newsletter Share on Facebook Tweet This Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Pin to Pinterest Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of You knew it was only a matter of time before Apple's Siri weighed in on the phenomenon that is Pokemon GO, and it turns out she has a lot to say about the subject. Even Siri needed time to put her thoughts together, though, so initially if you asked her about the game she wouldn't know what to say. Now if you ask about Pokemon GO you'll get a range of responses (via Mac Rumors). For example, if you ask "Do you like Pokemon GO", Siri might reply "Look, there's Jigglypuff behind you! Oh wait, it's Wigglytuff. I always get those two mixed up." You also might get "Snorlax. Zzzz. Sorry, what was the question?" or "I know it's my destiny." If you ask "What's your favorite Pokemon?" instead, you could get one of several answers. Those include "Higgledy Piggledy", Geodude, dude", or "That yellow species with an electrostatic tail of variable angles is rather cute." Siri seems to really like Pikachu, but then again who doesn't? Cheeky responses aren't the only things Siri can help you with in regards to Pokemon GO. Thanks to sources like Wolfram Alpha, Siri can also answer your Pokemon specific questions. For example, if you ask "What kind of Pokemon is Pikachu?", she'll answer "Pikachu is an electric Pokemon", or if you inquire about Snorlax's abilities, she'll say "it looks like the answer is Gluttony." Well played Siri, well played. As time goes on, expect more and more responses from Siri to show up online, but in the meantime, go ahead and give it a try.

Photo: Getty Images More On: new york giants The secret to Eli Manning's success revealed Giants expect best offensive lineman back — in nick of time Politician to Odell Beckham Jr.: The Bronx more than a strip club Giants' 'quiet assassin' is waking up and looks worth every penny After Ben McAdoo’s first preseason game as a head coach, he sounded just like so many men who came before him when analyzing what went wrong in a 27-10 loss to the Dolphins, even though the Giants starters left the field with a 10-0 lead. Head coaches despise turnovers, and McAdoo’s club committed six of them. “As much time and energy as we spend on the football and taking care of the Duke in practice, for us to be that careless with the ball is very disappointing,’’ McAdoo said Saturday. “It will be fixed and it will be addressed.’’ McAdoo then pulled a Tom Coughlin — he used some analytical data to further his point: The Giants were minus-three in turnover ratio, and last season, NFL teams were 2-46 when committing three more turnovers than the opponent. “Tough to win football games that way,’’ McAdoo said. Of course, the guys turning the ball over the most — quarterback Ryan Nassib and running back Bobby Rainey — will not be on the field (Nassib) and most likely will not be on the roster (Rainey). Injury updates: Rookie CB Eli Apple was sent to get a scan of his left knee. After the game Apple did not consider the issue to be serious. Rookie WR Sterling Shepard (groin) will go through individual drills on Sunday, and then it will be determined if he can go through team drills. “We don’t think it’s serious,’’ McAdoo said of Shepard. WR Geremy Davis (hamstring) suffered a slight strain and will not work on Sunday. FB/TE Will Johnson came out with a neck burner, and “it looks like he’ll be out at this point,’’ according to McAdoo. WR Victor Cruz was shelved last week with a strained groin. “We’re gonna throw Victor out and do individual with him [Sunday] and see how he gets through individual and then we’ll take it from there,’’ McAdoo said. Apple was on the field for 19 plays on defense. As for the other draft picks, Shepard was in for 31 plays, S Darian Thompson (28), LB B.J. Goodson (30), RB Paul Perkins (13) and TE Jerell Adams (12). Goodson had seven tackles, including two for loss, but had some trouble with cramping. “B.J. was flying around,’’ McAdoo said, “making plays and looking like he was having fun.’’ McAdoo said Thompson, the third-round pick from Boise State currently starting at free safety, was impressive in his debut. “He was 100 percent in his assignments, or close to it,’’ McAdoo said. “He communicated well. Special teams, he has some improvement to do there.’’ After reviewing the tape, McAdoo was critical of how Nassib performed in the rare start subbing for Eli Manning. “He didn’t always have clean protection but Ryan still had the opportunity to make some plays,’’ McAdoo said. “Ryan has got to move on, learn from this experience and he’s got to bounce back.’’ The second-unit offensive line of Byron Stingily, Ryan Seymour, Brett Jones, Adam Gettis and Bobby Hart struggled in pass protection but was better in the running game. “We need to develop those guys,’’ McAdoo said. “They certainly have it in them, but we didn’t play that way last night in the passing game.’’ Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under b.j. goodson ,  ben mcadoo ,  darian thompson ,  new york giants ,  ryan nassib Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next How did Jets fare in preseason Week 1?

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple’s secretive car project is still years away from a public unveiling, but the company’s first vehicle-related patent has officially hit the scene. Unfortunately, it doesn’t reveal much about the rumored car, though it does include some interesting information. The patent, which was filed a little over a year ago by BAE Systems and assigned to Apple, focuses on the steering device for an articulated vehicle. That could a multi-chamber bus or train, but based on one image in the patent it might also be a military tank. The drawing shows the outline of a tank-shaped vehicle with tread tires, though the rest of the patent is focused on the details of that steering system. BAE System builds a variety of military vehicles for land, air and sea, so a tank fits right in. Patently Apple was also able to dig up an image of an articulated bus on the company’s website, which might explain this particular patent. Unfortunately, that still doesn’t explain why Apple is involved. It’s pretty clear the company is investing in automotive technology, and you can expect to see plenty of vehicular patents in the coming years. But Cupertino’s automotive plans are still a mystery for now.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     New MacBook Pro With Touch ID Sensor Expected To Release Soon Posted: Aug 13 2016, 1:04pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Aug 13 2016, 1:07pm CDT, in Rumors | Apple   Macbook Concept By Martin Haek   We will be seeing a revamped MacBook Pro any time now if we are to believe the word of Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The new 13 inch and 15 inch retina display laptops by Apple will have a bunch of new features which include a Touch ID sensor and an OLED mini screen above the keyboard. Don't Miss: The Black Friday Deals to Buy now on Amazon It seems like Gurman’s report is pretty much in line with all other reports we have received about the new MacBook Pro. He seems to agree with both Ming Chi Kuo from KGI securities and 9to5mac that the reveal of the new laptop is going to be a pretty big event. The new laptops are going to weigh less and are thinner in design than other MacBook’s released by Apples. The new MacBook Pro will not resemble the MacBook Air which is good news for all those MacBook users who want more than one port on their laptop. Users should expect better performance and improved battery consumption due to the Intel Skylake processors which will power the new MacBook Pros. The stand out feature about this new MacBook however remains the OLED mini screen that is expected to be situated above the keyboard keys. It will most likely serve as a replacement of the physical function keys. We still aren’t quite sure how Apple plans on using this screen. It could use it to control basic functions such as volume or media buttons, or it could take a step further and display shortcuts as well as information about the app that might be in use on the laptop. These new MacBook’s are going to more secure than any other Macs available for two reasons. Firstly the Touch ID sensor that has been incorporated into these new machines and secondly the secure enclave that these laptops will ship with. The updated features should settle the complaints made by MacBook pro users that the laptops are quite outdates and have received no upgrades since June 2012. But Apple has not made a habit of upgrading its laptops too often if you follow the trend set by the company. According to Gurman the new MacBook Pros will be released sometime in October and will not be part of the iPhone 7 launch in September.

Podcast: The central role of C by Dave Winer Friday, August 12, 2016 Here's a 25-minute podcast about my experiences learning to program and the central role that C played in the journey. This podcast was spawned from the hashtag #firstsevenlangs, which for me were: Fortran Basic Simula PDP-11 ASM C UCSD Pascal 6502 ASM One interesting question raised in this podcast -- the Apple II clearly isn't a Unix clone, but the Mac borrowed lots of ideas from Unix. Did Woz play with Unix before designing the Apple II? Hope to do a bunch more of these. I want to start talking more about the internals of software. As I explain in the podcast, I've been focused on "poets" for my career, but underneath it all there are a few new software ideas that haven't been well-enough discussed, and the things we learned are not reflected in other people's software. It's now time in my career to think about passing off, so I want to be sure to cover the important stuff. But first we have to talk about the foundation, and for me that was C and Unix and how they were one and the same, how a language could be the core of an OS and how an OS could be the core of a language. And how C was both a machine language and a high-level language (something I did not go into great detail in, in the podcast). C and Unix integrated two big concepts in two dimensions. Once I saw it could be done, I wanted to do it for storage and editing too. And that's what Frontier is/was.

It seems like the closer we get to September and the alleged September 7 release date, the further we end up digging ourselves in an overwhelming mess of rumors. Alleged iPhone 7 Plus Today brings yet another confusing piece of the puzzle - a few shots of what appears to be a 5.5-inch iPhone 7 with a dual-camera setup, POGO pins on the back and to add a finishing touch to the mix - colored in black. Naturally, this leaves us a little perplexed. If we stick to the original theory of three iPhone 7 models - the alleged "Plus" and "Pro" being of the 5.5-inch variety, then this would definitely be the highest tier device in the mix. So far so good, right? However, last we heard and saw yesterday, there appeared to be only two versions of the handset, the bigger one equipped with the dual-camera, but not the POGO pins. And if quantity is anything to go by, the day before that we got pretty much the same information form yet another source. Alleged iPhone 7 Plus In light of this, we thought it better to concentrate on the photos themselves and what they do appear to showcase with confidence, whether legitimate or not. This is not the first time we are hearing about the possibility of a black color option, as well as other new finishes, like Deep Blue for that matter. So the sight of a dark iPhone isn't exactly shocking. However, we must say it looks incredibly stylish, complete with little details like the shade of the antenna bands and we really hope this rumor turns out to be true. Another thing we can clearly see is the absence of a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the unit and a total of two grills. Given the current situation and influx of leaks, we are far from the idea that this could definitively settle the arguments over the audio jack or the stereo speakers, but it is yet another small grain of proof for one of the scenarios, if anyone is still keeping track.

McIntyre August 13, 2016 9:25 am EST Print Email Tweet Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares handily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past month. They have risen almost 12% to $108 as the index is up barely 1%. The stock also has outperformed tech giants Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Just a few weeks earlier, Apple was in the dumps. What a difference a short period makes. Apple’s earnings were considered lackluster. Sales of its flagship iPhone family were weak. Its sales in Greater China, the area where Apple management says they have to win, fell sharply. On July 26: Apple financial results for its fiscal 2016 third quarter ended June 25, 2016. The Company posted quarterly revenue of $42.4 billion and quarterly net income of $7.8 billion, or $1.42 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $49.6 billion and net income of $10.7 billion, or $1.85 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 38 percent compared to 39.7 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 63 percent of the quarter’s revenue. The guidance: Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2016 fourth quarter: revenue between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38 percent operating expenses between $6.05 billion and $6.15 billion other income/(expense) of $350 million tax rate of 25.5 percent And Greater China sales dropped 33%, compared to the same quarter a year ago, to reach $8.8 billion. A great deal of research shows Apple is losing market share there. The run up in the share price likely owes itself to one factor. The iPhone 7, which launches in September, is considered an “all or nothing” gamble by the world’s most valuable company. There already have been a number of leaks about the size, weight and features of the smartphone. Bulls believe the iPhone 7 will be a huge leap ahead of competition, as the earliest iPhones were. Bears claim the phone will not have any features not part of Samsung’s (Apple’s greatest rival) current smartphones, or ones it will release in its next generation. The month has brought a wave of optimism to Apple’s shares, which may last until the next set of earnings and the iPhone 7 release.

Their new England sports Saturday being heard by calling 417371287. Sports Radio One 03 point seven WEEI. I. I don't know if you don't compete out there tonight all right. We talked about things he did you win no turnovers offensively that's. That's a winning formula right there real defense in the court. Now I thought well both points right there. A lot of things work on but still a lot of good things out there Roth a good start RD we don't look this week between the mayor I don't know that's a good job tonight. Southern new England sports Saturday. Think it's from down only show he's ten player Dennis thank Allah and talking about a lot of Red Sox and patriots day but we're gonna go straight to the calls. And mild for. Stephen Boller ever stayed. In the morning good morning it's Steve. All not much out I know you wanna ask me about what I bottom of the game I would guess yeah. Skew anything that's Orleans caught Osce called our numbers. Let me puke thank you look two quick start and I'll say them as fast as that you know when pop humanly possible. A lot of the guys they get beat up beat up on on the B you know my level went there up Archie years ago. And have been known for that the travel agent should always Jewell we know web ring Bellwether of what that might link by the well. He'd order Jolie as about it stole credit and walked out of that he'd go up spit. These guys that hit a group a group young guy who's a stand that went to Poehler are pushing and go directly on the mall happens all the fine. Two years later. The real business men's association was pain. Paramilitary to chill it. Sure and killing Machida but we will but I rat. These it that would hang around in the district could create trouble goes every well Mon. Only you brought up what. Yeah exactly that won't help that. You're gonna see clutching of the page is watching it a one game vs not watching the reds. Won the picture. When the patriots were the hottest. I would say we're the 2003. Out of all back to back championships. And amazingly that coincided with the Red Sox. And I called the yield about a proxies and when they lost in game seven and on the 2003. ALC yesterday when app A-Rod. The patriot. It was surprising in all all or call what second shall Opel and agents are in the World Series. And even in that a suitable we don't know all won we won them all that it was just a one week quit even on talk radio talk about the patriot. It was 82 year deal at the U gotta admit that I I. Well we have well let's see what we have this again what he wouldn't think it would ever happen again you are correct it was a different eye and that was. Whatever up. But that's the last time that that that hot hot I've seen one up against each other and there was it would mean one week of a it was like OK they have the balls and yet you talk about well I mean it was easier nine W recruitment they run. Is there are things Steve that would dissuade pats fans based on I don't know it to hatred against Alan Brady self it mean that may drive some patriots fans back over the Red Sox for the first month that are you know just ticked off the lake. I have one guy was talking about why tournament a lot of political brain become it reminds me. And it reminds me of when Bledsoe could hurt I didn't go to the next game I was off yak copy and should which work. A Indianapolis. COLT game that that they actually one or orbit. They're being. And I would I just thought we're going back to. It'll be bad old days and we were well quarterback what really cracks me up all the game which I did not seek an addition networking and back yet. Apple or here or I am. Is that your take it according to South Korean society the future will be sent me. The car we could say OK the that's the future they all of a sudden now Jimmy G the guy everybody indictment he got to get creative perspective outbreak. If you don't all just scary. That's all muscles not overreact to attend only take from from Friday more let's not even react. Two to tango although I didn't find reacted like road kill you NASA. No criticized ST is earlier point about you know when the Red Sox were bigger than the patriots had it was a time when we still haven't seen. It World Series victory right. And word desperate for that we've already gotten our. Initial patriots win and then maybe the second one. But that was different time. Yet and this is the end of streets have it at the Red Sox he sees him alienate a lot of fans is much less fight Alia that would have but. As much as I try to drum up and argued that I think the end of the Brady error even if it's 23 years away. Will keep patriots on the front burner for at least the next three seasons no matter what the Red Sox to even if they're in first place right now if there were surging up. Of people we're just gonna care more about Brady getting in another championship or two before he had some up by a patriots still rule us. This market but it is weird like Steve said displays like a watch the first four weeks. There is a little bit of a Malays right now when you say yeah I mean training it's always training camp soft there wasn't anything electric. Purse say from Thursday's gain that was a big soccer Celtic draw apple wasn't so bad at work so good that you don't you really. When McCain mat rat athenaeum percent. Well looked pretty and your first look at them but lines and against other teams scrubs. You don't take too much into the end of pre season game like will you remember anything at all from that game in two weeks. It. All right. There you were saying to me those repayment. Defense. The defense impress you write about outward about that you felt like the defense. Was the story. And the defense carried it seems that a source for weeks of the season. And I don't know. Com. What's your problem what defense right now because the way I looked at it with the exception Justin Coleman. Really good that first unit when they were on the field they weren't of course as you say are backups of sergeant evaluating seriously but troop recently one's yours so. You take that but. Okay I'm just looking back the last year they they lost to the eventual world champs. They gave up twenty points in that game idiocy championship game so it's not a bad performance. So that was a good defense last year great defense is good defense but they lost Sheila Jones. People maybe want to diminish that but the guy it's blown sex it was part of their forty ninths act totally it's huge. Day just found out naked which is out for months I think that's being a big deal. Haven't we thought he might be up for the year while like I agree it could have been horror or at least three with just look at the first four games now you do not of Rob Ninkovich tortilla which owns. Jerod Mayo hung up. Dominique Easley got released maybe you know it would expect news for him anyway but that's a first round pick to a couple years ago you were opened to be Celtics so you got four missing pieces at least three. From a defense that was tenth in the league last year. I have a hard time looking at that in the first four games and seeing the defense is going to be good enough to dominate and carry them. Specially got to Arizona office that's pretty arguing that we won. So you go on the road to play okay Carson Palmer has had some. Bad games he's also that's great games. I mean the that the Larry FitzGerald game when he beat the Packers in the playoffs last year if you can remember back to how good they looked in that game. Before it looked terrible the next week. That could easily be the Arizona offense. In game one of the season to argue expecting. The Patriots defense the hold that offense that when he points analysts. I mean I'm. I think there's those that put thirty on the board easily I don't think that put thirty Ortiz all I really don't think that it I think there's wings game I think it's three and one. During Jimmy geez four weeks are really do I think it was for him when he I hear people saying this all over the place three and want foreign that's foolish. I think if I think there are 22 is reasonable. For a no. It's crazy. It's it is reasonable I was three and one that. 31 as possible scale I think we want the loss now it's just a case and you can back with three straight games and you're expecting on the table I know the brought home. Great teams but not bad teams no shrinking Cooley here typically all over the place. Miami's got a code but I don't know. Miami was so it lasted six intent but not great and the new coach and case. They're that this Bryant and I think they'll beat might bomb yeah yeah that's good but that's going to be a dink and dunk fest. That will that'll be one of those like. When he for 23 games comes down the final minute you know my my Italian it looked this up the previous the NC shows in Miami's ever beaten new England's. At Foxboro the Brady era except for one game in week seventeen when terrorists debris. So OK I give you Miami's. But to expect to sweep Houston in buffalo that the. Houston's terror except that they're not now they're fabric and the playoffs last year. In the appeal Bryant and the Disco prop Oslo I don't think he's in second brought costs com on. All the weapons he had last she's played against doing the glory is to get it and he had Denver's weapons to throat okay and they got bailed out at the other nailed a couple of times yes he does it did under doesn't have to rely and JJ watt. And in I'm not taking shots at their defense I think the defense X a pretty good. A committed dissing your point do you think the Los Weiler in the Texans in week theory yes maybe you're right I think O'Brien knows this patriots team while them that's going to be at least a tricky game. I don't know what to make the bills next do you think the Patriots defense is a problem within ninety million dollar man Tyrod Taylor. I would say their their shake in the booths of that but they do have some good weapons anyone considered young receiver LeSean McCoy Rex Ryan is still obsessed with beating this team he is gonna. That's I think. Thereto or 22 if they go to do you should be happy. Want I I know some people think to a two you'd think that. As many people think they're going for now I don't see him go or no I don't see him being Arizona Arizona is really good team. And Arizona as a team that can make the super bull run this year. The Who and the Patriots defense do you think will be dominant in the first four games tank Jones. There's no the question Collins is the guy you know lots of things can turn a lot of heads with the absence of Ninkovich has long. Chris and GAAP. Relax in the other as some may get some good Sutter moves get the defense gets his hands up there right away. Chris Long looks like he's rajoub and he was released by the rams for a reason I feel like money can't overreact. Partially money. It's a big part of it so what Tim what do you need to see over the next a what do you pass rush from Trey flowers you know from your guy Chris Long I think that's important. And they got to get healthy and make sure that on their quarters Logan. Ryan's gonna get back in and that's gonna be big. Yeah I think their defense was steadily last year they lost some parts. The opium bald average Dominick though for you to see the can be dominant tabled I think that's a stretch talked market tenants and fox Yemen my friend. We both never done this before at least for the each other ever that was an obvious from. Listen I think it's pretty obvious since the but I just want to make that crystal clear to the people that just tuned in because they're desperately waiting to get some mustard and Johnson. And kick us off here quick shuttle to Jerry talent Gainey Providence to be I polish your because as a I don't. You just out and watch it either and that's absolutely disgusted as I wish you didn't share that was good I wish I was sitting in the same room and right now. But it's been a lot of fun it's a lot of pay.

Chris Stewart/Dayton Daily News/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Analysts may be feeling bearish  about Apple's lack of innovation on the iPhone front, but smartphones aren't going anywhere anytime soon--and neither are apps.  On the one hand, that's a good thing, because many of us depend on those apps for navigation, communication, entertainment, and occasionally, work.  On the other hand, some people like to use apps behind the wheel, which is a very dangerous thing. As a new study from Liberty Mutual Insurance and SADD (Students Against Destructive Decisions) points out, apps are especially dangerous in the hands of teen drivers, 68 percent of whom use apps behind the wheel. Recommended: Do you belong on the road? Take our driver's test. The study polled 5,150 teenagers at high schools across the U.S., and not surprisingly, it revealed that what teens say and what teens do can be two very different things. (Parents, don't gloat: we know all about you .) Here are a few of the key findings: Test your knowledge Do you belong on the road? Take our driver's test. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 95 percent of teens said that using an app while driving is dangerous, but 68 percent admitted that they used apps behind the wheel. 64 percent of teens said that using music apps is dangerous when driving, but 46 percent admitted to using them. 41 percent of teens said that using navigation apps is dangerous when driving, but 58 percent admitted to using them.   27 percent of teens say that they text while driving. That's roughly on par with stats from four years ago . Perhaps most alarmingly, when asked to rank driving behaviors according to how distracting they were, roughly 80 percent of teen drivers viewed apps as "not distracting". If you're a parent of a teen driver, researchers say that there are a couple of things you can do to keep your kid safe on the road. For example, 42 percent of teens surveyed said that they've texted while driving to get directions. If your kid is traveling somewhere new, ensure that he or she gets directions in advance.  Also, 73 percent of teens surveyed said that they keep their phones handy when they're driving by themselves. Tell your teen to put the phone away and silence notifications to reduce the temptation to check texts and updates. SADD offers other handy tips for drivers of all ages  to address the problem of distracted driving. The Christian Science Monitor has assembled a diverse group of the best auto bloggers out there.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     IPhone 7 Plus Leaks In Pure Black With Smart Connector And Dual Camera Posted: Aug 13 2016, 8:05am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Aug 13 2016, 8:51am CDT, in News | Apple   Credit: 移动叔叔 Gallery 4 images   New hands-on photos of an iPhone 7 Plus or possibly iPhone 7 Pro leaks. The iPhone 7 has leaked in full in countless photos of components and even working iPhone 7 devices. The only big secret for Apple to reveal on September 7 at the iPhone 7 event is if there are two or three iPhone 7 models. Don't Miss: The Amazon Black Friday 2016 Ad A leaker on Weibo shows off what he calls an iPhone 7 Plus in a series of photos. The device features a dual camera and the smart connector known from the iPad Pro. There have been reports that the iPhone 7 Plus will only differ from the iPhone 7 in screen size. A third model, iPhone 7 Pro, would feature a dual camera and the smart connector. The hands-on leaked photos show a very polished iPhone that looks like fresh out of the factory. The leaker says this is the pure black version The metal body definitely looks darker than my space grey iPhone 6S. The dark metal looks great on these photos. Apple is expected to present the iPhone 7 on September 7. Pre-order begins on September 9 and the new iPhone will go on sale on September 16. There is still a chance that it will not be called iPhone 7, but iPhone 6SE as the new Apple phone sticks to the design language of the iPhone 6. 2017 will be the year Apple introduces a complete new iPhone design with OLED display. The iPhone 7 will feature the A10 CPU, no audio jack, touch sensitive home button, improved water resistance, better cameras and cleaner design on the rear shell. Despite sticking with the current design, the iPhone 7 brings enough improvements to consider an upgrade.  Unclear is still what the smart connector will be used on the iPhone 7. A keyboard accessory sounds a bit niche to me. There must be a bigger idea behind the smart connector on the iPhone 7.  Gallery 4 images You May Like The Author Luigi Lugmayr Luigi Lugmayr (Google+) is the founding chief Editor of I4U News and brings over 15 years experience in the technology field to the ever evolving and exciting world of gadgets.

Apple is notoriously secretive so most of the information we have is based on rumours and alleged leaks. But if this information turns out to be true you can look forward to a great looking device, although it does have its controversies.

IS this the new iPhone 7? (Picture: LETEM SVETEM) The Look These recently leaked pictures apparently show a gold version of the iPhone 7. The images from Czech website Letem Svetem show it is similar in design to the previous model, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Apple might be waiting until the iPhone’s tenth birthday next year to drop a design bombshell.

That means you’ll have to use the lightning port or wireless earphones. Crazy home button The home button is not going to be an actual button, according to reports. Instead it will vibrate to make it feel like you’re tapping away on something. This is the future guys. This picture was leaked (Picture: LETEM SVETEM) The rest The camera will be better obviously.

The Facebook founder speaks fluent Mandarin, in which he regularly addresses Chinese audiences in speeches and online videos. His own Facebook profile has photos of him beaming while walking the Great Wall, jogging through Tiananmen Square and peering over the Terracotta Army. Zuckerberg, a keen diplomat, is constantly wooing China’s political leaders, and has been eager to secure praise from its tech chiefs. And yet, try to reach Facebook.com in mainland China, and instead of the social network’s familiar blue and white, you will be met with a blank page saying “this site can't be reached”. Since July 2009, when the social network was fingered as a breeding ground for protesters demanding independence in the north-west region of Xinjiang, Facebook has been shut off in China under the state’s programme of blocking websites that have been unwilling to co-operate with rules on censorship and surveillance. Mark Zuckerberg jogging in Xi'an Credit: Facebook Facebook is far from alone in living outside China’s “Great Firewall”, which also blocks access to Google, Yahoo, YouTube, Twitter and Wikipedia. The country, which now has the world’s biggest internet population with an estimated 720m users, has an online economy that is almost completely isolated from the rest of the world. Despite this, the Chinese internet would not be wholly unrecognisable to the Western consumer. To search the web, internet browsers can use Baidu, the country’s answer to Google. In the gap left by Facebook and Twitter sits Weibo, a cross between the two that more than 100m people log on to every day. For their fix of cat videos, the Chinese internet user has no need for YouTube when Youku Tudou does the job just as well. Outside China, Silicon Valley is relentlessly conquering the world. Facebook has 1.7  billion people logging in at least once a month – almost two thirds of the non-Chinese internet population. Google has seven products with more than a billion monthly users. The world’s five-biggest public companies – Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google parent Alphabet, and Microsoft – all hail from hi-tech clusters in California or Seattle. The internet’s powerful network effects, and software’s infinite ability to scale, mean this small set of companies accounts for an increasing share of the world’s attention. So why does the economy that will be the world’s largest in around a decade elude them? Beyond the Great Firewall Website blocking is undoubtedly a factor in this. Google, which introduced a censored version of its search engine in China in 2006, had millions of users in the country before it reversed course in 2010. But it was already a distant second to Baidu, enjoying just a 35pc share of the search market, far below the practical monopoly it enjoys elsewhere. Just as significant as China’s censorship of the web is the reality that products baked in the California sunshine often don’t appeal to Chinese consumers, or are implemented so poorly that a copycat with local knowledge can easily dominate the market. There was no better example of this than the monstrously expensive, but ultimately doomed effort by Uber to dominate China, which came to an end this month. Almost everywhere else in the world, the car-hailing app  has got on the wrong side of taxi drivers and, in many cases, regulators, but has become the default way for young, social city dwellers to get around. Didi Chuxing has managed to beat Uber at its own game in China Credit: EPA In mainland China, however, it was dwarfed by Didi Chuxing, a domestic competitor with the know-how and local connections to beat Uber at its own game. Since Uber had set the wheels rolling on its Chinese subsidiary in 2014, it had lost billions, subsidising rides and handing drivers heavy bonuses in a bloody scrap for market share. But Didi had matched it yuan for yuan. Two weeks ago Uber threw in the towel. It agreed to merge its Chinese business with Didi, a partnership in which the American company will have a 17.7pc share. While the alliance was celebrated as a way for the combined group to end their brutal race to the bottom and finally make profits, it was hardly the surrender that Travis Kalanick, Uber’s ultra-competitive founder, would have hoped for when he first entered China. Uber was not able to blame the Great Firewall for its inability to repeat its success in Western markets. Neither was eBay, which arrived in China with great fanfare in 2004, but shut down only two years later. Alibaba – which at that point was a minnow compared with eBay – had beaten the American colossus away with Taobao, its own consumer auctions website. Amazon, the dominant web retailer in most of its markets, has repeatedly tried to establish a foothold in China but has largely resorted to partnering with domestic players. These are deep-pocketed companies, which are not used to running away with their tails between their legs, but the litany of failures in the country is starting to look like a pattern. A different internet It is not for the want of effort or interest. China’s internet-savvy population and rising middle class make it an ideal market. But when the internet’s giants set foot in the country, they have typically failed to understand its culture and habits. The mass internet in China did not arrive until years after the West, so many users’ first experiences with it was via a smartphone, rather than a desktop computer. This means that many of the services that were born on the PC – the email, search engines, even the web itself – do not form the basis of the Chinese internet. WeChat is a way of life for internet users in China Credit: Reuters Instead, life revolves around WeChat, a messaging app which became popular due to the prohibitive expense of texting. China is not alone in this – WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Apple’s iMessage have replaced texts around the world – WeChat is a far more advanced portal to the wider internet. It is used for shopping, peer-to-peer payments, and booking doctors’ appointments. The dominant smartphone manufacturers in the country – beyond Apple, which has been a rare US success story – are brands unfamiliar to most in the West: Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. And the majority of China’s online payments do not directly go through credit cards and banks, but via Alipay, a service introduced by Alibaba more than a decade ago. Try to survive in China outside the bubble, as Uber did when it took its first steps into the country, and you may as well not exist. “Chinese companies almost all use Alipay and WeChat – if you come into the local market and don’t use them, you won’t work here,” says Xiaofeng Wang, an analyst at Forrester. “They have huge user loyalty.” Didi, unlike Uber, was able to build strong ties with WeChat, which many Chinese smartphone owners use to book transport, although the fact that WeChat’s owner Tencent is a major shareholder in the taxi app may have greased the wheels. But domestic operators have also proved to have strong stomachs for low prices and heavy losses, which have allowed them to compete with the invaders of Silicon Valley long enough to stand on their own feet. The rise of the Chinese internet giant “Chinese consumers are very fickle and aggressive in being price conscious; that leads to a very ruthless market, you see that across many sectors,” says Benjamin Kennedy, a managing partner at DealGlobe, a Shanghai-headquartered investment bank that helps Chinese firms invest in Europe. “It’s very hard for a Western player to come in who doesn’t understand the market and the consumer in depth and create a value proposition. Chinese businesses are willing to take really thin margins, even smaller firms will happily lose money in that battle.” The result of these ultra-competitive but loss-making Chinese businesses has been a spate of mergers, which has created domestic behemoths capable of standing up to their foreign rivals. Didi Chuxing itself was formed by the merger of Didi and Kuadi, which were China’s two biggest taxi apps. Youku Tudou, the dominant video site, is also a result of a duopoly that could not sustain itself. AT A GLANCE | Five Chinese internet giants Taking on these giants, which serve an enormous market, is a lot tougher than entering a smaller country where the incumbent cannot hope to compete. So will Silicon Valley, which dreams of a connected world without national borders give up on China, having spent billions there? The gargantuan opportunities there suggest not. Zuckerberg continues his courtship of officials. Google is once again hiring in the country, suggesting it could rekindle its efforts there. But Wang, of Forrester, says that domestic giants are now so entrenched that it is hard to see Silicon Valley players ever dethroning them. “I don’t think they’d have a chance,” she says. Kennedy says a better strategy would be to, as Uber has done, partner with a local player, citing the success of companies such as Volkswagen which have grown in China by establishing joint ventures. That may be so, but whether the utopians of Silicon Valley can swallow such a pill is another question.

Facebook's $6 Billion Buyback Is 'Pragmatic' Trump's Victory A Mixed Bag For Social Media Stocks (Seeking Alpha) As the market rebounded over July, amid a relatively strong earnings season and reassuring messages from the Fed regarding the economic outlook, TD Ameritrade clients were net equity sellers, the latest Investor Movement Index (IMX) showed. This is how the IMX works: when the index’s score surges, it means investors' recent past activity has leaned toward a bullish stance; conversely, when the score declines, investors' recent past activity has tended towards bearishness. Over July, the IMX declined by 6.2 percent to 4.69. TD Ameritrade’s Managing Director of Trading, Nicole Sherrod, shared a look into what the firm’s clients did in July. Interestingly, the decline in exposure to equities was not only driven by net selling of stocks, but also by “lower volatility relative to the overall market of several widely held names” like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC). As stated above, the market strength led to net selling of some big companies, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), which rebounded in July. Similar was the situation for Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST), Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SIRI) and General Electric Company (NYSE: GE). Finally, some more popular stocks that saw net selling over July included Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM), Sprint Corp (NYSE: S) and LinkedIn Corp (NYSE: LNKD).

Several Giants were nicked up a bit in the 27-10 defeat at MetLife Stadium, but no players suffered what are believed to be serious or long-term injuries. It was a welcomed result for a Giants team that as been the NFL's most injured over the past three seasons, and had lost multiple players to season-ending injuries by this time last year. Here's a postgame rundown of the Giants' injury report: Odell Beckham puts on pregame catch display WR Odell Beckham Jr. (coach's decision): Beckham was set to play on Friday night, but after the game was delayed about an hour due to weather, McAdoo decided to hold him out. The decision was not injury-related. "He came out, we had intentions of playing him in a handful of plays," McAdoo said. "We got back in, we had the delay, and I decided not to play him." CB Eli Apple (leg): The first-round pick left the game with what was diagnosed as a "lower leg strain. McAdoo said the injury "doesn't look to be anything serious at this point," and Apple spoke to reporters after the game, saying he felt fine. More on Apple WR Sterling Shepard (groin): The second-round pick exited with a sore groin, but he also said he was fine after the game, telling Giants fans to not "freak out" about the fact he and Apple got nicked up. More on Shepard Turnovers doom Nassib WR Geremy Davis (hamstring): Of all the injuries from the game, this one might be the one to keep an eye on, although McAdoo seemed to think it is not a serious issue. "Doesn't look severe at this point," McAdoo said, "but things can change overnight." FB/TE Will Johnson (burner): Johnson exited with a burner, but it is not serious.  LB B.J. Goodson (cramps): Goodson just had cramps; he is fine.  WR Victor Cruz (groin): Cruz sat out Friday's game with a groin injury, but McAdoo was hopeful he may be back at practice Sunday. More on Cruz Other players that did not play: LB Keenan Robinson (groin), DE Kerry Wynn (groin), LB J.T. Thomas (hamstring/PUP), DT Jay Bromley (ankle/PUP).  TALK IS CHEAP, E59: Preseason preview, and an interview with ex-Giants WR Brandon London Subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, Stitcher, Soundcloud or iHeartRadio.

In 2002, Steve Jobs held a series of meetings with executives from two of the world's biggest record labels: Warner Music and Universal. He wanted to pitch them the idea of an online music store, from which listeners could download -- for less than a dollar, pound or Euro -- songs "a la carte." The music industry was, understandably, resistant. After all, the sale of albums underpinned their billion-dollar industry; they had no incentive to indulge an idea that threatened the status quo. "They thought," Jobs remembered to Steve Levy, "it would be the death knell of the album." After tense and protracted talks, they signed up. Other labels followed. A year later, Apple launched iTunes. The days of the CD seemed numbered, but it didn't quite work like that: By 2006, CD sales still brought in more than $9 billion a year for the music industry in the U.S.. It seemed the old format could survive in the new world. In 2008, Spotify was launched. Within a few years, it was joined by a wave of similar streaming platforms: Rhapsody, Apple Music, Tidal. This time, CDs could not cope. In 2015, CD sales brought in $1.5 billion in the U.S., according to the New York Times. That's a drop of more than 80 percent in a decade. CDs survived the first blow, but the second swept them away. At times, Arsenal have the air of a club at risk of suffering the same fate. Arsene Wenger griped about Man United's fee for Paul Pogba, which he feels Arsenal couldn't match. Last week, Wenger was asked about the £89 million fee that Manchester United agreed to pay Juventus for Paul Pogba. The sum, he said, was "crazy," though he tempered that by saying he was comfortable with it, as long as United were spending money they could afford. Of course, that clarification didn't work: Jose Mourinho, eternally sensitive to criticism like a particularly volatile Roman Emperor, has since offered two rounds of rebuttal to his old sparring partner. First, he said it was "unethical" to talk about other clubs' behaviour. Once the deal was done, he suggested it was the sort of transfer only possible at one of the world's big clubs, with the implication being that Arsenal didn't meet that criterion. Mourinho's explanation for his barbs is that he was "defending" his club from external criticism. Regardless, what he said will have touched something of a nerve among Arsenal supporters. Although Arsenal qualify as one of the world's top clubs by pretty much any metric -- income, fan base, presence in elite competitions -- they do not, by their own admission, have the sort of financial firepower to commit so much money to one player. Ivan Gazidis, the club's chief executive, said as much when in New York on the team's preseason tour. "We cannot afford to outgun competitors that have far more money," he said. The club's "self-sustaining model" means that he and Wenger have to "be very careful, very selective." Those words have cut the club's fans deeply. They've been hearing them for more than a decade, almost since the pre-iTunes age, and unsurprisingly, they've started to wear a little thin. Arsenal suffered lean years while they built the Emirates, fans were told, so that they could match the playthings of the sheikhs and the oligarchs off the pitch as well as on it. They have built cash reserves in the hundreds of millions, enough to make them heavyweights in the transfer market. What has all that been for if they still can't compete? Sadly, what has happened to Arsenal runs parallel to what happened to CDs. They survived the first blow and managed to secure a place in the world for themselves, even when they were supposed to have fallen by the wayside. Then, just when they were starting to feel comfortable, the ground moved beneath their feet once more. Arsenal built the Emirates to increase their match-day revenue. The short-term pain was worth the long-term gain, they said. They were a little hamstrung in the transfer market -- in John Cross's excellent book on Wenger, the Frenchman admits how tight finances were at times over those years -- but it was deemed necessary. Arsenal needed to innovate to stay ahead. That bit of the plan worked. Wenger kept Arsenal competitive and constantly in the Champions League -- of the original "Big Four," they're the only team to not have experienced some time out of that competition -- and the stadium soon started enabling the club to fill its coffers. Arsenal make more money from their match-day revenue than any club in the world, according to the financial analysts Deloitte. Building a new stadium was the right thing to do, except, of course, that it was not. By the time the Emirates was starting to pay off their own debt, the amount of money coming into the Premier League from television rights had become a flood. Suddenly, match-day revenues were not as important as they had been. Worse, the arrival of Sheikh Mansour at Manchester City super-heated the transfer market once again. Granit Xhaka has been Arsenal's big signing this summer, but fans are unhappy he's the only one. Arsenal had been sprinting to stand still, but Wenger and the club adapted once more. They came out of austerity and started judiciously adding talent to their team. The Frenchman brought in Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez, far higher profile and more expensive signings than he might previously have considered. Like the CD, Arsenal seemed to have been able to find a way of staying relevant ... and then this summer happened. Pumped full of Nitro-glycerine by the record-breaking TV deal, the Premier League's transfer market shot beyond their reach once more. Arsenal are one of the biggest clubs in the world, but Mourinho is right: Arsenal could not pull off a deal such as the one that brought Pogba back to Old Trafford because the money sitting in their bank accounts, what once looked like a fortune, does not quite stretch as far. This is a world, remember, in which Jordon Ibe fetches £15 million and John Stones £53 million. Arsenal survived the download era. They found the new world had a place for them. Now, though, streaming has come along, and they seem old-fashioned again. It would be foolish to predict that this is the end of Arsenal as a force or that this is the year they drop out of the top four. Whatever you think of him, Wenger and his record deserve more respect than that. Arsenal finished second last year. They might not be good enough to win the league, but they are more than good enough to be in the conversation. It is hard, though, to see how they react to what has happened to football's concept of value this summer. All that saving, planning and admirable common sense, and the market's madness has caught them out. It should be a source of sorrow more than anything: Wenger's Sisyphean struggle to get to the top of the hill, only for the ground to shift beneath him as soon as he gets close.

The Giants overhauled defense performs well in limited action. (Bill Kostroun/AP) BY Seth Walder NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Saturday, August 13, 2016, 2:02 AM So far, the $200 million spending spree is working. Big Blue’s revamped defense held Miami’s offense to a total of just eight yards over the two drives that the starters played in Friday’s 27-10 preseason loss to the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium. Granted, it’s just the preseason. And granted, it’s the Dolphins. But the Giants put together a strong pass rush and got the results they hoped for out of their high-priced unit in the two drives they played. “I liked it,” Ben McAdoo said of the pass rush. “I’m all for it.” Follow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. "Like" us here. Expensive defensive end Olivier Vernon was a standout and got after his old teammate, Ryan Tannehill, in his limited action and nearly forced a safety. Vernon and Jason Pierre-Paul were so quick to cause disruption on that play that they actually bumped into each other in the backfield. “I mean JPP, he’s extremely athletic and he’s a monster out there on that field,” Vernon said. “I wouldn’t expect anything less. Right now he’s just keep it flowing, keeping it flowing, and I can’t wait to be in Dallas.” The Giants defense only was on the field for six plays, simply because that was all they were needed for: they forced two three-and-outs. It almost got better, as Jonathan Casillas nearly picked off Tannehill. New Giant defensive tackle Damon Harrison and Johnathan Hankins warm up before the game. (Rich Schultz/Getty Images) “I thought the first-team defense took a solid step tonight, coming out playing with each other for the first time,” McAdoo said. Apple, Shepard injured in Giants’ preseason game vs Dolphins Though neither Eli Manning nor Odell Beckham Jr. played Friday night, the Giants were ahead 7-0 when most of the “starters” exited the game. Ryan Nassib connected with Shepard for a big play on the first drive that ended with a Rashad Jennings three-yard touchdown. For a moment it looked like the success was going to come at a cost, as both Eli Apple (lower leg strain) and Sterling Shepard (groin) left the game with injuries. However, McAdoo and both rookies said after the game they weren’t concerned about their health, though Apple admitted the tweak near his knee did give him a scare initially. Though the starting offense — minus Manning and Beckham — started out hot, the backup units took a turn for the worse. “We had six balls on the ground and two (interceptions), I’m not pleased about any of it,” McAdoo said. Nassib finished 7-15 for 75 yards with two interceptions and a fumble lost. Miami Dolphins running back Damien Williams finds the end zone in the second quarter. (Ray Stubblebine/AP) After being hyped up by Beckham earlier in the week, Shepard made a strong first impression on Giants fans. The rookie wide receiver’s first catch as a member of Big Blue came on the opening drive, when he dove and grabbed an underthrown third-down pass from Nassib near the right sideline for a 24-yard gain that put the Giants inside their opponents’ 10-yard line. That big gain set up the Jennings three-yard score two plays later that put Big Blue up 7-0. The defense made quick work of the lackluster Dolphins offense, picking up back-to-back three-and-outs. After a couple of close calls earlier in the half, Nassib was eventually picked off by Bobby McCain about halfway through the second quarter on a deep ball intended for Shepard. He was later strip-sacked and then picked off again by A.J. Hendy. CRUZ QUESTION Victor Cruz unsurprisingly did not play after suffering a groin injury earlier in the week. So when will he practice again? “We’ll take a look,” McAdoo said. “Hopefully, Sunday.” CALLING THE SHOTS Offensive coordinator Mike Sullivan called the plays Friday, McAdoo said. The head coach has not decided who will call the offensive plays during the season, but said Saturday went “fine” and that there were “no problems with play entry.” STORM WATCH: McAdoo said the plan originally was for Beckham to play Friday, but he elected to sit the star receiver after the game was delayed due to severe weather...Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Janoris Jenkins started at cornerback but Rodgers-Cromartie slid inside to the slot in nickel when Eli Apple came in.  Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS Jailbreak tweaks of the week: ClearClockView, PullOver, & more…   skip to main content skip to main menu     This tweak lets you unlock your iPhone with Touch ID even without a passcode By Anthony Bouchard, Aug 13, 2016 Tweet 14 Comments All of Apple’s iPhones since the iPhone 5s, and even the latest iPad models, come with Touch ID fingerprint scanners that let you have access to your device almost immediately without the need to waste time entering a password or passcode at the Lock screen. However, if you never use a passcode anyways, but you still enjoy the functionality of Touch ID, you can use a new jailbreak tweak called AlwaysTouch. It’s meant for family devices AlwaysTouch is really for those of you who don’t care about the security of a particular device because it may already be getting used by more than one person or it may be a family device. It allows you to use the Touch ID sensor to unlock your device even when a passcode isn’t set. Moreover, it doesn’t matter what fingerprint is used to unlock the device, so your mom, dad, siblings, children, and anyone else who uses the device can use the Touch ID sensor to unlock your iPhone or iPad with their own fingerprints. The tweak is essentially nothing more than a way to evade the “slide to unlock” animation on the Lock screen by allowing you to use the Touch ID sensor to unlock the device instead. Because you don’t have a passcode set, the device isn’t really checking the fingerprint to make sure that the person using the Touch ID sensor is authorized to use your device, instead, it’s just assuming that you want to unlock your device because the Touch ID sensor is being used since there are already no security measures in place. It’s not for the security mongers If you’re big on security, and you have a huge passcode set and have Touch ID set up to recognize your fingerprint only, then you don’t need this tweak, and I wouldn’t even bother to recommend it to you. The reason the tweak exists is because there are legitimately people out there who don’t use a passcode because they may have a family device that anyone in the household is welcomed to use, and it gives the illusion that you’re using Touch ID to unlock the device from an aesthetic standpoint. If you have a reason to keep any information on your device safe, then you should stick to the traditional passcode and Touch ID method of unlocking your device. My thoughts on AlwaysTouch It’s a touchy subject whenever you’re talking about security, and I know some people will wonder why in the world you would leave a device without a passcode in the first place. Speaking from experience, my family and I always had our own personal devices that we kept secure in our own person with a passcode, and most recently, with Touch ID, but we always had a family iPad that we were all welcomed to use, and to make things easier, we didn’t put a passcode on it. That’s simply because we only used the device for web browsing and not for personal data – consider it the same reason you might use a public computer at the library or at a school, rather than your own. In a scenario like this one, AlwaysTouch is cool because it lets you get past the Lock screen in a new way. Typically when you try to unlock a device without a passcode, you have to wake it up and then slide to unlock to get to the Home screen, but with AlwaysTouch, you can just use the Touch ID sensor to get to the Home screen, and that’s just a nice touch even for those who don’t have a passcode because it feels more modern. If you have any devices that aren’t passcode protected, and they’re jailbroken, I think AlwaysTouch is a nice tweak to check out. However, if your only devices are those that are heavily guarded by passcodes and contain personal information, then skip it. Wrapping up To bring a more modern way of getting past the Lock screen to iOS devices without a passcode, AlwaysTouch is a cool tweak for jailbroken devices to check out and is available free of cost in Cydia’s BigBoss repository. Anyone can use it, which makes it perfect for family devices that you keep around the house. Would you use AlwaysTouch for any of your devices? Share why or why not in the comments below.

We had to share a device in my family or any family for that matter why not just assign the family last name with any number on the end and we can all share that device and still be secure. Doesn’t make sense to leave any device ever with out a passcode Anthony Bouchard Most of the time, no, sometimes yes. Depends what you use it for. mickey Because passcodes/passwords can be annoying for a shared home device. My iPad/iMac are shared and don’t move from their respective rooms so they have no passcodes. Ease of use is valued here over security. Of course there’s nothing sensitive on them. I’d use touchID if it was an option but it isn’t, and passcodes are just not as seamless. Bugs Bunnay Now this is one nifty tweak! Forget that slide to unlock! amarioguy No, this doesn’t disable requiring passcode after restart, as that’s in the Secure Enclave and no tweak can modify SEP’s behavior without BOTH a SEP BootROM exploit, and an Application Processor BootROM exploit. banchong Would be good if it didn’t totally disable reachability.
