The new video series that the tech titan posted on its page features yaks, breathing buildings and making one-half gallon of artificial sweat every day. As a part of the celebration, Apple told about its new headquarters based in Cupertino, California. 'Apple Park', which opened for its employees earlier in April, is the world's largest naturally ventilated building, projected to require no heating or air conditioning for nine months of the year. Apple's new headquarters replaced five million square feet of asphalt and concrete with grassy fields and over 9,000 native, drought-resistant trees, and is powered by 100 per cent renewable energy, the company said. With 17 MW of rooftop solar, Apple Park will run one of the largest on-site solar energy installations in the world. According to the '2017 Environmental Responsibility Report' Apple was now powering 96 per cent of its operations with renewable energy in the company's offices, retail stores and product distribution centres. Apple is now 100 per cent renewable in 24 countries, including all of its data centres. In the report, Apple also set an aim to help put an end to mining on earth and said it is planning to use 100 per cent recycled material to manufacture its products. In 2016, Apple launched Liam, the experimental automated technology that disassembles iPhone 6 for recycling. --IANS sku/in SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features India sizzles as heat wave grips states Assam soaks in joy, celebrates Bihu No bars on highways Rare April snow, heavy rains cut off Kashmir Dalai Lama's Arunachal visit rattles China, jubilates exiled Buddhists About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2017.

The tech titan plans a one day move to a closed-loop manufacturing system in which it will use 100 percent recycled products. But the company is yet working on the probable and optimized way to implement the move. Moreover, on the occasion of Earth Day Apple have adorable plans for the celebration. Apple leads no mining campaign for tech-industry The company made a shout-out clearing its aim to preserve the environment by no mining in the Environmental Responsibility Report released today. The reason Apple is stretching the major shift is the electronics manufacturing companies affect on our planet. Apple says that they are challenging themselves by making an attempt to stop mining and fetch the necessary things from rare earth minerals and recycled products. Here goes the statement, “We don’t question these realities — we challenge ourselves to ask what we can do about them in every part of our business” In a recent interview with Vice, Lisa Jackson, Apple’s VP of the Environment and Social Initiatives said that the company will not necessarily source from the earth the materials they need in its products. Jackson added that Apple is attempting a rare thing which is to announce the goal before figuring out its way. In 2011, after Tim Cook took over as Apple’s CEO, the company has raised many social programs. Currently, 100 percent of the electricity Apple uses to power their data centers and 96 percent of the electricity used by the facilities of Apple worldwide comes from renewable energy sources like hydro, solar and wind. To judge the environmental and social impact of the obtaining the material it uses, Apple created Material Risk profiles. It then checks out where the company can cut down the use concerning the effect on the environment. Apple seems serious with the unprecedented goal for the tech industry to drive improvements in the methods of sourcing materials. The tech titan is also making attempts in the recycling industry to innovate new ways or alterations in the policies that could bring metals, minerals and rare earth materials from the old devices. The Liam initiative by Apple which is a disassembly line of robots is a great move. The Liam robots can pull apart the old devices, saving more than the regular recycling process does. Apple celebrates Earth Day Earth Day is on 22nd April and to celebrate it Apple has launched a video campaign that highlights the key aspects of the tech giant’s environmental priorities this year. Moreover, on the Earth Day Apple employees will change from their standard blue shirts to Green Earth Day shirts. Apple Watch users will also see new activity challenge ahead of Earth Day. Educational programs will be added in iPad to educate kids about the importance of the environment preservation. Apple will have a specialized logo with green accent leaf on the traditional Apple in its retail stores worldwide. Earth Day is one of the few days when Apple alters its logo. Apple has shown a great leadership by announcing a goal for the tech-industry of “Stop mining”; commencing the initiative. So as Apple, be a leader in every aspect.   Author Christy Gren Christy Gren is an Industry Specialist Reporter at Industry Leaders Magazine; she enjoys writing about Unicorns, Silicon Valley, Startups, and Business leaders and innovators.

By: Reuters | San Francisco | Published:April 22, 2017 10:03 am Apple application documents give some clues about the company’s highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. Apple Inc outlined a plan to train operators of self-driving cars in documents submitted to California regulators earlier this month, the latest clues to the company’s autonomous vehicle technology aspirations. Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on April 14 by the California Department of Motor Vehicles but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company’s highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet’s Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform. Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called “Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview” whose objective is “to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions.” “Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control,” the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple’s development platform “will have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs.” The document does not include detail on how Apple’s self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple’s three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer’s cars. For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: Apple No Comments.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Samsung's Galaxy S8 Success Will Come at a Cost And what it means for Apple. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 21, 2017 at 10:15PM By all indications thus far, Samsung's newest Galaxy S8 looks like it's going to be a massive success. The new flagship handset has a striking and unique design that sets it apart from anything Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has done, and the company played it conservatively in terms of the battery specs in order to ensure that the Note 7 debacle doesn't repeat itself. The Note 7's explosive tendencies were in part tied to Samsung pushing the envelope with the battery's energy density. The Galaxy S8 may very redeem the South Korean conglomerate's brand in the eyes of consumers. Assuming nothing goes wrong in the coming months, that success could come at a cost, as the Galaxy S8 promises to be one of 2017's best-selling phones. Image source: Samsung. Component costs are going up IHS Markit has just released preliminary estimates on the bill of materials (BOM) for the Galaxy S8. Spoiler alert: It's expensive. The BOM totals an estimated $301.60, which is meaningfully higher than any previous Galaxy device. That figure is before you include other costs, such as manufacturing or licensing royalties. Tacking on another $5.90 in manufacturing costs brings the total to $307.50. Compare that to other flagship Galaxy phones, as well as IHS Markit's estimates for the iPhone 7 from last September: Device Estimated BOM Galaxy S8 $307.50 Galaxy S7 $264.16 Galaxy S7 Edge $271.21 iPhone 7 $224.80 Data source: IHS Markit. The Galaxy S8 starts at $720. IHS Markit notes that the Galaxy S8 is the first handset that has the technical capabilities to deliver gigabit speeds over LTE. While the market researcher doesn't break out the display costs in its release, display assemblies are often the most expensive component, and Samsung's new "Infinity Display" very likely contributed significantly to the increase. The device starts with a generous 64 GB of storage and 4 GB of RAM, further adding to the BOM, representing about $41.50. Taking the battle upmarket Given the Galaxy S8's strong critical reception thus far, there's quite a bit of pressure for Apple's 10th-generation iPhone to be a blockbuster, as Samsung has now raised the bar. IHS Markit director Andrew Rassweiler notes that BOM costs are trending up, which "reflects something of an arms race in features among Apple, Samsung and other phone manufacturers, as they all try to add new and distinguishing hardware features." One of the most widely held expectations for the 2017 iPhone is a high-end model featuring an OLED display that could cost upwards of $1,000. Given the aforementioned disproportionate impact on costs that displays have, Apple's first adoption of OLED technology will also drive up the component costs of the "iPhone 8" or "iPhone X" or "iPhone whatever-Apple-calls-it." Since Apple has much more aggressive margin targets than its frenemy, any increase in costs should translate into an even higher price point relative to Samsung's pricing strategy. (Hence the possibility of a $1,000 price tag.) At a time when average smartphone prices continue to trend lower, Apple and Samsung are taking their battle even further upmarket.

Set for a reveal this coming May 16, the HTC U 11 is expected to debut the tech giant’s revolutionary Sense Touch technology, an entirely new way for users to interact with the upcoming flagship device. Despite this new technology and the smartphone’s likely powerhouse specs, however, a couple of confirmed characteristics of the U 11 have managed to get many mobile fans extremely apprehensive. HTC has a pretty mixed track record with its flagship devices, though the HTC 10, released last year, was met with much acclaim due to its balanced specs and premium design. Unfortunately for the smartphone maker, the HTC 10’s excellent reviews and powerhouse internals did little to sway the market away from the equally-stellar Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the iPhone 7, two of 2017’s most successful smartphones. Thus, with the HTC U 11 being released not long after the debut of the acclaimed Galaxy S8, mobile enthusiasts are apprehensive about the impending fate of HTC’s 2017 flagship. U saw it here first [specs: https://t.co/CXrpcG0YAm] pic.twitter.com/vP7U6mzjzo — Evan Blass (@evleaks) April 15, 2017 One thing that has managed to make many mobile fans apprehensive was the revelation that the HTC U 11 would not be sporting a traditional 3.5mm headphone jack. The removal of such an essential smartphone feature has been trailblazed by Motorola with the Moto Z and Apple with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, much to the chagrin of consumers. In Apple’s case, the Cupertino-based tech giant asserted that the removal of the key feature was a decision made with “courage” in mind, a reason that has become notorious among internet meme-makers worldwide. Unfortunately for HTC fans, it appears that the smartphone-maker is dedicated to following Apple and Motorola’s example. Longtime users of HTC devices, posting on the comment thread of the U 11’s official teaser, have voiced their concerns to the smartphone maker, stating that the lack of a headphone jack would make the upcoming flagship into a far less compelling purchase. According to HTC’s response to users’ concerns, however, the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack is completely a matter of audio quality, as the device’s USB-C port would give users a superior mobile sound experience. Nevertheless, numerous users posting on HTC’s official Twitter account have already stated that they would be keeping their old HTC devices until such time that the smartphone maker releases another flagship device that includes the essential feature. Apart from the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, HTC fans have also noted that based on the renders and leaked images of the smartphone, the HTC U 11 would feature a traditional design, including sizable bezels on the device’s top and bottom. This means that HTC’s 2017 flagship, when compared to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the LG G6, already looks outdated even before it gets released. HTC's upcoming flagship may be branded 'HTC U 11' and come in five different colors https://t.co/lu6JRR6Lys pic.twitter.com/G1pUssj66Q — Android Police (@AndroidPolice) April 21, 2017 Nevertheless, the HTC U 11 does have its Sense Touch technology, which would enable users of the device to access the smartphone’s features by using the sides of the flagship as a touch panel. A leaked promo ad for the feature has been released, and from what could be determined from the feature so far, it appears that Sense Touch would be quite similar to Samsung’s Edge features, giving users shortcuts to popular applications. Noted leakster Evan Blass, writing for VentureBeat, stated that the HTC U 11 would be featuring a vibrant paint job that is available in white, black, blue, red, and silver options. Other rumors about the internals of the HTC U 11 include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 mobile processor, around 6GB of RAM, up to 256GB of storage, a 12MP Dual-Pixel primary camera, an 8MP Selfie Shooter and a 5.5-inch QHD display. A 3,700mAh battery with Quick Charge 4.0 is also widely speculated for the upcoming device.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 22 April 2017 | MYT 10:00 AM Apple touts greater use of recycled metal in gadgets Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products for recycling and has melted down iPhone aluminium enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories. — AFP NEW YORK: Apple wants to “one day” end the need to mine materials from the earth to make its gadgets, the technology giant said in its annual environmental responsibility report.  ”Traditional supply chains are linear,” it said. “Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products.”  ”We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material,” it added.  The company’s research concluded that recycled aluminium should come from Apple products rather than recycling facilities because of the high-grade quality required.  Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products for recycling and has melted down iPhone aluminium enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories.  ”For tin, we took a different approach,” the company said. “Unlike aluminium, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards.”  As a result, Apple has been using recycled tin for its iPhone 6s.   The ultimate aim is “to one day end our reliance on mining altogether,” the company said, without specifying a date.  Apple did not disclose the amount of recycled products currently used in its products.  ”Apple’s commitment to 100% recycled materials is ambitious, and highlights the need for greater urgency across the sector to reduce resource consumption and e-waste that are causing significant impacts on the environment and human health,” Greenpeace senior analyst Gary Cook said.  Making new gadgets with reclaimed material reduces demand for mined metals and increases the tendency for devices to be recycled, according to the environmental group.  Samsung last month said it would sell some Note 7 smartphones that were recalled for safety reasons as refurbished devices, in an effort to manage its stockpile in an “environmentally friendly” manner.  The South Korean giant recalled an estimated four million of its flagship smartphones over concerns that batteries could overheat and burst into flames.  A Samsung statement said that salvageable components from devices would be detached, and metals extracted by companies that specialise in recycling.  While lauding a shift to devices made completely from reclaimed materials, Greenpeace analyst Cook urged technology companies to also design products that last a long time and are easy to repair and recycle.  Apple is also among Silicon Valley titans investing heavily in green energy for operations, saying that 96% of the electricity at its global facilities comes from renewable sources and that its new ‘spaceship’ main campus is powered entirely by renewable energy. — AFP Related Stories You May Be Interested VR companies navigate ‘the trough of disillusionment’ Sony nearly triples annual profit forecast Uber extends sexual harassment probe; expects report by end-May Switch from 3G to 4G SIM card to enter Maxis' RM1mil giveaway campaign How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Mongolia, Chinese Taipei rule the courts Ex-Thai chief Worawi wants ban reversal after appeals win Thanks for defecating advertisement Latest News How to prevent your child from spending money on your smartphone ‘Assassin’s Creed’ creator releases ‘Ancestors’ tease What to do if your smartphone is stolen Zynga launches ‘GIFS Against Friends’ Apple touts greater use of recycled metal in gadgets Most Viewed in Tech What to do if your smartphone is stolen ‘Assassin’s Creed’ creator releases ‘Ancestors’ tease How to prevent your child from spending money on your smartphone Switch from 3G to 4G SIM card to enter Maxis' RM1mil giveaway campaign Zynga launches ‘GIFS Against Friends’ Bosch and Baidu join forces to accelerate autonomous driving breakthroughs in China Riot Games introduces Student Ambassador Program in Malaysia Italian court rules mobile phone caused tumour Acer unveils three Chromebooks for work and education Samsung’s Galaxy S8 hits stores Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

That’s April 22nd, 2017, and you’ll have to complete a 30 minute workout outdoors to collect it. From Apple’s Earth Day press release: Apple’s new Earth Day Challenge encourages customers to get outside and enjoy the planet and complete a workout of at least 30 minutes. If they do so on Earth Day, they’ll receive a special achievement and unique stickers in the Messages app. Apple Watch Badge for Earth Day Outdoor Workout Apple issued a press release touting its environmental efforts in advance of Saturday’s celebration of Earth Day. On Thursday, Apple released four animated videos about sustainability programs around the world. Tidbits from Apple’s Earth Day Press Release Apple is now powering 96 percent of its operations with renewable energy in the company’s offices, retail stores, and product distribution centers. Apple has achieved its goal of 100 percent renewable energy in 24 countries, and specified that included all of its data centers. Seven companies in Apple’s massive supply chain have, “committed to powering their Apple production with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of next year, including three new manufacturers – Compal Electronics, Sunwoda Electronics and Biel Crystal Manufactory Ltd.” Apple has, “transitioned approximately 320,000 acres of forest in China toward Forest Stewardship Council certification.” The company said it had reached its goal of, “protecting and creating enough sustainably managed forests to cover all its packaging needs.” Apple also said it was using aluminum recycled by its Liam robot to build Mac minis used in supplier facilities. Please note that Apple is not claiming that all Mac minis are made from this aluminum.

View All Editorials → Apple Hires Satellite Experts away from Google Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin 1 minute read Apr 21st, 2017 9:05 PM EDT | Analysis Apple has hired away a pair of Google’s top satellite experts, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Citing unnamed sources, Mr. Gurman reported that Apple hired John Fenwick, who previously led Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering at Google. They are part of a new hardware team at Apple headed by another former Googler, Dropcam cofounder Greg Duffy. Apple in the Skies? Apple Hires Satellite Experts The first question you might have is why Apple would want to make satellites. The answer to that could be in a recent Boeing regulatory filing. According to Bloomberg, Boeing is working on plans for a network of 1,000 satellites that would provide broadband internet access. That service could be offered anywhere, including areas with no wired or wireless telephone infrastructure. Boeing has reportedly talked to Apple about being part of the project. Whether or not that’s true, and whether or not Apple is going to work with Boeing, it’s easy to understand that Apple could be interested in offering that sort of service. Opening up the third world to high speed internet access is a goal of many tech giants, and that would certainly include Apple. The company could also turn such an operation into a direct revenue generator in the developed world. Bloomberg noted that Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. forecasted $30 billion in satellite internet revenues by 2025. That’s serious money even for Apple. Apple could also use a satellite fleet for multiple purposes. The company could take its own photographs for Apple Maps, and sell those images on the open market like Google. Apple could also contribute to or compete with existing global positioning systems. Perhaps most importantly, Apple could use satellites to augment its own data distribution for iTunes and the App Store. Or Maybe Not Apple has tons of projects, most of which get killed along the way. Just because Apple hired two satellite experts and has them working in a new hardware team doesn’t necessarily mean Apple will ever be involved with satellites. In addition, just because these two folks are satellite experts doesn’t necessarily mean this team is even working on satellites. They’re reporting to someone who isn’t a satellite expert, for instance. But, it’s interesting news no matter how you slice it. I think many Apple fans would love for Apple to launch its own ISP, especially if it was dedicated to Apple’s existing commitment to privacy and security.

Apple Glass concept. Credit: Tailosive Tech / YouTubeMore Apple Glass concept. Credit: Tailosive Tech / YouTube The leaked report, which was obtained by Gizmodo, makes note of over 70 incidents at Apple's campuses. Some of them are mundane, while other contain eyebrow-raising clues about the company's next wave of products. Several of these reports deal with eye strain issues, which gives a bit more weight to the possibility of an Apple AR headset. In one incident, an employee "experience discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study." A separate report involved an employee dealing with eye pain after working with some sort of "new prototype."

One incident involved an employee getting hurt while out skiing to collect data that could be used to track skiing and snowboarding on an Apple Watch. Another report noted that an employee was hit by an Apple minivan, which, according to one of Gizmodo's sources, could be one of the vans that Apple uses to gather data for its Maps app. While injury reports are a strange place to find product news, some of these testing scenarios line up with rumored Apple products and features. The company has long been expected to jump into augmented reality — Apple CEO Tim Cook has frequently championed the technology, and various rumors and patents have pointed to an Apple AR headset arriving some time in the near future.

Approx. 70-75% of smartphones sold in India are at the sub-$150 level, while just 7% are in the “high-end” bracket of $300+,” the report explains. “Industry participants noted that the actual selling price (ASP) of an Apple iPhone in India is $612, much higher than Samsung’s ASP of $173 and Micromax’s $86. Indeed, Apple’s sales in India are around 2 million, way short of its target of selling 10 million mobile phones in India by 2016-17,” it further explains. However, the report also goes on to say that Apple has stated that it considers India to be a big longer term opportunity for growth. Furthermore, improving 4G networks, declining data tariffs and free service by new entrant Jio is enticing a lot of consumers to upgrade to 4G smartphone will also work in Apple’s favour, the BofA report claims. Apple is already preparing its manufacturing facility in India and is reportedly expected to start trial assembly in Peenya near Bengaluru with Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron. tags Apple Apple iPhone Reliance Jio Apple News Samsung more from tech White House messaging app Confide not secure, says lawsuit Apr 21, 2017 11:31 IST WhatsApp admins beware: Offensive posts can land you in jail Apr 21, 2017 09:29 IST Not a Drop to Waste- A Water Day Infographic Partnered Feature Recommended for you Read more Apple enters self-driving cars race, gets California nod to test vehicles Apple’s Make in India project: iPhone-maker to start trial assembly in Bengaluru next month Read more Apple’s next gen iPhones to sport new screen technology to make reading, viewing better Apple may get no special sops for making in India: Report India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the report notes that Apple has recently hired John Fenwick former lead of Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, who headed up satellite engineering at Google. Both now allegedly report to Greg Duffy, the Dropcam cofounder who joined Apple in January. Speculation on Duffy’s hire earlier this year suggested that he was “likely to be leading a special project at Apple that is operating like a startup within the company” but no further details were available at the time as to what such a project would be; the two most recent hires, however, suggest that Apple is pursuing another entirely new line of research and development. Fenwick and Trela are leading experts in the demanding and expensive field of satellite design and operation, generally representing work in the areas of image collection and communications. Bloomberg notes a regulatory filing last year where Boeing outlined a plan to provide broadband access through over 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit, and according to a person familiar with the situation, the aerospace company has allegedly spoken with Apple about being involved in that project, but it’s unclear if that’s directly related to this new special project, or even if those talks will result in any kind of a deal. However, according to a blog post by satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar, industry insiders at the annual Satellite 2017 conference recently reported that Boeing’s project was in fact being funded by Apple. Unlike Google, Apple has traditionally shown little interest in becoming a telecommunications provider of any kind, however Farrar and other consultants in the satellite industry have suggested that Apple may be looking to make a mark in an entirely new area of satellite internet, which is expected to each $30 billion in revenue by 2025. Companies such as Boeing are exploring solutions to provide lower latency and faster speeds at lower costs than existing cellular systems, which could revolutionize wireless communications. However, as Farrar points out, there’s still no guarantee that Apple will be involved int he Boeing project, as it remains a high risk industry “littered with bankruptcies and other failures.” It seems equally likely that Apple may have hired the new executives for their expertise in unrelated areas, such as imaging capture systems for its mapping platforms. Despite Fenwick and Trela’s background, they’re reporting to a lead who has consumer product and imaging experience, suggesting that their expertise may have been brought on board for less far-reaching plans. As a whole, the new hardware team led by Duffy still reports to Dan Riccio, Apple’s SVP of Hardware Engineering, the department traditionally focused on developing the iPhone, iPad, and Mac hardware, as well as Apple’s augmented reality efforts.

John Fenwick, who led Google's spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering have left the company for a new hardware team at Apple which reports to Greg Duffy, co-founder of Dropcam. Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company's first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth's surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University. It's speculated that Apple could be looking to expand into satellite design and operation. One use for such technology would be a broadband service that could reach users who don't currently have Internet connectivity. It's also speculated that the executives could be working on a system to help Apple better collect mapping data, perhaps via the use of drones. Notably, rumors have suggested that Apple may be funding Boeing's V-band development work. Boeing has proposed a constellation of between 1,396 and 2,956 V-band satellites in 35-74 orbital planes at 1,200 km in altitude. The endeavor would create a global broadband system that would provide a wide range of advanced telecommunications services for commercial and governmental users.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile These leaked iPhone 8 schematics are a travesty if they’re real Image Source: Moe Slah, ConceptsiPhone Zach Epstein @zacharye April 19th, 2017 at 10:31 AM Share Tweet After three straight years with the same iPhone design, Apple is expected to finally shake things up a bit in 2017. In fact, the company may be shaking things up more than usual. In years past, “S” updates feature (almost) the exact same design as their predecessors. This year, however, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are rumored to switch to a new design that features a glass back to facilitate wireless charging. Then, of course, we have the iPhone 8, which is expected to be a bold reimagining of Apple’s iPhone design. Reports suggest that we can expect a sleek new “full-screen” design that does away with the home button and shrinks the bezels all the way around the new OLED display. But a new leak on Wednesday shows a troubling design detail that would be an absolute travesty if the leak is genuine. Don't Miss: The best thing about Samsung’s new Galaxy S8, aside from the design We published our Galaxy S8 review on Tuesday morning, and we absolutely adore Samsung’s new smartphone design. It’s simply stunning, there’s no doubt about it. The build quality of the phone is outstanding, the performance is impressive, and the design is the best the world has ever seen. But the design isn’t perfect, and there’s one issue that really annoyed us. The back of a smartphone is the worst possible place for a fingerprint scanner, and we explained why in our review. In a nutshell, it’s simply not natural. If you keep your phone in your pocket, your thumb is naturally positioned where the home button is as you slide your handset out of your pocket. Even if you typically carry your phone elsewhere, you’re always looking at the front of the device when you pick it up, so the fingerprint scanner should be on the front. If it’s on the back, you’re left feeling around the phone in an attempt to unlock it. Samsung compounded matters by placing the scanner off-center and far too high up the back of the phone, but anywhere on the back is bad news. That brings us to today’s new leak… The above schematic was posted on Twitter on Wednesday by Sonny Dickson. Dickson has a mixed track record and he neglects to link the source that first posted the image, but the schematics appear to be taken from a Foxconn factory where the new iPhone 8 will be produced. If they’re the real deal, we’re not happy at all. Apple has been working for years on technology that would allow the company to embed its Touch ID fingerprint scanner beneath the display of an iPhone. The iPhone 8 has been rumored to be the first model that will actually feature the next-gen sensor. But more recent rumors have suggested that Apple is running into manufacturing issues that would prevent it from coming anywhere close to meeting demand if it does indeed opt for an embedded Touch ID sensor. Some reports have said that Apple is sticking with its guns, and it will embed the sensor in the screen. As a result, the iPhone 8 might not launch until sometime in October or even November. Other reports have claimed that Apple is scrapping the idea though, and it will instead move its fingerprint reader to the back of the iPhone 8. This would be awful, if true, and the schematic above pours more fuel on that fire — an opening for a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner can clearly be seen beneath the Apple logo. It’s quite possible that this new schematic is fake, or that this is one of several designs Apple is toying with. Sadly, it’s also possible that this is the real deal, and that Apple plans to take a huge step backward with the iPhone 8 because it doesn’t want to wait another year before ditching the physical home button and shrinking those massive bezels.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Internal Documents Reveal Apple’s Self-Driving Car Technology By Tyler Lee on 04/21/2017 18:04 PDT Is Apple building their own self-driving car? We can’t say for sure if that is true, but what is true is Apple’s interest in the technology. Recently California’s DMV granted Apple approval to test self-driving cars on California’s roads, and now thanks to internal documents obtained by Business Insider, we are getting a glimpse at the technology behind Apple’s efforts. The documents obtained by Business Insider in question include “Development Platform Specific Training” as well as details about a self-driving car system titled “Apple Automated System”. The image above was part of the documents and describes how the setup includes the use of a Logitech wheel and pedals to actuate drive by wire. The document also talks about training drivers to test the system, which is mandated under California law, and it seems that drivers must pass seven tests before they can be considered fully trained. Each driver will be given two practice runs and three trials to pass each test which will be conducted on a private course. Now last we heard, Apple had given up on building their own car and could be choosing to focus on the software side of things instead. These documents and the permit does confirm that Apple is still interested in the tech, although exactly to what degree remains to be seen. After all many companies work on projects that don’t necessarily become a commercialized product, but we’ll just have to wait and see. Filed in Apple >Transportation.

Boeing laid out a plan to provide broadband internet access through over 1,000 low-earth orbiting satellites in a 2016 regulatory filing, and a source “familiar with the matter” told Bloomberg that Apple spoke with the aerospace company about coming an investor-partner in the project. Further, TMF Associates satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar wrote in a recent blog post that industry insiders said Boeing’s project was being funded by Apple at the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. Farrar noted that a Wall Street Journal article reported that Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025, showing the potential of the field. One of the major lures for tech companies like Apple, Google and Facebook to develop broadband internet is to tap into the large demographic of people who don’t yet have internet access, notes Bloomberg. Facebook has long espoused this goal. The report also states that Apple might be putting its satellite experts to work on something else closely related — such as drones or near space technology like high bandwidth radio transceivers or high-altitude balloons. Whatever it is, however, likely has its home in the sky.

Noodlecake Studios is a small indie game studio proudly based in Saskatchewan’s biggest city since 2011. Apple recently recognized the company as one of Canada’s top game makers in the newly minted “made in Canada” section of the App Store. “To be profiled by a company like Apple as one of the top makers in Canada, the first one, is you know pretty humbling and we’re very excited to see where it can lead, because you never know,” said Ryan Holowaty, Noodlecake’s vice president of business. The company acknowledges that it’s based in an unlikely city. On its website, Noodlecake describes Saskatoon as “a.k.a. the middle of nowhere Canada” and pokes fun at the fact it chose to plant roots in a “big patch of barren land in the middle of the country” over Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver. But its headquarters hasn’t held Noodlecake back. The studio started in its founder’s kitchen and had early success with games like Stickman Golf. The app has since had several sequels, was named one of the best apps of 2013 and has been translated into more than 10 languages. In six years, Noodlecake has designed hundreds of mobile games for both Android and Apple devices. The company now employs 15 game developers and also makes third-party video games comes to life. In a roundabout way, Noodlecake has become an ambassador of sorts for Saskatchewan. “If we go to San Francisco to a conference and people ask where we’re from and we say Saskatchewan, and people are like, ‘Where is that?’ They have no idea where it is,” said CEO Jordan Schidlowsky. “I don’t think many people know that stuff like this is happening in Saskatoon or Saskatchewan, so it is cool to shed light on the tech industry.” With files from CTV Saskatoon Related Stories Startups in Japan getting ample cash but lack innovators 'Pokemon Go' or no?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Shutterstock Not everyone is a fan of Apple’s recycling program Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 20th, 2017 at 9:00 PM Share Tweet Perhaps more so than any other large-scale tech company, Apple prides itself for its commitment to the environment and for its ongoing efforts to “leave the world better than we found it.” Earlier this week, with Earth Day on the horizon, Apple released its 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report and signaled its plan to eventually stop mining the earth for materials. Don't Miss: It’s official: Everyone hates the iPhone 8 design that just leaked “It sounds crazy, but we’re working on it,” Apple’s report reads in part. “We’re going deeper to pioneer a closed-loop supply chain, where products are made using only renewable resources or recycled material to reduce the need to mine materials from the earth. That means continuing to invest in ways to recover materials from our products—like Liam, our line of disassembly robots—and encouraging our customers to return products through Apple Renew, our recycling program.” Incidentally, Apple introduced its Liam robot last year when it rolled out the iPhone SE, a video of which can be seen below. Now recycling old products is a great way to harvest materials, but some folks are claiming that the rules governing what Apple’s recycling partners can and can’t do with old machines could be far more environmentally friendly. According to a report from Vice, Apple’s recycling partners are subject to contracts which prevent them from reusing, reselling or harvesting parts from older iPhones and MacBooks. Instead, piles of old Apple products are shredded into tiny sized pieces whereupon similar metals are grouped together and, per Apple, are then used “for production stock in new products.” It’s arguably a bit nit-picky, but some folks feel that Apple can do better in this regard. Jason Koebler of Vice writes: Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, notes that recycling “should be a last option” because unrecyclable rare earth metals are completely lost and melted down commodities are less valuable and of generally of a lower quality than freshly mined ones. Repair and reuse are much better ways to extend the value of the original mined materials. To be clear, Apple’s practices are often against the wishes of the recycling companies themselves, who don’t like to shred products that are still valuable. In a weird twist of fate, I visited ECS Refining before I knew that it did recycling for Apple. While I was there, I watched workers crowbar and crack open recent-model MacBook Pro Retinas—worth hundreds of dollars even when they’re completely broken—to be scrapped into their base materials. I’m not sure it’s fair to call Apple out in this regard but it’s an interesting point of view to consider nonetheless. The main problem with this critique, I think, is that it’s easy to nitpick about what Apple can do better while completely ignoring the industry-leading measures Apple has made with respect to environmental responsibility over the last few years.

Amazon Music Unlimited is Amazon's take on a subscription music streaming service. When you think about it, picking a music streaming service is no easy task. Between Apple Music, Pandora, Google Play Music, Spotify, and about a hundred other similar services, it's genuinely difficult to sort through the cruft and find something that's worth sticking with. If you happen to be in that sorting-through-the-cruft stage, you might want to give Amazon Music Unlimited a go — the company's take on a subscription music streaming service is, at the very least, on par with most other offerings. To get a better idea of what Amazon Music Unlimited offers, you can peruse our FAQ! OK, at the very base level, what is it? Amazon Music Unlimited is a subscription-based music streaming service that'll run you anywhere between $3.99 and $14.99 a month (more on that later). It's Amazon's Apple Music. It's Amazon's Spotify. It's Amazon's Google Play Music … you get the picture. There are — broadly speaking — two types of music streaming services: radio and on-demand. The free version of Pandora is an example of the radio-style music streaming service; you choose a song, artist, title, or genre to start with and the service builds a playlist inspired by your choice. Skipping songs is typically limited and ads usually play between tracks. Limited skips and advertisements are the price to pay for a free music streaming service. Amazon Music Unlimited is the other type of streaming service, the on-demand type. When you subscribe to Music Unlimited, you get access to a catalog of tens of millions of songs that you can stream and download without ads and with as many hits of the next button as your heart desires. Nice! In what countries is it available? At last count, Amazon Music Unlimited was available in four countries: Austria, Germany, the United States, and the U.K. Got it. Next question: How big is the library? Amazon says there are "tens of millions" of songs available in the Amazon Music Unlimited library and sadly that's as specific as they get. See, here's the thing about most modern streaming music services: Deep down inside, they're all very similar. Most streaming music companies are able to get the same or similar deals for music distribution, so the size of the music library is bound to be pretty consistent across the industry. Because of these similarities, companies aren't motivated to be too detailed about specs unless they have a spec that sets them apart. Amazon says Music Unlimited has "tens of millions" of songs, Spotify says it offers "over 30 million tracks" — so who has more? 🤷‍♀️ You can't be sure (and that's the idea). What devices does it support? ALL THE DEVICES! Music Unlimited is available on your iOS (or Android) devices, your Mac (or your PC), your Fire TV, Apple CarPlay, and Alexa devices like the Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Tap. The only device it's not available on is your Apple TV. Sigh. Amazon Music on iOS - Free - Download Now Amazon Music on macOS - Free - Download Now Amazon Music on the web - Free - Check it out Does it offer student and family rates? No and yes, respectively. Amazon Music Unlimited offers a six-member family plan, but there's no special rate for students. But enough about family and student rates! Amazon Music Unlimited has one of the most interesting pricing models I've seen in a music streaming service. So interesting, in fact, that I'm going to go ahead and lay out all the details in a handy chart for you! Plan Prime Member Pricing (per month) Non-Prime Pricing (per month) Echo $3.99 $3.99 Individual $7.99 $9.99 Family $14.99 $14.99 Understanding Amazon Music Unlimited plans Music Unlimited Echo Plan: This plan is exclusive to owners of an Amazon Echo, Dot, or Tap. For $3.99 a month, users can stream from the full Amazon Music Unlimited library (tens of millions of songs) on-demand and ad-free. The only catch is it's exclusive to your Echo device — your subscription won't grant you access to Amazon Music Unlimited on the web or in the app. Music Unlimited Individual Plan: This plan works on all your devices. For $7.99 a month for Amazon Prime members and $9.99 a month for non-Prime members, you get access to tens of millions of songs on the web, in the app, and on any of your Echo devices. Music Unlimited Family Plan: This plan also works on all your devices. For $14.99 a month for both Amazon Prime members and non-Prime members, you and up to six family members get access to tens of millions of songs on the web, in the app, and on any of your Echo devices. I should also mention there's an entirely separate Prime Music service that's exclusive to Amazon Prime members. You get access to over 2 million songs and can listen on-demand and ad-free. This service is free for anyone who subscribes to Amazon Prime and it's available for use on your Amazon Echo. How does it compare to other music streaming services? It's a whole lot like other music streaming services but there are a few differences. And y'know, I had so much fun making that last chart I thought it'd be great to build another one. Here's a glimpse at how Music Unlimited compares to other popular streaming services! Spotify Apple Music Google Play Music Amazon Prime Music Pandora Free trial period 30 days 3 months 30 days 30 days (with Prime membership) 30 days for Premium, 7 days for Plus Price $9.99/month ($14.99 for family up to 6 people) $9.99/month ($14.99 for family up to 6 people) $9.99 ($14.99 for family up to 6 people) Comes with Prime membership ($99/year), $7.99/month for Unlimited Pandora Premium: $4.99/month, $54.89/year Pandora Plus: $9.99/month, $109.89/year Library size ~ 30 million songs ~ 40 million songs ~ 40 million songs ~ 2 million (may differ depending on location), ~ 40 million (Unlimited) ~ 40 million Number of countries supported Over 60 Over 110 Over 60 See Amazon Australia, New Zealand, U.S.A.

Otherwise, they should at least allow for two people to stream from the plan at the same time for no additional cost. 0 3 days ago Reply RhymingDesigner Hey Mikah, good article. I especially liked your charts. I've been a Spotify paid member for three years and am happy – but might be persuaded to switch someday. One thing I like about Spotify is that I can download 3,333 songs per device with a three-device maximum. You say that offline downloading is part of the Amazon package, but don't give specifics. Also, I know Spotify has a free trial, but what about AMU? I'm going to head on over to Amazon now for more info. 0 3 days ago Reply Paul5555p I've been using my free trial on Apple Music and its almost at its end (April 26). I will not be using it as a paid subscriber, just didn't seem to be a good fit for me. At the same time I've been using Amazon Music with my Prime membership and liking it very much, it does everything I want and seems to work great. I have had some, well several issues with Apple Music and the Siri interface, I ask Siri to play some things and no response or the wrong response. Amazon lets me tell it music I don't like and it won't play it or offer it up as a suggestion, very handy. For now its Amazon Music for me. 0 3 days ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Photo / Chris Ratcliffe After revolutionizing phones, Apple is testing self-driving cars and exploring augmented reality. Recent hires suggest the company is now also looking to the skies. The iPhone maker has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, according to people familiar with the matter. John Fenwick, who led Google's spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering, left Alphabet's Google for Apple in recent weeks, the people said. They report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam, who joined Apple earlier this year, the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about Apple's private plans. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, as did Google. Fenwick, Trela and Duffy didn't respond to requests for comment. With the recruits, Apple is bringing into its ranks two experts in the demanding, expensive field of satellite design and operation. At the moment, these endeavors typically fall into two fields: satellites for collecting images and those for communications. In a regulatory filing last year, Boeing detailed a plan to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It's unclear if those talks will result in a deal. At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insiders said Boeing's project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates, wrote in a recent blog. Continued below. Related Content Brian Gaynor: No reason to go back to the bad old days 60-plus, swindled and flat broke Imposing GST on low-value imports doesn't level the playing field A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. "It's not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation," Farrar wrote, noting a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025. A lure for technology companies like Apple, Google and Facebook is to connect billions of people who don't have internet access yet. The broadband services being explored by Boeing and others would feature low latency and faster speeds than existing cellular systems. "You have a new wave of enthusiastic people who aren't inhibited by the hard knocks of the past," said Roger Rusch, who heads satellite consulting firm TelAstra. Still, TMF's Farrar said there's no guarantee Apple will get involved in the Boeing project. The satellite industry is littered with bankruptcies and other failures. Satellite telephone company Iridium filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999, and Teledesic abandoned its "internet from the sky" plan more than a decade ago. It's not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation. Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Indeed, Apple may have hired the Google executives for something other than satellite work. It's already trying to use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans. And in 2015, it acquired Aether Industries, which develops near-space technology such as high bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. Duffy, Fenwick and Trela's new boss, has mostly consumer product experience from Dropcam. It's internet-connected security camera stored images and video of homes and sent alerts to a smartphone app. Alphabet's Nest acquired the business in 2014. After a tumultuous stint there, Duffy joined Apple to form a new team reporting Dan Riccio, who oversees hardware teams for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple's augmented reality efforts, the people familiar with the matter said. Fenwick and Trela joined Alphabet's Google in 2014 when the search giant acquired Skybox Imaging, their satellite-imaging startup, for $500 million. However, this year Google sold the renamed business, Terra Bella, to startup Planet Labs, a one-time Skybox rival. Google also planned to invest about $1 billion in an internal satellite internet initiative run by industry veteran Greg Wyler, however Wyler left to start satellite communications firm OneWeb, and Google ended up investing $1 billion in SpaceX. Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company's first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth's surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University.

I know that it's not very likely that Apple TV is a popular product among our readers, but for those that did make use of it the inconvenience after the recent 10.2 update must have been a bit annoying. For those out of the loop, it further locked down AirPlay by using a new pairing process, likely intended to restrict use of the protocol to Apple products. Thankfully for those that mix and match ecosystems, doubleTwist was able to work some magic on that proprietary mess and get things working again. Their full statement is available below. Back in May 2011, we were the first to bring AirPlay music streaming to Android, helping hundreds of thousands of Android users listen to their favorite tunes through their Apple TV and other AirPlay-compatible devices. Fast forward to April 2017 and Apple, in a surprising and anachronistic move, released a 4th generation Apple TV firmware update (tvOS 10.2) that blocked 3rd party apps from supporting AirPlay by requiring a proprietary pairing process conveniently restricted to Apple apps and devices. Yep, Apple wants you to switch to an iPhone if you happen to own an Apple TV! But users today demand interoperability between their devices. Modern households are diverse ecosystems of connected devices, full of iPhones, Android phones, smart TVs and a cacophony of gadgets. So we went ahead and added support for Apple’s new pairing process in the latest doubleTwist Pro release because we believe the era of walled gardens is long gone. The AirPlay functionality is also live for CloudPlayer so you can stream your cloud music to your Apple TV. Happy listening! If you mix and match things to such a degree that you need to side-load the app, APKMirror's got your back.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Wearables Image Source: iDropNews Apple is already using a screen technology that’s better than OLED, report says Chris Smith @chris_writes April 20th, 2017 at 6:04 PM Share Tweet Apple is widely expected to launch an OLED iPhone this year, which would be a first for the iPhone since its introduction 10 years ago. But a new report from Korea suggests that Apple is already working on a new screen technology that might debut with the Apple Watch Series 3 later this year. The next-gen wearable will have a new type of display, one that could then be used on future iPhone models, and potentially impact the bottom line of various Apple suppliers. Don't Miss: It’s official: Everyone hates the iPhone 8 design that just leaked According to Business Korea, the Apple Watch Series 3 will have a micro-LED display rather than an OLED screen as its predecessors. If micro-LED sounds familiar that’s because a flurry of reports in late 2015 and early 2016 claimed that an Apple team is working on this particular technology in a secret lab in Taiwan. Micro-LED screens should be smaller than alternatives, and more energy-efficient. Business Korea notes that micro-LED displays would also be thinner and lighter than OLED or LCD screens. LG, the exclusive provider of OLED screens for the Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 is expected to take a financial hit to the tune of over $200 million when Apple makes the switch from OLED to micro-LED. The report says that Apple will actually begin mass production of micro-LED for the next Apple Watch in Taiwan at the end of the year. The worry here is that once the technology is further perfected, Apple might fully make the jump from OLED to micro-LED. The report says that Samsung and LG would lose around $1 billion a year should they lose Apple’s business. It’s not clear when Apple would be ready to use micro-LED display tech in bigger devices like the iPhone. The report says that Apple is likely to use OLED displays for the iPhone 9 that will be launched next year, but these panels would be manufactured by Chinese company BOE. Even in such a case, South Korean suppliers would lose some of Apple’s business. Multiple reports in the past years have detailed the efforts of various display makers, including Samsung, LG, Japan Display, BOE, and others to win Apple’s OLED display orders. Currently, Samsung is in an advantageous position, being the exclusive supplier of the iPhone 8’s OLED screen. Apple is likely looking to add more vendors to the mix, to make sure it has enough stock on hand, and that it can keep driving costs downwards.

Through a public records request, Business Insider was able to obtain training documents detailing Apple’s plans to test self-driving car technology. As the documents show, Apple has created an “Automated System” for self-driving cars and is gearing up to put staffers through a rigorous training program. Unlike many of Google and Waymo’s test vehicles, the Apple car includes a steering wheel and pedals. During testing, the system is controlled electronically, but drivers must be ready to take back control of the vehicle. “The development platform is capable of sending electronic commands for steering, accelerating, and decelerating and may carry out portions of the dynamic driving task,” an Apple official wrote on a government form. If the safety “driver” presses the brake or grabs the Logitech steering wheel, autonomous driving mode will be disengaged. However, stepping down on the accelerator pedal won’t override the drive-by-wire system. According to the documents, Apple testers must pass seven tests before they can complete their training. After two practice runs, they get three trials to pass each evaluation. Unsurprisingly, Apple remains tight-lipped on its plans. Rumors have persisted for years that it was creating its own self-driving car under Project Titan, although it’s possible that Apple is now focusing its efforts just on the technology required for autonomous vehicles.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Qualcomm's Sales Decline for Baseband Modems for the iPhone 8 will hurt their Bottom Line | Main April 21, 2017 Apple may be Backing Boeing's Low-Earth Satellite Constellation Project that would Compete with Google, SpaceX & Others In a new report this afternoon we learn that at the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insider Tim Farrar said Boeing's low-earth satellite project was being funded by Apple. Tim Farrar is a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates. The reason that this speculation may have some meat on its bones is because Apple has recruited a pair of Google satellite executives for a new hardwared team. Google is backing the OneWeb project. Whether it's another dream chasing team like Apple's Project Titan for electric cars is unknown at this time, but Apple has to dream big if they want to tap into possible emerging markets. Bloomberg's authors try to stitch together a plausible scenario and you could read their full story here.   Boeing's application for a license from the Federal Communications Commission to launch and operate a network of 1,396 satellites was actually reported on last June. Boeing want's to be able to compete with SpaceX (Elon Musk) and OneWeb (backed by Google) in a race to build constellations for broadband Internet access. The catch is that Boeing stated that the project would launch in six years after obtaining approval from the Commission. So this isn't a project 'just around the corner' and why speculating too far ahead is close to useless.   In total, Boeing says that they would eventually have 2,956 satellites designed to provide Internet and communications services for commercial and governent users around the globe.   According to the LA Times report, Boeing was still working out whether it will actually provide the service or just make the satellites and get them into orbit, and where the satellites will be built.   Marco Caceres, senior space analyst for the Teal Group, said at the time that the new plans for satellite constellations are driven by the potential of increased access to and new uses of the Internet. 'Everybody's trying to propose these massive constellations and be the first one to get it up there and take advantage of creating a whole new market. No one wants to be left behind."   So we can understand that Apple has to get their head around how they can craft hardware and services to take advantage of such a new satellite based Internet service.   While this kind of venture has been dreamed up before and failed, this next generation of satelites could make it economically feasible. A secondary L.A. Times report posted in December 2016 noted that "Launching one of these smaller satellites can cost a fraction of the price for a larger, school-bus-sized satellite. These new satellites will largely be mass-produced.     If this latest wave of satellite networks gets off the ground, it could pose a challenge to a $224.6-billion industry currently dominated by telecom and cable companies with their miles of fiber optic and copper wires.   Taylor Palmer, industry analyst at market research firm IBISWorld stated in the 2016 report that satellilte networks are "going to shake up how these operators are controlling different regions, and it's going to allow the consumer a little more of an option."   If Apple still has any dreams of a true TV challenging service that could bypass the cable networks, satellite networks would be the way to go.   Once Boeing entered the market, their possible future competitors attempted to point to the flaws of their proposed system. FierceWireless posted a report on this in November 2016 titled "Boeing responds to 'errors' and 'flawed assumptions' about its proposed satellite system in 37/39 GHz band."   Who were some of these Boeing competitors? Interestingly enough, they're also Apple competitors, Samsung and Nokia. So would it be in Apple's interest to fund Boeing's project and prepare a backup business plan for the next-wave of the internet? Yes of course.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Apple Apple’s most powerful computer in years will be in stores by Christmas Chris Smith @chris_writes April 18th, 2017 at 7:22 PM Share Tweet In a rare move a few weeks ago, Apple confirmed  that it’s working on new Mac desktops, including a revamped Mac Pro and iMacs that will also target “pro” users. A new report from Asia says that Apple is looking to launch its 2017 iMacs in the second half of the year, with the high-end Mac set to hit stores in time for Christmas. Don't Miss: Apple is having trouble getting the iPhone 8’s signature feature to actually work Apple will begin production of its new iMac PCs in May, Digitimes learned from Taiwan-based supply chain makers familiar with the plans. Quanta Computers is expected to manufacture both iMac versions this year, including the regular and the high-end model. The latter will probably be the most exciting version of the 2017 iMac line, a “server-grade” iMac targeting high-end buyers. Apple is expected to launch 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMacs in the third quarter of the year, the report notes, to catch up with the holiday shopping season. The iMac Pro will feature Intel’s Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor, 16GB to 64GB of ECC RAM, and up to 2TB of NVMe SSD storage. On top of that, the desktop will pack the latest discrete graphics card, although it’s unclear what that means. Intel’s chip is not released yet, MacRumors explains. As for that “ECC RAM,” that’s error correcting memory, the kind that can detect and correct data corruption. A recent report from Pike’s Universum said a few days ago that the 2017 iMac is set for a late October launch and mentioned the same set of specs for the high-end model. The report also said the iMac might feature AMD graphics to support VR and pro apps, as well as Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C connectivity. Finally, a new keyboard is also in the works, according to the source. Recent patent discoveries indicated Apple is working on Touch Bar enabled standalone keyboards for the iMac. Apple is also reportedly working on a new 8K display for the next-gen Mac Pro, and a next-gen Mac mini.

For Android users that might own an Apple TV that could have been a bit of a downer. Fret not, though. Much as doubleTwist was the first to bring AirPlay streaming to Android, they're one of the first to bring it back. I know that it's not very likely that Apple TV is a popular product among our readers, but for those that did make use of it the inconvenience after the recent 10.2 update must have been a bit annoying. For those out of the loop, it further locked down AirPlay by using a new pairing process, likely intended to restrict use of the protocol to Apple products. Thankfully for those that mix and match ecosystems, doubleTwist was able to work some magic on that proprietary mess and get things working again. Their full statement is available below. Back in May 2011, we were the first to bring AirPlay music streaming to Android, helping hundreds of thousands of Android users listen to their favorite tunes through their Apple TV and other AirPlay-compatible devices. Fast forward to April 2017 and Apple, in a surprising and anachronistic move, released a 4th generation Apple TV firmware update (tvOS 10.2) that blocked 3rd party apps from supporting AirPlay by requiring a proprietary pairing process conveniently restricted to Apple apps and devices. Yep, Apple wants you to switch to an iPhone if you happen to own an Apple TV! But users today demand interoperability between their devices. Modern households are diverse ecosystems of connected devices, full of iPhones, Android phones, smart TVs and a cacophony of gadgets. So we went ahead and added support for Apple’s new pairing process in the latest doubleTwist Pro release because we believe the era of walled gardens is long gone. The AirPlay functionality is also live for CloudPlayer so you can stream your cloud music to your Apple TV. Happy listening! If you mix and match things to such a degree that you need to side-load the app, APKMirror's got your back.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Woman airlifted, man hospitalized after crash on Hwy 18 Friday Apr 21, 2017 at 3:19 PM Apr 21, 2017 at 11:35 PM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — A woman suffered major injuries and was airlifted to a trauma center following a crash on Highway 18 Friday afternoon, authorities said. Authorities responded to reports of a major-injury crash involving two vehicles on Highway 18 and Rimrock Road at 1:40 p.m. Friday. A man also suffered injuries due to the crash, Apple Valley Fire Protection District Chief Sid Hultquist said. The exact circumstances of the crash are still unclear, but Hultquist said the woman was headed west on Highway 18 in a Nissan Sentra while the man was headed east on Highway 18 driving a white Ford Flex. “It appeared as though the Flex was making a left turn to go south and collided with the Nissan Sentra,” Hultquist said. “The collision forced the Sentra into a light pole across the road.” The woman suffered major leg injuries and was airlifted to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center. The man also suffered leg injuries, though not as severe, Hulquist said, and was taken to St. Joseph Health, St. Mary for treatment. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials shut down the eastbound lanes of Highway 18 from Tao Road to Rancherias Road following the incident, and traffic was diverted onto Outer Highway 18, Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station Sgt. Jeff Allison said. The closure was lifted just after 2:30 p.m. The cause of the crash remains under investigation by the Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station.

Now they’re committing to stop using mined metals altogether. It’s a big leap to make, going from conflict-free to 100% recycled. This isn’t something Apple is going to make happen overnight, of course. It’s a long-term goal and one that’s going to take a considerable amount of planning to make a reality. To hear that Apple wants to shift entirely to sustainable sources isn’t a surprise. They’ve been moving in a more sustainable direction for years, and we’ve seen proof in a couple of different places. iFixit’s repairability scores are one. A few years ago, Apple products were notoriously difficult to repair. That’s still the case with some (the iPad Air 2, for example), but others have gotten much easier to disassemble and re-assemble. Another indicator is the environmental reports put out by Greenpeace. Again, Apple used to come out on the bottom. Now they’re among the best — if not the best. They’ve come out on top three years in a row now. Curiously, that’s even with a recycling program that leaves a lot to be desired. Vice has published a report that shows a few glaring problems. For one, only a very small percentage of the devices Apple is recycling are Apple devices. They’re recycling a lot of electronics, yes, but Vice found the bulk of the weight processed to be old, heavy things like televisions, VCRs, printers, and monitors. On top of that, Vice learned through FOI requests in several states that Apple requires its recycling partners to shred any Apple devices they process. That’s a big problem since many of those devices contain parts that are still perfectly good and could be harvested and used to repair others.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Apple may be funding Boeing’s satellite system for global broadband coverage Christian Zibreg on April 21, 2017 2 Today’s report from Bloomberg on Apple’s latest high-profile hirings includes a passage that sheds light on Boeing’s alleged talks with Apple regarding a broadband satellite service. According to Boeing’s regulatory filing, the aerospace giant is planning to blanket the Earth with more than a thousand satellites providing fast Internet coverage throughout the United States and internationally. According to authors Mark Gurman and Mark Bergen, Boeing has talked with Apple about investing in or partnering on the project. It’s unclear from the report if those talks might result in a deal. However, industry consultant Tim Farrar recently quoted an insider who unequivocally stated that, yes, Boeing’s project is indeed being funded by Apple. Of note, Boeing’s former CEO and Corporate President, James Bell, joined Apple’s Board of Directors in October 2015. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Internet from the sky? What Boeing is basically proposing here is a NGSO (non-geostationary satellite orbit constellations) low-earth orbit satellite system with the aim of providing better-than-cellular broadband coverage throughout the United States and internationally. To that extent, Boeing asked the FCC to consider the allocation and authorization of additional uplink spectrum in the bands 50.4-51.4 GHz and 51.4-52.4 GHz so that it could create a full five gigahertz of paired spectrum for V-band operations. Here’s an excerpt from the filing (emphasis mine): This new uplink spectrum will help create a five gigahertz block of uplink spectrum that, paired with fixed satellite service downlink spectrum in the 37.5-42.5 GHz band, will enable very high data-rate V-band satellite broadband services that will be deployed in the near future. The system would feature low latency and faster speeds than existing cellular systems, bringing communications service to all users at the same cost regardless of location. There are currently four gigahertz of allocated satellite uplink spectrum in USA: 47.2-50.2 GHz: Not yet designated for fixed satellite service use. 50.4-51.4 GHz: Shared between NASA/military and commercial entities, with co-primary allocations for fixed, fixed satellite, mobile and MSS services. 51.4-52.4 GHz: Currently allocated for terrestrial fixed and mobile wireless services. The 50.4-51.4 GHz and 51.4-52.4 GHz bands are well-suited for satellite use because they are not being used by terrestrial wireless, at least not in the United States. Boeing explains that millimeter wave technology and phased arrays forming numerous small transmission and receive beams allow fixed satellite service systems to re-use individual frequencies many times within the beams of a given satellite transponder. Potentially lucrative business Nearly 100 million Americans, many in rural and remote areas, lack access to broadband. More than 23 million American in rural areas have access to broadband Internet with speeds lower than 25 MB down and 3 MB up. And when it comes to the baseline 25 Mbps downstream service, three out of four Americans homes are served by a single provider or none at all. The cost of deploying terrestrial broadband remains extremely high so the opportunity exists to bring ubiquitous satellite Internet access to those areas that remain underserved. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025. Boeing’s filing sums it up nicely: By bringing comparable Internet speeds, performance and prices to Americans regardless of where they live, satellite broadband systems also have the potential to create new national broadband competitors and re-invigorate the United States telecommunications marketplace. Could Apple be funding Boeing’s satellite constellation so that it could sell its own high-speed telecommunications and data services to iPhone owners? Only time will tell. But we do know: Apple is starting a whole new hardware team for which it hired two Google executives who specialize in satellites for collecting images and those for communications.

Tech News | 21 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (0) Apple Releases 10th Annual Environmental Responsibility Report by Michael E. Cohen Over a decade ago, Apple established a set of environmental health and safety policies to not only “Meet or exceed all applicable environmental, health and safety requirements,” but also, “Where laws and regulations do not provide adequate controls… adopt… standards to protect human health and the environment.” Those words, by the way, can be found in Appendix D of Apple’s 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report, issued this week. The 56-page PDF report looks very much like an Apple product: a clean, attractively spare document featuring lots of white space, beautiful photos, and a not inconsiderable amount of data packed inside. Unlike with many Apple products, while this year’s report reveals what Apple has most recently accomplished, pundits won’t need to speculate where Apple plans to go in the future. That’s because Apple has explicitly said where it plans to go, with its environmental intentions coming in the form of “bold questions” asked by Apple’s Lisa Jackson, Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, in the report’s opening statement: “Can we power a global business with the sun, wind, and water?” “Can we get 100 percent of our supply chain to move to 100 percent renewable energy?” “Can we one day stop mining the earth altogether?” “Can we use only 100 percent recycled and responsibly sourced paper in our packaging?” “Can we improve on the world’s best materials?” Of course, it’s in any company’s interest to post softball questions in such a progress report, but Apple does at least try to answer them honestly, if the three third-party assurance and review statements in Appendix C of the report can be trusted. On powering a global business with sun, wind, and water, Apple reports that 96 percent of the electricity that powers its global facilities comes from renewable resources, and that its carbon footprint was 29.5 million metric tons for fiscal 2016, down from 38.4 million metric tons the year before. Moreover, the company says that 100 percent of the power it consumes in the United States for data centers already comes from renewable sources. As for its supply chain moving completely to renewable resources, Apple reports that, between Apple-initiated energy audits and training, “efficiency improvements made by suppliers avoided more than 150,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.” The company has installed “485 megawatts of wind and solar projects across six provinces of China” and plans to deliver 2 gigawatts of clean power in China alone by 2020, and 4 gigawatts of such power worldwide. How about reducing its reliance on mining? Apple hasn’t been as successful at that but reports that it is increasing the use of recyclable materials like aluminum and tin (100 percent of the solder on the iPhone 6 main logic board comes from recycled tin). Results from Liam, Apple’s research and development project on disassembly technologies, are helping to increase the yield of recyclable materials from its products. When it comes to packaging materials, Apple reports that in fiscal 2016 it “used 131,000 metric tons of fiber, of which 62 percent was recycled, 38 percent was virgin fiber from responsibly managed sources, and less than 1 percent was virgin fiber that did not comply with our sustainable fiber specification.” Apple is also stepping up partnerships with groups like the Conservation Fund and the World Wildlife Fund to increase the number of acres of sustainable forest from which it obtains such fiber. Finally, Apple has invested heavily in environmental testing to reduce the amount of toxic materials in its products. Apple’s Cupertino Environmental Testing Lab, which uses plasma mask spectroscopy and ion, liquid, and gas chromatography among other tools and techniques to identify toxic materials, has grown twenty-fold since its establishment in 2006. The company even manufactures artificial sweat so it can measure the amount of nickel leaching from Apple Watch cases to help reduce exposure to customers who are allergic to nickel (Apple has created a video explaining why it makes its artificial sweat). Other toxic materials that Apple has eliminated from its products include beryllium, mercury, PVC and phthalates, arsenic, and lead. To be sure, this report is designed to show Apple’s efforts in the best possible light. Moreover, no manufacturer that operates at Apple’s scale can avoid causing some environmental degradation. Nonetheless, at a time when national and world leaders seem to have become less concerned with global environmental concerns, it is heartening to see a corporation of Apple’s size and influence make environmental protection a fundamental — and well-funded — corporate goal.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Kerryman and New York construction tycoon Kevin O’Sullivan is behind the project and says it “will put Cork on an international map, and bring jobs to the city”. O’Sullivan and his brother left the town of Ballinskelligs on the Wild Atlantic Way in 1986 and since then have been involved in numerous high profile projects in the Big Apple; his firm Times Square Construction have overseen renovations to Grand Central, built the 9/11 memorial and Apple’s flagship store on 5th Av.

Minister for Housing Simon Coveney (and potentially Ireland’s next Prime Minister) cautiously welcomed the plan; the ambitious nature of the proposal “will blow people away, they will create a real ‘wow’ factor and it will prove a real draw to the city and a catalyst and a center piece for dockland development,” he said. However, he added, the final go ahead would depend on an Environmental Impact Statement and planning permission which would give city residents the right to object. H/T: IrishAmerica.com.

Instagram user bro.king released some renders of the iPhone 8 that are based on previously leaked schematics. iPhone 8 Renders Reveal What It Looks Like The iPhone 8 renders only show what the sides and the back are going to look like. Based on the schematics, the aluminum frame takes after the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 6. There are provisions for the usual buttons (the volume rocker and Sleep/Wake button), the ring/silent switch, and the SIM card. At the bottom are a Lightning port and two speaker grilles, while at the top there are two little holes. And as expected, there’s no cutout for the 3.5mm headphone jack. 3D model of iPhone 8 casing based on likely fake schematics depicts rear Touch ID https://t.co/MzZ8QhNsfc pic.twitter.com/0CsPP1gEtA — iDownloadBlog (@iDownloadBlog) April 21, 2017 At the back, there are two interesting cutouts that can be seen aside from the one for the Apple logo. The camera slot hints a vertical dual-camera set-up, while the circular hole beneath the logo is presumably for the Touch ID. According to MacRumors, these iPhone 8 renders show what consumers can expect to see if the technology that can embed the Touch ID sensor on the screen doesn’t make it to the launch version. Like Samsung, Apple is going to put the fingerprint scanner at the back so that the physical home button can be removed. Another component of the iPhone 8 design is the tapered antenna lines. The iPhone 6 and 6s had these at the top and bottom, running across the back. The iPhone 7 made the lines more aesthetically pleasing by putting them at the curved edges. But seeing that the iPhone 8 will likely have a boxy chassis, the antenna lines will have nowhere to go. The renders show that they will be reduced to short lines at the top and bottom part of the phone’s sides. iPhone 8 To Have Infinity Display [Image by Jason Kempin/Getty Images] Putting the Touch ID at the rear means that fans can expect a Galaxy S8-esque design. The removal of the physical home button will allow the screen to take up most of the front of the iPhone 8. With a curved OLED screen and almost no bezels, we would be seeing Apple’s version of Samsung’s Infinity Display. There are mixed reactions about this. Some don’t like the extra cutout at the back at all, which would disrupt the clean look. There are suggestions that Apple could utilize the Apple logo instead to maintain a simple rear design (that would also be a neat feature), but it’s best not to get our hopes high on this. Unfortunately, that’s all the leaked schematics had to show. But piecing it together with a previous leak that shows what the front side could look like, we have a pretty good picture of the iPhone 8. Here we go #iphone8 #iphonex or #iphoneedition pic.twitter.com/kxDDOKZ6XM — KK Sneak Leaks (@kksneakleaks) April 17, 2017 iPhone 8 Specs And Release Date The 10th anniversary iPhone, also dubbed the iPhone Edition, will be bigger at 5.8 inches, ValueWalk reports. It is almost confirmed to have a curved display, but it is unknown if the Cupertino-based company will stick to mild curves or follow the Edge trend. Under the hood, the iPhone 8 will be powered by a smaller and faster 10-nanometer chip. The RAM is unknown for now, while the internal storage options will likely be the same. Although the iPhone 8 will be sold alongside the successors to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, it will be released much later. The two are expected to be unveiled in October, but the iPhone Edition will arrive just in time for the holidays. This is apparently due to some difficulties in the 3D imaging technology and some technical hurdles of putting the Touch ID sensor below the screen. As more and more details surface about the iPhone 8, consumers can’t help but get excited. It’s looking like Apple is back to innovating instead of doing the same thing over and over again.

Login Search Qualcomm Reports A Strong Q2'17: Is Confident About The Future Of Its Licensing Business April 21, 2017, 03:19:16 PM EDT By Trefis Team, Trefis Shutterstock photo Qualcomm ( QCOM ) reported a strong Q2'17 on April 19th, with both non-GAAP revenue and EPS above analyst expectations. The company saw healthy year-on-year growth across all reported segments, driven by solid MSM chipset demand and strong growth in the automotive, networking, and IoT area. Despite the various licensee disputes, Qualcomm witnessed a strong quarter for its licensing business on account of the positive effect of licensing progress in China, strong 3G, 4G demand, and a focus on costs. The company estimates that reported 3G/4G device shipments were approximately 400 million units within ASP of approximately $207 at the midpoints. Global 3G/4G handset ASPs are tracking consistent with expectations of low single-digit percentage declines year-over-year, and Qualcomm continues to see healthy growth in global 3G/4G device shipments. Note - "The GAAP results for Q2'17 reflect a $974 million reduction of revenues associated with the BlackBerry arbitration award including estimated interest in attorney's fees. This reduced fiscal second quarter GAAP EPS by approximately $0.48 per share." Qualcomm claims that its semiconductor business continues to benefit from a strong product roadmap for mobile handsets, as the adoption of mobile technologies and mobile computing accelerates around the world, as well as new growing markets including automotive, networking, and IoT. The company is confident that its footprint in these new segments will strengthen with the NXP Semiconductors' acquisition, which is expected to close this calendar year. While the strong Q2'17 performance and Q3'17 guidance is encouraging, the ongoing dispute with Apple and various other lawsuits is a cause of concern and could potentially impact the company's performance in subsequent quarters. Qualcomm Is Confident Of Sustaining Its Licensing Model While there are serious doubts about the sustainability of Qualcomm's licensing model, the company is confident of navigating these challenges in time and has taken several steps to address the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) and U.S. Fair Trade Commission ( FTC ) matters in Q2'17. Qualcomm also recently filed an answer and counterclaims in the Apple litigation. (For more info on the lawsuits - Read) Specifically, regarding the dispute with Apple - Apple withheld payment, to the tune of $1 billion, to their contract manufacturers who, in turn, withheld payments to Qualcomm for royalties that were owed under the contract manufacturers agreements. Effectively, Qualcomm's Q3'17 guidance assumes a range of possible payments from Apple, and from the Apple suppliers, but does not reflect a scenario that Apple suppliers pay nothing to Qualcomm for March end quarter sales. The disputed agreement with Apple ended in December 2016, so there is really no relevance or impact to what the contract manufacturers would owe the company for sales during the March quarter, according to Qualcomm. Overall, there are a lot of uncertainties around the licensing business, so we'll have to wait and watch how it all plays out.

Fenwick led Google's spacecraft operations, while Trela was head of satellite engineering. Both Trela and Fenwick are reporting to Greg Duffy, the former co-founder of camera company Dropcam. What the two are doing at Apple is unclear, but Bloomberg speculates they're either working on satellites for image collection or satellites for communications. Rumors have suggested Apple is using a fleet of drones to collect data to improve Apple Maps, with the company having filed for an FAA permit to be able to fly drones for commercial purposes. Apple also acquired Aether Industries in 2015, a previously unknown purchase. Aether Industries develops high-bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. On its website, Aether Industries shows off a range of high-resolution aerial imagery and claims to provide a "full imaging and mapping solution for full color aerial images." There's also evidence Apple is interested in deploying satellites for communication purposes. Boeing has been working on sending more than 1,000 satellites into low-earth orbit for the purpose of providing broadband access, and the company has reportedly been in talks with Apple.The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It's unclear if those talks will result in a deal. At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington D.C. last month, industry insiders said Boeing's project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Inc., wrote in a recent blog. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. Former Boeing executive James Bell also joined Apple's board of directors back in October of 2015, another potential link between Apple and Boeing. It continues to be unclear if Apple will get involved with Boeing's broadband endeavor, but it's easy to see why Apple might be interested with Boeing aiming for faster speeds than existing cellular systems. Apple and Google declined to comment on the hiring, while Fenwick, Trela, and Duffy did not respond to Bloomberg's request for comments.Tags: Google, satellite, Aether Industries, Apple acquisitions Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - 8 hours ago< > Embed Apple Signals Interest in Internet Satellites 00:41 Apple's next big launch may be a literal one as the tech giant seemingly has an interest in internet-beaming satellites.

Now, a new app called After Ice has harnessed the power of geolocation, augmented reality (AR) and gathered NASA data to show users exactly how their city will look after the ice melts. The app reveals how many feet of water is predicted for your location with a stream of sea water floating across the screen – bubbles and fish will also swim past. Scroll down for videos  After Ice has harnessed the power of geolocation, augmented reality (AR) and gathered NASA data to show users exactly how their city will look after the ice melts. It was released in honor of Earth Day on Saturday AFTER ICE APP  After Ice was released to the Apple Store this week in honor of Earth Day on Saturday, but a New York-based artists also wanted to help the public 'visualize what is happening to the planet'. After Ice lets users see NASA climate projects in an augmented world through their mobile phones – and are presented with two different scenarios. The first highlights what would happen if all of the ice on the planet were to melt – an effect that is said to occur far down the road. And the other shows what could happen in the not so distant future- in 2080. To see how your city would be affected, simply download After Ice in the App Store and snap photos of the area around you. The app will share how many feet of water is predicted for your location and a augmented reality stream of sea water will flow across the top of the screen – bubbles and fish will also swim past. After Ice was released to the Apple Store this week in honor of Earth Day on Saturday by a New York-based artist who wanted to help the public 'visualize what is happening to the planet'. 'We have a serious disconnect from important existential issues like global warming and melting glaciers,' said Justin Brice Guariglia. 'Glaciers live a world away, and in a temporal and spatial scale that evolution has not prepare us to understand.' 'As an artist interested in the existential, and feeling a great sense of urgency, I felt compelled to make this accessible.' After Ice lets users see NASA climate projects in an augmented world through their mobile phones – and are presented with two different scenarios. The first highlights what would happen if all of the ice on the planet were to melt – an effect that is said to occur far down the road. Guariglia noted that 'if the earth continues to warm, and all the ice melts, there will be over 263 feet of projected sea level rise'. And the other shows what could happen in the not so distant future- in 2080. 'According to the latest projections, the seas will rise by over 6ft (2m) by the 2080s. That's within the lifespan of children alive today,' he shared.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next What IS 'Operation Gotham Shield'? Bizarre alert claims US...

Share this article Share 21 shares Sea levels have already climbed more than 27 cm in New York City and 38.5 cm along the New Jersey coast just in the 20th century. However, these rates are expected to exceed the global average of up to two feet because 'the East Coast is slowly sinking', explained NASA. And Guariglia used New York City as a test case for the app. Users can also read an explanations of the imminent threat the Big Apple faces as its 8.4 million residents would be a risk once climate change is in full effect. According to the latest projections, the seas will rise by over 6ft (2m) by the 2080s*†. That's within the lifespan of children alive today.  After Ice was in honor of Earth Day by a New York-based artists who also wanted to help the public 'visualize what is happening to the planet' HOW NEW YORK MIGHT LOOK IN 2140   In a new book entitled 'New York 2140,' author Kim Stanley Robinson supposes that climate scientists will be surprised by how quickly the world's ice sheets will shrink and sea levels will rise.  His novel explores how civilization might nonetheless muddle through to remake this reshaped world. In Robinson's future, he writes that melting ice sheets will lead to an overall 50 feet (15.24 meters) sea level rise by 2140.  The submerged streets of Lower Manhattan have turned into canals, crisscrossed by pedestrian high lines.  Vaporettos have replaced taxis.  Skyscrapers whose bases have fallen beneath the waves are protected by nanodiamond coatings and powered by solar microgrids. Retreat has occurred mainly from the intertidal zone of Midtown Manhattan, where the forces of the daily tidal cycle wreak havoc on structural integrity.  On the dry land surrounding the Cloisters, far uptown, carbon nanomaterials originally intended for space elevators allow new buildings on the shrunken island to reach hundreds of stories upward.  Airships are steered by chatty but rule-bound AIs, and communications take place by tablet, with celebrities broadcasting live feeds of real-world adventures through the cloud. However, although the app warns of the dangers, it also shares tips on what users can do to stop climate change. To see how your city would be affected, simply download After Ice in the App Store and snap photos of the area around you. The app will share how many feet of water is predicted for your location and a augmented reality stream of sea water will flow across the top of the screen – bubbles and fish will also swim past. 'We warm the earth, the glaciers melt, and we go under water… Global warming is happening, however it needs to be emotionally felt before people will want to take action,' Guariglia explained. 'I hope this app will at the very least get a conversation going and get some of the science out of the lab, and into people hands.'    Read more: What is AFTER ICE? | Guariglia Share or comment on this article e-mail 21 shares Most watched News videos GRAPHIC: Horrifying moment pit bull attacks toddler in street Former Patriot Aaron Hernandez found hanging in his prison cell Terrifying footage shows moments after Paris shooting Attempted rapist runs from police moments before being arrested Crewman jumps from cargo ship to save whale tangled in net Mom sobs after AA flight attendant 'violently took her stroller' Hilarious footage of a screaming man experiencing labour pains Film makers expose 'major new developments' in McCann case Angry woman gets escorted off plane by police Robert Irwin and Jimmy play with baby bears on The Tonight Show Man punches woman as she tries to intervene in street fight Farmer gives very 'country' account of car crash and bee attack EXCLUSIVE: Aaron Hernandez left behind a handwritten...

She usually doesn’t call me directly unless she has a technology problem, and this time, it was a good one. It seems her iPad and her iPhone were both in a state of wanting her Apple ID password, and they were telling her the account was locked and to proceed she needed to reset the password. This wouldn’t be a problem for many people, who could jump on a computer and reset the Apple ID password, but in my mother-in-law’s case the iPad and the iPhone are her only ways to get online, so she was stuck. There was a link on her screen to reset the password, but for that she’d need to remember her security questions. Let’s just say she and I didn’t remember the security questions. You can also reset the password through email, so through Apple’s website, I was able to reset her password and then log into her email account to make the change. I then called her back to tell her the new Apple ID password and talk her through getting her devices unlocked. Crisis averted. What happened was interesting. Apple released an iOS update, and both her devices had updated and restarted. To complete the update, you are asked to log back into your iCloud account. My mother-in-law didn’t remember the password, so she locked the account after trying too many times without success. It didn’t help that she really didn’t understand what was going on with the update_ Navigating a password reset procedure can be challenging, even for me sometimes. Luckily, my wife’s iPhone did the same update the day before, and she was also presented with the screen to enter her Apple ID, which she did without incident, so when my mother-in-law called, I quickly recognized she was in the same boat. The takeaway is to take your time to read and understand what is being asked in those little dialog boxes. If all else fails, have a plan for someone who can help you navigate these situations. We’ve been talking about passwords and how to keep up with them. In this case, a detailed notebook containing your logins and passwords is invaluable. — ABOUT THE WRITER Jim Rossman writes for The Dallas Morning News.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple Refuses to Allow iPhone, Mac Recycling Apple Refuses to Allow iPhone, Mac Recycling By Joel Hruska on April 21, 2017 at 1:56 pm Comment There’s a pair of near-perfectly juxtaposed stories about Apple in the news today. First, Apple has released its own environmental progress report for 2017. The news here is generally good, as you’d expect from a self-prepared report, but it highlights Apple’s success in moving to fully renewable energy and to use less power across its entire product stack. Other investigations into the company’s practices, however, haven’t been so rosy. In the report, Apple claims that it wants to move to products that are fully recyclable. The report reads: Traditional supply chains are linear. Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use… We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material. We already have programs in place to ensure the finite materials we use in our products are sourced responsibly through strict standards and programs on the ground that drive positive change… Apple’s long-term concept for a recyclable product. [W]e’re piloting innovative new recycling techniques, like our line of disassembly robots, so we can put reclaimed materials to better use in new products. It’s an ambitious goal that will require many years of collaboration across multiple Apple teams, our suppliers, and specialty recyclers—but our work is already under way. So, to hear Apple tell it, the day is soon coming when it’ll be able to hand you an iPhone and say “This iPhone built from recycled hardware,” and you’ll never know the difference. That’s an ambitious goal. It might not be cheaper than using new materials right out of the gate, but over time as new methods to improve efficiency are discovered, Apple might one day be able to build devices out of mostly recycled material for less than it would cost to buy new components. Given how many smartphones go into landfills every year, and how many hundreds of millions of phones Apple sells, this kind of efficiency would make a material impact on e-waste and could encourage other companies to create their own recycling programs. Apple’s desire to tout its own environmental credentials isn’t surprising, but a new article from Vice puts a different spin on the company’s activities. According to their year-long investigation, Apple iPhones and MacBooks aren’t “recycled” in any meaningful sense. Instead, they’re completely destroyed, by Apple’s specific order. The Cupertino-based company handles almost none of its own recycling, instead farming it out to various third parties, and they forbid any reuse or resale of any components. Everything is shredded down to commodity-grade bits of metal, plastic, and glass, with Apple handling just a fraction of their own materials processing. Image by Vice There are multiple problems with this approach. First, while shredding computers and phones into base stocks of plastic, glass, and metal may still count as “recycling,” it ignores how many of these devices could be repaired, reused, and sold for profit. Funding from such activities could actually help pay for more recycling — a recent USA Today story dove into how falling prices for recycled stock material have put the crunch on recycling companies. Apple’s current policies ensure that their own recycled products are worth a minimal amount of money, which makes it more difficult for recycling companies to stay in business. And make no mistake — this is about branding, with device security a distant second and environmentalism far behind. Just as fashion brands regularly destroy entire product runs at the end of a season to prevent their clothes from ending up on people deemed undesirable (if unofficial) brand ambassadors, Apple doesn’t want Macs flooding into a resale market, because it would create the expectation that Macs should be priced lower than they are. The juxtaposition of Vice’s findings and Apple’s environmental report highlights the difficulty of developing a truly comprehensive recycling and reuse program. If Apple can start building smartphones out of 100% recycled materials (or even 80-90%) that would be a huge step forward relative to where we are. At the same time, however, Apple is pursuing strategies that guarantee its own hardware ends up in landfills or used as filler in the manufacture of other goods, rather than allowing them to be reused or repaired. If the company is serious about reducing its own pollution, it needs to develop recycling practices that it and its partners can both use to repair and reuse existing products, not just manufacture new ones.

But now some media companies are shutting down those experiments. The Guardian has confirmed that it is no longer working with Facebook on Instant Articles, nor is it distributing its content through Apple News, according to a report by Digiday. However, the British daily is still said to be working with Google to publish articles using the company's Accelerated Mobile Pages or AMP standard. "We have run extensive trials on Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News to assess how they fit with our editorial and commercial objectives," a Guardian spokesman said. "Having evaluated these trials, we have decided to stop publishing in those formats on both platforms." The British newspaper company, which has been trying to build up its financial resources with a membership drive, went on to say that its primary objective "is to bring audiences to the trusted environment of the Guardian to support building deeper relationships with our readers, and growing membership and contributions to fund our world-class journalism." Facebook launched Instant Articles in 2015, and offered it to publishers as a way to make their content more mobile-friendly. Under the deal, Facebook modified the stories to make them load more quickly on smartphones, and offered publishers a share of advertising revenue. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Initially, there was a large amount of interest in the Facebook deal because many companies didn't have their own fast-loading mobile pages or apps. Major publishers such as the New York Times and the Washington Post agreed to be part of the Instant Articles project, and some—including the Guardian—published everything they had through the feature. Over the past few months, however, there have been rumblings of dissatisfaction among many publishers, including the New York Times, which no longer distributes its content through Instant Articles. Many media companies say the amount of revenue they've been getting from the Facebook feature has been lackluster. Facebook has admitted that it needs to do more work on revenue-sharing options for publishers and media companies, and it is also introducing support for subscriptions and pay models, something more and more publishers and news sites are relying on for income. The Guardian was also an early adopter of another Facebook venture known as "social reader apps," which Facebook promoted in 2012. The apps allowed users to sign up for and read news content inside special apps that lived on the social network, but the Guardian pulled out of the deal after Facebook changed the way its algorithm worked and stopped recommending the apps. While Facebook's Instant Articles has proven to be less than stellar as a method of generating revenue, some publishers have been more complimentary about the returns they are getting from Apple News, which distributes content from partners through a news-reading app. But The Guardian said it is no longer participating in the Apple project either. The British publisher has continued working with Google's AMP standard, however, which like Instant Articles makes it easy for stories and other content to be viewed on mobile devices. AMP supports subscriptions and pay models, and it is also an open-source project, which means any developer or publisher can contribute to the development of the standard. The Guardian said at a recent conference that more than 60% of its mobile traffic comes from content that it distributes through the Google project.

Home Macs | 20 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (5) iLife and iWork Apps Now Free for Everyone by Josh Centers Once upon a time, Apple used to charge for nearly all its software, and especially productivity apps like the iLife and iWork suites. However, back in 2013, Apple made those apps free with the purchase of any new Mac or iOS device (see “New Free iLife and iWork Apps Share across Devices and Platforms,” 22 October 2013). Now, with no announcement or fanfare, Apple has made the current iLife and iWork apps entirely free for all users. Just to be clear, the change affects the following apps: GarageBand for macOS (requires 10.10 Yosemite) and iOS (requires iOS 10.2) iMovie for macOS (requires 10.11.2 El Capitan) and iOS (requires iOS 9.3) Keynote for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Numbers for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Pages for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) This is good news for holdouts who haven’t purchased a new eligible Apple device since 2013 but are running the necessary version of the operating system and would like copies of the iLife and iWork apps. And it makes explaining the pricing easier for Apple. Why didn’t Apple just make these apps free for everyone in the first place? The answer likely lies deep within Apple’s accounting department. By making iLife, iWork, and OS X 10.9 Mavericks free and bundling them with every new Mac and iOS device sold, Apple was able to delay recognition of a portion of its sales receipts. That’s because the product wasn’t “fully delivered” without updates to the software — it’s a “subscription accounting” approach. In its Q4 2013 financial quarter, Apple delayed recognition of $900 million in revenue, in essence hiding that money from the quarterly report (see “Apple Q4 2013 Results See Lower Profits Again,” 28 October 2013). That may answer the question of why Apple made this change now too. According to Daniel Eran Dilger of AppleInsider, the deferred revenue trickles back into Apple’s reported revenues over 2 years for iOS and 4 years for the Mac. It has been about 4 years since this deferral likely began, implying that Apple has finally cleaned the associated deferred revenue off its books. In the end, this change won’t mean much. Any effects from iLife and iWork becoming free — on competing apps, on Apple’s revenues, and on the perceived value of Apple hardware, for instance — have already taken place. Most people who want to use the iLife and iWork apps have likely either bought copies already or purchased new hardware since October 2013. We suspect that sales to owners of older Macs and iOS devices have dropped to the point where it was no longer worthwhile for Apple to bother charging for the apps anymore.

Reply Jeffrey Puritz  2017-04-20 17:33 You're an optimist but my lengthy experience with Apple tells me that like Aperture these apps are in for a long slow death by neglect. Sadly, I think that this is true for the mac as well. Apple is only interested in the products with the most revenue and it shows. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-04-20 18:15 Free may seem like a good thing, but nothing is really free. In this case we will be paying for these apps through hardware purchases, if we use an app or not. Then there is the question of app quality. Since Apple is not making any money off them anymore there is no stimulus to make these apps so good people will be willing to pay for them. The option to vote with our wallet has been taken from us. One sad example is the latest version of Numbers for iOS. The complaints and 1 star reviews are pouring in but Apple seems to be deaf and blind to them. Now that Numbers is free there is even less reason te expect Apple to do anything about this bad update. Reply Paul F Henegan   2017-04-21 03:55 No, they are not "free for everyone", only for those who have also upgraded to macOS X 12 or later. As Alfonso Scenna observes above, unless one is willing and able to run the very latest OS, there is no invitation to the party. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-21 09:39 You're right that these apps have specific system requirements, and we've updated the article to make this completely clear. However, that doesn't change the fact that the apps are indeed free for everyone. Your ability to run an app is separate from its price. Reply  Search   Cached.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Apple recruits top Google satellite executives for whole new hardware team Christian Zibreg on April 21, 2017 0 Mark Gurman and Mark Bergen, reporting Friday for Bloomberg, have learned from sources who didn’t wish to be named that Apple is in the process of starting a brand new hardware team for which it recruited a pair of top Google executives specialized in satellites for collecting images and those for communications. It’s unclear from the report what Apple’s secretive new hardware team might be focusing on, but it could be inferred from the hirings that Tim Cook & Co. might be considering a satellite constellation of their own for either image collection or some sort of communications services. Apple and satellite engineering John Fenwick, who led Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, who was the search giant’s head of satellite engineering, left Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. for Apple in recent weeks. Both men joined Google in 2014 when it acquired their satellite-imaging startup Skybox Imaging for a reported $500 million. In 2017, Google sold Skybox to startup Planet Labs Inc. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University. The two former Google executives now report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam who joined Apple earlier this year to form a new team. He reports to Dan Riccio, who oversees hardware teams for iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple’s augmented reality efforts. The report notes that Google planned to invest $1 billion in an internal satellite internet initiative run by industry veteran Greg Wyler before it invested $1 billion in SpaceX after Wyler left to start satellite communications firm OneWeb Ltd. Considering Fenwick and Trela are experts in satellite design and operation, it’s reasonably safe to speculate that Apple could be looking to design or manage a satellite constellation. But why? The most likely answer: to boost Apple Maps with its own highly detailed satellite images, which could be very helpful should Apple decide to launch Maps web app in the future. Apple could also create its own Google Earth-like service, especially following the launch of the beautiful Google Earth web app earlier this week. For years, the iPhone maker has operated a fleet of airplanes that capture aerial images of major metropolitan areas and landmarks from multiple angles, used to create detailed 3D views of buildings and other objects on Maps. Apple goes Google Earth? The company also operates a fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans that roam the streets capturing data that helps improve Maps. I’m only speculating here, but those vehicles might be also taking street-level photographs that Apple could use for a Google Street View-like feature on Maps. Bloomberg in December said Apple even relies on a fleet of drones to update Maps information faster than the aforesaid minivans allow. The FAA granted the Cupertino company approval to operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography and videography.

The UK music industry, like its counterparts in other countries, has had a tough time adapting to the technological shake-ups of recent years. But now it also has to plan for the changes that will be ushered in by the UK's decision to leave the European Union. Obviously there is still huge uncertainty about what the country's future relationship with the EU will be like, since its expected departure in the spring of 2019 is still subject to lengthy negotiations. However, it is already possible to identify areas of the music business that may feel the effects. Record shops With the industry's annual Record Store Day falling this year on Saturday, 22 April, record shops are enjoying a boom in sales of old-fashioned vinyl releases. The format was widely expected to die a slow death with the advent of the CD, but in recent times, vinyl records have managed to outsell downloads. However, when Record Store Day 2020 rolls around, there is a risk that those singles and albums could cost significantly more. Image caption Will these records cost more post-Brexit? If the UK does not manage to conclude a favourable trade deal with the EU, then tariffs may be applied on goods coming into the UK. There are now only a couple of vinyl pressing plants left on British soil, so the majority of records sold in the UK are manufactured in factories based in other EU countries. The same goes for CDs. If tariffs on goods return, record labels will face increased costs, which they will have to pass on to consumers. Digital music So why buy music on physical formats anyway? This is the 21st Century, so go for streaming or downloads. Well, even there, Brexit is likely to have consequences. The pound has fallen in value in the wake of last June's referendum outcome. The leading music streaming services, from Sweden's Spotify to US-based Apple Music, are all multinational firms whose pricing policies are decided elsewhere. Apple has already increased the price of its apps this year, in a move widely attributed to the Brexit vote. Apple Music subscriptions could follow suit if the pound falls any further. In other ways, however, Brexit will have no effect at all. Many politicians and business leaders have called for the UK to preserve its access to the European single market, but in digital terms, things are more complicated. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The vast majority of Spotify's catalogue is available all over the world While goods are covered by the single market in Europe, the market for services is still very much a work in progress. And when it comes to the distribution of digital products, including music and e-books, consumers will still find that borders get in the way. If you have an account with Amazon UK, you can buy a CD from Amazon's French website, but it won't allow you to buy the same music on download. That said, streaming services are more unified. Spotify, for instance, makes practically all its catalogue accessible everywhere in the world, with some minor variations in local-language music. But although Brussels has failed to create a digital single market for music consumers, it has done a lot for music producers. Royalties People who make music can make money from it in various ways. As well as selling digital or physical copies of it, they are also paid royalties every time it is played in public. There are two kinds of these: mechanical royalties, which you get whenever your music is reproduced on CD or vinyl, or as a download or stream performance royalties, which you get when your song is performed live or played on radio or television Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mechanical royalties date back to the days of piano rolls And although there is no EU single market for digital music purchases, there is now a thriving single market for licensing music and collecting royalties on it. In the UK, the main royalty collection society is PRS for Music. Its chief executive, Robert Ashcroft, says that the European Commission made a big difference with its Collective Rights Management Directive, which came into force in the UK in April last year. As a result, it is now much easier to license music in many territories at once, rather than having to authorise it country by country, as was formerly the case. PRS, for example, works in a joint venture with its counterparts in Sweden and Germany, STIM and GEMA, to operate a pan-European online music rights licensing service. This means that songwriters and music publishing companies can get paid more quickly and accurately. "We have already been licensing our rights on a pan-European basis," says Mr Ashcroft. "Brexit won't stop that and it's not in our business interest to stop it either." Copyright law The UK's law on music copyright has changed in recent years because of Brussels. In November 2013, UK copyright protection on sound recordings increased from 50 years to 70 years, in line with an EU directive approved in 2011. However, recordings that had already slipped into the public domain, such as the Beatles' first single, stayed there. Image caption The Beatles' earliest recordings are now out of copyright And there is a "use it or lose it" provision for hitherto unreleased recordings from 50 years ago. If record companies have ageing tracks in the vaults that they have never issued, then they have no comeback if other people get hold of them and release them. Will all this change when the UK "takes back control"? PRS's Mr Ashcroft thinks not. "I expect it to continue unless and until someone presents an argument that it's damaging to the economy," he says. Touring and nationality One area where Brexit could have a negative impact is on touring musicians. There are fears that music groups might have to scale back European tours after Brexit and fewer European acts could travel to the UK. "We have a very healthy business in royalties that are earned when our members' works are performed overseas," says PRS's Mr Ashcroft. "If there were obstacles to British bands touring, that would be a potential challenge." At the same time, however, he is concerned about Brexit's potential impact on his own organisation's staffing levels. "Eleven per cent of our employees come from countries other than the UK. We operate daily in 13 languages. We need the prime minister to give assurances that the people resident and working here can stay." On that basis, he feels that the UK's music business is well integrated with the rest of Europe and hopes it will stay that way, despite Brexit: "We are so international that we think our business transcends that."

The new document provides further evidence that Apple is actively working on autonomous driving technology internally. Sony A6500 Business Insider obtained the document entitled “Development Platform Specific Training” which refers to the “Apple Automated System” used in self-driving vehicles: According to the document, Apple drivers must pass seven different tests before they are fully trained. Each safety driver has two practice runs and three trials to pass each test on what appears to be a private course. The document itself details technology used by drivers including Logitech hardware and basic driving maneuvers like tight u-turns and sudden braking or acceleration. Each test type includes a goal and steps to override the autonomous system when training with the system. While Apple can test anything privately and internally, its California permit allows it to test three Lexus RX450h SUVs according to the DMV documentation published last week; that’s the same vehicle used in Google’s own self-driving tests. While it was believed for several months that Apple was building an electric vehicle of its own, recent reports have claimed Apple is focusing instead on self-driving car software for now which is evidenced by recent public-facing developments. Back in December, a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was uncovered that acknowledged first hand Apple’s work on self-driving technology.

By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor There is one thing that Amazon.com Inc.’s investors might cheer, but could end up stopping the stock’s climb to record highs in its tracks: entering the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow’s recent underperformance, and the pending acquisition of component DuPont & Co., has some on Wall Street wondering if the 121-year-old “blue chip” barometer needs some extra juice. The Dow DJIA, -0.15%  has gained 4.2% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  has advanced 5.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.11%  has run up 9.8%. Becoming one of the select 30 Dow companies might seem like validation for the e-commerce and technology giant and its investors. Amazon AMZN, -0.39% which has been public for nearly 20 years, has forced a number of industries, including retail, the cloud, logistics and media, to evolve or face extinction. Read more about how Amazon will become the first trillion-dollar company Nasdaq record high. To match it, S&P needs about 45 points. Dow, about 600 points.— Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) April 21, 2017 Quick, put Amazon in the Dow! https://t.co/etWMGh33Lb— Downtown Josh Brown (@ReformedBroker) April 21, 2017 But Amazon disciples should be careful what they wish for. Call it the Dow jinx, but recent entrants have underperformed the stocks they replaced by wide margins, often for relatively long periods. Don’t miss: Apple’s year in the Dow has been rotten for investors. Investors don’t need to worry, however, because they will have plenty of warning before Amazon gains entrance. There are two big reasons the Dow’s keepers have likely shunned the fourth-largest U.S. company by market capitalization. The stock price is too damn high While there are no hard and fast rules for the Dow’s membership committee to follow, the stock price matters. And Amazon’s is way too high, without a large-multiple stock split. “We prefer that the ratio of highest to lowest price be less than 10-to-1,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., in an interview with MarketWatch. Amazon’s stock slipped Friday to $897.99, more than 30 times the price of the current lowest priced stock in the Dow, which is General Electric Co.’s GE, -2.38%  at $29.70. FactSet Amazon would have to enact at least a 3-for-1 stock split just to meet the Dow keepers’ minimum requirement, and a 7-for-1 split to price its stock roughly in the middle of the range of component stock prices. Amazon last split its stock, 2-for-1, in September 1999, going from nearly $120 to about $60. The Dow is very different from other widely followed broad market indexes, because it is price weighted while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are market-capitalization weighted. That means the higher the share price, the more influence it has on the Dow’s price. For example, Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -0.12%  market cap of $745 billion is nearly nine times greater than Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS, -0.55%  market cap of $87 billion. However, a 1% rise in Goldman’s stock, which currently trades above $218, would add about 15 points to the Dow, while a 1% rise in Apple shares, which trades around $142, would add about 10 points. Amazon had 486 million diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s annual report, but was authorized to have as many as 5 billion shares outstanding. That means Amazon could split its stock by a factor of up to 10 times without seeking shareholder approval to increase the number of shares outstanding. No dividend, no dice The membership committee doesn’t require a dividend, but companies that don’t pay them don’t get invited. Every current Dow component pays a dividend, with the implied dividend yield ranging from a low of 0.72% for Nike Inc. NKE, -0.98%  to a high of 4.89% for Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -2.40%   “In my memory, it’s not an issue that has come up,” Blitzer told MarketWatch. “We haven’t seriously looked at a candidate that did not pay a dividend.” In other words, Amazon hasn’t yet been a serious candidate for Dow inclusion, since the company stated in its most recent 10-K filing with Securities and Exchange Commission that it has “never declared or paid cash dividends” on its common stock. Dow crosses 21,000: more upside to come?(4:56) The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 21000 for the first time Wednesday morning. WSJ's Paul Vigna and Tanya Rivero discuss the market's response to President Trump's policies and what still concerns traders about the U.S. economy. Photo: Getty To match the lowest yield at current prices, Amazon would have to start issuing a quarterly dividend of about $1.58 a share, or about $6.34 on an annual basis, at an estimated cost of about $3.1 billion a year. The company said in its 10-K, however, that it continually evaluates opportunities to pay dividends. Stock repurchases are a little different. Despite having a $5 billion stock buyback program in place, Amazon didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016, 2015 or 2014, filings show. But that’s OK, because three current Dow components--Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.36% Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.01%  and Verizon--didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016. If Amazon is in, who’s out? For Amazon to get into the Dow, some company has to come out. An easy choice to be booted is DuPont DD, +0.46% which is expected to complete the acquisition by Dow Chemical Co. DOW, +0.36%  sometime in August 2017. That is plenty of time for Amazon to make some big changes, which it will undoubtedly describe as shareholder friendly. Of course, the Dow keepers could decide to keep the combined chemical giant in the index, to maintain sector representation, although the only sector rules that are followed are that transportation companies and utilities are excluded, since those sectors are represented by the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.08%  and the Dow Jones Utility Average. DJU, +0.69%   “Sectors are considered, but I cannot say what weight they have,” Blitzer said. The Dow already has Apple, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.37% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.03% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -1.18% but the technology weighting is still well below that of its chief large-cap rival. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average exchange-traded fund DIA, -0.13%  had a technology weighting of 14.63% as of April 19, according to Morningstar, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, -0.32%  had a 19.83% tech weighting. If the Dow keepers decide a tech member must leave to admit Amazon, Cisco’s market-cap of $164.2 billion and IBM’s of $151.6 billion are currently the lowest of the five. Don’t dis the Dow Despite the status gained by entering the Dow, recent history suggests investors may have to wait a while before it pays off. FactSet Apple’s stock had soared 40% and AT&T shares had inched up 0.7% in the year before Apple took AT&T’s Inc.’s T, -1.07%  place in the Dow on March 19, 2015. In the year that followed, Apple shares tumbled 17% while AT&T’s soared 17%. Read more about the AT&T-for-Apple swap. Eventually, the Dow curse faded, and Apple attracted the attention of the most famous value investor. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, -0.95%  had shied away from buying Apple shares before they entered Wall Street’s most-staid fraternity. He didn’t start buying Apple’s stock until the first quarter of 2016, or about one year after it entered the Dow. Since then, Buffett has boosted his stake in each quarter, to reach 57.4 million shares as of Dec. 31. Apple had reached a record close about a month before it entered the Dow, but didn’t set another record until nearly two years after it gained admittance. The following table shows how the newcomers performed relative to their replacements: Stock added (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Stock removed (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Apple (AAPL) -16.9 AT&T (T) -17.2 Goldman Sachs (GS) +9.2 Bank of America (BAC) +17.9 Visa (V) +7.6 Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) +72.0 Nike (NKE) +16.3 Alcoa (AA) +91.0 S&P Dow Jones Indices, FactSet Before investors criticize the Dow keepers, for turning new age growth companies into old-school blue chips, just look how they’ve performed relative to the broader stock market. Since Nov. 1, 1999, when the first Nasdaq-listed technology companies were admitted, the correlation coefficient between the Dow and the S&P 500 has been 0.9797, according to an analysis of FactSet data, or just shy of a perfect match. The Dow has climbed 93.33% since then, while the S&P 500 has advanced 73.80%. FactSet Don’t miss: Dow hitting 20,000 is a reminder that it’s the best active fund ever fashioned. So if Amazon splits its stock, starts paying a dividend, and it eventually enters the Dow, investors may want to step aside for a while. But check back a year later, and see if Buffett has finally become a believer.

The company's "Development Platform Specific Training" document references an "Apple Automated System" and a "Development platform," alluding to the self-driving software platform Apple is rumored to be building after plans for a full autonomous electric vehicle fell through. Click to enlarge Apple recently obtained a permit from the California DMV that will allow it to test self-driving vehicles on public roads, and as part of that process, the company appears to be training employees to use whatever system it's testing. According to the DMV, Apple plans to use three 2015 Lexus RX450h SUVs, which will be driven by six drivers with expertise in areas like machine learning. Based on the documents, drivers are required to pass seven tests as part of their training before being allowed to work with Apple's software platform. Each driver must complete two practice runs and three trials to pass tests, which cover topics like taking control of the vehicle at tight U-turns, sudden acceleration, sudden braking, and more. Click to enlarge According to the training packet, Apple's self-driving car uses a Logitech wheel and pedals to actuate drive by wire, and it supports one person at a time. Pressing the brake pedal or grabbing the steering wheel in Apple's test vehicles will disengage the electronic driving mode, but drivers can accelerate without overriding the "drive by wire" mode.Apple's work in the car industry has been something of an open secret for the past three years. The company was originally planning to create its own autonomous vehicle, but pivoted to an autonomous driving software platform following internal strife and leadership issues. Apple is now said to be creating a driving system under the leadership of Bob Mansfield, with the car team having been given until the end of this year to prove the feasibility of a self-driving car platform. Such a system could potentially allow Apple to partner with car manufacturers as a sort of expansion of CarPlay. With Apple ready to test the software on public roads, it appears development is fairly far along. Should the company take vehicles out on California streets, its work will need to be publicly shared with the DMV based on California law.

I believe they just stopped the whole (real) car project because they thought the software is the most important thing here. Without software there is no hardware. Building the car is probably the more trivial thing here compared to autonomous driving. They can build this when the software is ready.

All we really had to support that idea was a lot of wishful thinking accompanied by the usual fantasy renderings. Not the same thing as reality, last I checked. Rating: 6 Votes WhoDaKat 11 hours ago at 01:31 pm Siri can't even figure out which "to" "too" or "two" I mean to use with voice recognition. I sure as heck wouldn't trust Apple with my life. It picks the right one for me. You have to give it context to understand what you mean. You can't just say, "to" and it expect it to know. But if you say, "I too would like to buy two flowers", it works just fine. Rating: 5 Votes macduke 10 hours ago at 01:54 pm This is a screenshot of an actual interaction I had with Siri yesterday morning after I got out of the shower. I had American Idiot by Green Day stuck in my head while showering, so I used "Hey Siri" to turn up the volume and play it. Or at least I tried—it was like Siri was having a stroke! The best part was after the music started playing, "Hey Siri" couldn't even hear me so that I could tell it to turn up the volume more. There's no way in hell I'd go anywhere near an Apple self-driving car! Rating: 3 Votes LordVic 10 hours ago at 01:57 pm Yeah I figured rules would be the same but you see what I'm trying to say right? And you are assuming you have enough time to enter manual mode and correct before impact. The owner of the vehicle would still be liable for accidents even if it was fully autonomous, which to me is reason enough to not want this useless tech. its really cool tech. it's a step towardsd that mythical sci-fi future. But I'm with you. I don't really want it until it's at that ready point where it can be trusted. and I don't see purely autonomous driving being practical until it's all or nothing. Once you get a mix of fallible humans driving, with rigid computer systems, it's a recipe for disaster. People are unpredictable and do things computers often have a hard time account for. It would take some serious AI to be ble to do so in such a complete heuristic sense, that we are still a long way from. Plus, I really like driving. my foot on the gas. Hand on the wheels. shifting. the roar of the engine at my command.... hmmm, need to go for a drive.... in my... camry.... DONT JUDGE!

By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor There is one thing that Amazon.com Inc.’s investors might cheer, but could end up stopping the stock’s climb to record highs in its tracks: entering the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow’s recent underperformance, and the pending acquisition of component DuPont & Co., has some on Wall Street wondering if the 121-year-old “blue chip” barometer needs some extra juice. The Dow DJIA, -0.15%  has gained 4.2% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  has advanced 5.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.11%  has run up 9.8%. Becoming one of the select 30 Dow companies might seem like validation for the e-commerce and technology giant and its investors. Amazon AMZN, -0.39% which has been public for nearly 20 years, has forced a number of industries, including retail, the cloud, logistics and media, to evolve or face extinction. Read more about how Amazon will become the first trillion-dollar company Nasdaq record high. To match it, S&P needs about 45 points. Dow, about 600 points.— Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) April 21, 2017 Quick, put Amazon in the Dow! https://t.co/etWMGh33Lb— Downtown Josh Brown (@ReformedBroker) April 21, 2017 But Amazon disciples should be careful what they wish for. Call it the Dow jinx, but recent entrants have underperformed the stocks they replaced by wide margins, often for relatively long periods. Don’t miss: Apple’s year in the Dow has been rotten for investors. Investors don’t need to worry, however, because they will have plenty of warning before Amazon gains entrance. There are two big reasons the Dow’s keepers have likely shunned the fourth-largest U.S. company by market capitalization. The stock price is too damn high While there are no hard and fast rules for the Dow’s membership committee to follow, the stock price matters. And Amazon’s is way too high, without a large-multiple stock split. “We prefer that the ratio of highest to lowest price be less than 10-to-1,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., in an interview with MarketWatch. Amazon’s stock slipped Friday to $897.99, more than 30 times the price of the current lowest priced stock in the Dow, which is General Electric Co.’s GE, -2.38%  at $29.70. FactSet Amazon would have to enact at least a 3-for-1 stock split just to meet the Dow keepers’ minimum requirement, and a 7-for-1 split to price its stock roughly in the middle of the range of component stock prices. Amazon last split its stock, 2-for-1, in September 1999, going from nearly $120 to about $60. The Dow is very different from other widely followed broad market indexes, because it is price weighted while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are market-capitalization weighted. That means the higher the share price, the more influence it has on the Dow’s price. For example, Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -0.12%  market cap of $745 billion is nearly nine times greater than Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS, -0.55%  market cap of $87 billion. However, a 1% rise in Goldman’s stock, which currently trades above $218, would add about 15 points to the Dow, while a 1% rise in Apple shares, which trades around $142, would add about 10 points. Amazon had 486 million diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s annual report, but was authorized to have as many as 5 billion shares outstanding. That means Amazon could split its stock by a factor of up to 10 times without seeking shareholder approval to increase the number of shares outstanding. No dividend, no dice The membership committee doesn’t require a dividend, but companies that don’t pay them don’t get invited. Every current Dow component pays a dividend, with the implied dividend yield ranging from a low of 0.72% for Nike Inc. NKE, -0.98%  to a high of 4.89% for Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -2.40%   “In my memory, it’s not an issue that has come up,” Blitzer told MarketWatch. “We haven’t seriously looked at a candidate that did not pay a dividend.” In other words, Amazon hasn’t yet been a serious candidate for Dow inclusion, since the company stated in its most recent 10-K filing with Securities and Exchange Commission that it has “never declared or paid cash dividends” on its common stock. Dow crosses 21,000: more upside to come?(4:56) The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 21000 for the first time Wednesday morning. WSJ's Paul Vigna and Tanya Rivero discuss the market's response to President Trump's policies and what still concerns traders about the U.S. economy. Photo: Getty To match the lowest yield at current prices, Amazon would have to start issuing a quarterly dividend of about $1.58 a share, or about $6.34 on an annual basis, at an estimated cost of about $3.1 billion a year. The company said in its 10-K, however, that it continually evaluates opportunities to pay dividends. Stock repurchases are a little different. Despite having a $5 billion stock buyback program in place, Amazon didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016, 2015 or 2014, filings show. But that’s OK, because three current Dow components--Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.36% Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.01%  and Verizon--didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016. If Amazon is in, who’s out? For Amazon to get into the Dow, some company has to come out. An easy choice to be booted is DuPont DD, +0.46% which is expected to complete the acquisition by Dow Chemical Co. DOW, +0.36%  sometime in August 2017. That is plenty of time for Amazon to make some big changes, which it will undoubtedly describe as shareholder friendly. Of course, the Dow keepers could decide to keep the combined chemical giant in the index, to maintain sector representation, although the only sector rules that are followed are that transportation companies and utilities are excluded, since those sectors are represented by the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.08%  and the Dow Jones Utility Average. DJU, +0.69%   “Sectors are considered, but I cannot say what weight they have,” Blitzer said. The Dow already has Apple, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.37% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.03% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -1.18% but the technology weighting is still well below that of its chief large-cap rival. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average exchange-traded fund DIA, -0.13%  had a technology weighting of 14.63% as of April 19, according to Morningstar, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, -0.32%  had a 19.83% tech weighting. If the Dow keepers decide a tech member must leave to admit Amazon, Cisco’s market-cap of $164.2 billion and IBM’s of $151.6 billion are currently the lowest of the five. Don’t dis the Dow Despite the status gained by entering the Dow, recent history suggests investors may have to wait a while before it pays off. FactSet Apple’s stock had soared 40% and AT&T shares had inched up 0.7% in the year before Apple took AT&T’s Inc.’s T, -1.07%  place in the Dow on March 19, 2015. In the year that followed, Apple shares tumbled 17% while AT&T’s soared 17%. Read more about the AT&T-for-Apple swap. Eventually, the Dow curse faded, and Apple attracted the attention of the most famous value investor. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, -0.95%  had shied away from buying Apple shares before they entered Wall Street’s most-staid fraternity. He didn’t start buying Apple’s stock until the first quarter of 2016, or about one year after it entered the Dow. Since then, Buffett has boosted his stake in each quarter, to reach 57.4 million shares as of Dec. 31. Apple had reached a record close about a month before it entered the Dow, but didn’t set another record until nearly two years after it gained admittance. The following table shows how the newcomers performed relative to their replacements: Stock added (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Stock removed (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Apple (AAPL) -16.9 AT&T (T) -17.2 Goldman Sachs (GS) +9.2 Bank of America (BAC) +17.9 Visa (V) +7.6 Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) +72.0 Nike (NKE) +16.3 Alcoa (AA) +91.0 S&P Dow Jones Indices, FactSet Before investors criticize the Dow keepers, for turning new age growth companies into old-school blue chips, just look how they’ve performed relative to the broader stock market. Since Nov. 1, 1999, when the first Nasdaq-listed technology companies were admitted, the correlation coefficient between the Dow and the S&P 500 has been 0.9797, according to an analysis of FactSet data, or just shy of a perfect match. The Dow has climbed 93.33% since then, while the S&P 500 has advanced 73.80%. FactSet Don’t miss: Dow hitting 20,000 is a reminder that it’s the best active fund ever fashioned. So if Amazon splits its stock, starts paying a dividend, and it eventually enters the Dow, investors may want to step aside for a while. But check back a year later, and see if Buffett has finally become a believer.

By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor There is one thing that Amazon.com Inc.’s investors might cheer, but could end up stopping the stock’s climb to record highs in its tracks: entering the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow’s recent underperformance, and the pending acquisition of component DuPont & Co., has some on Wall Street wondering if the 121-year-old “blue chip” barometer needs some extra juice. The Dow DJIA, -0.15%  has gained 4.2% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  has advanced 5.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.11%  has run up 9.8%. Becoming one of the select 30 Dow companies might seem like validation for the e-commerce and technology giant and its investors. Amazon AMZN, -0.39% which has been public for nearly 20 years, has forced a number of industries, including retail, the cloud, logistics and media, to evolve or face extinction. Read more about how Amazon will become the first trillion-dollar company Nasdaq record high. To match it, S&P needs about 45 points. Dow, about 600 points.— Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) April 21, 2017 Quick, put Amazon in the Dow! https://t.co/etWMGh33Lb— Downtown Josh Brown (@ReformedBroker) April 21, 2017 But Amazon disciples should be careful what they wish for. Call it the Dow jinx, but recent entrants have underperformed the stocks they replaced by wide margins, often for relatively long periods. Don’t miss: Apple’s year in the Dow has been rotten for investors. Investors don’t need to worry, however, because they will have plenty of warning before Amazon gains entrance. There are two big reasons the Dow’s keepers have likely shunned the fourth-largest U.S. company by market capitalization. The stock price is too damn high While there are no hard and fast rules for the Dow’s membership committee to follow, the stock price matters. And Amazon’s is way too high, without a large-multiple stock split. “We prefer that the ratio of highest to lowest price be less than 10-to-1,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., in an interview with MarketWatch. Amazon’s stock slipped Friday to $897.99, more than 30 times the price of the current lowest priced stock in the Dow, which is General Electric Co.’s GE, -2.38%  at $29.70. FactSet Amazon would have to enact at least a 3-for-1 stock split just to meet the Dow keepers’ minimum requirement, and a 7-for-1 split to price its stock roughly in the middle of the range of component stock prices. Amazon last split its stock, 2-for-1, in September 1999, going from nearly $120 to about $60. The Dow is very different from other widely followed broad market indexes, because it is price weighted while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are market-capitalization weighted. That means the higher the share price, the more influence it has on the Dow’s price. For example, Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -0.12%  market cap of $745 billion is nearly nine times greater than Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS, -0.55%  market cap of $87 billion. However, a 1% rise in Goldman’s stock, which currently trades above $218, would add about 15 points to the Dow, while a 1% rise in Apple shares, which trades around $142, would add about 10 points. Amazon had 486 million diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s annual report, but was authorized to have as many as 5 billion shares outstanding. That means Amazon could split its stock by a factor of up to 10 times without seeking shareholder approval to increase the number of shares outstanding. No dividend, no dice The membership committee doesn’t require a dividend, but companies that don’t pay them don’t get invited. Every current Dow component pays a dividend, with the implied dividend yield ranging from a low of 0.72% for Nike Inc. NKE, -0.98%  to a high of 4.89% for Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -2.40%   “In my memory, it’s not an issue that has come up,” Blitzer told MarketWatch. “We haven’t seriously looked at a candidate that did not pay a dividend.” In other words, Amazon hasn’t yet been a serious candidate for Dow inclusion, since the company stated in its most recent 10-K filing with Securities and Exchange Commission that it has “never declared or paid cash dividends” on its common stock. Dow crosses 21,000: more upside to come?(4:56) The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 21000 for the first time Wednesday morning. WSJ's Paul Vigna and Tanya Rivero discuss the market's response to President Trump's policies and what still concerns traders about the U.S. economy. Photo: Getty To match the lowest yield at current prices, Amazon would have to start issuing a quarterly dividend of about $1.58 a share, or about $6.34 on an annual basis, at an estimated cost of about $3.1 billion a year. The company said in its 10-K, however, that it continually evaluates opportunities to pay dividends. Stock repurchases are a little different. Despite having a $5 billion stock buyback program in place, Amazon didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016, 2015 or 2014, filings show. But that’s OK, because three current Dow components--Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.36% Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.01%  and Verizon--didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016. If Amazon is in, who’s out? For Amazon to get into the Dow, some company has to come out. An easy choice to be booted is DuPont DD, +0.46% which is expected to complete the acquisition by Dow Chemical Co. DOW, +0.36%  sometime in August 2017. That is plenty of time for Amazon to make some big changes, which it will undoubtedly describe as shareholder friendly. Of course, the Dow keepers could decide to keep the combined chemical giant in the index, to maintain sector representation, although the only sector rules that are followed are that transportation companies and utilities are excluded, since those sectors are represented by the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.08%  and the Dow Jones Utility Average. DJU, +0.69%   “Sectors are considered, but I cannot say what weight they have,” Blitzer said. The Dow already has Apple, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.37% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.03% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -1.18% but the technology weighting is still well below that of its chief large-cap rival. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average exchange-traded fund DIA, -0.13%  had a technology weighting of 14.63% as of April 19, according to Morningstar, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, -0.32%  had a 19.83% tech weighting. If the Dow keepers decide a tech member must leave to admit Amazon, Cisco’s market-cap of $164.2 billion and IBM’s of $151.6 billion are currently the lowest of the five. Don’t dis the Dow Despite the status gained by entering the Dow, recent history suggests investors may have to wait a while before it pays off. FactSet Apple’s stock had soared 40% and AT&T shares had inched up 0.7% in the year before Apple took AT&T’s Inc.’s T, -1.07%  place in the Dow on March 19, 2015. In the year that followed, Apple shares tumbled 17% while AT&T’s soared 17%. Read more about the AT&T-for-Apple swap. Eventually, the Dow curse faded, and Apple attracted the attention of the most famous value investor. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, -0.95%  had shied away from buying Apple shares before they entered Wall Street’s most-staid fraternity. He didn’t start buying Apple’s stock until the first quarter of 2016, or about one year after it entered the Dow. Since then, Buffett has boosted his stake in each quarter, to reach 57.4 million shares as of Dec. 31. Apple had reached a record close about a month before it entered the Dow, but didn’t set another record until nearly two years after it gained admittance. The following table shows how the newcomers performed relative to their replacements: Stock added (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Stock removed (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Apple (AAPL) -16.9 AT&T (T) -17.2 Goldman Sachs (GS) +9.2 Bank of America (BAC) +17.9 Visa (V) +7.6 Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) +72.0 Nike (NKE) +16.3 Alcoa (AA) +91.0 S&P Dow Jones Indices, FactSet Before investors criticize the Dow keepers, for turning new age growth companies into old-school blue chips, just look how they’ve performed relative to the broader stock market. Since Nov. 1, 1999, when the first Nasdaq-listed technology companies were admitted, the correlation coefficient between the Dow and the S&P 500 has been 0.9797, according to an analysis of FactSet data, or just shy of a perfect match. The Dow has climbed 93.33% since then, while the S&P 500 has advanced 73.80%. FactSet Don’t miss: Dow hitting 20,000 is a reminder that it’s the best active fund ever fashioned. So if Amazon splits its stock, starts paying a dividend, and it eventually enters the Dow, investors may want to step aside for a while. But check back a year later, and see if Buffett has finally become a believer.

Apple quietly made one of its coolest hires ever. The company recently brought on Steven Keating, the MIT doctoral student who made a 3D printout of his own brain after he was diagnosed with a tumor. We don't know whether Keating is working on one of Apple's teams dedicated to health care, given his affinity for the space, or whether he has joined another team that would take advantage of his mechanical engineering expertise. Keating spoke today at Sage Bionetworks' annual conference, Assembly, which brings together patient advocates and researchers to discuss open innovation in science. Keating, who is listed on the agenda as working on Apple, still lists his occupation as a doctoral candidate at MIT Media Lab on his LinkedIn profile. He previously worked as a product design intern at Apple during the summer of 2013. Steven Keating (of @Apple ) gives out 3D printed copies of his brain tumor (now cut out) instead of business cards #sageassembly— Magdalena Skipper (@Magda_Skipper) April 20, 2017 Apple declined to comment. Keating made headlines in 2015 after revealing the depths of his science experiment to better understand his own tumor. Keating told Vox that he collected 75 gigabytes of his health information, ranging from his tumor pathology slides to his medical information. At the Assembly conference, he spoke about the challenges for patients to aggregate their own medical data. Keating said he ended up going to medical school at least in part so he could study his own tissue. He also described giving 3-D models of his brain tumor to family members as Christmas tree ornaments, according to a person who attended the session. Sage Bionetworks, a nonprofit research organization, has been a major proponent of Apple's ResearchKit software, which is designed to make it easier for medical researchers to launch mobile-based studies. Sage's cofounder Stephen Friend joined Apple in June of 2016, after his company developed a suite of apps that leveraged ResearchKit's open-source framework to study diseases ranging from breast cancer to Parkinson's. Keating has publicly shared his commitment to helping patients gain access to their own health data, a mission that seems in line with Apple's approach to the sector (despite its notoriously closed approach). As I previously reported, the iPhone maker recently acquired a personal health data startup called Gliimpse, which is designed to help people aggregate their medical information. As Keating commented in a previous interview: "Can we have a simple, standardized share button at the hospital? Where is the Google Maps, Facebook, or Dropbox for health? It needs to be simple, understandable, and easy, as small barriers add up quickly." Christina FarrReporter for CNBC.com

Though he's no longer involved with the company he helped build, Wozniak remains a figure in the tech world, speaking at conferences and offering insights on the state of the industry. He even did a stint on ABC's "Dancing With the Stars" back in 2009. But his attitude toward money is surprisingly different from that of most of his peers. In a recent interview with Fortune, the tech icon shares his straightforward investing strategy, which is to avoid it and to keep his distance from finance altogether. "I do not invest. I don't do that stuff," Wozniak tells Fortune. "I didn't want to be near money, because it could corrupt your values." Getty Images Steve Wozniak Wozniak says he doesn't like the growing Silicon Valley trend of "engineers as rock stars," a construct that didn't exist at the time he was helping build Apple: "Mostly it's because of how much money they have — and I went the other way. I did not want to be one of them." Wozniak aimed to build innovative products and improve the world with Apple, not to get rich. "I really didn't want to be in that super 'more than you could ever need' category," he says. Rather, Wozniak chose to invest in things close to his heart, such as museums in San Jose, Calif., his hometown. "I was born there, and I have a street named after me there because of it," he says. Tony Avelar | Bloomberg | Getty Images Steve Jobs, right, with his friend and co-founder, Steve Wozniak Wozniak gained his fair share of wealth when Apple went public: Today, he's worth an estimated $100 million. By contrast, Steve Jobs, Wozniak's Apple co-founder, was worth around $10.2 billion when he passed away in 2011. One initial reason for this divergence in net worth is Wozniak's disinterest in money from the start. Back in 1980, he offered $10 million of his own stock to early Apple employees, something Jobs refused to do. He later called the move "the right thing" to do. Jobs' eventual fortune also came primarily from his stake in Disney, not from his Apple earnings. Current CEO of Apple Tim Cook shares Wozniak's concerns about the way riches can corrupt. He recently told college students, "Don't work for money — it will wear out fast, or you'll never make enough and you will never be happy, one or the other." Instead, he suggested, "You have to find the intersection of doing something you're passionate about and at the same time something that is in the service of other people."

By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor There is one thing that Amazon.com Inc.’s investors might cheer, but could end up stopping the stock’s climb to record highs in its tracks: entering the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow’s recent underperformance, and the pending acquisition of component DuPont & Co., has some on Wall Street wondering if the 121-year-old “blue chip” barometer needs some extra juice. The Dow DJIA, -0.15%  has gained 4.2% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  has advanced 5.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.11%  has run up 9.8%. Becoming one of the select 30 Dow companies might seem like validation for the e-commerce and technology giant and its investors. Amazon AMZN, -0.39% which has been public for nearly 20 years, has forced a number of industries, including retail, the cloud, logistics and media, to evolve or face extinction. Read more about how Amazon will become the first trillion-dollar company Nasdaq record high. To match it, S&P needs about 45 points. Dow, about 600 points.— Carl Quintanilla (@carlquintanilla) April 21, 2017 Quick, put Amazon in the Dow! https://t.co/etWMGh33Lb— Downtown Josh Brown (@ReformedBroker) April 21, 2017 But Amazon disciples should be careful what they wish for. Call it the Dow jinx, but recent entrants have underperformed the stocks they replaced by wide margins, often for relatively long periods. Don’t miss: Apple’s year in the Dow has been rotten for investors. Investors don’t need to worry, however, because they will have plenty of warning before Amazon gains entrance. There are two big reasons the Dow’s keepers have likely shunned the fourth-largest U.S. company by market capitalization. The stock price is too damn high While there are no hard and fast rules for the Dow’s membership committee to follow, the stock price matters. And Amazon’s is way too high, without a large-multiple stock split. “We prefer that the ratio of highest to lowest price be less than 10-to-1,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., in an interview with MarketWatch. Amazon’s stock slipped Friday to $897.99, more than 30 times the price of the current lowest priced stock in the Dow, which is General Electric Co.’s GE, -2.38%  at $29.70. FactSet Amazon would have to enact at least a 3-for-1 stock split just to meet the Dow keepers’ minimum requirement, and a 7-for-1 split to price its stock roughly in the middle of the range of component stock prices. Amazon last split its stock, 2-for-1, in September 1999, going from nearly $120 to about $60. The Dow is very different from other widely followed broad market indexes, because it is price weighted while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are market-capitalization weighted. That means the higher the share price, the more influence it has on the Dow’s price. For example, Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -0.12%  market cap of $745 billion is nearly nine times greater than Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s GS, -0.55%  market cap of $87 billion. However, a 1% rise in Goldman’s stock, which currently trades above $218, would add about 15 points to the Dow, while a 1% rise in Apple shares, which trades around $142, would add about 10 points. Amazon had 486 million diluted shares outstanding as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s annual report, but was authorized to have as many as 5 billion shares outstanding. That means Amazon could split its stock by a factor of up to 10 times without seeking shareholder approval to increase the number of shares outstanding. No dividend, no dice The membership committee doesn’t require a dividend, but companies that don’t pay them don’t get invited. Every current Dow component pays a dividend, with the implied dividend yield ranging from a low of 0.72% for Nike Inc. NKE, -0.98%  to a high of 4.89% for Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -2.40%   “In my memory, it’s not an issue that has come up,” Blitzer told MarketWatch. “We haven’t seriously looked at a candidate that did not pay a dividend.” In other words, Amazon hasn’t yet been a serious candidate for Dow inclusion, since the company stated in its most recent 10-K filing with Securities and Exchange Commission that it has “never declared or paid cash dividends” on its common stock. Dow crosses 21,000: more upside to come?(4:56) The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 21000 for the first time Wednesday morning. WSJ's Paul Vigna and Tanya Rivero discuss the market's response to President Trump's policies and what still concerns traders about the U.S. economy. Photo: Getty To match the lowest yield at current prices, Amazon would have to start issuing a quarterly dividend of about $1.58 a share, or about $6.34 on an annual basis, at an estimated cost of about $3.1 billion a year. The company said in its 10-K, however, that it continually evaluates opportunities to pay dividends. Stock repurchases are a little different. Despite having a $5 billion stock buyback program in place, Amazon didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016, 2015 or 2014, filings show. But that’s OK, because three current Dow components--Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.36% Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.01%  and Verizon--didn’t repurchase any shares in 2016. If Amazon is in, who’s out? For Amazon to get into the Dow, some company has to come out. An easy choice to be booted is DuPont DD, +0.46% which is expected to complete the acquisition by Dow Chemical Co. DOW, +0.36%  sometime in August 2017. That is plenty of time for Amazon to make some big changes, which it will undoubtedly describe as shareholder friendly. Of course, the Dow keepers could decide to keep the combined chemical giant in the index, to maintain sector representation, although the only sector rules that are followed are that transportation companies and utilities are excluded, since those sectors are represented by the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +0.08%  and the Dow Jones Utility Average. DJU, +0.69%   “Sectors are considered, but I cannot say what weight they have,” Blitzer said. The Dow already has Apple, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.37% Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.03% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -1.18% but the technology weighting is still well below that of its chief large-cap rival. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average exchange-traded fund DIA, -0.13%  had a technology weighting of 14.63% as of April 19, according to Morningstar, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, -0.32%  had a 19.83% tech weighting. If the Dow keepers decide a tech member must leave to admit Amazon, Cisco’s market-cap of $164.2 billion and IBM’s of $151.6 billion are currently the lowest of the five. Don’t dis the Dow Despite the status gained by entering the Dow, recent history suggests investors may have to wait a while before it pays off. FactSet Apple’s stock had soared 40% and AT&T shares had inched up 0.7% in the year before Apple took AT&T’s Inc.’s T, -1.07%  place in the Dow on March 19, 2015. In the year that followed, Apple shares tumbled 17% while AT&T’s soared 17%. Read more about the AT&T-for-Apple swap. Eventually, the Dow curse faded, and Apple attracted the attention of the most famous value investor. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, -0.95%  had shied away from buying Apple shares before they entered Wall Street’s most-staid fraternity. He didn’t start buying Apple’s stock until the first quarter of 2016, or about one year after it entered the Dow. Since then, Buffett has boosted his stake in each quarter, to reach 57.4 million shares as of Dec. 31. Apple had reached a record close about a month before it entered the Dow, but didn’t set another record until nearly two years after it gained admittance. The following table shows how the newcomers performed relative to their replacements: Stock added (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Stock removed (ticker) 1-year move (%) after change Apple (AAPL) -16.9 AT&T (T) -17.2 Goldman Sachs (GS) +9.2 Bank of America (BAC) +17.9 Visa (V) +7.6 Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) +72.0 Nike (NKE) +16.3 Alcoa (AA) +91.0 S&P Dow Jones Indices, FactSet Before investors criticize the Dow keepers, for turning new age growth companies into old-school blue chips, just look how they’ve performed relative to the broader stock market. Since Nov. 1, 1999, when the first Nasdaq-listed technology companies were admitted, the correlation coefficient between the Dow and the S&P 500 has been 0.9797, according to an analysis of FactSet data, or just shy of a perfect match. The Dow has climbed 93.33% since then, while the S&P 500 has advanced 73.80%. FactSet Don’t miss: Dow hitting 20,000 is a reminder that it’s the best active fund ever fashioned. So if Amazon splits its stock, starts paying a dividend, and it eventually enters the Dow, investors may want to step aside for a while. But check back a year later, and see if Buffett has finally become a believer.

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's the rebirth of satellite Internet iPhone 8 rumors: Apple might move Touch ID to the back of the device Video Is Snapchat building the iPhone killer? Apple has a new high-flying project in the works. According to Bloomberg, Apple is getting involved in launching satellites that would beam down broadband Internet access. Recently, Apple poached two Google satellite executives to form a new hardware team within the company. John Fenwick led Google’s spacecraft operations and Michael Trela was head of satellite engineering. The report adds that Fenwick and Trela will now report to Greg Duffy, the Dropcam founder who joined Apple earlier this year. Presumably, they will be working on a secret project to design and develop Apple’s own satellites.  Another recent development that points to Apple’s growing interest in this area is a partnership with Boeing to launch more than 1,000 low-orbit satellites. Apple has held discussions with Boeing about being an investor/partner in the project, according to Bloomberg. Furthermore, aerospace insiders believe Apple is helping fund the Boeing satellites. It’s not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation. “It’s not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation,” wrote Tim Farrar, a satellite consultant at TMF Associates. “SpaceX alone could generate $30 billion in revenue from satellite Internet by 2025.” Why this matters: A world with better access to faster, low-latency Internet will definitely help Apple’s future. It would help increase the demand for the iPhone in emerging markets, and also help make connected homes the next big thing. There are a few caveats, however. Satellite-beamed “Internet from the sky” has long been a dream for major tech companies, including Google and Facebook, which would also benefit from a more-connected world. But launching a fleet of satellites has proven to be expensive and risky, and many satellite companies have gone out of business as a result. It’s entirely possible that Apple hired the ex-Googlers to work on a project that’s more down to earth. Duffy’s experience is more in consumer products and image-capturing, so perhaps Apple’s new hardware team could be creating drones for improving Maps, and thus replacing the camera-equipped minivans.

Joe Mullin - Apr 21, 2017 7:30 pm UTC Enlarge / Headquarters of Finnish telecom equipment group Nokia. Getty Images / RONI REKOMAA / Stringer reader comments 28 Share this story The largest publicly traded patent-assertion company, Acacia Research, has launched a new lawsuit (PDF) against Apple and all the major cell phone carriers. Cellular Communications Equipment, LLC, a unit of Acacia, has sued Apple, Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile. The company says that the five industry giants infringe four patents related to basic cell phone technologies. All four patents originated at Nokia, which has been sharing its patents in so-called "patent privateering" arrangements for some years now. Further ReadingPatent enforcement company slams Apple with $22M verdict after East Texas trialLike so many lawsuits, the CCE v. Apple et al. case is based in the patent hotspot of East Texas, which is still considered favorable ground for patent plaintiffs. Acacia is based in Southern California, but the complaint says CCE's principal place of business is an office in Plano, which is within the Eastern District of Texas. Patent privateering takes place when an operating company shares its patents with a patent-assertion entity for a cut of the profits. It allows operating companies to make money off the business of pure patent litigation, sometimes derided as "patent trolling." Apple is clearly sick of Nokia's privateering. In December, Apple filed an antitrust lawsuit against Nokia, saying the company hatched a plan to work with "its PAE [patent assertion entity] co-conspirators" to enforce a diffused patent portfolio, "to maximize the aggregate royalties that can be extracted from product companies." Nokia responded by filing a huge patent infringement lawsuit against Apple the following day. Further ReadingSmartphone patent wars redux: Nokia sues Apple, big timeAnother company using Nokia patents, MobileMedia Ideas, won a $3 million jury verdict last year. Nokia did a major deal with another patent-licensing company, Pendrell, in 2013. This week's CCE lawsuit is something of a pile-on, since CCE already won a $22.1 million verdict against Apple in September for infringing on a different patent. The patents in this suit are numbered 6,892,074, 8,902,770, 8,254,872, and 9,037,129. Their filing dates range from 1997 to 2010. The '074 patent, filed in 1997, describes using primary and secondary "mobile stations" to receive voice calls and text messages. The '770 patent relates to "carrier aggregation" and signaling between networks. The '872 patent has to do with making emergency calls "without registering with IP Multimedia Subsystem," and it was disclosed to the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) group as a standard-essential patent. The '129 patent relates to getting emergency alerts. Joe Mullin Joe has covered the intersection of law and technology, including the world's biggest copyright and patent battles, since 2007.

View All Editorials → Apple Music Launches Up Next Series with 6LACK Interview Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet 1 minute read Apr 21st, 2017 2:22 PM EDT | News Apple is moving forward with its original content plans for Apple Music with a new artist interview series called Up Next. The monthly interviews start off with Zane Lowe interviewing singer and rapper 6LACK. Apple Music’s Up Next series debuts with 6LACK The series is being presented as interviews with “music’s next generation” in the form of short documentaries and interviews. Apple hyped the series on Twitter saying there will be a new interview every month. Apple’s special page on Apple Music for the 6LACK interview states, Considering he made his recording debut at the age of four, you could say that 6LACK – pronounced “black” – was born to do this. The singer/rapper transcended the Atlanta underground with last year’s “PRBLMS”, a bold showcase of late-night, R&B-inflected hip-hop. The unfiltered personal narratives of his full-length debut, FREE 6LACK, proved that “PRBLMS” was just the beginning. Explore 6LACK’s blossoming catalog, watch his incredible live performance in Atlanta, and get to know him through our exclusive documentary and in-depth interview with Beats 1’s Zane Lowe. Apple is actively hunting for original music-related content for Apple Music, and Up Next is just the latest addition to the lineup. Apple also has original shows in the form of Carpool Karaoke, Vital Signs and Planet of the Apps coming, and just landed the exclusive rights to the Clive Davis documentary Clive Davis: The Soundtrack Of Our Lives that opened this year’s Tribeca Film Festival. Up Next also includes artist performances, titled Up Next Sessions. Introducing #UpNext. Music’s Next Generation. A new artist every month. Up first, @6LACK.https://t.co/mPtDdmNNLG pic.twitter.com/qq62ggEyCh — Apple Music (@AppleMusic) April 20, 2017 In some ways, Up Next feels a lot like Apple’s failed Apple Music Connect feature. The idea was to give artists a way to share songs and behind the scenes information with fans, but it never really took off. Up Next looks like Apple’s attempt to fix that by offering a look into artist’s lives in a more compelling and intimate way. For artists on the rise Up Next could be a powerful tool to help push their careers to a new level. For Apple, it’s a way to make Apple Music more enticing to current and new subscribers.

Which Won't Make it to 2067? View All Editorials → Apple Injury Reports Hint at Augmented Reality Glasses Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet 2 minute read Apr 21st, 2017 10:29 AM EDT | News Thanks to a leaked health and safety report we have some clues into what projects Apple is working on, and it looks like augmented reality glasses may be on that list. Two employees suffered from eye injuries from lasers attached to some form of headgear, which sounds a lot like a wearable augmented reality device. Apple eye injury reports hint at augmented reality plans The report wasn’t supposed to be public, but an environmental health and safety contractor accidentally emailed it to a few hundred Apple employees. Gizmodo got ahold of the report, too, and found references to mundane workplace accidents like running into doors, along with more interesting incidents like the eye laser injuries and a company-owned minivan hitting an employee. Apple’s Eye on Augmented Reality The first incident hinting at Apple’s augmented reality plans happened on February 21 and involved a prototype device. The report states, After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. A second incident on March 2nd references eye pain and noted the security seal “on the magenta outer case had been broken.” Both are in line with the idea that Apple is exploring augmented reality gear. Apple CEO Tim Cook said his company is very interested in augmented reality, although he hasn’t elaborated on what form that’s taking. It’s likely Apple will start by adding augmented reality features to the iPhone, and expand from there. Some form of wearable accessory is the next logical step. Based on these incident reports, it looks like Apple is already heading down that path. The leaked safety incidents follows a report claiming the iPhone 8 will include an iPad Pro-like smart connector that could be used with augmented reality glasses. Assuming the report is right, the glasses will most likely be an accessory instead of a required component for Apple’s augmented reality experience. Apple’s Minivan Versus Pedestrian Incident On March 21st an Apple employee was struck by a company owned minivan as it left a parking garage. The report says, Minivan 82 turned left leaving the [Vallco Parkway] parking lot and struck a pedestrian (Apple employee) crossing the sidewalk from the opposite direction (at the intersection of Vallco parkway and Main Street Drive Garage Parkway.) The crosswalk signal was white, the van turned on a green light. When the van struck the employee, he fell back several feet; he suffered minor injuries. The speculation is that the van is part of Apple’s self driving vehicle project and the computer system responded to the situation incorrectly. That’s possible considering the company has a permit to test autonomous vehicles on public roads in California. It’s also possible a van driver simply failed to notice the pedestrian and drove into them. This may be a case of trying to make an isolated incident fit into the Apple Car narrative. The eye injury reports seems to be a clearer hint into Apple’s plans than the minivan incident. Regardless, it’s a safe bet Apple is already looking for a new environment health and safety contractor.

The company just hired Alphabet’s John Fenwick, who was Google’s head of spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, Fenwick’s colleague and head of satellite engineering, to be part of a new team under Dropcam co-founder Greg Duffy. Apple hired Duffy, who himself left Alphabet in 2015 shortly after Nest acquired Dropcam, earlier this year for an undisclosed position. Apple is putting resources toward satellites and space It’s unclear what exactly Duffy’s unit is working on, but Fenwick and Trela’s expertise in the satellite business seems to suggest the company is looking into internet delivery. Fenwick was the co-founder of SkyBox Imaging, a satellite company Google acquired in 2014 and later sold to competitor Planet Labs back in February of this year. Another big name in the satellite business, Greg Wyler, left Google back in 2014 to work with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, and Google ultimately invested $1 billion alongside Fidelity in the space transportation company it appears in lieu of building out its own division. So it’s clear the general winding down of satellite work at Google has pushed some of its in-house talent to competitors, but Apple is still a peculiar pick given its nonexistent track record in the satellite space. Both Facebook and Alphabet are the biggest players in the tech industry when it comes to delivering internet over the air, with Facebook working on solar-powered drones and Alphabet having shifted its resources from satellites and drones of its own to its hot-air balloon project Loon and Google Fiber unit. But telecom consultant Tim Farrar wrote last month that Apple is funding a Boeing effort to deliver internet using a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites. Duffy’s role at Apple working under Dan Riccio, who oversees Apple’s consumer hardware teams, also suggests Apple could be building some of this tech itself, according to Bloomberg. While what the iPhone maker is up to is all very murky right now, it’s clear CEO Tim Cook has gotten serious about looking beyond smartphones and other consumer electronics and into more forward-looking industries like satellite internet and self-driving cars.

Trending in Apple Here’s what the Hackintosh community wants in the new modular Mac Pro Yesterday AAPL: 142.27 -0.17 Apple creates new hardware team led by former Google execs Michael Potuck - Apr. 21st 2017 11:16 am PT @michaelpotuck Google Apple Maps View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit It’s well known that Apple is working hard to bring innovation to augmented reality and self-driving cars (in some capacity). However, new hires recently made by the company are making a satellite constellation project seem likely. AirPods A new Bloomberg report details that Apple has hired two former Google satellite executives as it starts a new hardware team. The iPhone maker has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, according to people familiar with the matter. John Fenwick, who led Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering, left Alphabet Inc.’s Google for Apple in recent weeks, the people said. They report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam, who joined Apple earlier this year, the people said. Satellite design and operation are highly expensive and the report notes that most projects in this field are focused on collecting images or for communications. An unnamed source shared that Boeing has plans to roll out a satellite broadband network and Apple has been it talks with the company about possible involvement. In a regulatory filing last year, Boeing Co. detailed a plan to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It’s unclear if those talks will result in a deal. However, Apple may be more interested in how this new hardware team headed by Fenwick and Trela could improve its maps services and possible integration with future AR features. It’s already trying to use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans. And in 2015, it acquired Aether Industries LLC, which develops near-space technology such as high bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. This seems a more likely focus for this new endeavor as Fenwick and Trela’s direct report Greg Duffy has mostly image and video product experience from his time at Dropcam. The unnamed source(s) close to this matter also pointed out that Apple’s SVP of hardware engineering, Dan Riccio, will oversee this team as he already does for Apple’s AR work.

Scholarship winners receive free tickets to WWDC, a huge benefit as a ticket is normally priced at $1,599. Apple is also providing scholarship winners with free lodging this year, housing them at the San Jose State University dorms, located approximately 15 minutes away from the venue when walking. To win a WWDC scholarship, students and STEM members were tasked with sharing a three-minute visually interactive scene created in Swift Playgrounds. Entries were judged on technical accomplishment, creativity of ideas, and content of written responses. Scholarship winners must accept the scholarship award by April 28. Apple has also already selected WWDC ticket lottery winners and charged chosen developers the attendance fee. Developers and students who were not selected to attend WWDC are able to watch both the keynote event and sessions with engineers through the Apple Developer website and the WWDC app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.

Credit: USPTO More like this iPhone 8 rumors: Apple might move Touch ID to the back of the device Facebook ventures into augmented reality, but Apple could do it better 3 technologies to keep an eye on in 2017 Video What happens to companies that depend on the iPhone? Is Apple really making a Google Glass-esque augmented reality device? We’re still skeptical, but a new report indicates the company is at least testing some sort of head-adjacent wearable. A safety inspector contracted with Apple accidentally emailed an incident report to hundreds of Apple employees, who then sent the document to Gizmodo. The report details 70-plus health and safety incidents that involved Apple employees, two of which experienced injury or pain to the eye after using a mysterious prototype. What kind of prototype would hurt your eye? Perhaps a pair of augmented reality glasses? One report described a February 21 incident: “After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis.” On March 2, another employee also had an eye incident: “Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with.” OK, there’s little to no detail here. It’s not even clear if the two employees were using versions of the same device or totally different products. But Apple CEO Tim Cook has made bold statements about augmented reality over the last year, indicating that the company is working on AR products (though we hear the near-term vision for that technology is the iPhone). The incident reports hint at other in-development projects, such as self-driving cars, and new Apple Watch features like ski-tracking, but there’s little in the way of specifics. And just because Apple employees are testing prototypes doesn’t mean any of this hardware will come to market. If Apple is in fact experimenting with augmented reality glasses, we’d prefer they wait to release them until, you know, the employee injuries are a thing of the past.

WWDC scholarship winners receive free access to the conference which usually has a $1599 ticket cost for entry. Sony A6500 This year Apple’s application process included a stronger emphasis on using Apple’s Swift Playgrounds app rather than supplying a finished app. Apple has also expanded the scholarship program to cover both the cost of entry for everyone and travel accommodations for some as well as lodging for the first time. WWDC is scheduled to kick off on Monday, June 5 in San Jose, California near Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino. Apple has held its developer conference in San Francisco since WWDC began selling out, however, so the location marks a major change for the event. Winning applicants must respond by April 28 to accept the WWDC scholarship. Applicants who did not receive the award this year are also being notified today. Apple is expected to introduce iOS 11, macOS 10.13, tvOS 11, and watchOS 4 at WWDC 2017.

 Apple just nabbed two top Google executives to run a secret hardware team Kif Leswing Apr. 21, 2017, 1:45 PM 4,516 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Apple may be working on satellites. The company best known for the iPhone has hired two Google executives who were working on building satellites for the search giant, Bloomberg reported on Friday. John Fenwick and Michael Trela joined Apple in recent weeks from Google, and they'll report to Greg Duffy, who was the founder of Dropcam, which was bought by Alphabet-owned Nest.  Duffy joined Apple earlier this year. The Information reported that he was leading "a special project at Apple that is operating like a startup within the company."  Bloomberg suggests that Apple may be working on satellites that distrubute broadband service, as Facebook and Google have experimented with in the past. According to the report, Apple bought a company called Aether Industries LLC in 2015 that specialized in "near-space technology."  At a recent satellite conference, Apple was rumored to be backing a Boeing plan to launch 1000 satellites for providing broadband internet access.  Of course, Apple is working on lots of stuff, and Duffy's background is in consumer products, such as the web-connected security camera Dropcam. We reached out to Apple. There are a lot more details over at Bloomberg.  SEE ALSO: Apple hired the Dropcam founder who clashed with Tony Fadell NOW WATCH: I wear these computer glasses every day even though I have perfect vision — here's why Loading video...

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive VVAPL executive director stepping down after 30 years Friday Apr 21, 2017 at 10:54 AM Apr 21, 2017 at 10:54 AM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — After decades of defending the lives of animals, one community leader has hung up the leash and is planning to move out of state. Kathy Williamson, who served as executive director for the Victor Valley Animal Protection League and Human Society for 30 years, has retired and is preparing to settle down in Idaho with her husband, Lance. “I knew the day would come to hang it up and retire,” said Williamson, who worked at the VVAPL located on Zuni Road in northern Apple Valley. “It’s a combination of my age and the desire to spend some time traveling with my husband.” Williamson, who’s been married for 30 years, said the couple is moving to be closer to family. She’s also looks forward to discovering the “serenity” that comes with living in Boise, “the big town with a small town feel.” “We’ve already met our new neighbors in Idaho and they’ve welcomed us with open arms and homemade cookies,” Williamson said. “I know we’re excited to get to know them.” According to Williamson, the VVAPL is being left in “good hands,” with “valuable leaders” who have taken the reigns of the 59-year-old nonprofit that has provided shelter to homeless animals relinquished by their guardians, rescued from abuse or neglect, and stray or abandoned animals. Williamson, who will stay on board as the league’s consultant until the end of August, said her former role will be filled by several individuals who have a long history with the VVAPL. Key roles at the shelter will include VVAPL Director Sherri Quinn, spokeswoman Terry Saenz, Adoption Manager/Assistant Director Jennifer Lane and Operations Manager Billy Reddington. “Our staff is stronger than ever and I’m confident they’ll continue to take the shelter in the right direction,” Williamson said. “It’s hard to leave, but it's the right time.” Williamson said she took the job as executive director after serving on the VVAPL’s board for 17 years. Her plans were to serve as director for a short time, “iron out the bugs” and return to her career as a school teacher. Looking back on 30 years, Williamson said she’s seen the VVAPL go through many positive changes, including seeing the “public’s perception” of the VVAPL transition from “a dog pound where people do horrible things to animals” to a “caring place where we find animals good homes and promote spay and neutering programs.” “The biggest challenge has been working with cities to get them on board with lowering the euthanasia rate,” Williamson said. “Overall, they’re moving in the right direction and doing the right thing.” Williams credits the many individuals, businesses and agencies who have supported the VVAPL over the years, calling their generosity “the backbone” of the organization. “The Victor Valley Animal Protection League was founded on the purpose of saving animals,” Williamson said. “It’s good to know the mission and purpose will live on.” For more information on the VVAPL, visit www.vvapl.com.

The company announced this through its recently-released 2016 environmental responsibility report, and via a nice little rollout with the help of Vice.  Everything Apple builds, they say, will one day be made from recyclable materials such as copper, aluminum, and tin. No more digging up the Earth for cobalt, tantalum, tungsten and other rare earth metals. SEE ALSO: New drone footage gives us the best look at Apple's spaceship campus yet But Apple has no public timeline to complete this goal. Lisa Jackson, the company's vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives, told Vice that company officials are a bit "nervous" because they don't have a plan, either.  Some of this seems fine — the goal, after all, is admirable, as it sets a higher target than Apple's competitors. It was even lauded (with caveats) by Greenpeace, an advocacy organization.  A man carries a bag of copper at a mine quarry and cobalt pit in Lubumbashi on May 23, 2016.More Image: JUNIOR KANNAH/AFP/Getty ImagesAFP/Getty Images But Apple is choosing not to take some steps that would speed up their timeline. First, Jackson said Apple is not about to make it easier for customers to repair their own phones.  She defended that stance with this: “I think trying to pretend that we can sort of make it easy to repair the product, and that you get the product that you think you’re buying — that you want — isn’t the answer.” Apple needs minerals mined from the ground to build its products, as do its rivals. Those products are held together with special screws and other pieces you can't find in the average repair shop. This is intentional.  It means Apple can make money when it sells you an iPhone and on your return to the Apple store after you've fumbled your phone down the stairs and lacerated its screen. Instead of being able to fix your phone with readily available generic parts, each broken iPhone means more mining for the creation of specialized items.  Either that, or iPhone owners decide to buy a new one, since the price of repairs often makes it more cost-effective to just get an updated device. If repairs were made easier, though, that would increase the longevity of Apple's products, which would in turn reduce the demand for mining.  Alas. Folks trying to buy iPhones in Amsterdam.More Read More Image: lex van Lieshout/Epa/REX/Shutterstock Speaking of fewer phones, Apple has been accused of planning the demise of old devices, forcing the purchase of new ones. A December, 2015 lawsuit, for example,  alleged Apple knew a software upgrade could hamper its older devices. The company makes its recyclers shred old devices so they can't be reused. Whether you believe this is a deliberate move to create product obsolescence or not, the company does roll out new products with regularity, and it certainly doesn't discourage you from discarding your still more than functional iPhone for the shiny next edition.  Apple's environmental responsibility report acknowledges their mining goal will take "many years," and Jackson told Vice that only a marginal amount of the iPhone is currently built from recyclable materials. Perhaps that's why they haven't released a timeline and don't have a plan?  Thus far, Apple's touted recycling initiatives include "disassembly robots" that pull apart old iPhones for use in new ones, and a campaign "encouraging more customers to recycle their old devices through Apple Renew."  Again, fine, sure. These are good things that will benefit the environment. But when a seemingly major component of your anti-mining initiative is to ask customers to give you their old devices on top of regularly purchasing those devices and repairing said devices only at your shops, it feels a little like a goal that will be achieved on a timeline tied to profit, not speed. This is hardly sufficient for the most valuable company on Earth, which prides itself on its environmental ambitions.  WATCH: iPhone 8 rumors include a 'Smart Connector' for AR headset Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Pogue's Basics: How to create a search-and-replace macro in Word Yahoo Tech Someone rendered that leaked iPhone 8 design, and it looks even worse than we thought BGR News Build your own DIY video game console Yahoo Tech The first flying car is available for pre-order Yahoo Tech Trump says he will release tax reform package next week Associated Press Inside the World's Greatest Scavenger Hunt, Part 1 Yahoo Tech This gadget can turn an ordinary surface into a smart controller Yahoo Tech Verizon is losing customers like crazy, even with unlimited data plans BGR News Jeff Bezos describes one change some Amazon employees hated Yahoo Tech Pogue's Basics: How to forward a text message Yahoo Tech It’s official: Everyone hates the iPhone 8 design that just leaked BGR News Jeff Bezos: Nobody asked for one of our most popular services Yahoo Tech

Phones by David Carnoy April 21, 2017 4:15 AM PDT @DavidCarnoy Samsung Galaxy S8: The good, the bad, the beautiful A stunning, curved display and excellent camera meet an awkward fingerprint reader and work-in-progress digital assistant. by Jessica Dolcourt 4:41 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Every year Samsung announces its new hero Galaxy phone in the spring, half a year before the new iPhone comes out in the fall. And every year, a few pundits write articles about how it might be the right time to switch from iPhone to Galaxy -- or really from iOS to Android. The problem with writing this article is that every year Samsung brings out a phone that's arguably better than the iPhone, but then six months later, Apple counters with something new, improved and just innovative enough to keep its legions of fans -- Android fanboys invariably call them sheeple -- from bolting from the iOS herd. Enlarge Image After playing around with the Galaxy S8 Plus, I was tempted to make the switch. David Carnoy/CNET In fact, a relatively small percentage of users end up switching from iOS to Android and vice versa each year. In a recent article, the Wall Street Journal cited stats from market researcher Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, which reported that 11 percent of former Android users bought an iPhone in 2016 while 15 percent of former iPhone users switched to Android. Of course, iPhone users aren't all switching from an iPhone to a Samsung phone; they're moving to several different Android vendors (LG and ZTE also picked up market share last year, according to the same WSJ story). So, will the Galaxy S8 move the needle on those "switch" numbers? The biggest variable is the battery question. But the black cloud of the Note 7 fires doesn't appear to have damaged the wider Galaxy brand: S8 preorders are said to be outpacing last year's model, and Samsung's brand reputation has already bounced back from its post-Note 7 low, at least according to one survey. Is the turnaround in Samsung's fortunes because of its extreme safety precautions in the new model or just the short memory of modern consumers? I don't know, but I'm willing to give the S8 a try myself. I'll likely be upgrading my iPhone 6S this year -- it's my primary phone -- and after playing around with the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus after the big Galaxy S8 launch event a few weeks ago, I was smitten. Here are a few reason I might switch: Apple's truly new iPhone will likely cost a bundle Rumor has it that Apple is going to release three new iPhones this fall. Two of them will be refreshes of the current iPhones -- basically, the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus -- while the "new" flagship model with all the new bells and whistles and rumored curved screen will cost upwards of $1,000. (When you consider that the 256 GB iPhone 7 Plus already costs $969, £919 or AU$1,569, it's really no stretch.) I'm willing to bet that phone will be very similar to the Galaxy S8 Plus in that it will have a high screen-to-phone-size ratio (translation: it will be an iPhone 7 Plus screen in an iPhone 7 body). But I'm not sure I want to pay $1,000 for a phone. By September we should see some discounts on the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, which currently list for about $750 (£689, AU$1,200) and $850 (£779, AU$1,350) respectively, depending on which carrier you buy from. I'm tired of paying such a premium for additional memory In the US, the base models for the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus have 64 GB of memory and feature a microSD expansion slot for adding more memory. You can add a 128 GB microSD for about $40 (the phones support up to a whopping 2 TB). If Apple follows its current lineup, new iPhones will come in 32 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB flavors. But you pay an extra $100 for each step up, which feels like highway robbery compared to those microSD card prices. Enlarge Image The Galaxy S8 has a headphone jack and will come with a pair of AKG earbuds that Samsung will sell separately for $99. David Carnoy/CNET I'm not as wed to the Apple app store as I once was Yes, I'm the same guy who said last year that he wanted a Galaxy phone running iOS. But a year later, I feel less and less bound to Apple's operating system. I now only play a handful of games and most the apps I use tend to be free and available for both Android and iOS. Also, I use Android devices as part of my day-to-day testing of accessories and other products, so I've amassed a fairly large collection of paid Android apps over the years that I can throw onto any Android phone. I know that a lot of people are locked into iTunes, too. Thankfully, I never really bought a lot of music, movies or TV shows through Apple. And with Apple Music on Android, and Netflix, Amazon and Vudu videos being cross-platform, I have plenty of options. I can live without iMessage Another Apple-only option I can do without: iMessage. It's excellent and one of the reasons iPhone users don't switch from iPhone to Android. For instance, for my colleague Patrick Holland, no iMessage on Android is a deal-killer. I get that. But I don't text so much that it's become part of my lifeblood. iPhone battery life has plateaued in recent years A lot of people are hoping Apple improves the battery life of its next-gen phones. In order to get through the day, I turn the brightness on my iPhone screen way down (Apple recently replaced my iPhone 6S battery free of charge because mine was one of the defective ones). If the battery life continues to stay the same I'll be disappointed. I've never loved Siri -- and I don't need Bixby to be great Maybe because my initial experience using Siri wasn't all that great I rarely use the iPhone's voice assistant (yes, she improves with each iPhone hardware and iOS upgrade). It's unclear how good Bixby Voice, the Galaxy S8's new voice assistant will be, because it hasn't launched quite yet. But it's not a make or break feature for me. I don't think the placement of the fingerprint scanner is a fatal flaw The biggest early knock against the Galaxy S8 is the placement of the fingerprint scanner right next to the camera lens on the back of the phone. In her review, my colleague Jessica Dolcourt wrote she had no idea what Samsung was thinking when put it there: "Other rear-mounted fingerprint sensors, such as the LG G6 and Google Pixel, are closer to the middle center of the phone's body, well clear of the camera and flash." But the phone also features a face unlock option -- though it's admittedly less secure -- as well as an iris scanner, though that doesn't work seamlessly in every scenario. But hey, there's even the less fancy PIN or pattern unlock option, which I was always fine with. I like having a headphone jack Can I live without a headphone jack? Yeah, I can. But I also wouldn't mind having one. The GS8 has that port, no dongle necessary. And it's still just as water-resistant as the iPhone 7. Will I make the jump? Honestly, I'm still probably going to wait to see what Apple shows off in the fall. (Apple, unsurprisingly, did not respond to my request for comment on any info on forthcoming iPhone products.) By that time, Samsung will also get a second chance to impress: The Note 8 should hit in August, if the company follows its recent release schedule. In the meantime, Samsung has already delivered a gorgeous phone, and I'm more open than ever to setting my iPhone aside. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care. Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.

Twitter Facebook Phishing attacks using internationalized domains are hard to block Chrome and Firefox developers attempt to find a balance between showing internationalized domain names and protecting users from phishing IDG Lucian Constantin (IDG News Service) 22 April, 2017 03:11 - - - - print email Comments The latest version of Google Chrome, released earlier this week, restricts how domain names that use non-Latin characters are displayed in the browser. This change is in response to a recently disclosed technique that could allow attackers to create highly credible phishing websites. The ability to register domain names made up of characters like those found in the Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, Hebrew and other non-Latin alphabets dates back over a decade. Since 2009, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has also approved a large number of internationalized top-level domains (TLDs) -- domain extensions -- written with such characters. When used in the Domain Name System (DNS) -- the internet's address book -- internationalized domain names are converted into ASCII-compatible form using a system called Punycode. However, when displayed to users inside browsers and other applications that support Unicode, they are shown with their intended non-Latin characters, making it possible for billions of internet users to read domain names in their native languages and scripts. While this is great for global internet usability, the use of internationalized domain names does raise security problems because some alphabets contain characters that look very similar to Latin letters and this can be abused to spoof URLs. For example, the letters "a" in the Cyrillic and Latin scripts are visually identical, even though they're different characters with different Unicode values: U+0430 and U+0061. This similarity would allow people to create the domain name apple.com using the letter "a" from the Cyrillic alphabet and the rest from the Latin alphabet. Such a domain name could be used to set up a phishing website that would be very hard to distinguish from the real one if the browser would visually show apple.com for both in the address bar. To prevent these so-called homograph attacks, browsers perform a series of complex checks to decide if it's best to display domain names using their intended scripts or to display their equivalents in Punycode instead. One of the rules they enforce is that if Latin, Cyrillic or Greek characters are mixed together, then Punycode will always be used. The Punycode version of the apple.com domain mentioned above, where the letter "a" is from Cyrillic, would be: xn--pple-43d.com. That's what users would see in the browser address bar. However, taking things further, a Web application developer named Xudong Zheng realized that for some domain names or brands it is possible to replace all of the letters with visually similar ones from a different script. For example, there are lookalike chracters in Cyrillic for all the letters in the word apple. In this case, the browser filter above would no longer apply because there is no mixed script in the name. To prove this, Xudong recently registered the xn--80ak6aa92e.com domain and set up a website whose address looked virtually identical to apple.com when opened inside Chrome, Firefox or Opera on Windows and Linux. On macOS the "l" character looked a bit differently, but was still close enough. Xudong reported this issue to browser vendors and Google fixed it Wednesday in Chrome 58 by adding yet another check to its internationalized domain name (IDN) policy. The browser will now display domain names in Punycode if all of their characters are Latin lookalike Cyrillic letters and if the top-level domain name is not an internationalized one. This means that the check only applies to traditional Latin-based generic and country-code TLDs like .com, .net, .org, .uk, .de and so on. For example, xn--80ak6aa92e.xn--p1ai would still look in the browser address bar like apple followed by the internationalized country code TLD for Russia, which is written in Cyrillic. The check does not match the script of the domain name with that of the TLD, which means that xn--80ak6aa92e.xn--fiqs8s also works, but with the internationalized country code TLD for China; so does xn--80ak6aa92e.xn--qxam for Greece, xn--80ak6aa92e.xn--3e0b707e for Korea and so on. These domains might not be suitable to launch phishing attacks against users in countries that use Latin-based alphabets, but might look legitimate to users that use different scripts. The Google Chrome IDN display policy is already made up of 10 different checks with different conditions, highlighting how hard it is to cover all possible abuses of such domain names. Mozilla is still considering whether it should take any action to block Xudong's technique and hasn't reached a final conclusion. A discussion on its bug tracker shows that there are strong opposing views about who should be responsible for preventing such attacks. Some believe that whole-script homograph attacks, as in the case of apple.com written with Cyrillic characters, is not something the browsers should fix. They feel that the responsibility should fall with brand owners who should register those domains to protect their brands and with domain registrars who should have blacklists in place to prevent users from registering potentially abusive domains. Gervase Markham, a policy engineer at Mozilla, published an unofficial FAQ document that explains how Firefox decides whether to display IDNs in their proper form and what implications a more restrictive policy would have. Firefox users who do not care about seeing IDNs in their intended scripts can manually force the browser to always display them in Punycode. This can be done by typing about:config in the browser address bar, locating the network.IDN_show_punycode setting and changing its value from false to true. Homograph attacks using IDNs are probably here to stay, as there will always be some edge cases not covered by existing policies. The debate is whether the risk is worth sacrificing usability for a large number of users, given that phishers already have a lot of success with simpler techniques that don't rely on perfectly spoofed URLs. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

However, taking things further, a Web application developer named Xudong Zheng realized that for some domain names or brands it is possible to replace all of the letters with visually similar ones from a different script. For example, there are lookalike chracters in Cyrillic for all the letters in the word apple. In this case, the browser filter above would no longer apply because there is no mixed script in the name. To prove this, Xudong recently registered the xn--80ak6aa92e.com domain and set up a website whose address looked virtually identical to apple.com when opened inside Chrome, Firefox or Opera on Windows and Linux. On macOS the "l" character looked a bit differently, but was still close enough. Xudong reported this issue to browser vendors and Google fixed it Wednesday in Chrome 58 by adding yet another check to its internationalized domain name (IDN) policy. The browser will now display domain names in Punycode if all of their characters are Latin lookalike Cyrillic letters and if the top-level domain name is not an internationalized one. This means that the check only applies to traditional Latin-based generic and country-code TLDs like .com, .net, .org, .uk, .de and so on. For example, xn--80ak6aa92e.xn--p1ai would still look in the browser address bar like apple followed by the internationalized country code TLD for Russia, which is written in Cyrillic. The check does not match the script of the domain name with that of the TLD, which means that xn--80ak6aa92e.xn--fiqs8s also works, but with the internationalized country code TLD for China; so does xn--80ak6aa92e.xn--qxam for Greece, xn--80ak6aa92e.xn--3e0b707e for Korea and so on. These domains might not be suitable to launch phishing attacks against users in countries that use Latin-based alphabets, but might look legitimate to users that use different scripts. The Google Chrome IDN display policy is already made up of 10 different checks with different conditions, highlighting how hard it is to cover all possible abuses of such domain names. Mozilla is still considering whether it should take any action to block Xudong's technique and hasn't reached a final conclusion. A discussion on its bug tracker shows that there are strong opposing views about who should be responsible for preventing such attacks. Some believe that whole-script homograph attacks, as in the case of apple.com written with Cyrillic characters, is not something the browsers should fix. They feel that the responsibility should fall with brand owners who should register those domains to protect their brands and with domain registrars who should have blacklists in place to prevent users from registering potentially abusive domains. Gervase Markham, a policy engineer at Mozilla, published an unofficial FAQ document that explains how Firefox decides whether to display IDNs in their proper form and what implications a more restrictive policy would have. Firefox users who do not care about seeing IDNs in their intended scripts can manually force the browser to always display them in Punycode. This can be done by typing about:config in the browser address bar, locating the network.IDN_show_punycode setting and changing its value from false to true. Homograph attacks using IDNs are probably here to stay, as there will always be some edge cases not covered by existing policies. The debate is whether the risk is worth sacrificing usability for a large number of users, given that phishers already have a lot of success with simpler techniques that don't rely on perfectly spoofed URLs.

 A new estimate says Samsung’s Galaxy S8 costs much more to make than Apple’s iPhone 7 Jeff Dunn Apr. 21, 2017, 12:41 PM 2,654 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Samsung’s Galaxy S8 phones are officially on sale, but don’t expect to grab one for cheap. The entry-level Galaxy S8 starts at $720, about $70 more than competing flagships like Apple’s iPhone 7 and Google’s Pixel. And that’s just on Verizon; with other carriers, it starts as high as $750. The Galaxy S8+ goes for even more. But as this chart from Statista shows, Samsung has some justification for the price premium. According to recent estimates from analytics firm IHS Markit, the cost of the materials and manufacturing needed to put the Galaxy S8 together is a good ways higher than any other major flagship on the market. IHS Markit says that entry-level model — what with its high-end chipset, larger-than-usual internal storage, and big, curved OLED display — sets Samsung back $307.50. That’s $36 more than last year’s Galaxy S7 Edge, $22 more than the Pixel, and $83 more than the iPhone 7, according to IHS Markit’s past estimates. That said, you might want to take all this with at least some grain of salt. Apple CEO Tim Cook is no fan of these sort of estimates, for one, famously saying that he’s “never seen one that’s even close to accurate” in an earnings call back in 2015. Nevertheless, with a redesigned, high-end iPhone 8 rumored to be on the horizon, it seems like the big smartphone makers are ready to pony up a bit more to sell slicker hardware.

This change is in response to a recently disclosed technique that could allow attackers to create highly credible phishing websites. The ability to register domain names made up of characters like those found in the Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, Hebrew and other non-Latin alphabets dates back over a decade. Since 2009, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has also approved a large number of internationalized top-level domains (TLDs) -- domain extensions -- written with such characters. When used in the Domain Name System (DNS) -- the internet's address book -- internationalized domain names are converted into ASCII-compatible form using a system called Punycode. However, when displayed to users inside browsers and other applications that support Unicode, they are shown with their intended non-Latin characters, making it possible for billions of internet users to read domain names in their native languages and scripts. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] While this is great for global internet usability, the use of internationalized domain names does raise security problems because some alphabets contain characters that look very similar to Latin letters and this can be abused to spoof URLs. For example, the letters "a" in the Cyrillic and Latin scripts are visually identical, even though they're different characters with different Unicode values: U+0430 and U+0061. This similarity would allow people to create the domain name apple.com using the letter "a" from the Cyrillic alphabet and the rest from the Latin alphabet. Such a domain name could be used to set up a phishing website that would be very hard to distinguish from the real one if the browser would visually show apple.com for both in the address bar. To prevent these so-called homograph attacks, browsers perform a series of complex checks to decide if it's best to display domain names using their intended scripts or to display their equivalents in Punycode instead. One of the rules they enforce is that if Latin, Cyrillic or Greek characters are mixed together, then Punycode will always be used. The Punycode version of the apple.com domain mentioned above, where the letter "a" is from Cyrillic, would be: xn--pple-43d.com. That's what users would see in the browser address bar. However, taking things further, a Web application developer named Xudong Zheng realized that for some domain names or brands it is possible to replace all of the letters with visually similar ones from a different script.

And after a lengthy stint in beta, the iOS 10.3 update is now available for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. As expected iOS 10.3 is a huge update for Apple’s mobile devices bringing new features, fixes and a ton of security patches with it. An iOS 10.3 release is confirmed. Today we want to take an updated look at the most important things to know about the iOS 10.3 update and its release. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details so check back for frequent updates as we push into the month of April. iOS 10.3 Review We’ve downloaded the iOS 10.3 update on the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 5. The iOS 10.3 update is massive, over 600MB for the iPhone 7, and the installation process took a lot longer than usual due in part to Apple’s new APFS file system. We didn’t run into any issues but the download/installation took upwards of 20 minutes on all of these devices so make sure you set aside some time to monitor the download and the installation. So far, we haven’t noticed any major problems with any of these devices. In fact, we’ve seen some nice improvements on the eldest device. Battery life is currently holding up on all four phones. We haven’t experienced any weird drain when in use or standby. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and cellular data are also stable. We’ve noticed some improvements to the iPhone 5’s boot speed and its UI. The user interface feels faster and more fluid than the previous versions of iOS 10. As of right now, iOS 10.3 is treating these three devices well and it’s recommended if you’re interested in iOS 10.3’s features, protecting your device from potential harm, or if you’re suffering from an unfixable iOS issue. If you’re doing fine on iOS 10.2.1, you might want to wait a few days for more long-term feedback to emerge. We’ll keep you posted. In the meantime, we’ve put together a list of reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.3 update right now. If you’re having an excellent experience on iOS 10.2.1 or below, we highly recommend digging into those reasons before making the move to iOS 10.3. iOS 10.3 Problems iOS 10.3 went through a lengthy beta but problems have slipped through the cracks. iOS 10.3 users are complaining about a wide range of issues including weird battery drain, issues with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, lag, random reboots, and issues with third-party apps. As of right now, these issues are isolated. They’re also extremely common after a major iOS update release. Most of these iOS 10.3 problems can be solved from the comfort of a computer chair at work or your home. If you’re seeing an issue after downloading iOS 10.3, take a look at our list of fixes. You’ll also want to report it to Apple so that its engineers can get to work on a fix. Downgrade & iOS 10.3.1 If you decide to download the iOS 10.3 update know that there is no longer a way to drop down to another official version of iOS 10. If iOS 10.3 is causing problems for you you’re stuck until Apple rolls out a new version of iOS 10. Apple’s no longer signing off on iOS 10.2.1 which means you can’t drop down to it if you’re unhappy with the iOS 10.3 update’s performance on your iPhone or iPad. Unfortunately, you can’t drop down to anything older than iOS 10.2.1 either. Also note that you can now “upgrade” to iOS 10.3.1. Apple’s released an iOS 10.3.1 update with bug fixes for iPhone and iPad. The update is tiny but it could have an impact on your device’s performance. For more on the iOS 10.3.1 update, take a look at our walkthrough. It goes over performance, problems, and more. Clips Now Available for iPhone & iPad A new feature, which requires the iOS 10.3/iOS 10.3.1 update is now available. Earlier this year, Apple announced a new Clips application. The company promised a release in April and Clips is now out on the App Store. Clips allows select iOS 10.3/iOS 10.3.1 users to create unique videos. It lets you combine video clips, photos and music that you can share via iMessage, Instagram, Facebook or another popular social networking platform. It also features Live Tiles which will let you create animated captions and titles using your voice. You’re then able to add effects like comic book filters, speech bubbles, shapes and full-screen animated posters. For more on Clips, take a look at our roundup. Clips isn’t available for the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, or iPad 4. What’s Next Apple’s already confirmed the next iOS 10.3 update. The iOS 10.3.2 update is currently in beta ahead of an unknown release date. As of right now the update appears to be a maintenance release which means it’ll probably deliver bug fixes and security patches as opposed to features. While you might be tempted to try the iOS 10.3.2 beta ahead of time, be aware that Apple’s early software can cause problems. Issues with apps and services, connectivity, and battery life are common beta issues and we expect these, and other problems, to plague the iOS 10.3.2 update as it passes through the company’s beta program. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 8 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 12 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 12 13 Responses 01/10/2017 Stephen Reply Really a very terribly written article, with numerous grammar mistakes.

Likely to Stay Ahead of Competition in Chip Manufacturing Tech The iDevice maker may very well be the first to adopt new manufacturing technologies from here on out. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 21, 2017 at 12:30PM Over the last several years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gotten more aggressive about transitioning to the latest chip manufacturing technologies out there. It was the first to utilize Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) 20-nanometer technology for a high-volume applications processor, and it was among the first to use its 16-nanometer technology. Interestingly, it looked as though Apple wouldn't be the first to utilize TSMC's upcoming 10-nanometer technology; wireless chip-maker MediaTek made quite a lot of noise about being among the first to use this technology (though it seems very few smartphone makers were interested in the chip MediaTek is building with it). Image source: Apple. Going forward, I think Apple will once again take the lead when it comes to using new TSMC manufacturing technologies. First to 7-nano, first to 7-nano+ On TSMC's most recent earnings call, executives said the company plans to move its 7-nanometer+ technology -- a performance-enhanced, area-reduced variant of the company's 7-nanometer technology -- into production in the second half of 2019, one year after the company begins mass production of its 7-nanometer technology. Interestingly, TSMC's stated timeline seems to imply that the first-generation 7-nanometer technology will go into mass production in the second half of 2018. Given that the company plans to go into what it calls "risk production" on the technology in the second quarter of 2017, mass production near the end of the first half of 2018 or at the very beginning of the second half of 2018 (to meet Apple's needs) seems like a reasonable timeline. If TSMC does indeed begin production at around those times for 7-nanometer and 7-nanometer+, then it's hard to imagine that Apple won't be the first, if not among the first, to utilize those technologies. Why is chip manufacturing tech important? The quality of a chip certainly depends on the quality of the chip design itself, and that's largely under Apple's control. However, it's also an inescapable fact that the better the underlying manufacturing technology, the better a given chip will be. Indeed, the power efficiency and performance of the transistors have a direct impact on how quickly a chip can run while staying in a desired power/thermal envelope. Additionally, the density of a technology (that is, how densely chip designers can pack those transistors) is important for economic reasons since chips become uneconomical to produce if they get too big. The denser the technology, the more features and functionality the chip designers can cram into a fixed chip area, which is generally a good thing. Consistent chip leadership It's widely accepted that Apple has one of the best, if not the best, mobile chip development organizations in the industry. If Apple continues to develop best-in-class architectures, then the combination of those architectures, its tight control of the software ecosystem, and the newest, best chip manufacturing technology available to it should allow it to maintain a healthy lead in chip technology. I'd say the clear majority of users don't care about the performance/specs of the chips inside of their smartphones. However, faster/more feature-rich chips that are custom tailored to deliver the best user experiences (even if customers don't know why iPhones deliver that user experiences) are not only interesting selling points today, but they could inspire current iPhone users to remain loyal to the iPhone franchise when it comes time to upgrade.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Leaked Document Details Apple Employee Injuries, Hints At Secretive New Products William TurtonThursday 1:01pm Filed to: apple 86 7 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: AP An incident report compiled by an Environment Health and Safety contractor working for Apple mistakenly sent to hundreds of Apple employees and leaked to Gizmodo includes tantalizing clues about some of the new products the notoriously secretive tech company may be cooking up. The report includes over 70 different incidents. Advertisement The report, sent out on April 14, is titled “Impact Descriptions Reported in [Santa Clara Valley] from Last Month,” and contains everything from inconsequential reports from employees after running into a door, all the way up to people seeking medical attention after testing new Apple products. The report includes information on the date and location of the incidents—which range from reports of workplace hazards like spills and fires to injuries sustained while on campus—and the level of care provided to the injured person, if any was required. Many of the incidents detail common workplace injuries. For example, on March 1 at 6:44 p.m an employee working in building 4 of Apple’s Infinite Loop campus (presumably working within Caffè Macs, Apple’s posh cafeteria for employees) burned his hand pulling fish out of the oven. Or when an employee working at Apple’s Arques office in Sunnyvale on March 14 reported “feeling lightheaded, had difficulty seeing clearly, could not stand. She mentioned feeling stressed.” Another incident, on March 29 at Apple’s Bandley 5 office in Cupertino, involved an employee dealing with a “hazardous material.” “Employee was opening a box of used Apple Pencils in [room number redacted]. As soon as she opened the box, a strong odor emanated from within the box. The employee, who is familiar with lithium battery odors, identified two Pencils as the odor source. She suspected the Pencils were leaking electrolytes.” Advertisement Apple did not immediately return a request for comment. This document lacks a lot of context, and the vague mentions of Apple prototypes jives with the company’s cult-like methods for keeping products under wraps. Even then, the incidents reports can be revealing, so we’ll let you make you own assumptions. It seems some of the incidents listed within this report may hint at new products Apple may be working on. One report on February 21 that included “medical treatment beyond first aid,” involved a prototype unit at Apple’s De Anza office in Cupertino. “After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis.” In another report, an employee working at Apple’s Vallco Parkway office in Cupertino reported eye pain on March 2. “Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with.” A source inside Apple speculated that this injury may have something to do with an augmented reality product Apple may be testing, something like glasses with an overhead display. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he thinks augmented reality will be a pretty big deal. Sponsored Or on March 10, when an employee on the Apple Watch team injured his knee while skiing. “Watch EE team has two days ski trip (3/10-3/11) to Tahoe area to help collect core motion data for skiing/boarding activity tracking. It’s also part of team building activity. Employee has participated in the activity and had an injury on his knee.” We asked Apple if it plans to add skiing and snowboarding as tracked activities to its Workout app but have not heard back. In one incident that required medical treatment beyond first aid, an Apple employee was struck by a company minivan on March 21. A source inside Apple speculates this may have been one of Apple’s minivans designed to collect data for its Maps product. “Minivan 82 (CA license plate #REDACTED) turned left leaving the [Vallco Parkway] parking lot and struck a pedestrian (Apple employee) crossing the sidewalk from the opposite direction (at the intersection of Vallco parkway and Main Street Drive Garage Parkway.) The crosswalk signal was white, the van turned on a green light. When the van struck the employee, he fell back several feet; he suffered minor injuries.” Advertisement On March 7 at Apple’s Forge office in Cupertino an employee suffered a swollen toe after doing some testing. “Employee was preforming a testing in our chamber when the [sic] dropped a heavy object on this toe.

The world’s biggest smartphone maker added more than $1 billion to its market capitalization Friday as investors cheered positive reaction to its new device. The device, unveiled in New York last month and a challenge to Apple’s iPhone, is the firm’s first major launch since last year’s humiliating withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 over exploding batteries, which hammered its once-stellar reputation. The new phones have received good reviews, with more than one million pre-orders for the S8 and the larger S8+ in South Korea alone. Shares in Samsung Electronics rose 1.2 percent to close at 2.04 million won ($1,797) Friday, adding around 1.3 trillion won to its total market capitalization. When Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus in New York last month, it said the new handsets would mark a “new era of smartphone design”. The two handsets include Samsung’s upgraded digital assistant Bixby, competing in a crowded field that includes Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. The most striking feature of the new phones is what Samsung dubs an “infinity display” — an expanded glass screen that covers the entire front of the device and appears to curve seamlessly around its edges. But some consumers have complained that the screens on their devices have a reddish hue. Samsung said in a statement that users could manually adjust the color range according to their preferences. The home button has been replaced with a pressure-sensitive section embedded under the screen, and the water-resistant phone allows for biometric authentication with fingerprint and iris scanners. The S8 is for those who want elegance — and are willing to pay for it. SCREENS TO THE EDGES After spontaneous fires that forced the recall of the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung is playing it safe on the battery and subjecting the S8 to tighter inspections. Instead, it’s pushing the boundaries — so to speak — on the phone’s display. Samsung minimized the phone frame and got rid of a physical home button to free up space for the “infinity display.” The 5.8-inch S8 and the 6.2-inch S8 Plus both have nearly 15 percent more display space than last year’s comparable models. But the phones themselves aren’t wider. In fact, the phones feel more comfortable thanks to sides that curve around to the back; last year’s curved S7 Edge model feels boxy by comparison. The bigger screen fits more lines of text, but doesn’t necessarily make video more immersive. While video on YouTube and Facebook gets automatically adjusted to fill the space, Netflix and Hulu movies just leave wasted black space on all four sides. This can be adjusted manually, but for a heftier price, one shouldn’t have to. ALL ABOUT THE BATTERY The S8 and S8 Plus have more physical space inside, but Samsung used it to give the battery more breathing room while keeping its capacity roughly the same as last year. Though a larger display drains the battery faster, tests of streaming video found that the new phones consumed power more slowly than last year’s models. And even with constant use — taking photos, watching video and playing music and podcasts — the new phones still made it to bedtime with power to spare. Samsung credits software and chip improvements. UNLOCKING THE PHONES Like the doomed Note 7, the S8 has an iris scanner to let users unlock the phone by looking at it — at least in theory. But the screen must be swiped first and the position from the user’s face must be at just the right distance. The fingerprint scanner was faster and more convenient for unlocking the phone. FIRE THE ASSISTANT Samsung is introducing a digital assistant called Bixby, but voice features intended to rival Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri aren’t ready yet. (Voice dictation does work with a reminder feature, though.) Bixby will also highlight appointments, trending stories and app suggestions, much as existing features on iPhones and other Android phones already offer. One promising feature aims to provide translations and product information using the phone’s camera. It’s like the Firefly feature on Amazon’s derided Fire phone, and it makes the same types of dumb mistakes — it identified a can of Diet Coke as four other sodas instead. And the translation tools were incomplete at grabbing passages and failed to automatically detect the language being translated from. CALCULATING THE VALUE Samsung throws in a pair of AKG premium headphones, valued at about $100. It’s nice to get headphones when many phone makers have stopped including them. The phone also comes with 64 gigabytes of storage, which frequently jacks up the price of other phones by $100. Those curved edges? Those also previously cost an extra $100. The S8 seems like a bargain for only $100 over the S7 at launch. But do you really need these goodies? The main camera on the S8 is about the same as last year’s, so you can still get amazing photos with the S7. There’s speculation that Apple will come out with a pricier, feature-rich iPhone for its 10th anniversary this year — but it’s expected to update the existing iPhone 7 line as well. Those who can’t live with yesterday’s technology won’t be disappointed with the S8. But for everyone else, Samsung could have also offered a lower-priced alternative with fewer goodies.

As a result, the S&P 500 is trading well above its 200-day moving average, a technical sign of strength. But other large parts of the market are struggling. Dominic Chu | @TheDomino 14 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters These mega-cap stocks are pillars of the market    20 Hours Ago | 01:40 Five companies have become the pillars of the stock market in 2017, and their names shouldn't sound unfamiliar, either. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are carrying a load of weight on their shoulders. As the Nasdaq hit a record high Thursday, it's important to note that the top five S&P 500 stocks by market capitalization represent 12 to 13 percent of the index's overall weight, and all of them — technology-related stocks — are trading in positive territory year to date. Apple, maker of the iPhone, is up 23 percent year to date, Google's parent company Alphabet is up 9 percent, Windows operator Microsoft has climbed 6 percent, e-commerce giant Amazon has risen 20 percent and social media darling Facebook is up a whopping 25 percent, as of Thursday's close. If you haven't already, it's worth noting that Apple, Facebook and Amazon have already climbed at least 20 percent for the year, and this is one of the reasons the stock market is holding up so well. To date, the S&P 500 index is trading well above its 200-day moving average. From this perspective, things might look healthy for equities. But about 120 to 130 stocks in the index are actually trading below that moving-day average. So, those five above-mentioned stocks are doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Hence the record highs in the market of late, despite not every company performing at par. — CNBC's Lauren Thomas contributed to this report.

(LiPo Ching/Bay Area News Group) Apple says it'll take six months to move all the employees into the building. The campus rests on 175 acres and the spaceship is one mile in circumference. There are 2,600 parking spaces in the subterranean parking garage with another 6,000 spaces located above ground. Apple Park will have 1,000 on-site charging stations for electric vehicles. There will be 1,500 bikes on campus for employees to use to get around. The inner part of the circular building is 30 acres. The project cost an estimated $5 billion and the land cost Apple $160 million. Over the coming weeks and months, as many as 12,000 employees will drive, bus or bike to the Park for the very first time, scope out their workspaces, and then get back to the business of creating the kinds of gadgets and services that have already seduced several generations of Earthlings. The campus will have seven cafes which will seat 3,000 people and can crank out 15,000 lunches day from the on-site kitchens. There are 1,750 seats on outdoor terraces. The building has four stories above and three below ground. There are 4,400 hollow concrete slabs that act as the building's floors, ceilings, and HVAC system. Companies that worked on the project are based in 19 different countries.

Now a massive spaceship-like Apple campus has landed across the street. “They put it together like a jigsaw puzzle. It was really incredible,” said Rohde, who has lived near the dividing line between Sunnyvale and Cupertino since the 1970s. This month, Apple employees started to move into the ring-shaped main building, which spans about 2.8 million square feet, contains four stories and includes the world’s largest panels of curved glass. More than 12,000 workers will fill the campus over six months as construction on the 175-acre site continues into the summer.

The opening of the building is not only a milestone for Apple, which celebrated the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year, but honors the legacy of innovation that late Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs left behind. A theater in Apple Park will be named after Jobs, who died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer at age 56. “This is Steve Jobs’ legacy. I had no idea he was going to leave us that soon,” said Gilbert Wong, former Cupertino mayor and council member. “Now it’s really up to Tim Cook and his team to continue the legacy of technological process and move Apple forward after the campus is built.” As the campus nears completion, nearby residents are bracing for more traffic to clog an already congested region. “You just have to be careful when you back out of your driveway otherwise you’ll get run over by someone,” said Rohde as cars whizzed by his Sunnyvale home. “That’s just the price you pay.” Apple declined to comment. In late 2010, Wong met Jobs for the first time on the fourth floor of Apple’s headquarters with Cupertino Mayor Kris Wang. Growing up in the Santa Clara Valley, Wong had watched Jobs from a distance, reading about the tech mogul in newspapers. Jobs, dressed in his signature black turtleneck and jeans, looked very thin that day but his mind seemed crystal clear. “He was there to market something to us so we only saw the positive side,” he said. After having a conversation with the Cupertino politicians, Jobs led them down a hallway to a locked door. “I’m sure you’ve watched The Willy Wonka movie,” Wong said. “He had this little key and you don’t know what’s behind this door.” Inside was a detailed model of a circular spaceship-like building, filled with miniature trees and people. “I just loved it,” Wong said. “It was all glass, round and there was a huge park in the middle.” Since then, Wong said he’s been on the roof of the building and seen the digging for the 1,000-seat auditorium. “Some of the glass was put in my last visit, but I didn’t have a chance to touch it because it was an active construction site,” he said. About 80 percent of the campus is made up of green space, a nod to Silicon Valley’s agricultural roots. Designed by world renowned architect Norman Foster, the circular design of the headquarters is similar to a quad on Stanford University’s campus or London Square where houses are surrounded by a park. The campus also includes a fitness center, a visitors center with an Apple store, an auditorium and research and development facilities. The campus is meant to foster creativity and collaboration among workers by combining thousands of employees in one location. In his last public appearance before his death, Jobs presented the design to the Cupertino City Council. The tech firm purchased the site from HP in 2010. “I think we do have a shot at building the best office building in the world,” Jobs told the City Council in 2011. In 2013, the City Council unanimously approved the project. The new campus is expected to generate an additional $32 million of property tax revenue to local public agencies, according to an economic impact report by Keyser Marston Associates. Apple also funded more than $66 million in public improvements around the campus and will spend about $35 million annually to help alleviate the traffic from their employees, according to the report. While some residents supported the project, others raised concerns that more traffic would disrupt the quality of suburban life in Cupertino, a city with about 60,500 people as of 2015. CJ Jocson lived in Cupertino for 23 years before moving to Nevada, but she’s thinking about returning to her hometown. More could have been done to mitigate the traffic, she said, but ultimately she supported the development of Apple’s new campus. Traffic has discouraged her from driving to see Apple Park when she returns to the area every month for work. But she’s been watching its progress over the years online. “Apple really put Cupertino on the map. No question about that,” she said. “And the consequence? People like myself who sold our homes could not complain.” And for some residents, it’s yet another reminder of the rise and fall of tech companies in Silicon Valley. “Maybe I’ll live here long enough to see them tear it down and building something else. Who knows?,” Rohde said. “Nobody who used to work over there ever in their wildest imaginations ever thought that HP would not be there.” Tags:  Apple Queenie Wong Queenie Wong covers social media businesses, including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, for The Mercury News.

Credit: Apple More like this The 10 must-have utilities for macOS Sierra Review: Refined iOS 6 highlighted by stunning Maps overhaul iOS podcast apps review roundup: Castro 2.3, Overcast 3, and Pocket Casts 6.5 Video Hands-on with Apple's new video-editing app, Clips “Free” seems like a good thing, right? After all, who doesn’t like not paying for things? This week’s announcement that Apple’s productivity and creative software—namely Pages, Numbers, Keynote, GarageBand, and iMovie—is now free to all users was mainly greeted with a positive reaction from pundits and consumers alike. I’ll agree that making these apps (which were already provided no charge to people who bought new Macs, iPhone, and iPads) free across the board is largely a positive move. But that decision does have some consequences that could be a downside for end users, developers, and even Apple. Not-so-fierce competition The effect is probably most pronounced for small and indie developers. Since Apple can afford to fund the development of these apps and then just give them away, it’s a tough proposition for small businesses to invest the time and money into building competing apps. Those developers generally have to charge for their apps, and consumers may wonder why they should pay when they can get Apple’s offerings for free. That said, in the case of these particular apps, that ship pretty much sailed long ago. Most Mac and iOS users only ended up paying for an app like Pages or GarageBand when it was time to upgrade the version. Apple’s essentially been the 800-pound gorilla in these markets since it first started giving away these apps with new devices. That’s not to say there’s no competition for these apps. On one side you’ve got open-source software (Audacity remains a popular audio editor, for example), while on the other you’ve got similar offerings from other giant companies, like Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Microsoft’s Office 365. So while consumer choice isn’t eliminated, it does certainly make it harder for a new player to enter the market. This might seem like a minor issue, when you have these wealth of choices…except for the niche users. You get what you pay for Here’s the thing: free can be a not-so-great price to pay. Sure, it feels satisfying, but when it comes to getting that one feature you want, or fixing that annoying bug, the gap between user and customer can feel broad. It’s easier to argue or advocate for a missing or broken feature when you’ve shelled out hard-earned cash for it. That can be tough if a piece of software largely, but not completely, meets your needs. For example, take GarageBand. It’s a remarkably competent audio editor, and I use it for all the podcasts I produce. But a few years ago, Apple removed the app’s podcast-specific editing features, and there are other features that would aid in podcast editing that the company never added in the first place—and there’s a good chance that it never will. That makes it tough if you’re looking for that one specific feature that really sells an app for you. Because if Apple isn’t likely to add the feature, and third-party developers can’t compete enough to make money, what are your options left? (Aside from building your own software, which, let’s be honest, is beyond most of our capabilities.) And frankly, that’s a problem not just for users, but for Apple too. All about the ecosystem Part of me thinks that Apple would love to incorporate all those niche features in apps that it can provide to all of its users free of charge, but there are always limitations and priorities when it comes to running a business. That’s one reason moving those apps to free worries me. iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie are no longer even bringing in a small amount of revenue—instead they’re purely ecosystem plays that help attract people to buy Apple’s hardware. That’s nothing new for Apple: the iTunes Store long operated in a similar fashion, and Apple made its yearly macOS updates free as well. But when it comes to productivity apps, the calculus is a little different. Giving these apps away could de-incentivize updates that incorporate new features. After all, if they’re not directly bringing in revenue, how much sense does it make to dedicate valuable resources to developing free apps that that aren’t either basic table stakes for the company’s operating systems—Mail, Safari, Messages—or apps that provide a gateway to bringing in more revenue, like iTunes. The upside Despite all these concerns, I think that, on balance, making these apps free is a good move. That’s because the benefit to end users is mostly positive. Users, for example, won’t be confused about why they suddenly need to pay for updates to these apps they own, when they don’t have to pay for other app updates. (And I’m sure, from Apple’s perspective, it’s preferable to those users simply not updating at all.) But the risks are real, even though we may not see some of them truly materialize until down the road. Because, as the saying goes, there’s no such thing as a free lunch.

Apple’s iOS 10.3 update delivered an impressive set of changes including new features, a ton of security patches, and some useful tweaks. It was a solid update but it was far from perfect. In early April the company’s pushed out an iOS 10.3.1 update and it brings a new security patch and bug fixes to iPhone, iPad and iPad touch owners. iOS 10.3.1 is a small bug fix update but small bug fix updates aren’t immune to problems. iOS 10.3.1 problems are popping up and some iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users are noticing performance issues. We’ve heard about UI lag, random reboots, apps locking up, and more in the days since the iOS 10.3.1 update’s release. While your first inclination might be to contact Apple Support or schedule a Genius appointment at an Apple Store, there’s a very good chance you’ll be able to fix your iOS 10.3.1 performance issues yourself. In fact, it might take you just a few seconds. Today we want to share some tips that’ve worked for us in the past. Here’s how we’ve managed to fix bad iOS performance in the past and these might work for you and your version of iOS 10.3.1. These tips should work for iOS 10.3 as well. Restart Your Device If you start noticing poor performance on your device, the first thing we recommend is a simple restart. This will take you just a few seconds but it could have a significant impact on your device’s performance. Most of you already know how to do this but if you’re new to iOS, simply hold the power button down, slide to power down your phone or tablet, and then hold the power button down again to power the device back on. Reset Your Network Settings If you’re seeing slow downloads on the internet, in apps, or in the App Store, we recommend resetting your network settings to see if that clears up the issue. To do this, go to your Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This will cause your device to forget your Wi-Fi passwords so make sure you have all of those handy before you start the process. It should only take a few moments to complete. If this doesn’t help fix your connectivity issues, we’ve got some more remedies available on our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems. Cleanup Your Device If you’re running out of space on your iPhone or iPad do some spring cleaning. Reducing the amount of clutter on your device could provide you with a nice boost to your device’s speed and overall performance. If you’ve owned your device for awhile there’s a good chance you’ve accumulated tons of items you no longer use. Maybe it’s videos you no longer watch or need, maybe its an app or 10. Whatever the case, it’s a good idea to track these files and apps down and delete them. You might be surprised at how much space you’ll clear up. To quickly check how much space you’re using on your internal storage, head into your Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage and select Manage Storage. Update Your Apps If you’re dealing with poor app performance you’ll want to check to make sure your apps are up-to-date. If you don’t have automatic updates turned on it can be hard to stay on top of app updates. Developers have been pumping out updates in the first half of the year and there’s a chance you might’ve missed an important release. Head into the App Store and see what you can find. Just make sure you read reviews before you install a new version. Stop Automatic Downloads Automatic app downloads are extremely useful if you’re the kind of person that’s unable to stay on top of app updates. That said, the feature will make your device’s GPU work which could lead to poor performance or weird battery drain. If you’re fine with manually updating your apps, at least temporarily, try disabling Automatic Downloads on your device. To do this, go to Settings > iTunes & App Store. Once you’re there, you’ll want to toggle the switch to turn off Updates located in the Automatic Downloads section. Kill Widgets Widgets are everywhere in iOS 10. And while they can be useful, they could also be hogging your device’s precious resources. If you have a ton of active widgets, try getting rid of the ones you don’t use to see if that helps improve iOS 10.3.1’s performance. To do that, you’ll want to swipe to the right while on the home screen. Scroll all the way to bottom of your widgets and select Edit. It’s a little circle. You should see a long list of services and apps. To remove a widget, tap the red circle with the white line and tap Remove. Remove them as needed. Stop Background Refresh Background Refresh is another useful feature that could be hampering your device’s performance, With this feature turned on, your apps will be refreshed with new information while the app is in the background. For example, your Facebook feed will constantly be updated without having to actually open up the app. Shutting this function down could help your device’s CPU so it’s worth a shot if you don’t need instant access to your data. To do this, go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and toggle Background Refresh off. This will shut it down completely. You also have the ability to go down your list of apps one-by-one and make a selection on a case-by-case basis if you wish to do it that way. Disable Spotlight Search There’s no guarantee it will help but you might try disabling Spotlight Search indexing to see if that helps improve your device’s speed. Spotlight Search allows you to easily search for content on your phone: Apps, emails, messages, and more. It’s useful but shutting it off could prove beneficial. To shut it off, head to your Settings. In General, select Spotlight Search. From there, you can toggle off all of the apps under Search Results or a select few. Reduce Transparency & Motion Effects If you’re noticing choppy animations and transitions try reducing transparency and motion effects on your device. Let’s start with Motion Effects. iOS 10 provides you a sense a depth when you tilt your device and when you open and close your various applications. Adjusting this feature a bit could help smooth out iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.3.1 performance on your phone or tablet. To reduce Motion Effects in iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.3.1, go to  Settings > General > Accessibility and toggle Reduce Motion on. Note that reducing Motion Effects will disable some features like the bubble effect in the Messages app. Now that you’re in the Accessibility part of your device’s settings you’ll want to try reducing transparency. This will reduce transparency and blur effects. By reducing these features, you could help your device’s GPU. To Reduce Transparency, tap Increase Contrast and then tap the toggle to turn on the Reduce Transparency function. Try the iOS 10.3.2 Beta Beta software can be problematic but there are times where users actually see improvements over the official software. If you’re desperate, you might try the iOS 10.3.2 beta to see if it helps your device’s performance. iOS 10.3.2 is a small release (as of right now) so don’t expect to see any new features or tweaks. Apple hasn’t announced an official iOS 10.3.2 release date yet so we’ll be moving through the beta without a release timeline. Start Over If nothing here helps, and you can’t find a fix anywhere else, you might want to factory reset your phone. If you can’t take your device into an Apple Store, try erasing your device and starting over from scratch. This has been known to have a positive effect on performance, particularly on older devices. Before you reset your phone to its factory defaults, you’ll want to make sure you’re completely backed up. You’ll also need to put aside an hour or two of free time to make sure the process goes smoothly. If you’ve backed everything up and you’re ready to wipe your device clean, head into Settings > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings to get started. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 8 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 12 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 12 3 Responses 04/01/2017 Clamster Reply You should turn off iCloud Keychain before resetting network settings because otherwise you will lose all your wifi logins in all of your Apple devices. It’s real PITA if you just blithely follow online suggestions to fix problems with a quick network settings reset. 04/17/2017 Анастасия Reply Yes 04/21/2017 Ozone Reply I’m so tired of reading about the “tons of bug-fixes” that comes with every ios version, when they always gives us a ton new ones! (otherwise there would be no need for the next ones “tons of bug-fixes”, right? Why don’t Apple, and everyone else stop that backlog, and hold the release until there are no bugs? I am still on ios’s cleanest, smoothest and less buggy version 8.3 with my iphone 6, and there I’m staying! Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Data centres generate a great deal of excess heat, and are generally not regarded as the most energy-efficient facilities. This one, however, will store up all of the excess heat that would usually go to waste, and give it straight back to the local community. The data centre will begin operation in the Jutland region of Denmark later in 2017, and will also be powered entirely by renewable energy. Apple is currently working with Aarhus University on a digester system that processes agricultural waste to generate methane, which in turn can be used a power source for the centre. Local farmers are also set to benefit from Apple’s eco-giveaway – one of the byproducts of the digester process is a nutrient-packed fertiliser that Apple will make available for use on farmland. This isn’t good guy Apple’s only green endeavour this year. It’s also planning to put another data centre in operation in Athenry, Ireland, which will be powered by energy generated by ocean waves. Apple is working with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to develop a new energy source, according to Macworld. The pair of eco facilities will cost a total of $1.8 billion to build, proving Apple certainly hasn’t taken its foot off the pedal since Greenpeace declared it the most energy-efficient of the 'Big Three' in January this year, with Facebook and Amazon lagging behind.

Web developer Xudong Zheng recently created a fake version of apple.com, which appears to have the exact same URL as the iPhone-maker’s online store.  Most people would have no issue clicking on the link, which appears to be completely legitimate. However, its actual URL is: “xn—80ak6aa92e.com”. There’s no malicious intent behind Mr Zheng’s fake apple.com, which simply contains a message reading, “Hey there! This may or may not be the site you are looking for! This site is obviously not affiliated with Apple, but rather a demonstration of a flaw in the way unicode domains are handled in browsers.” Gadgets and tech news in pictures + show all Gadgets and tech news in pictures 1/43 Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

It’s an old scam, known as an internationalised domain name (IDN) homograph attack, which was first reported back in 2001. The attack exploits the fact that lots of different characters look the same, and sneakily replaces certain Latin characters with identical- or near-identical-looking characters from non-Latin alphabets, such as Cyrillic. The URL for Mr Zheng’s fake Apple website uses a Cyrillic ‘a’, which is impossible to distinguish from the ASCII ‘a’. ASCII is an encoding standard for characters familiar to English readers, a hangover from the internet’s early days as a US creation. However, potential scammers can use a tool called Punycode to translate characters from Unicode, an encoding standard for a much wider range of characters, into ASCII, transforming a URL most internet users would never click on to something that looks completely innocent. Chrome 58, which was released this week, protects users from the issue. People using older versions of Google’s popular browser can still be affected, so it’s important to update. Read more Windows users urged to update computers after NSA hacking tool release The scam also works on Firefox, but not Safari or Internet Explorer. Firefox users can protect themselves by typing about:config into the address bar and marking network.IDN_show_punycode as True. This will display IDN domains in their Punycode form.  Mr Zheng says concerned users can also take extra precautions by manually typing out URL or navigating to sites via a search engine.

Living Computer Museum is now Living Computers: Museum + Labs! For more on LCM+L, go to https://t.co/ity89EFabC. #ComeInGeekOut pic.twitter.com/vItXZB3c7q — Living Computers (@LivingComputers) October 25, 2016 Steve, meet Paul The show opened in early April 2017 with a VIP preview night, to which the museum invited some of the amazing people who first created the personal computer, shaping the early days of the industry. This was quite a remarkable party, not least that it saw Microsoft co-founder, Paul Allen (who also founded the museum) and Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, meet for the very first time. Got to tell Paul Allen how what he did was a part of starting Apple. That's what doing things first is about. pic.twitter.com/A2Fws6mcai — Steve Wozniak (@stevewoz) April 13, 2017 In the world of microcomputers, Apple products, and specifically those designed by Woz, really stand out. “The circuit board layouts and efficient use of chips that Woz designed are beautiful pieces of engineering,” said Carlson. “The Apple II remains one of the best designed personal computers ever.” Getting the crew back together “I was rounding up the early Apple employees for a photo around our operational Apple 1,” Carlson told me. “Only when they were all lined up did they realize that the whole crew from Steve Jobs’ parents’ garage was there, except Steve himself," he said. "Woz, Bill Fernandez, Chris Espinosa, Randy Wigginton and Daniel Kottke, they had not all been together since the garage days.” (The original Apple I was built by these men in Steve Jobs’ parent’s garage). The founder of Silicon Valley’s Homebrew Computer Club, Gordon French, and moderator Lee Felsenstein, founders S-100 computer companies like Cromemco and IMSAI and the family of Apple engineer Don Hutmacher also turned up for the VIP event. These are the guys that built @LivingComputers Apple 1's in Steve Jobs's parents house. First time they all were together since! pic.twitter.com/JvDdZRms3L — Lath carlson (@LathCarlson) April 18, 2017 What you’ll find The Apple exhibit includes three Apple I machines with one being the only operable machine in the world. These machines – the first-ever Apple product -- were all handmade by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and their small team. Of the approximately 200 Apple I computers produced, fewer than 70 remain.  “By using the Apple 1, you experience first-hand how much more user friendly a keyboard and display screen is to use, when the machines that came before relied on switches and lights,” said Carlson. “Visitors will also get a sense for how limited many of the early personal computers were. They had poor resolution screens, very little memory (the Apple I came with 4K of RAM), and in many cases (like the original Macintosh) not much software.” “For me, seeing Steve Wozniak demonstrate the Apple I for his wife Janet at our event is not something I will ever forget,” said Carlson. What NeXT? There are other computers in the collection, including the Sanyo MBC-550, Amstrad PC1512, Microsoft “Green-Eyed” Mouse, Apple III,  Powermac G4, Microsoft SoftCard and the 1990 NeXTcube. The NeXTcube is also a highly important historical artefact. You could even argue that the reason you are reading this article  now is because of that system. Why? Because Sir Tim Berners-Lee created the world’s first Web browser and first Web server on a NeXTcube in 1990. Putting the personal in PC It’s easy to forget that the early days of computing were enabled by very personal triumphs and shared efforts. “In the early days of personal computers, everyone was working together. Microsoft was supplying up to 50 companies with software in the beginning, with much of it for Apple. "People would start projects in their garages, form companies, then fail and join other companies. In 1975-1978, it was a tremendously, dynamic industry, and one of the few times in the development of computers that single individuals could have such impact.” Carlson came across lots of evidence of the personal empowerment writ deep inside the tech industry during the opening night. “Many times, one of the guests would recognize a computer, or component they had a hand in designing, which made the event that much more memorable. The guests were so busy talking and reconnecting that very little of the food was eaten!” Hello Apple I Carlson had a great story about showing Kottke the Apple I that was once in Steve Jobs’ office.   “I was talking to long-time friend of Steve Jobs, and sometimes Apple employee, Daniel Kottke. We were looking at the Apple I that had come from Jobs’ office when Daniel remarked that the hand-drawn return arrow on the keyboard had been drawn by him,” said Carlson. “He then went on to reminisce about the time Jobs asked him to modify an Apple 1 with an EPROM so it could run BASIC without the need to load it from a cassette tape. "At that moment, I had the privilege of letting him know that the machine we were looking at was that same Apple 1, the only known machine to undergo that modification.” That moment when Daniel Kottke realized he's looking at the Apple 1 that Steve Jobs asked him to modify with an EPROM with BASIC on it. pic.twitter.com/c96Nl1b4J9 — Lath carlson (@LathCarlson) April 13, 2017 Just imagine how you might feel if you were Kottke coming across that. We invent tomorrow It is interesting to think about the significance of the technologies and individuals represented through this show. It is particularly significant as we look to a future in which computers become so much a part of life they almost disappear. As technology heads into AI, IoT, wearables, mobile and more, tomorrow’s tech future will look very different from today’s – and vastly different from then moments captured by the museum. “Moore’s Law is at its apex,” Carlson explains. “Basic physics dictates that there is a limit to how small components can get, whether it is the width of a photon of light, or the size of an atom. Also, most of us now have more computing power than we really need. "What we will see is a continued decrease in the cost of processors, to the point where they are almost free. We are also seeing some really interesting advances in memory.” The interface is also transforming. “In the future, I expect brain interfaces to continue to improve, and as computers get smaller and mostly cheaper, an increase in IoT-type devices and more ubiquitous computation,” he said. (Here’s one idea of how that might work). Knowledge is power Why did the Museum decide to launch this exhibition? To educate, entertain, and inspire, Carlson seemed to say. Most people won’t be able to visit the museum, but even at a distance the founders wanted to stress their message: “The computers of today are the direct descendants of the machines built by a bunch of people just like them in their garages and bedrooms, said Carlson. “Their collaboration, sharing and open standards enabled this world-changing technology to take off.” Ultimately the museum staff hope to infect people with a sense of personal empowerment and inspiration. “We want visitors to walk away from this exhibition inspired by the stories of the people that created these computers. Inspired to use technology, to solve their own problems, or even to create new technologies.” You can help The museum is looking for interesting computers, software, documentation and memorabilia to add to its collection. “One thing we are collecting right now is computer industry swag from historic conferences and fairs,” said Carlson.

The base model with a 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, 256GB flash storage, 8GB of RAM, and Intel Iris Graphics 550 is available for $1,529 in the United States, reflecting savings of $270 off Apple's regular price of $1,799. Available colors include both Silver and Space Gray. The base model is also available with an upgraded 16GB of RAM for $1,699, or $300 off Apple's regular price of $1,999. The higher-end model with a 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, 256GB flash storage, 8GB of RAM, and Intel Iris Graphics 550 is available for $1,699 in the United States, reflecting savings of $300 off Apple's regular price of $1,999. Available colors include both Silver and Space Gray. The higher-end model is also available with an upgraded 16GB of RAM for $1,869, or $330 off Apple's regular price of $2,199. Other built-to-order configurations are available for between $1,949 and $2,459 in the United States, including models with up to a 3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor, 1TB flash storage, and 16GB of RAM. Apple has also made refurbished 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models available in Canada for between $290 and $350 off. The 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and 13-inch model with standard function keys were added to Apple's refurbished store in March. Apple says refurbished MacBook Pro models are thoroughly inspected, tested, cleaned, and repackaged, including the manuals and cables included in the box. The notebooks are each given a new serial number and undergo a final quality assurance inspection prior to being added to Apple's refurbished store. A refurbished MacBook Pro comes with Apple's standard 1-year warranty effective on the date the notebook is delivered. The warranty can be extended to three years from the original purchase date with the AppleCare Protection Plan, which costs $279 for the 13-inch MacBook Pro in the United States.

(AAPL) Won’t Buy Walt Disney Co (DIS) – But It Will Do This It's a very unlikely merger, but a big deal could still be in play By Vince Martin, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 20, 2017, 12:07 pm EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: 10 Stocks That Won’t Exist in a Decade Apple Inc.

(AAPL) Won’t Buy Walt Disney Co (DIS) – But It Will Do This Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Beats on Q2 Earnings, But It’s Still a Trap 10 Stocks That Won’t Exist in a Decade View All Posts A report from RBC Capital Markets last week suggested that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could acquire Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS). Analyst Amit Daryanani said that multiple investors had asked him about the possibility of a merger between Apple and Disney, arguing that there was a non-zero possibility of such a deal occurring. Source: Shutterstock A combination of AAPL and Disney stock would be the largest merger in history — and in RBC’s estimation, a strong positive for Apple stock. The idea has been greeted with almost universal skepticism, and the report had little, if any, impact on trading in Apple shares. Indeed, the merger seems highly unlikely. But it does appear that Apple, which traditionally has shunned major acquisitions, could be in the market for a bigger target. That target may not be Disney. But there’s reason to believe Apple has a major deal in its future. What Would an Apple-Disney Merger Cost? Disney has an enterprise value of about $196 billion at the moment. Apple likely would offer a roughly 40% premium for Disney stock. In that case, the acquisition would cost Apple about $267 billion, including assumption of debt. That’s a huge price tag, obviously — but it’s not insurmountable. Apple could fund at least some of the purchase price with Apple stock. Apple already has about $226 billion in cash and securities as well. The one major problem is that most of the cash remains trapped overseas. If the Trump administration can’t push through a repatriation holiday, the cash portion of a Disney acquisition could be tougher to fund. Would Disney Benefit AAPL Stock? The strategic value of such a deal for Apple and AAPL stock is more complicated. On its face, the addition of Disney’s content would provide a huge leg up to Apple’s services business — notably both Apple TV and Apple Music. Apple has been trying to put together a streaming TV package for years — only to fall behind Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube, among others. Disney’s ABC and ESPN properties could form the beginning of a content package that could rival YouTube streaming, Hulu and other bundles. The counterargument is that adding Disney could ruin Apple’s ambitions in TV. The whole point of providing a streaming platform is to be provider-agnostic, something that Apple is … but it wouldn’t be if it owned Disney’s programming. Would a provider like AMC Networks Inc (NASDAQ:AMCX) want to license The Walking Dead to an Apple TV package if Apple also is a major competitor? The most interesting aspect of the deal would be Apple’s ownership of ESPN. ESPN is struggling badly with cord-cutting, which threatens its business model of charging $7-plus per subscriber per month — whether subscribers are interested in sports or not. The Apple delivery system, from one standpoint, could invigorate ESPN. From another standpoint, however, ESPN would be an anchor. Liberty Media Corporation (NASDAQ:FWONA) CEO John Malone speculated last year that Disney could split off ESPN and sell the rest of its assets to Apple for cash and/or Apple stock. Apple may not want to enter the live sports fray — and it may not be interested in what could be a long-term decline in ESPN viewership.

Of course, there’s no knowing for certain if that will be the case, so about six months is the time you will have to wait. However, if they are accurate, we could be in for a spectacular borderless iPhone. One that has nearly no bezels at all, and a curved OLED display. Here’s the latest on each and a few more interesting rumors thrown in for good measure. Images By Martin Hajek for Computer Build iPhone 8 Borderless? This first piece of information comes by way of a leak, and show new schematics shared via someone called KK, a Weibo user. As for the details, it looks like (according to this leak) the iPhone 8 will be almost the same length and height as the iPhone 7. However, it is clear to see that a larger display is present, measuring 14.65cm with a near borderless appearance. Meaning the bezels are still there but measure just 4mm, which isn’t exactly borderless, but as near as possible. As for the leak itself, you can see possible iPhone 8 images in the tweet below. However, they also reveal what looks like a slim and narrow speaker above the display, with what looks like a sensor cluster and camera lens. Here we go #iphone8 #iphonex or #iphoneedition pic.twitter.com/kxDDOKZ6XM — KK Sneak Leaks (@kksneakleaks) April 17, 2017 Curved OLED Display We’ve been reporting about the possibility of Apple, at last, removing the old IPS Lcd panels from its handsets for some time. However, there have conflicting rumors, some which suggest otherwise. Although now, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who is considered to be a reputable Apple Insider has added his piece to the chatter. He recently suggested that “People close to the matter” say the iPhone 8 will sport an OLED display. Furthermore, and in line with the borderless leak above the screen will cover the entire front of the 10th-anniversary device. As for the shape of the OLED panel, it will be flat on what looks like something similar to an iPhone 4 design. Although, it will be curved around the edges. Function Area Touchscreen According to the Express, the iPhone 8 will have an enormous edge-to-edge display. A display that falls in line with the leaks and insights of Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. However, the Express goes into a little more detail on what to expect including, what will replace the Home Button. Apparently called the “Function Area Touchscreen” this depicts an iPhone 8 with a much taller screen than we’ve seen before. In fact, it would need to be, as it (according to the report) will house Touch ID and the replacement Home Button. Furthermore, it will contain a row of buttons that react to what’s on screen. Could Apple be trying to replicate what it has on the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, in the form of a row of virtual buttons? If this latest rumor is accurate, it certainly seems so. As for additional functionality, auto-correct suggestions, menu items, and more could be brought to the fore. October or November Launch? Could Apple be about to miss its first September launch deadline? If recent reports are to believed, it will. And, it won’t be by choice, as apparently there are some, what seem like insurmountable issues with the OLED panel. Issues which some reports point towards the OLED lamination process as being the cause, and some towards the incorporation of a 3D sensing system. However, other reports have firmly laid the blame at the feet of Touch ID, and Apple’s insistence that it be beneath the OLED display. This apparently has led to production problems, which mean the iPhone 8 won’t be ready for September in its current form. To counter this, Apple will apparently, place Touch ID onto the rear of the next iPhone as a compromise. Doing so will allow it to meet its self-imposed September deadline, but create the same back camera lens smudging issue seen on the Galaxy S8.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple iPhone 8 schematic hints at rear-facing Touch ID, vertical dual cameras Apple iPhone 8 schematic hints at rear-facing Touch ID, vertical dual cameras By Bindu Nair - Apr 21, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Apple is rumored to be testing multiple prototypes of the iPhone 8 right now, some of which feature Touch ID on the front and some on the back. It’s apparently trying to overcome problems with the former and could be forced to opt for the latter if it doesn’t succeed. Frequent tipster Sonny Dickson has now provided evidence for the rear-facing fingerprint sensor via an alleged design schematic of the iPhone 8. The handset in the image features vertical dual cameras and what appears to be a cutout for Touch ID on the back. The positioning of the fingerprint reader below the Apple logo is pretty awkward. It’s already inspired an outpouring of extremely negative reactions online, with many pointing out that it’s not a convenient spot to place a finger on. Also See: Apple to kickstart trial assembly of iPhones in India next month MacRumors posits that the circular cutout could actually be for wireless charging, allowing the iPhone 8 to get fueled up without interference from the aluminum casing. It’s widely believed that all 3 new iPhones will support the feature, but it’s not clear if Apple will go with an all-metal body or wireless-friendly glass sandwich design. Bloomberg had previously reported that Apple was considering a simpler iPhone 8 style that would feature an aluminum back and slightly larger dimensions. The above photo falls in line with that thanks to its 149.5mm x 72.5mm size, which also coincidentally matches that of another design schematic leaked last week. In a tweet, Dickson pointed out that the iPhone 8 schematic he leaked doesn’t appear to have volume buttons, but this can’t be said for sure until clearer photos turn up. The mute switch, Lightning port, speaker grilles, and SIM card slot are all in place, with the long-lost 3.5mm headphone jack being the only other part missing.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Leaked documents hint at Apple AR glasses Apple Leaked documents hint at Apple AR glasses By Bindu Nair - Apr 21, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Apple’s AR ambitions are a well-known secret at this point, with CEO Tim Cook frequently talking about his enthusiasm for the technology. Unfortunately, little is known about what exactly the brand is planning. One persistent rumor that’s been dogging the company for quite a while now is a pair of AR-powered smart glasses. Fresh proof of these AR glasses has now emerged in the form of a leaked incident report compiled by Apple’s Environment Health and Safety contractor. The document was accidentally sent to hundreds of Apple employees and obtained by Gizmodo. The report contains brief descriptions of over 70 minor to major injuries which occurred on the Apple campus. One of the more interesting ones occurred on February 21 when an employee required ‘medical treatment beyond first aid’ after testing out a mysterious prototype. Also See: Apple gets permit to test autonomous cars in California She apparently experienced discomfort in her eye and told the study lead that she able to see the laser flash at multiple points during the experiment. The study lead then referred her to an optometrist and secured the prototype unit for analysis. A separate incident involving another employee saw that worker experiencing eye pain after working with a new prototype. The security seal on the magenta-colored outer case had apparently been broken, leading him to believe that the unit might have been tampered with. A source inside Apple speculates that this injury could have some relation to the AR products the company is testing, perhaps a pair of smart glasses with an overhead display. It’s also possible that the studies were related to other eye-related tech like the iPhone 8’s iris scanner or 3D facial recognition abilities.

Home Macs | 20 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (5) iLife and iWork Apps Now Free for Everyone by Josh Centers Once upon a time, Apple used to charge for nearly all its software, and especially productivity apps like the iLife and iWork suites. However, back in 2013, Apple made those apps free with the purchase of any new Mac or iOS device (see “New Free iLife and iWork Apps Share across Devices and Platforms,” 22 October 2013). Now, with no announcement or fanfare, Apple has made the current iLife and iWork apps entirely free for all users. Just to be clear, the change affects the following apps: GarageBand for macOS (requires 10.10 Yosemite) and iOS (requires iOS 10.2) iMovie for macOS (requires 10.11.2 El Capitan) and iOS (requires iOS 9.3) Keynote for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Numbers for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Pages for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) This is good news for holdouts who haven’t purchased a new eligible Apple device since 2013 but are running the necessary version of the operating system and would like copies of the iLife and iWork apps. And it makes explaining the pricing easier for Apple. Why didn’t Apple just make these apps free for everyone in the first place? The answer likely lies deep within Apple’s accounting department. By making iLife, iWork, and OS X 10.9 Mavericks free and bundling them with every new Mac and iOS device sold, Apple was able to delay recognition of a portion of its sales receipts. That’s because the product wasn’t “fully delivered” without updates to the software — it’s a “subscription accounting” approach. In its Q4 2013 financial quarter, Apple delayed recognition of $900 million in revenue, in essence hiding that money from the quarterly report (see “Apple Q4 2013 Results See Lower Profits Again,” 28 October 2013). That may answer the question of why Apple made this change now too. According to Daniel Eran Dilger of AppleInsider, the deferred revenue trickles back into Apple’s reported revenues over 2 years for iOS and 4 years for the Mac. It has been about 4 years since this deferral likely began, implying that Apple has finally cleaned the associated deferred revenue off its books. In the end, this change won’t mean much. Any effects from iLife and iWork becoming free — on competing apps, on Apple’s revenues, and on the perceived value of Apple hardware, for instance — have already taken place. Most people who want to use the iLife and iWork apps have likely either bought copies already or purchased new hardware since October 2013. We suspect that sales to owners of older Macs and iOS devices have dropped to the point where it was no longer worthwhile for Apple to bother charging for the apps anymore.

Reply Jeffrey Puritz  2017-04-20 17:33 You're an optimist but my lengthy experience with Apple tells me that like Aperture these apps are in for a long slow death by neglect. Sadly, I think that this is true for the mac as well. Apple is only interested in the products with the most revenue and it shows. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-04-20 18:15 Free may seem like a good thing, but nothing is really free. In this case we will be paying for these apps through hardware purchases, if we use an app or not. Then there is the question of app quality. Since Apple is not making any money off them anymore there is no stimulus to make these apps so good people will be willing to pay for them. The option to vote with our wallet has been taken from us. One sad example is the latest version of Numbers for iOS. The complaints and 1 star reviews are pouring in but Apple seems to be deaf and blind to them. Now that Numbers is free there is even less reason te expect Apple to do anything about this bad update. Reply Paul F Henegan   2017-04-21 03:55 No, they are not "free for everyone", only for those who have also upgraded to macOS X 12 or later. As Alfonso Scenna observes above, unless one is willing and able to run the very latest OS, there is no invitation to the party. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-21 09:39 You're right that these apps have specific system requirements, and we've updated the article to make this completely clear. However, that doesn't change the fact that the apps are indeed free for everyone. Your ability to run an app is separate from its price. Reply  Search   Cached.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Apple’s Hollywood strategy remains murky Christian Zibreg on April 21, 2017 1 Apple is launching a show about apps and their makers, titled “Planet of the Apps”, as well as a Carpool Karaoke spinoff this spring, marking its first two original reality shows. However, the company’s overall programming strategy when it comes to original video content production is still a moving target as to what exactly it wants to do in that space, several people in the industry have told Mashable. The publication claims Apple is quietly gearing up for a major content offensive, but cautions that its leadership isn’t sure what the company will focus on or who’s going to be in charge. “As of right now, there isn’t a structural approach,” a source said. “There’s been a little bit of a moving target as to what exactly their plan is.” This is precisely what The New York Post reported last month, alleging that senior Apple executives were clashing over who gets to secure major Hollywood deals. Multiple sources told Mashable that Apple’s head of content Eddy Cue and other top executives have been meeting with film and TV veterans, including with top dogs at Paramount Pictures and Sony TV. Other people familiar with Apple’s plans say the firm has upped its physical spaces in Los Angeles recently and is planning to expand its real estate footprint in the city to accommodate more hires and potential studio space. “One such location is in Culver City, a stone’s throw from Sony Pictures Entertainment,” says Mashable. “The location has in part fueled rumors that Apple could be looking to acquire the entertainment division, which is reportedly exploring a sale.” Showtime’s COO Tom Christie told Mashable during the SXSW entertainment festival in Austin, Texas that Apple could look upon Showtime as new distribution opportunities. “Ultimately the more distributors the better for the consumers and the better opportunity for Showtime to get sold,” he said. Recode recently alleged that that the iPhone maker could be considering offering a “premium TV bundle” with content from the networks HBO, Showtime and Starz. While Apple was reportedly planning a panel at SXSW, it later changed its mind for reasons unknown. Apple’s Eddy Cue said at the Code conference in February that they were not attempting to gain a foothold  in Hollywood by buying and distributing a bunch of TV shows. “We’re trying to do some things we think are creative and can move culture and we think that Apple can add some value to,” he said, adding that Apple is interested in working on “a lot more content and a lot more unique things that haven’t been seen before.” Apple declined to comment for Mashable’s story.

Hell when did the AppleTV officaily get out of being a hobbdy for them? Apple appears to be lacking leadership and strategy on so many levels.

In addition to powering the center entirely from renewable energy, the company is capturing the waste heat generated and feeding it into a district heating system, to warm local homes … NordVPN As MacWorld spotted, that’s not the only example of Apple’s desire to combine environmentalism with being a good neighbour. The data center in the Jutland region will be partly powered by recycling waste products from farms. Apple is working with Aarhus University on a system that passes agricultural waste through a digester to generate methane, which is then used to help power the data center. The digester reaction turns some of the waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer, which Apple returns to local farmers to use on their fields. The center should also be making a worthwhile contribution to the Danish economy. The government said last year that the $950M project represented the largest foreign capital investment in the country’s history. Coupled to the Irish data center – which has had something of a rough ride – the two add up to Apple’s biggest ever investment in Europe. Apple said in its annual Environment Responsibility Report that it is working toward a goal of making all of its products from 100% recycled materials, ending the need for mining. It didn’t, however, put a time on this, which I think represents a missed opportunity. Underlining the importance of renewable energy, a new app uses augmented reality to bring to life NASA’s projections of rising sea levels over the next 60-70 years.

Normally this is a feature reserved for the iOS ecosystem, but doubleTwist found a way to AirPlay songs through Apple TV on an Android device. In late March, however, Apple released an update to tvOS that broke doubleTwist’s ability to tie into Apple TV and be used for music streaming. Apple once again walled up their garden, but thankfully, the devs have since restored access to AirPlay in version 2.7.8 of its doubleTwist Pro app. What’s more, AirPlay functionality has also been added for CloudPlayer, allowing you to stream your cloud music to Apple TV too. See also: Apparently Apple wants to join forces with Foxconn on Toshiba bid 1 week ago In 2011 this app was almost an essential way to listen to music without having to be wired via a headphone jack to the speakers. Nowadays, we don’t even have headphones jacks we have products such as the Chromecast Audio that not only work with any operating system, but also cost less than a $149 Apple TV. Of course, the app is still useful in linking your iTunes library to your Android device, but with more and more people switching to streaming services instead of owning digital songs, even this feature is being outgrown in 2017.

The limited edition watch maintains the features of its predecessor but comes with a new design (and by "design" they mean "color option"). While the Nike+ comes in a black or white color options, the NikeLab variant combines both, with a Space Gray aluminum body and Light Bone/Black band.     The new smartwatch comes with standard Apple Watch Series 2 features, along with Nike exclusive extras already embedded into the Nike+ watch.   Apple Watch NikeLab will be available on April 27th on Nike's website, at NikeLab stores and the Apple Watch Store at Isetan Shinjuku.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE Steve Wozniak discusses how Apple is becoming Microsoft, commercial space travel, and more Jonathan Vanian, Fortune@JonathanVanian April 21, 2017 7:30 AM Above: Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak speaks with Conan O'Brien on the "Conan" show on TBS on March 7, 2016. Image Credit: Screenshot There would be no Apple without Steve Wozniak. Wozniak, who co-founded Apple over 40 years ago with the late Steve Jobs, remains a revered figure in Silicon Valley. Although he is no longer connected with Apple, he keeps busy making appearances at big tech conferences to inspire inventors, serves as chief scientist for the enterprise data storage startup Primary Data, and even found time to cha-cha-cha on the TV show Dancing With The Stars a few years ago. On Friday, Wozniak returns to the upcoming Silicon Valley Comic Con event where pop culture fans, celebrities, and technologists will celebrate “the nerd side of things,” as he put it. In this edited interview with Fortune, Wozniak discusses how his former company is acting like Microsoft, the influence of money in Silicon Valley, and being an introvert in the social networking era. Fortune: How has the tech landscape changed over the years? Wozniak: When Steve and I started Apple we were so naïve and young. We didn’t know anything about business. We didn’t know that it’s often the case that you start a company and then you get bought out as an exit strategy. We thought that you start at home, you make a product, and become profitable so you have your company forever. As long as it makes a profit, it never goes away. That’s how I thought companies worked. Boy, it’s a different story now in Silicon Valley. I think there are an awful lot of people who have a quick exit plan like selling the business to another big company to get enough money to buy a house in San Francisco. Then they move on to the next one. There are many companies that are started by business people and not engineers. Engineers say, “What would be a cool product? What would make the world greater and better?” That’s where I come from. Engineering is your line of work. I do not invest. I don’t do that stuff. I didn’t want to be near money, because it could corrupt your values. What are your thoughts on the rise of engineers as rock stars in Silicon Valley? Mostly it’s because of how much money they have — and I went the other way. I did not want to be one of them. I invested early in things like museums in the city I love, San Jose. I was born there, and I have a street named after me there because of it. I really didn’t want to be in that super “more than you could ever need” category. Did you ever think when you were starting Apple that software companies like Facebook would become so dominant? Well, there was Microsoft. I was just on CNBC and they were asking, “Oh, my gosh. Apple wants to make this software and license it for self-driving cars.” Well, Apple’s becoming Microsoft. Microsoft had an operating system that was their crown jewel and they licensed it to everybody. Apple said no — they had to make the hardware. Hardware and software have to go together [in computers], but not so in cars. What is your take on commercial space travel and people like Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk getting involved? Nobody expected the iPhone. Nobody expected Google. Nobody expected Facebook and Twitter would be these great things. It is really hard to predict with a spreadsheet what makes sense; otherwise big companies that already existed would have created those things. Of course SpaceX [Musk’s space startup] and Blue Origin [Bezos’ space startup], they’re not coming out of nowhere, but they’re coming out of individuals trying to do something very risky. It is very risky, but it is fascinating to watch what these companies are doing. Yeah, space exploration comes down to engineering and scientific knowledge. It does take a certain amount of funding, but NASA’s budget seems so small for what they bring us. It just seems so small that I’m not surprised that large private players can make a difference too. You recently said that companies like Apple and Google would be even bigger in 2075 than they are now. Do you think these companies will do so by expanding into other areas, like how Google and Apple are moving into healthcare? I don’t know. Every company should do what they’re good at. There are actors who are just good at acting. Everyone shouldn’t try to do every single thing in the world, and Apple’s big thing, really, is more about protecting the brand. Making products a certain way that protects your brand. That’s one role. That’s one key role in the world, and it doesn’t mean making every single product. Everyone who owns Apple shares just says, “No, no, no, you gotta have something new now.” Well that’s Silicon Valley in that you’re always chasing the next new thing and you never get to stop. I mean unless you’re somewhat smart. Why is your Twitter feed essentially a timeline of places you’ve visited and restaurants you’ve eaten at? I am not the right person for social networks. I was never social in my life. I am not good at socializing in person. I skipped Facebook and I skipped Twitter when it came out, because I’d wind up with everybody asking me to be a friend. I have 5,000 Facebook friends I don’t know, and I’m going to scan what they’re doing in their lives everyday? It doesn’t work well for me because I won’t just cut it down to only the 100 people I really know. But I found Foursquare. I was actually in Spain and some young kids introduced me to Foursquare, so I started checking in. I thought, “My wife will be able to see where I am.” But if I check into a restaurant and somebody comments on it, I get that comment in an email from Facebook. So I typically have 100 to 200 Facebook inquires a day, and some of those I go in and answer when I feel my answer’s important. It’s interesting that you prefer Foursquare over other social networks. It’s kind of one-directional, and Twitter can be one-directional. To tell you the truth, I admire what Twitter is and what it’s done for the world. And I admire Facebook, but I’m a little scared of the power Facebook and Google get and I avoid them more than most people. My calendar is on Google and about nothing else of me wants to touch Google. When I get these advertisements all over the place and they’re exactly what I’ve been looking at recently, you’re living in my world. You’re making it stale. That’s not the adventurous world of going and watching a new movie with superheroes achieving victory. Well, that’s a realistic application of artificial intelligence today. That’s today’s level of simulated intelligence to kind of knowing you. The funny thing is, everyone in popular culture movies has to be an individual — to be above the others, to be super. And that’s how we think of ourselves as human beings. Well, what am I? I’m what’s in my brain. I have my memories, my feelings, my way of thinking of the world. And that’s who I am.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Lowest P/E Stocks Today Using Apple, HP Inc., and Qualcomm as examples of the benefits and drawbacks that come from investing in value stocks. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Apr 21, 2017 at 10:31AM Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down. -- Warren Buffett As far as investing strategies go, there are worse practices than buying something for $0.80 and eventually selling it for $1.00. At a basic level, this is the idea underlying the school of finance commonly known as value investing. Backed by plenty of empirical evidence, value investing has been demonstrated time and again as a way to outperform the broader market when applied properly. It's also what makes cheap stocks today like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) examples of the good, the bad, and the ugly that come from buying empirically cheap stocks. Apple Apologies in advance for the lack of originality, but tech giant Apple remains, in my view, one of the cheapest and most attractive stocks on the market today. Let's briefly review some of the finer points behind Apple's investment thesis. Trading at 17 times its last 12 months earnings, the Mac maker does not look like a total steal at first glance, although its shares remain far cheaper than the S&P 500 at 26 times earnings. However, after subtracting the $185 billion in net cash on its balance sheet from its market capitalization, Apple's core business can be said to be trading at just 12 times last year's earnings, a discount of more than 50% to the market. This says nothing of the current-year sales and profit surge one can reasonably expect in the year ahead thanks to the late-2017 launch of the iPhone 8. Thanks to Apple's massive installed base and the fact that it has yet to update the iPhone form factor since the iPhone 6, it seems likely Apple will benefit from a significant iPhone upgrade cycle over the coming 12 months. This only scratches the surface of its longer-term investment thesis, but hopefully, it demonstrates why Apple shares are too cheap to ignore today. Image source: Getty Images. HP Inc. A stock cheaper than Apple, HP shares currently trade hands at 12 times their last 12 months' earnings and 10 times their estimated next 12 months' EPS. However, unlike Apple, HP shares can be seen as being "cheap for a reason" because of the far less attractive economics of its core business.  When the former Hewlett-Packard split into two companies in late 2015, CEO Meg Whitman stayed at the helm of what can be viewed as the "good business," though more recent evidence suggests the opposite. This business trades as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise today and deals with the enterprise IT and server operations of the Silicon Valley icon. After the split, HP Inc. controls the PC and printing operations. As has been the general trend in the PC business, sales at HP Inc. have gradually declined in recent years. And though the PC will never fully disappear, the sell-side community expects HP Inc.'s sales and profits to remain tepid over the next several years. Seen this way, HP Inc. stock stands as a useful contrast to Apple in that it demonstrates that not all cheap stocks are created equal. More often than not, the market tends to price stocks fairly, and HP Inc. certainly looks like a slow- to no-growth company that is priced as such. Qualcomm Lastly, I included struggling chipmaker Qualcomm in this list as a cautionary example of a possible pitfall in value investing. As a highly profitable company trading at 16 times current earnings and 11 times forward earnings, it's easy to look at Qualcomm as a company the market simply misunderstands, like Apple. However, Qualcomm could be seen as what the investment community refers to as a "value trap," the very opposite of an attractive value stock. Qualcomm operates two core businesses. It designs and sells various semiconductors that deal with mobile connectivity, an activity that generates about two-thirds of the company's sales. Because of its important role in developing connectivity technologies like 3G and 4G LTE, Qualcomm's other business collects royalty revenue from nearly every cellular device produced worldwide. This highly profitable activity generated 85% of the company's pre-tax income last year.  However, Qualcomm's patent licensing segment has recently been hit by a raft of antitrust fines and lawsuits from regulators and companies who accuse the company of charging abusive rates for access to its patents. The trend started in China, where Qualcomm eventually agreed to pay a $975 million fine in 2015. Then, late last year, South Korean regulators hit Qualcomm with a $853 million charge on similar grounds. To make matters worse, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also accused Qualcomm of monopolistic practices in January; a similar investigation is underway in the EU. Finally, adding insult to injury, Apple -- a longtime customer of Qualcomm -- actually sued the chipmaker for $1 billion days after its U.S. FTC charges were filed.  Many of these legal issues are still playing out, and Qualcomm has a vested interest in vigorously defending its profit center segment. The sheer volume of the legal pressure facing Qualcomm calls into question the company's entire business model, though, and that's why its shares are so cheaply valued at present. Hopefully this provided a useful overview of the various types of investing situations one may encounter when sifting through cheap stocks, ranging from diamonds in the rough to highly risky situations. The important thing to remember is that investors always need to dig into the quantitative and qualitative reasons for why a stock is valued a certain way. Value investing can be one of the most consistent strategies to use to beat the market if done skillfully, but not all cheap stocks are created equal. Andrew Tonner owns shares of Apple.

By: Reuters | Updated: April 21, 2017 7:48 pm San Diego-based Qualcomm also warned that it was unclear whether Apple’s contract manufacturers would underpay royalties owed in the third quarter, leading to the wider-than-usual profit forecast for the period. ( Image for representation, Source: Reuters) Qualcomm Inc, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, reported quarterly revenue and profit that beat analysts’ estimates, helping ease concerns surrounding the company’s dispute with Apple Inc. Investors pushed the company shares – the worst performer year-to-date on the Philadelphia semiconductor index – up 2.4 percent to $53.85 in after-market trading on Wednesday. The iPhone maker sued Qualcomm in January, accusing the chipmaker of overcharging for its chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm said on Wednesday that Apple’s contract manufacturers underpaid royalties in the second quarter, but revenue was not affected as the amount was similar to what Apple claimed Qualcomm owed it. San Diego-based Qualcomm also warned that it was unclear whether Apple’s contract manufacturers would underpay royalties owed in the third quarter, leading to the wider-than-usual profit forecast for the period. However, Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said on a post-earnings call that the company expected to continue to be an “important supplier to Apple now and into the future”. Qualcomm forecast current-quarter adjusted profit of 90 cents-$1.15 per share and revenue of $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.09 per share and revenue of $5.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The royalties issue also weighed on Qualcomm’s second-quarter results. Also Read: Qualcomm claims Apple made threats and lied to regulators The quarter included a $974 million reduction to revenue, or 48 cents per share, related to an arbitration over a royalties dispute with BlackBerry Ltd. Revenue fell 9.6 pct to $5.02 billion in the three months ended March 26. On an adjusted basis, Qualcomm reported revenue of $5.99 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $5.89 billion. Despite the litigation worries, revenue in the Qualcomm Technology Licensing business rose about 5 percent to $2.25 billion, ahead of the analysts’ estimate of $2.24 billion, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. The licensing unit contributed about 85 percent of the company’s earnings before taxes in 2016. Charter Equity analyst Edward Snyder attributed the results in part to catch-up payments by customers who had earlier disputed them. “It’s kind of a confusing mess right now on who’s coming and who’s going, that’s one of the reasons that you’re not seeing the stock perform better,” Snyder said. The company also said there was increased demand for its Snapdragon mobile chips, particularly in China, boosting revenue by 10 percent in its chip-making unit. Also Read: Apple-Qualcomm billions put at risk as phone alliance frays Qualcomm’s market share in China is expected to increase to 65 percent this year from 50 percent in 2016, with share gains in OPPO, Vivo, Xiaomi and Meizu, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang wrote in a note. Excluding items, Qualcomm earned $1.34 per share, above analysts’ average estimate of $1.19.

Increase / Decrease text size Joe Clark   - Reporter 21st April 2017 Add to favorites Apple Augmented Reality glass may be coming sooner than you think, if a leaked environmental incident report is to be believed. Apple Augmented Reality glasses may be a reality and coming sooner than you think, if a recent report is to be believed. An internal incident report, compiled by an Environmental Health and Safety contractor with Apple, was mistakenly mailed to many Apple employees, which was then leaked to Gizmodo. The incident report is vague in detail but does mention several incidents which could pertain to some variation of high tech specs. The report mentions 70 incidents regarding possible health and safety issues, including incidents with eyes and wearables. The report, “Impact Descriptions Reported in [Santa Clara Valley] from Last Month” is predominantly made up of inconsequential and routine office incidents, such as burns in the cafeteria, or someone feeling dizzy, but the more interesting sections of the report mention Apple prototypes. February 21st: “After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis.” March 2nd: “Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with.” These reports are lacking any kind of context, but Apple CEO, Tim Cook has stated in the past that he thinks Augmented Reality is a big deal, even going insofar as to tell the Independent “I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone.” “I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it’s not a product per se, it’s a core technology,” AR is definitely becoming a driving force in technology, Snap recently announced that it will be expanding its Lenses technology, Facebook has introduced the concept of Lenses to its Stories system, and Niantic’s Pokemon Go continues to generate enormous user interaction, and revenue. Apple have not yet commented on the leaked report.

Apple Apple reveals in its yearly Environmental Responsibility Report how it goes to great lengths to ensure product safety. The company has built test centres at its manufacturing facilities despite already having one huge testing lab full of scientists. The tech giant also creates artificial sweat to test products like the Apple Watch, further bolstering its innovator status. Apple runs its own environmental testing lab to make sure that its products are not only people-safe, but also Earth-friendly. The company doesn’t seem content on just choosing the right materials as it goes “far beyond what’s required by law.” And Apple claims that it doesn’t count on third party specialists to look for potentially harmful elements as it has its own team of chemists and toxicologists on the payroll to do that. The company’s environmental testing lab in Cupertino, California has grown more than 20 times its original size when it was constructed just over a decade ago. Apple also makes it a habit to update the place with state-of-the-art equipment. Aside from the Cupertino lab, Apple likewise has test centres put up at its manufacturing facilities to assess and validate products during the course of the manufacturing process. Apple is also into biocompatibility. The company says that it carefully tests all Apple product components that come in direct contact with skin since many people are allergic to various materials. And the Mac maker pushes boundaries when it comes to these things. The company does nickel leach testing on the Apple Watch and its other wearables to see how fast nickel is able to transfer from metal parts into sweat. Not only that, Apple says it creates artificial sweat when it comes to such tests. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. “By placing different components in jars of the artificial sweat, we can closely monitor samples to ensure that nickel and other allergens and irritants stay where they belong,” says Apple. “And we go far beyond sweat in our testing. We analyse materials that someone might put in their mouth — like an Apple Pencil you might chew on while considering the next line in your drawing — to make sure they’re safe.” Apple hasn’t gone into specifics on how it produces artificial sweat for the Apple Watch bands, but the company deserves props for being bold enough to do such a rather particular undertaking. Apple likewise does product evaluation even after said products have already gone through extensive reliability tests, just to make sure that the devices remain safe to use several years after being exposed to various types of environmental settings.

Cook's tweet includes a picture of a few billboards that are up in Turkey, which showcase photographs taken by "young talents" within the country in order to celebrate the national holiday. Türkiye'de Ulusal Egemenlik ve Çocuk Bayramı’nı genç yeteneklerin çektiği müthiş fotoğraflarla kutluyoruz. #23Nisan #iPhoneileçekildi 🇹🇷 pic.twitter.com/VUqrUjH92G— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) April 21, 2017 Additionally, over the past few days Apple has been uploading a few new videos to its Turkish YouTube channel, all celebrating Children's Day as well. Using the "Shot on iPhone" campaign, each new ad includes a short video clip that has been taken by kids aged ten to eleven years old. The newest video, uploaded yesterday, includes a slow-motion shot of seagulls. The other Children's Day Apple ads include Shot on iPhone videography with unexpected perspectives, animal close-ups, and more slow-motion shots. The Shot on iPhone campaign has been running for years now, and Apple frequently uses the strategy to celebrate specific national holidays. Earlier in February, the company created a Carnival-specific video for its Brazilian YouTube channel to showcase "the diversity, variety and freedom of expression of Carnival." Since the iPhone 7 launched, Apple's ads have mostly focused on the improved photography capabilities of the smartphone.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Today Google Home's Virtual Assistant can learn its Owner's voice for Security Reasons like Apple's Patent Pending Idea | Main | Qualcomm's Sales Decline for Baseband Modems for the iPhone 8 will hurt their Bottom Line » April 21, 2017 Why is Foxconn Pushing Sharp back into the Smartphone Market so Aggressively?   In March Patently Apple posted a report titled "Politics Likely Played a Role in Softbank's Decision to Back Off their Investment in a new Apple Rival Led by Andy Rubin." Softbank was about to back an emerging smartphone company by the name of 'Essential' led by Andy Rubin, Android's architect, when they pulled out of the deal at the last minute "partly because of the Japanese investor's increasingly close relationship with Apple Inc.," reported the Wall Street Journal. Yet the Wall Street Journal's report didn't say that Foxconn was pulling out specifically. Foxconn was trying to gain the manufacturing business for this new smartphone that will be a new competitor to Apple, their number one customer.   On April 16 Patently Apple posted a report titled "What's the Game Plan for the Ever Aggressive Foxconn? In that report we covered a Nikkei report that Foxconn/Sharp was mulling re-entry into the PC Market under the Sharp brand. Sharp's President Tai Jeng-wu added that they had no plans of restarting its smartphone business.   I noted in the report that if Foxconn would be willing to get Sharp back into the dying PC business, why wouldn't they consider the smartphone business?   Today the Chinese-language Economic Daily News is reporting that Sharp aims to ship one million smartphones this year. The report notes that "Sharp has revamped its strategy for smartphones and aims to ship over one million smartphones in fiscal 2017."   This news is on the heels of our report that Sharp was getting their OLED fab for smartphone displays up to speed. It would now appear that the race to get their OLED plant up and running wasn't for Apple but rather for their own smartphones, something that Sharp's president just recently stated they wouldn't do. Either the Nikkei is completely unreliable as a source or there's a deceptive game playing out.   Today's report further states that "Sharp has also decided to market its flagship family products under a single "Aquos R" brand in the Japan market, replacing the previous brands of Aquos Zeta, Aquos Serie and Aquos Xx used by different distributors."   The report further noted that "To stage a comeback in the China market, Sharp has recently recruited Lou Zhongsheng, former vice president of the Coolpad Group, to head its smartphone business unit in China. Sharp has been absent from China's smartphone market for four years.   Sharp also plans to start selling its smartphones in Europe in 2018 through one of its subsidiaries, the paper added.   In Taiwan, Sharp recently launched its Sharp Z3 smartphone, targeting the mid-range segment. The Sharp Z3 features a 5.2-inch 2K display which can deliver a brightness of up to 520nits and is priced at NT$13,990 (US$461) unlocked."   With Foxconn likely still backing the upcoming Essential smartphone while making a huge push into the OLED market and pushing Sharp back into the smartphone business, especially in China, what are we missing here?   Is Foxconn going to test out Sharp's new OLED's in the market first to prove to Apple that they have the expertise and volume to satisfy their future needs? Is Foxconn out to hurt Samsung their mortal enemy?   Even Foxconn's bid for Toshiba is confused in the press. First Reuters and Bloomberg reported that Foxconn could make a deal for Toshiba with Apple. Then earlier this week the Nikkei reported that Foxconn eyed involving Sharp in Toshiba bid while seeking Softbank's Chairman for assistance in the bidding war as well. Their original bid was with TSMC.   The basic thinking was that a Foxconn victory in gaining Toshiba would be a direct gain for Apple so that they wouldn't have to rely on Samsung so heavily. But a Toshiba victory for Foxconn could now be seen as a strategic move to support both Sharp's push back into the smartphone market in addition to supporting Essential which is likely to be a Samsung competitor in the Android market in the U.S.   For 2017, Foxconn has been one of the most aggressive tech companies on the planet attacking multiple market fronts at lightning speed and Toshiba is only their latest known move. We assume and hope that Apple's number one supplier is working to help Apple move away from Samsung on many fronts so that their relationship will only get stronger. And yet, some of their moves are questionable without having a context. Do we cheer Foxconn on or do we begin to question their alliance with Apple?   Unfortunately that can't be answered today because it's an ongoing story that's still unfolding and something tells me that there's a lot more news from Foxconn still to come in the coming months ahead.   Like a good tension-filled TV series like 24, the story is one of the most fascinating in the tech sector to date with each episode building towards an end that we yet don't understand. The pieces of the story are purposely scrambled to keep us guessing.   Yet the one nagging question that keeps popping up is why has Foxconn pushing Sharp back into the smartphone business so aggressively?   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Apple Apple makes half a gallon of synthetic human sweat each day to test its products Chris Smith @chris_writes April 20th, 2017 at 3:36 PM Share Tweet Here’s one quality assurance and environment-related test you didn’t expect from the iPhone maker: Apple manufactures half of gallon of sweat each day just so it can test it out on some of its new products. Don't Miss: Niantic is finally addressing Pokemon Go’s biggest problem Apple announced a significant new sustainability initiative this week, one that sounds great in theory, but might be harder to implement. The Cupertino-based company wants to stop using mined minerals in its products going forward and rely only on recycled materials instead. While explaining its new goal to Vice, Apple also demoed its special Apple Environmental Testing Lab where chemists and toxicologists use “unusual methods to gauge the impact of their products on users and the environment they live in.” One such test involves shooting a laser like the one found on the Mars rover to vaporize elements and see what happens. A different test uses that human-like sweat I mentioned. Apparently, Apple needs to make half of gallon of fake human sweat that’s supposedly just like the real one, to see what happens when you hold products in it, including AirPods and Apple Watch bands, which are exactly the kind of Apple gadgets more likely to come in contact with plenty of sweat. “We carefully test all product materials that come in contact with skin,” Apple explained in its annual Environmental Responsibility Report. “For example, many people are allergic to nickel, which is common in many alloys like stainless steel. So we do nickel leach testing on Apple Watch and other wearable devices to measure how quickly nickel can transfer from metal parts into sweat. We even create artificial sweat to conduct such tests. By placing different components in jars of the artificial sweat, we can closely monitor samples to ensure that nickel and other allergens and irritants stay where they belong.” Here’s what appears to be a batch of Apple Watch metal chassis immersed in fake sweat: Image Source: YouTube Apple Watch bands: Image Source: Apple AirPods get the same treatment: Image Source: YouTube This is where the “used” sweat goes: Image Source: YouTube Fake sweat aside, Apple’s Environmental Testing Lab is going to play an important part in Apple’s plan to ditch its reliance on mined-minerals.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Virtual Reality Apple has a mystery prototype that injures employees’ eyes Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 20th, 2017 at 3:58 PM Share Tweet According to a workplace Health and Safety report obtained by Gizmodo, Apple is working on some kind of eye-mounted system that involves using lasers. We only know this because in two instances, Apple employees were left injured after testing the prototype. Don't Miss: Verizon is losing customers like crazy, even with unlimited data plans The document leaked to Gizmodo is an incident report on workplace injures, compiled for Apple by an independent contractor. The report details a number of accidents that could be linked to new products Apple is testing, including a face-mounted AR or VR system, and possibly a minivan linked to an Apple project. The report details two injuries related to a prototype that sounds like it has a lot to do with augmented reality: “After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis.” In another report, an employee working at Apple’s Vallco Parkway office in Cupertino reported eye pain on March 2. “Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with.” A source inside Apple speculated that this injury may have something to do with an augmented reality product Apple may be testing, something like glasses with an overhead display. Laser flashes and “eye pain associated with use” all sound like some kind of head-mounted display, like the ill-fated Google Glass. The fact that the prototype had a magenta housing also points it towards being a piece of wearable technology. The only thing that Apple has gone out of its way to make colorful is its other wearable, the Apple Watch. Apple has been linked to some kind of augmented reality project for a long time. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly said that he thinks AR will be more interesting than VR, and numerous reports have suggested that Apple has been working on a prototype for some time now. The leaked report also detailed an incident where a company-owned minivan turned into a crosswalk and hit an Apple employee. It’s possible that the minivan is something to do with Apple’s long-rumored self-driving car program, or it could also be collecting mapping data for Apple Maps.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals How to check the warranty status of your devices with the Apple Support app Steffen Reich on April 21, 2017 6 We have previously plugged Apple’s warranty check page in order for you to get answers to your coverage questions, but with the release of Apple’s own Support app, things have gotten a whole lot easier once again. Overall, the application deserves praise for its smart itemization of your devices right out of the gate and the subsequent device-specific breakdown of submenus. This is what facilitates the super fast warranty checks demonstrated below, however it is also the reason you should be inclined to download the app for any other support related purpose. In this post, we will show you how to use the Apple Support app to check the warranty status of your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or other Apple devices. Check the warranty of your devices using the Apple Support app First, you’re going to want to get your hands on the app itself from the App Store. Once settled on your home screen, it’s mere child’s play! 1) Pop open the blue Apple Support app. 2) Log in using your Apple ID credentials. 3) Next, Apple support will conjure up a list of all products tied to your ID, which should resemble the list below (except hopefully boasting less antique MacBooks in your case). 4) Reviewing any of your devices’ warranty status is considerably easy from here on: first choose the one you want to screen and tap it! 5) At the top of your product’s dedicated page, hit the blue Product Details tag. 6) And here we are. The first box of text reflects whether or not your product is covered by AppleCare or Limited Warranty (conferred automatically on the day of purchase). The follow up explains the implications for your Repairs and Service Coverage. Note that the page in front of you solely indicates the warranty status of the one device you selected prior. The information will vary from device to device and usage of the terms ‘Limited Warranty’ versus ‘AppleCare’ are mutually exclusive: as you can see below, Limited Warranty precludes AppleCare and vice versa. That’s all there is to it, easy as pie. I love the Apple Support app just for this shortcut, because it is so, so easy to lose sight of the state of things when it comes to your Apple warranties. Try it out and remind yourself at what point you’re going to have to start treating your iPhone a little better to avoid sky high repair charges!

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: iDropNews Apple said to be building 100M new iPhones as Samsung strives for 60M Galaxy S8s Chris Smith @chris_writes April 19th, 2017 at 2:40 PM Share Tweet Apple is working on three new iPhones this year, with the iPhone 8 expected to bring over a variety of novel features according to many reports. Those features should include a full-screen design, wireless charging, and next-generation augmented reality capabilities. According to a new report from Asia, chip suppliers will start stocking parts for the upcoming iPhones in the second quarter and will accelerate production towards the end of the quarter. Don't Miss: Everyone’s favorite Alexa smart plug is back on sale on Amazon According to Digitimes, chip demand for Apple’s next iPhones will exceed 50 million sets per quarter during the second half of the year. If accurate, Apple may produce more than 100 million new iPhones, including iPhone 8, iPhone 7s, and iPhone 7s Plus this year. The report notes that total iPhone sales might hit a total of 220 million to 230 million units. That estimate is only for the 2017 iPhones, which is an impressive number, considering that Apple will probably continue to sell the iPhone SE and iPhone 7 series alongside the upcoming devices. Samsung, meanwhile, reportedly has an internal sales target of 60 million new Galaxy S8 and S8+ handsets, combined. The report notes that TSMC will make the A11 chip that will power all 2017 iPhones. The foundry is expected to ramp up production in the second half of the year, and the 10nm node should account for about 10% of its wafer sales during the six-month period. Other chips suppliers that are said to be making parts for the iPhone include ADI, Broadcom, Cirrus Logic, Cypress, NXP, Qualcomm, STMicroelectronics, and TI. Apple may be getting ready to mass produce more than 100 million iPhones this year, but more and more reports say the iPhone 8 will see significant delays, as Apple is experiencing manufacturing issues with certain technologies like the in-screen fingerprint scanner.

By Patrick Thibodeau Senior Editor, Computerworld | Apr 21, 2017 3:00 AM PT Credit: Thinkstock More like this 5 tech battles facing Trump Trump at risk of 'letting down American workers,' says IEEE-USA Silicon Valley's Trump rebellion now has EFF calling for more encryption Video Schneider Electric's microgrid Some PCs are assembled in the U.S., but not many. This includes those from Lenovo, the China-based firm that runs a factory in North Carolina. Apple operates a Mac Pro assembly plant in Austin, but makes many of its other products overseas. Lenovo and Apple may have an edge in selling PCs to the U.S., under President Donald Trump's recently signed "Hire American, Buy American" executive order signed this week, say analysts. All PCs are made with components sourced globally, but vendors that assemble products in the U.S. may gain preference. Trump's executive order doesn't spell out how "buying American" will work for IT suppliers -- if it happens at all. The Trump order may have more pull concerning hiring under federal contracts and federally funded projects. Many IT projects are restricted from foreign labor by security clearances, but not all. [ Further reading: Hottest jobs, cities and industries for IT pay in 2017 ] The hire American aspect of the order may force firms, and federal agencies themselves, that are using H-1B workers to hire U.S. workers instead. "I think there will be more scrutiny with regard to who actually performs on the contract," said Katell Thielemann, an analyst at Gartner. In terms of hardware, in 2004 the government recognized the problems with trying to source tech in the U.S., and it exempted commercial IT projects from the Buy American Act of 1933. But Trump could revisit this waiver, and if he does problems await. "Think about the prevalence of open source software like Linux across all federal agencies," said Thielemann. "How do you really carve out the piece [of code] that is 'American' -- it's impossible to do." "The government has information technology that it frankly cannot source from the United States alone," said Thielemann. Thielemann believes what's at the core of Trump order is a crackdown on large-scale waivers granted as part of free trade deals. These largely affect "large asset classes," such as motor vehicles, steel and cement, and not IT. Still, vendors may be prompted by the Trump administration's actions to manufacture certain IT systems in the U.S. That may be costly. "Unless there are radical improvements in technology manufacturing methods, the economics of domestic manufacturing will result in higher end-item prices for technology manufactured in the U.S.," said Ray Bjorklund, who heads federal market research firm BirchGrove Consulting. "Will the American people be comfortable if the federal government spends more for the same technology products than it did in previous years?" asked Bjorklund. And will the Trump administration change its purchasing rules in way that favors PC vendors in federal procurement that assemble products in the U.S.? "I think that what we're all anxiously waiting to see," said Trey Hodgkins. He is the senior vice president at the Information Technology Alliance for Public Sector, an industry group. The U.S. may leave the IT exemption in place, but if it makes a change vendors are going to have to start assessing how their products enter the market, said Hodgkins. It also means figuring out just what "Made in the USA" means under any new rules issued by the Trump administration. "Are they assembled here or are they built here entirely?" asked Hodgkins.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Technology and sports team up to bring new athletic bands and features to the new swim-proofing, GPS, new bands, and more with Apple Watch Nike+. Updated April 2017: NikeLab has just announced an exclusive new "neutral-toned" style Apple Watch NikeLab, which is Space Gray with a Light Bone/Black band. It's otherwise identical in form and function to the standard Apple Watch Nike+. If you like it, you'll need to get it directly from Nike.com starting April 27. Back in October, Apple announced Watch Series 2, which brought the global positioning system (GPS), swim-proofing, longer battery life, and a brighter display to the wrist. In addition to continuing their existing partnership with fashion house Hermés, Apple also announced an all new one: with athletics company Nike. Given the fitness focus on Apple Watch Series 2 — and Apple CEO, Tim Cook's position on the Nike board — it made total sense. At least in concept. So, how's the execution? I've spent three months with Apple Watch Series 2 and a month with Apple Watch Nike+, and here's the answer! See at Apple The Watch Apple Watch Nike+ is a variant of Apple Watch Series 2. More specifically, a variant of the aluminum Apple Watch Series 2, the type previously branded as "Sport". There aren't any anodized gold or rose gold options in the Nike+ line though, but these are silver and space black, along with distinctive Nike+ bands and a watch face to match. Apple Watch Nike+, like all Apple Watch Series 2, is swim-proof. Just do it — in water! There's no stainless steel option for Apple Watch Nike+. Since it's designed for health and fitness, though, the sportier aluminum version is the better fit. Inside, though, there's the new dual-core Apple S2 system-in-package (SIP) with built-in GPS, which means it can lap the original when it comes to performance. It can also track your running, walking, wheeling, and swimming routes, even if you don't have your iPhone with you. Nike+ seems biased towards running, but it's got the same swim-proofing as every other Series 2, so you can do your laps in a pool or swim along the coast and, every time your watch breaks surface, your route will still get mapped. Regardless of how you're working out, the double-bright screen will also make it easier to see your stats, even in the sun. On the watchOS side, there's extra integration for the Nike+ app. If you don't already have it, you'll be prompted to download and install it as part of the setup process. From there, you can access it via Siri or right from the two special Nike+ watch faces, one digital, one analog. They have BIG, BOLD numbers on them, so it's easy to see while you're out for a run — either in silver or in electric green "volt". And if you're not out for a run, the Nike+ complication will stare at you, prompting you, until you go. That's the biggest advantage of Apple Watch Nike+ — it ties you into the larger Nike+ community and that's great because it's less about brand and more about lifestyle. It's also great for people who are intrinsically motivated. Activity Sharing on iOS does wonders for this already, but Nike+ goes beyond Apple hardware. It becomes a very literal extension of the "just do it" philosophy, making sure you've "just done it", both now and next time. To be honest, though, I got more out of Apple's Activity Sharing than Nike+. Both are great but my friends are all on Activity Sharing, not Nike+, so that was a better experience for me. It'll vary for each individual though, and that's the real advantage of having both. Apple Watch Series 2 + watchOS 3 Rather than recapitulate the Series 2 hardware or watchOS 3 software reviews, I'll simply point you to my colleague, Serenity Caldwell's original reviews, and my second opinion follow up. Everything we wrote there applies here. Apple Watch Series 2 review watchOS 3 review Apple Watch Series 2 + watch OS 3: Second opinion Apple Watch Hermès Series 2 review The bands Apple Watch Nike+ comes in a "collection", or a series of different case and band colors. You can't currently buy Apple Watch Nike+ bands separately. Apple Watch Hermès started similarly but the bands eventually did go on sale separately. It remains to be seen if Apple Watch Nike+ will follow along, but unless and until it does, you should make sure you get the color you want right up front. Here's the full Apple Watch Nike+ collection, as of the time of this review: 38mm or 42mm space gray case with black and volt (green) sports band. 38mm or 42mm space gray case with black and cool gray sports band. 38mm or 42mm silver case with silver and volt (green) sports band. 38mm or 42mm silver case with silver and white sports band. There's also an exclusive, special edition NikeLab version with a light bone and black band. The sports bands, as the name implies, are variations on the classic Apple sports band introduced with the original Apple Watch. Made of fluoroelastomer, it's water and sweat proof, resilient, and easy to both put on and tuck away. All of which makes it ideal for exercise. The big difference is the perforations that run, staggered three across, almost the entire length of the band. Not only do they look hella cool, they make the sport band breathe better. When Apple debuted the woven nylon band back in March of 2016, I liked it better than the sport band because it was more breathable. The Nike+ variant of the sport band, though, gives it a run for its money. I do wish it was available in more colors, though. Black, white, and volt (green) are fine. But this design is also begging for a shocking yellow, neon pink, and even a bright orange trim. Don't even get me started on Product (RED). Hopefully we'll see those eventually — maybe if/when the bands go on sale separately? Like with the casing, there aren't any fancier versions of Nike+ bands available. Nothing in leather or steel. Since Apple Watch Nike+ is compatible with the full range of Apple Watch bands, though, from woven nylon to Hermès, when you're done working out you can still dress it up just as fancy as you want. That's the huge advantage of Apple Watch Nike+ not simply being tied to NIke+ services but being part of the Apple Watch family as well. The conclusion With Apple Watch Series 2, Apple coalesced their messaging from a little something for everyone to a real focus on health and fitness. The other aspects are still there, from excellent notification handling to super-convenient Apple Pay and remote control, but activity and workouts are front-and-center in the marketing. And Apple Watch Nike+ is front-and-center for activity and workouts. Apple Watch Nike+ gives you everything you get in the regular aluminum Apple Watch Series 2 and more. You get the exclusive Nike+ watch face and bands, and tight Nike+ integration into complications and Siri. All for the same price of $369 for the 38mm and $399 for the 42mm. I'd go so far as to say that if you're even remotely interested in Nike+ or those exclusive bands, you should get Apple Watch Nike+ over the regular Apple Watch Series 2 without a second thought. If you later change your mind about either, you're just a swap or a swipe away from having that regular Apple Watch Series 2 anyway. If you later change your mind the other way, well, you'll currently need to buy another watch... Even though I ultimately preferred Apple's Activity Sharing and workout app to the Nike+ integration, if I were getting an aluminum Apple Watch Series 2, Apple Watch Nike+ is absolutely the one I'd get. In fact, it's the one I got for one of my family members for Christmas, who was ecstatic. I very much hope, like Hermès, Apple Watch Nike+ isn't a one off but rather the beginning of a beautiful partnership.

It's very nice. Sent from the iMore App 1 3 months ago Reply StraightlineBoy Got mine at launch in late October. Suggest getting the black and grey strap if you want one that's a bit less in your face. The strap is really comfortable and probably the highlight of the added features. Personally I find the Nike faces lack the customisation that I'd like so I don't use them and the Nike Running Club is a dreadful walled garden; once your data is in there, Nike think they own it and won't let you share it anywhere else. Other platforms such as Garmin do allow the data to be shared with services like Strava which has far better tools for post-run analysis than the very basic features provided by Nike. For what it's worth, the Nike watch app does work well, seems accurate and has had a few updates since launch to iron out some early bugs. I no longer use it though for the reasons previously stated. All of the serious runners that I know use Strava and by denying it's existence Nike will only alienate people who should be it's core audience. Despite my anti-Nike rant I do recommend the watch over the standard series 2; there's no downside to owning one and has features that you can't get any other way if you later decide that you want them. 1 3 months ago Reply ferdnerfer Thanks for your comments, I'm close to buying an Apple Watch 2 to log my running [I've used my iPhone for this intermittently over the years, trying various apps]. The Nike version of the watch adds custom faces & bands, are there any other differences that can't be installed from the app store [such as Nike+ app]? 0 3 months ago Reply StraightlineBoy Nothing that I'm aware of (except for being able to use the Nike Volt (fluro green-yellow colour) on some of the regular watch faces and I think there might be a few siri commands that are Nike watch only (but I've never used them so not certain on that). I have to add that currently I'm still waiting for the ideal Watch running app for me. Strava integration is vital (to me) and the few that offer it have proved buggy in their early versions. Strava have promised their Watch app will be updated in early 2017 to do the GPS functionality so I'm pinning my hopes on that. In the mean time, I wear my Apple Watch for everything except running. I've reverted to my Garmin Forerunner and HR chest strap because it's the most reliable way of getting everything I need; probably not what you wanted to hear! 0 3 months ago Reply returnmyjedi Personally I think it looks rather brilliant, something that a mutated wasp/human would wear.

My wife's watch 2 is the same using Nikes app. I would use Map My Run app but I have to carry my iPhone for the app to work. Back to carrying my iPhone when running. -1 3 months ago Reply StraightlineBoy The touchscreen is fairly ropey at the end of run I have to admit and plain old useless when even slightly damp. This won't happen but Apple need to put a couple of extra physical buttons on the watch if they want runners to ditch their Garmins and use the Apple Watch instead. 0 3 months ago Reply ItnStln511 Does this give you the other watch faces that are included in the Apple Watch Series 2 in addition to the two Nike+ watch faces, or is it in place of? 0 3 months ago Reply hoyaloya You can use all of the other watch faces. You also get the option on the other watch faces to choose volt (bright yellow) as a color choice. 0 3 months ago Reply ItnStln511 Can you chose volt even if you get the black and gray version?

It is a thorough review. One question, in the photos some of the watches have a blue color scheme. Is that an option? I have the Apple Nike + with the black/volt band and the only options are volt, white or a combination of volt and white for the Nike watch faces. With the other model or band is blue an option on the Nike watch faces? I looked at other photos on the Apple site and do not see blue. It looks nice, I wish it was an option on mine. 1 3 months ago Reply KBeat No, that's just bad color balance in the photo. The blue you're seeing is really black. 0 3 months ago Reply hoyaloya Thanks I get your point that it's a color balance issue and I think you're right, but looking at it from that perspective, it's the white watch face choice which is appearing as blue on the black background. I still wish Nike had made that color. 0 3 months ago Reply Litboys Really interested! 0 3 months ago Reply Litboys I want one! 0 3 months ago Reply jnmy Question.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Legal Battle Again Dominates Qualcomm’s Earnings Call Just like last quarter , all anyone wanted to talk about on Qualcomm ‚s(NASDAQ: QCOM) earnings call last night was the mobile chip giant’s expanding legal battle with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . The situation even overshadowed relatively strong earnings, as Qualcomm topped consensus estimates by putting up revenue of $6 billion with adjusted earnings per share of $1.34. Management said that the automotive, networking, and Internet of Things (IoT) segments performed particularly well. Heading into the release, there was concern that Qualcomm’s results could be held back since Apple is interfering with royalty payments that its contract manufacturers owe to Qualcomm, which was one of the counterclaims in Qualcomm’s countersuit against Apple. The whole situation is complicated because Apple’s suppliers sit between the two dueling parties, and are effectively getting caught in the crossfire. Image source: Court filings. Here are the relevant highlights from the call regarding the escalating litigation. Qualcomm believes its direct license offers are fair Over the years, Apple has tried to ink a direct licensing deal with Qualcomm, but has never found the offered terms consistent with fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) principles. Qualcomm says its offers have been comparable with the terms it offers hundreds of other companies, according to Qualcomm President Derek Aberle: The offers we have made to Apple for a direct license to Qualcomm cellular standard essential patents are consistent with the value of our patent technologies, established by these more than 300 arm’s-length license agreements and are fully compliant with Qualcomm’s FRAND commitments. It is unfortunate that Apple has rejected these fair and reasonable offers. Apple has started withholding payments to suppliers, which owe Qualcomm Since Apple’s contract manufacturers pass along the royalty costs in full, which Apple is now disputing, Apple has simply started to withhold these payments from its suppliers. These suppliers, in turn, underpay what they contractually owe to Qualcomm. The difference is roughly $1 billion. Aberle again: Despite Apple’s claims against Qualcomm, Apple suppliers remain contractually obligated to pay royalties to Qualcomm under their license agreements with us, including for sales of iPhones to Apple. In our fiscal second quarter, Apple interfered with the license agreements between Qualcomm and the Apple suppliers by actively inducing them to underpay the royalties they owed to Qualcomm for sales during the December quarter. Apple withheld payments to their suppliers for sales in the December quarter in an amount equal to what Apple claims Qualcomm owes to Apple under a separate cooperation agreement between the companies. Image source: Apple. The underpayments didn’t affect recognized revenue Apple suppliers reported the appropriate amount of royalties owed during the quarter, but simply underpaid what was owed. As such, Qualcomm still recognized the full royalty revenue from these contractual agreements, so it’s mostly a matter of cash flow. Net accounts receivable did increase sequentially by $2 billion, including the disputed $1 billion. This is offset on the balance sheet, with $1 billion held in liabilities while the dispute remains ongoing. Here’s CFO George Davis: It is worth noting that fiscal second-quarter royalty revenues were not impacted by the underpayment because the suppliers reported the full royalties for the term of their agreement, and acknowledged they were due, but underpaid by the same amount that Qualcomm is withholding from Apple under the cooperation agreement. Suppliers are still on the hook As mentioned above, Apple suppliers are getting caught in the crossfire, since they still owe Qualcomm royalties due to their agreements irrespective of what Apple does. Apple withholding payments to suppliers because Apple has a beef with Qualcomm has no direct impact on what the suppliers owe. On the other hand, the suppliers don’t want to pay out such large amounts. Here’s General Counsel Don Rosenberg: So just to be clear, the excuse that the contract manufacturers used was that Apple wasn’t paying them and what Apple was saying was that they are holding back payment to them to match payments that they claim we owed them from the other agreement, the BCPA. No connection to the license agreement between us and our contract manufacturers. So it was totally improper for the contract manufacturers to withhold. And we now look at what they’re going to do going forward, and we say, well, even the excuse that they use before that is Apple claiming that they were making up for amounts that we didn’t pay them, doesn’t exist anymore. So there doesn’t seem to be even an arguable rational reason for anybody to withhold the payments. This is how Qualcomm still recognizes the full revenue Normally, if an amount is disputed, it isn’t recognized as revenue. But since the suppliers themselves have not formally disputed the payments, Qualcomm is still able to recognize the revenue in full, as mentioned above. Here’s Davis: Typically, if there’s a formal dispute, then we would not take revenue until the dispute is resolved. And I’ll let Derek or Don comment on what constitutes a formal dispute. But certainly, entry into arbitration or lawsuit is one case in the past. For the customer in the second quarter, the customer reported fully and underpaid and has not filed a formal dispute. And in that case, we take the revenue for the amount paid while we’re working on collecting the balance owed from the customer. A major overhang The legal battle is a major overhang, and — unlike the FTC’s suit — probably isn’t going away anytime soon. It’s a small consolation for Qualcomm investors that the bulk of the dispute is in the rearview mirror. The Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement (BCPA) that’s at the center of the dispute expired at the end of 2016. Rosenberg again: While we disagree with [Apple’s original complaint], obviously, the rationale for that no longer applies. As Derek said earlier, that BCPA contract is expired. So there are no more monies even arguably due from us to them and therefore, no basis or rationale to continue withholding from the contract manufacturers. Qualcomm is taking a conservative approach to guidance, factoring in numerous scenarios of royalty payments from Apple via its suppliers (not including a scenario where Apple suppliers pay nothing).

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 21, 2017 at 7:00AM As if there wasn't already enough pressure. Reviews for Samsung's latest, greatest, and hopefully non-exploding Galaxy S8 are starting to hit the web, and there's universal praise among the tech press. After years of shamelessly copying Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs (and getting sued for it), Samsung has truly come up with an innovative and unique design that looks nothing like anything out of Cupertino. Even a longtime Samsung critic like myself has to acknowledge that it's a pretty great-looking phone, especially when it comes to the display and virtual lack of bezel. In retrospect, given Apple's decades-long obsession with rounded corners (dating back at least three decades), it's kind of curious that the iPhone maker has never made a display with rounded corners, particularly since Apple controls the operating system, too. Apple even once scored a dubious design patent that was literally (only solid lines are covered by the patent, while dashed lines are for illustration) nothing more than a rectangle with rounded corners. Rounded corners are just one aspect that makes the Galaxy S8's display look so polished and easy on the eyes, and this is becoming a trend among Android OEMs. (webOS had rounded corners, if you even remember what that is.) That display looks amazing. Image source: Samsung. Many outlets are even calling the Galaxy S8 the best and most beautiful phone ever made (examples here, here, and here). Can Apple reclaim the crown? Meanwhile, Apple took a big risk in 2016 by using the same overall design for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the first time it recycled a design for a third year. The iPhone 7 design, originally introduced in 2014, does look a bit outdated when compared directly next to the Galaxy S8. It ended up paying off, as Apple was able to set a new record for iPhone sales in the fourth quarter, returning to growth in the process. Presumably, Apple underestimated how much people hate headphone jacks. Expectations are incredibly high for the 2017 iPhone, since it will be the 10th-generation device. There are reports that Apple is also pursuing a bezel-less display as well, but like Samsung, it then faces the dilemma of where to place the fingerprint sensor and/or home button. Samsung opted for a digital home button while moving the Galaxy S8 fingerprint sensor to the rear. Apple reportedly wants to integrate Touch ID directly into the display, which is presenting significant technical challenges. Bloomberg reported earlier this week that the high-end model could be delayed by one or two months after the unveiling. In addition to technical challenges, some production bottlenecks are also expected due to challenges manufacturing heavily curved glass, but Apple is also testing a few other designs, including variants that feature stainless steel and glass (like the iPhone 4). Apple still hasn't finalized its designs, and the clock is ticking. The company usually begins pilot production runs in the second quarter before ramping up production ahead of third-quarter product launches. Apple better have a show-stealer up its sleeve that can meet lofty expectations, or else Samsung might take the crown for 2017. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Will we see new iMacs, Mac minis, and Mac Pros? What will the iPhone 8 look like? And are there any new products we don't even know about yet? We gather the rumours and whispers about Apple and make our pedictions for the year ahead. by Martyn Casserly | 21 Apr 17 Contents iPhones iPads Apple Watch Series 3 Apple TV Macs Software & services Mergers & acquisitions But don't expect… 2016 was an interesting year for Apple. It saw the introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, albeit controversially without headphone jacks, and a return to the 4-inch form factor in the popular iPhone SE. The MacBook Pro line received its first major revision for a number of years, including the introduction of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Plus there was the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and an apparently Brexit-related unwelcome hike in prices across the board. So, what does 2017 have up its sleeves for Apple fans? Well, here at Macworld we've donned our prognostication hats, investigated every rumour and trend we could find, all to bring you our predictions for 2017. It looks like it could be a big year. iPhones 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, so many are expecting Apple to pull out all the stops and release something quite special. iPhone SE 2: Many had anticipated that Apple would upgrade the iPhone SE model to the iPhone SE2 or SEs in March 2017, replacing the existing (and rather popular) SE that was introduced in March 2016. However the iPhone SE was only treated to a bump in storage to 32- and 128GB on 21 March and another update seems unlikely for now. We do still expect a new iPhone SE model at some point in the future, maybe in September or maybe in 2018 (KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has forecast that the iPhone SE 2 won't make an appearance in 2017 at all, on the principle that Apple doesn't want to cannibalise sales of the (higher-margin) iPhone 7). When the new model launches it is likely to keep the existing, classic design, but feature upgraded internals such as the A10 chip found in the current iPhone 7 and a more powerful camera. When? We think September  iPhone 7S or iPhone 8: Apple made a minor update to the iPhone 7 during an Apple Store update on 21 March, adding a Product RED version. Product RED is a charity that attempts to eliminate AIDS in Africa. Part of the proceeds from the new red models of the iPhone 7 will go to the charity. Apple doesn't make it clear how much it donates to the charity, but it does say that since Product RED was founded in 2006, (RED) has generated more than $465 million for the Global Fund, with more than $130 million from Apple alone. On to the new iPhones... There has been much discussion over what the new iPhone will be called. Normally Apple would continue its tick-tock rhythm of a new design one year followed by the S version which upgrades only the internals. But the iPhone 7 featured a minimal change to the design of the 6 and 6S, which leads many to think that Apple is saving the big changes for its 10th Anniversary model - the iPhone 8. Perhaps the biggest expected change to the design of the iPhone 8 is the removal of the Home button to allow an edge-to-edge glass display. But what of Apple ID and the fingerprint sensor? Well, there have been several reports that Apple intends to include technology that allows the screen itself to act as a fingerprint sensor, thus removing the need for a physical button. Alternatively, Apple might use facial recognition instead of/in addition to the fingerprint sensor. Apple reportedly purchased Israeli startup RealFace, which as the name hints specialises in facial recognition technology. This would be a truly remarkable innovation and give iPhone users display sizes on par with many premium Android devices but in a compact format. MacRumours also asserts that Apple is intending to use a flexible OLED display rather than the LCD panels that have appeared on previous iPhones. This could make the devices lighter while also offering more vivid colours and contrasts.   Image created by ConceptsiPhone Another feature often found on Android phones is that of wireless charging, and it looks very likely that this will be included on the iPhone 8. Some rumours even suggest the Apple will include long-range wireless charging, with Bloomberg Business reporting that the company wants to impliment the game changing technology that could charge an iphone from several feet away, and could have it ready for 2017.  The Jet black colour introduced with the iPhone 7 has been very popular, but its tendency to scratch easily is thought to have prompted Apple to return to a glass back and front design for the iPhone 8. There might also be new Deep Blue and Space Black colour options if the reports on various Japanese sites are to be believed.  One interesting idea that's gathering pace is that the new model will include Augmented Reality software, which overlays relevant information on any place or thing that you point the camera at. While we've yet to see proof of this, it would be a very cool addition. So with a new edge-to-edge design, software enabled fingerprint detection, long-range wireless charging, better display, plus the usual internal upgrades, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus really could be a worthy way to mark a decade at the top. Roll on September 2017. For the latest rumours and an in-depth roundup read our iPhone 8 release date rumours article. When? We think September iPads New iPad Air: Since there was no new iPad Air in 2015 or 2016 Apple fans were hoping for an update to that model soon. There were some concerns that the 9.7in iPad Pro had displaced the iPad Air line, but those fears were unfounded when Apple announced a new iPad in March 2017. Apple has done away with the Air from it's name, however: what was the iPad Air line is now just the iPad. The iPad is what would have been called the iPad Air 3 and comes with Apple's A9 processor, an update to the A8X processor in the iPad Air 2. This means it has the same chip as the iPhone 6s, but retains the same display and cameras as the Air 2. read more here: New iPad latest. Apple stop using Air in all its product names very soon - as signalled by the 13-inch MacBook Air's tiny update in 2016 and the retirement of the 11-inch version. When? We think 2018 iPad mini: The iPad mini received a minor update in March 2017, gaining more capacity for the same price (£419 for the 128GB Wi-Fi model and £549 for the 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular). However, this was not the iPad mini 5 anticipated, and given that the iPad mini 4 was last updated in September 2015, it's clear that Apple isn't too focused on its smaller tablets and Apple does state that the most popular tablet size is 9.7in. Perhaps October will see the introduction of an iPad Mini Pro with upgraded components, a new thinner, tougher aluminium chassis, and the inclusion of a Smart Connector to match that of the other iPad Pro devices. Read more about the iPad mini 5: iPad mini 5 new feature rumours When? We think 2018 iPad Pro 2 With the 12.9-inch iPad Pro arriving in November 2015, and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016, it's hard to guess the plans for this line. We had hoped for an update to both in spring 2017, but no update was forthcoming. Apple did however introduce a new 9.7in iPad in the iPad Air category (so lacking the Apple Pencil support and featuring a A9 chip rather than the A9X, and £339, rather than £549. Apple may update the iPad Pro models in September or October 2017. Much will depend on how effectively they have dealt with the stagnating iPad sales problem we've observed in the past few earnings calls. One way to stimulate interest could be the introduction of a new size, which is what analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is suggesting. He has stated that Apple will offer three Pros in 2017, but not a Mini as you might think, instead a 9.7-inch, 12.9-inch, and new 10.5-inch variant. He makes sense of this by explaining that the 9.7-inch Pro will be a lower powered version than it's bigger brothers - possibly the existing Pro being kept as the base model and sold at a cheaper price. Kuo's thoughts were published before Apple lauched the new iPad 9.7in, which seems to sit as the lower powered version he predicted. Whether Apple would stop selling the 9.7in iPad Pro remains to be seen - the company has said it is its most popular sized iPad. Other rumours doing the rounds argue that there will be a 10.9-inch version instead of the 10.5-inch one Kuo is backing. This could also feature a design change that eliminates the bezels and makes use of the software fingerprint detection technology that is expected to appear in the iPhone 8. There's no doubt that iPads are in a transitional period at the moment, but Apple seems to be pushing the Pros as the way ahead, so expect some interesting products in March. Read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review | iPad Pro 2 rumours When? We think October Apple Watch Series 3 Apple released the second generation of its Watch in September of 2016 which added GPS, internal upgrades, and water-proofing to the design. This was accompanied by the WatchOS 3 update that increased performance and functionality for not only the new models but also the original range.   We expect to see Apple announce the third iteration of its Watch in September 2017, hopefully for around the same price as the current models which start at £369, although that is far from certain after the increases we saw at the end of 2016. Apple did offer some new Apple Watch bands in March 2017. These include a new wide stripe Woven Nylon band, standalone Nike Sport Bands and Apple Watch Hermès bands in new colours. There's little in the way of firm evidence suggesting what the Apple Watch 3 will look like, but it's fair to say that you should expect a model that's very similar to the current version. Some experts have postulated that there could be a Watch S release in March of 2017 that would include additional storage space, but this remains a rumour at best. Several news sites have also speculated on the possibility of a round display, much like the one found on the Moto 360 Android Wear device. It's widely expected that the Watch 3 will include a front facing camera that could be used for selfies or FaceTime calls, as Apple holds a patent for such a device and Watch OS 2 introduced support for FaceTime audio calls. The new model is also rumoured to feature a Micro-LED display, which would be lighter, thinner, and brighter than the AMOLED panels currently used.  Another common thought is that Apple will finally introduce 3G or 4G capabilities to the Watch, in order to make it more independent from the iPhone. We're not convinced by this. Apple likes its devices to be closely tied together, and the battery life problems that come with cellular capabilities might make it an unattractive option at this time. It's still early days for the Apple Watch, so we fully expect this to be a quiet evolution rather than revolution. Thinner, lighter, faster and longer battery life is the mantra, and we'd be very happy with that. For a more in-depth look at the latest rumours on the Apple Watch be sure to check out our Apple Watch 3 rumours article.

We think September Apple TV It might have escaped the attention of many people that 2017 actually marks the 10th anniversary of Apple TV. With this in mind some think that Apple could celebrate the occassion with an update to its little black box. Whether this is true or not remains a mystery, as there have been very few credible rumours about any new developments inside the Apple campus. Then there's also the fact that the usual gap between iterations of Apple TV tends to be two or three years. It was curious though that a large section of the recent WWDC event was given to the software updates in tvOS. Maybe something is cooking in the labs after all? We'll keep researching and reporting our findings, so check back regularly. Read more about the Apple TV: Apple TV (2015) review | Best Apple TV apps | Tips for using the new Apple TV Siri Remote | New Apple TV release date rumours When? We think WWDC Macs The Mac Pro: The Mac Pro is long overdue a refresh as it hasn't been updated since its launch in 2013. The once futuristic device now looks a little long in the tooth, having been bypassed by generations of Intel chips that never made it into the chassis. Will Apple update the Mac Pro in 2017 or has it given up entirely on this professional Mac workstation? At this point we really don't know. Rumours of release dates and potential upgrades have come and gone, but nothing has appeared. We were hopeful that March 2017 would see new Pros announced, but nothing has materialised yet. We think a WWDC launch in June is possible. Read more about the Mac Pro: Mac Pro release date rumours & specs  | Mac Pro preview  | iMac vs Mac Pro, best pro Mac desktop When? We think WWDC MacBook Air: With the introduction of the 12-inch MacBook and the new, lightweight 13-inch MacBook Pro the writing seems pretty much on the wall for the old MacBook Air. Apple has already retired the 11-inch model in 2016, and once the 12-inch MacBook gets an update in 2017 to hopefully add an additional USB-C port and upgrade the god-awful keyboard, there won't be much room left for the Air brand.   All many of us wanted for the 13-inch model was to get a retina screen and a spec bump, but we suspect that will never happen and the MacBook Air, like the iPad Air, is on the way out. Read more here: New MacBook Air release date, specs & rumours. When? We think never... MacBook Pro: With the MacBook Pro having been released at the end of 2016, we don't expect much to change until very late in 2017. The massive redesign has already caused quite a reaction, so we'd rule out anything significant happening in the next iteration. Instead we think there will most likely be a shift to Kaby Lake chips, which in turn could open up higher RAM options. Other than that all we really want are the prices to come down. Read: MacBook Pro 2017 latest rumours. When? We think October 12in Retina MacBook update Apple launched its incredibly thin and light 12in MacBook back in March 2015, and the MacBook's first birthday saw a solid if unspectacular update - various sensible specs boosts, and a rose gold colour option. The third iteration of the 12in MacBook is likely to appear at some point in 2017 - although there was no sign of it when Apple updated some of its products on 21 March. Rumours are thin on the ground right now, but some of the wilder speculation has suggested that the new version might feature a 'Force Touch keyboard' - a keyboard, in other words, that doesn't actually move in response to your key presses, instead simulating presses through haptic feedback just like the Force Touch trackpad. Sounds pretty bizarre - not to mention difficult to use for touch-typing - but that's the sort of thing you tend to hear this far ahead of a launch. We think it's more likely that Apple will install the second generation of its butterfly keyboard that appeared on the new MacBook Pro instead. Read more in our 2017 MacBook rumour round-up. When? We think WWDC Mac mini: Ah Mac Mini, where did it all go wrong? After being hobbled in 2014 by what can barely be considered an upgrade, Apple has left the Mini to fall fallow. Now we don't know whether 2017 will see a resurrection of its fortunes, but all here at Macworld are rooting for the little guy. Read more in our new Mac mini rumours article. When? We think WWDC New iMacs: The iMac range last saw updates in 2015 that moved the high-end models over to Intel's Skylake processors, and the 21.5in models to Broadwell chips. What 2017 holds in store for the range is still uncertain, as Intel's chipsets seem to be slightly out of step with Apple's demands at the moment. No iMac updates were forthcoming on 21 March when Apple updated the iPad, but they may still appear. Bloomberg has reported that new iMacs are on their way, at WWDC we think, but details are as yet unknown as to what upgrades the devices will be running. When? We think WWDC Read more in our new iMac rumours article. Apple predictions for 2017: Mac processor updates Despite Apple's adventures into processor design it's unlikely we'll see the company rolling out its own chips in its desktop and laptop machines unless it can make them fully compatible with the current Intel line-up. Wonderful though it would be to run iOS apps alongside OS X software, Apple would need to give developers several years' notice to update their applications to run on any new architecture, so expect to still be buying Intel-driven machines for at least the next 12 months. Apple predictions for 2017: Force Touch Keyboard A Force Touch keyboard could be in the works, too - as a supplement to the Magic Trackpad 2 - if a recent patent filing is anything to go by. The switchless design would allow Apple to produce even thinner MacBooks, and also to take into account the force with which a key is pressed, which will be a boon for anyone making music on their Mac. In the opposite direction it should allow for haptic feedback, which could possibly be used to signify to vision-impaired users that they're correctly striking a particular key. Software & services 'Wireless mystery device' Recent photos reveal a mystery wireless device submitted to the FCC by Apple bearing the model number A1844. The mystery device, of course, caused huge stirs in the Apple community. The application claimed that it was a low-powered device with both Bluetooth and NFC wireless functionality. This led some to believe that it was either going to be a new, smaller Apple TV or possibly even an accessory for Apple Pay, allowing small businesses to accept wireless/Apple Pay payments. However, while we'd all hoped it'd be a cool new Apple device, further investigation seems to suggest that it's nothing more than a badge reader that attaches to a door assembly, most likely for use in Apple's Apple Park HQ opening in April 2017. There's a snap of the wireless device above, but those that want more information can check out the full FCC filing here.  iOS 11 Apple traditionally announces new version of iOS in June, followed by the release in the autumn. So far the only strong rumour about the new operating system is that it will include an improved 'natural-sounding' Siri as Apple works to improve the behaviour and repsonse of its voice interface. Another strong possibility is the inclusion of a Dark Mode with black backgrounds rather than the bright white normally found on iOS, and there's an outside chance that your Contacts could become active in iOS11, meaning you can see when people are available to chat. Read more about the latest rumours in our iOS release date rumours UK article. Plus you can revisit the changes Apple made in iOS 10 by watching the video below. Apple predictions for 2017: macOS X Like iOS 11, the new version of Apple's Mac operating system will be unveiled at WWDC 2017 in June, and then roll out in the autumn. So far there are no real rumours about what Apple will include in the new update. Siri integration was at the centre of the 2016 release, so it's possible that those features will be enhanced and improved upon for the 2017 update. As always, check back regularly and we'll keep you up to date on any new developments. Also check out our OS X 10.13 Rumours page.

No other news as yet, but we'll keep digging In the mean time you could read about the improvements made in watchOS3 here: watchOS 3 new features or listen to our discussion about it. Apple predictions for 2017: tvOS Last and probably least of Apple's four software platforms, tvOS nevertheless got a decent update at WWDC 2016 which we think will probably carry it through 2017. You can read all the gory details in our article New tvOS features, but we also discuss the new features in this video: Apple Pay Alongside these headline developments, there will be a whole series of speedbumps along the way as Apple extends and refines its Apple Pay offering. We anticipate that Apple Pay will be accepted in a wider range of headline stores.  Apple Music Apple Music - which is now available on Android - will inevitably expand. With 15 million subscribers in 2016 Apple Music made a decent start, but is it good enough to continue this momentum and can it really compete with the likes of Spotify? As for Beats 1, we're not convinced this is making the impact Apple hoped for, but the we probably aren't the target market for it. We'd like to see more radio channels tuned to less trendy music choices. There are also rumours that streaming on Apple Music could be enhanced, with high-resolution better quality audio for that service - up to 96kHz/24-bit, according to a report on Macotakara. Since the 3.5mm headphone jack is limited to CD quality sound this appears to back up the motives for Apple ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, as the Lighting port can offer HD audio. Apple Music may also prove to be the one thing that keeps the iPod on the shelves in 2017. If you'd asked us what we thought of its chances at the close of 2014, we'd have said 'slim', but 2015 saw Apple deliver the first proper update to the iPod touch in three years, and it's now providing another entry ramp for the firm's £9.99 a month music subscription service. That alone means it makes sense to give it at least 12 months to prove itself. The same can't necessarily be said of the nano and shuffle, which are each available in just one configuration and, without streaming abilities, offer no ongoing revenue source. Apple Music saw a major redesign at WWDC 2016. We discuss the changes in this video: Mergers & acquisitions Apple has got quite a lot money, and armchair pundits love to spend the company's money for it. Buy Tesla! Buy GoPro! Buy Sonos! From time to time these suggestion-cum-predictions come true, as with Apple's acqusition of Beats in 2014, but it hardly needs stating that the company isn't in a hurry to divest itself of that cash cushion. Any merger & acqusition activity is likely to be comparatively conservative: rather than going for the big names that crop up in prediction articles like this one, Apple is far more likely to pick up smallish but promising firms on the way up and take their products in house - just as it did with Siri. We do know of a few big deals that Apple has considered recently, though. The Financial Times reports that in May 2016 Apple sat down with Time Warner, one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and spoke seriously about an acquisition deal. The deal never got beyond the exploratory phase, but this does strongly suggest that Apple is in the market for an acquisition that will give it a foothold in video content - something that would prove valuable in the event that its rumoured TV-streaming service comes to pass. With Time Warner apparently out of the picture, many analysts believe that the next target could be Netflix, but we're still in the realm of the mega-deal, so don't bet your live savings on the deal happening. Apple's Gliimpse acqusition On 22 August 2016 Fast Company reported that Apple had made an intriguing new acquisition: Gliimpse, a startup that enables users to collect and collate personal health data. It's not known at this point how much the acqusition cost Apple, but the company has confirmed the deal, albeit with its usual boilerplate statement that it "buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and generally [does] not discuss [its] purpose or plans". Gliimpse was created in response to the bureaucratic difficulties in the US related to health documentation: the lack of an overarching authority or standardised system makes it exceptionally difficult for patients to access and usefully analyse their own data. And this makes it an obvious fit with Apple's recent health-related announcements. With the launch of HealthKit and CareKit, the company intends to revolutionise the health and medical care sector, and has a track record of providing umbrella services - in music, fitness and mobile software most successfully - that make complex markets easier for consumers to approach. Related fact: one of Gliimpse's founders, Anil Sethi, started his career at Apple in the 1980s. Apple's Turi acquisition At the start of August 2016, Apple acquired a Seattle artificial intelligence company named Turi, according to a report by GeekWire. The site's sources peg the deal at approximately $200m, although both Apple and Turi have declined to comment on the matter. Turi's specialities, artificial intelligence and machine learning, are hot right now and the acquisition represents Apple's way into an increasingly crucial area of the tech sector. Google is big on artificial intelligence, as are Facebook and Amazon, but Apple itself has discussed the subject in numerous recent product launches. iOS's QuickType keyboard uses artificial intelligence to predict what you're trying to type; iOS also uses it to suggest apps it reckons you're likely to use and contacts you'll want to speak to, and the new automated album creation tool in Photos uses deep learning techniques to analyse faces, places and objects and create coherent compositions. watchOS 3's Instant Apps feature is dependent on being able to predict which apps you'll want to use next. But Apple's products are only going to get smarter over the coming years, as Turi's tech is integrated into the portfolio. Apple's Tuplejump acquisition Further to it buying Turi, Apple followed up the next month, September 2016, by buying Tuplejump. Like Turi, it is a machine learning company that allows better data management for businesses. According to TechCrunch, Apple's interest in the acquisition was down to Tuplejump's focus on open source ways of applying machine learning and analytics to big data. This again points to Apple's increasing interest in improving its artificial intelligence products such as Siri.  Apple's $1bn investment in Didi Chuxing After its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch, Apple invested a huge $1bn in the uber-competitor, Didi Chuxing - a Chinese company that forced Uber out of its local market. The company is valued at $35bn, and with a further $1bn investment from Apple, it seems that there is certain weight behind the movement in China - this came come in a form of advertising of Apple products in China, to Apple-product integration within taxis. Given the boom of the Chinese market, it seems that investors are happy with this move. But don't expect… The Apple Car, was the hot rumour of 2016, but now it seems that Apple has scaled back it's ambitions and now thought to see working on a software solution rather than the hardware. The company is said to have had up to 1,000 developers working on the so-called Project Titan, and to have set up various different front companies, including Faraday Futures and Sixty Eight Research. We'd love to see it on the roads in 2017, but industry chatter suggests 2020 is a more likely date. If they're right, it might not be worth holding back on an interim upgrade to your existing run-around next year. And if you were hoping for an actual television set from Apple it's time to give up on that idea too. We won't see an Apple car this year, but you can expect the rumours to continue.

And not only does Apple probably knows it sucks, it even admitted to having chosen form than functionality on the new design. To compensate, it then announced massive price reductions on the current line. It also told the world that it is currently working on the Mac Pro 2018 that will be fundamentally different from the current generation. In a recent round table meeting with a number of tech journalists, Apple almost openly admitted that it made a mistake on the Mac Pro’s current design. In fact, it even apologized for not including proper cooling and upgradability on the build. Nevertheless, Apple promised that the Mac Pro 2018 will be totally different from the previous one. Mac Pro 2018 modular design The first thing worth mentioning is the fact that Apple is going back to the old modular design of the Mac Pro. The very same ones that it released back in 2006. And since the Mac Pro 2018 will be modular, that means end users will be able to upgrade the machine with ease. 2006 Mac Pro (via memoryamerica.com) Most professionals who uses the Mac Pro require more graphics processing power in addition to CPU cores. As most of them are artists and digital content creators, they require more raw power when it comes to video editing and transcoding. Since most of the time, these are what they will be doing on the machine. While the current generation Mac Pro is beefy enough, obviously, it still falls short on major performance requirements. Main hardware components Unlike the older Mac Pro, the current workstation hardware offering from Apple is limited to only one processor. Back in 2006, Apple made it possible to add a second processor on Mac Pros for that added performance. With modularity in mind for the Mac Pro 2018, upgradability will also come easy. Unfortunately, nobody knows the extent of modularity Apple is planning on the upcoming Mac Pro. Hopefully, the Cupertino company will be kind enough to include another socket for an Intel Xeon processor. Intel Xeon Processor (via anandtech.com) At the moment, the current Mac Pro model only offers a single socket for the main processor. While it can be configured to a maximum of 12 cores, having the ability to add another processor into the build is somewhat more attractive to a PC enthusiast. This will give them a modicum of control on what they want their systems to be and how they perform. Furthermore, being able to add an extra processor will definitely boost the performance of the Mac Pro 2018. Graphics Since the Mac Pro 2018 will be modular, it could happen that users will not be limited as to what brand or type of graphics card they can use on the machine. Furthermore, as with many high-end PC setups, the chance to install more than one GPU on a single computer is a very exciting idea especially for gaming enthusiasts. Hopefully, Apple will also consider graphics card upgradability in the design of the Mac Pro 2018. This will come in handy especially now that NVIDIA just released the Mac drivers for the latest Pascal-based graphics cards like the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti and Titan Xp. Mac Pro 2018 pricing and release date The Mac Pro is known to be pricey and this is the main gripe of non-Apple users and perhaps the main deterrent for them as well. However, what everyone is paying on the Mac Pro is the solid build as well as the seamlessness of the hardware and software. This is why, it will not be a surprise at all if the entry-level Mac Pro 2018 is priced above $2,500. In fact, there is a very strong chance that Apple will retain the original base price at $2,999. 2013 Mac Pro (via apple.com) As for the release, if we are lucky enough, consumers could be seeing the new Mac Pro sometime in October next year. There is also a chance that it will happen earlier than that. Nevertheless, for now, all that can be done is wait. For more updates on the Mac Pro 2018, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

In an era where saving natural resources has been the need of the hour, Apple has come up with a bold statement aiming one day to completely avoid mining materials for its products and instead use recycled materials.   In its Environmental Responsibility Report, Apple said - "Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products."   Apple placed its goal for closed-loop supply chain where ‘one day’ the company will only use renewable resources to manufacture its products. However, Apple mentions that the quality of the recycled material is important as the company have some pre-determined quality standards so in the best case scenario, the recycled material is best to extracted from past Apple products. This is why Apple has been encouraging its customers to return their old used Apple products.   Meanwhile, the situation is a little different for ‘tin’. "Unlike aluminum, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards." - the report read. Expectantly, the Cupertino-based giant didn’t disclose the amount of recycle products being put in the process, as of now.   On the other hand, Samsung also recently declared that it might, in fact, sell refurbished Galaxy Note 7 units to avoid wasting resources. However, that never happened which forces us to believe that Samsung might have recycled all of the returned Note 7 units for manufacturing its upcoming products. If you are not aware, Samsung recalled the Galaxy Note 7 last year twice after the device had some serious issues with the battery.The Galaxy Note 7 was never launched in India.   Another important point where smartphone manufacturers should really concentrate is to design products which lasts much longer. This is exactly what an analyst named Cook from Greenpeace has urged OEMs to change in their next production cycle.

Dissecting The Falsities In Apple's Misleading New "If You Don't Have An iPhone" Ad Campaign Will Shanklin View All Posts 2011/03/17 10:47am PDTMar 17, 2011 2 Plus 1 on G+ 410 Share on Facebook 108 Share on Twitter Total Shares412 News Off-Topic Ah, the arrogance of Cupertino. Does it know no bounds? In Apple's latest attempt to frame their iPhone as being the obviously superior choice over Android, a new series of ads start with "If you don't have an iPhone... ". They then proceed to boast about features that are on both iOS and Android, using their typical clever wordplay to convince the less-knowledgeable that you can only get these features on an iPhone. The first ad starts with: If you don't have an iPhone, you don't have the App Store. So you don't have the world's largest selection of apps. Well no, but you have the Android Market, which is growing at a much faster rate than Apple's and that analysts predict will catch up to the App Store in the number of apps within the next several months. You will also soon get the additional choice of the Amazon App Store, which will offer competitive pricing and - something Apple avoids like the plague - options. Uh, yeah, good one there, Apple. The video then continues: ... [apps] that are this easy to find and this easy to download right to your phone. Is it easier to search for apps on an iPhone than on an Android phone? They both involve entering some words into a little search bar. Are App Store apps easier to download than the Market's? Both merely ask you to push a button or two, wait a few seconds, and let it download. What's more complicated about Android's? Nothing. ... so [your iPhone] can be almost anything, like a boarding pass... Hey guys, Android phones do that too. ... or do almost anything - like pay for your coffee. Another check for Android. A second ad focuses on reading, bragging: If you don't have an iPhone, you don't have iBooks. No, but you have Kindle, Nook, Google Books, and a plethora of other third-party readers. ... so you don't have your favorite books in your pocket. Uh, yes I do. ... and you don't have the iBookstore - an entire bookstore in your pocket. Maybe not, but I have an entirely bigger bookstore in Amazon's Kindle store, in addition to having the B&N Nook Store, Google Books' store and pretty much any other online e-retailer I want to visit (because, you know, unlike on iOS, you can actually download files through the Android web browser). The third spot zeroes in on music, claiming: If you don't have an iPhone, you don't have an iPod in your phone. While it may not be "an iPod," my Android phone plays mp3s just as well, thank you very much. ... with your music, and your playlists (yes, the word "your" is accentuated by the voice-over actor reading the commercial). So what, do Android phones force you to listen to someone else's music? Do they not allow playlists? Wrong on both accounts, Apple. ... and you don't have iTunes on your phone - the world's number one music store. No, but I have Amazon MP3, which gives me everything the iTunes Store does (minus The Beatles, which I already have), only it doesn't have DRM and it often gives lower prices. The ads are concluded, in quite predictable Apple fashion, with the profound declaration: Yep. If you don't have an iPhone... you don't have an iPhone. Now that part, Apple, you nailed right on the head. I certainly do not have an iPhone... I have a much better phone. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVvVQc3O01U http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV2__tmrEbM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmz0YG2ZP0I Source: YouTube [1] [2] [3] via PhoneArena Tags Android apple iphone marketing rhetoric steve jobs subscribe ...

Tony While I agree with most your points(minus amazon being better then iTunes, least from a UI perspective), the commercial never says "and Android can't do this". So the implication that they're lying to you isn't quite right. Personally I sit inbetween iOS and Android and own both, they both have alot to like so it's really hard to choose one over the other. Phil The commercials imply that if you don't have the iPhone you can't do or don't have various things. That in turn implies that you can't do them on Android or any other device. The point being made here is that it ends up being misleading. As pointed out you can very well have a bookstore in your pocket without an iPhone. Cliff Indeed it is true that the commercial never explicitly mentions that Android can’t do the equivalent functions, it can still be considered a lie to present the information in the manner they have. Many times, especially with politicians, a lie is never explicitly told, yet it is the implication of even true facts that are purposefully misleading. In this case, this commercial is using the lie of ‘dissembling,’ and probably some ‘careful speaking.’ Much of what the commercial says is true: “If you don’t have an iPhone, you don’t have iBookstore” – True, because iBookstore is proprietary software for the iPhone. “If you don’t have an iPhone, you don’t have an iPod on your phone” – also true because iPod is a registered trademark of Apple Inc. This list could go on, but the point is that while these statements may be true, it is the impression given that is the lie. With their careful wording, an uninformed viewer will be left with the impression that only the iPhone can perform the tasks listed, when that is completely untrue. Android comes into the mix because it is one of the competitors that can, in fact, do all the functions listed that the iPhone can. I’m not really appalled by this or anything because this is just propaganda at its finest, and typical of any commercial organization, however this is still technically lying. Just some food for thought. Steve Technically lying? I would have to disagree. What is technically lying? Can you be technically pregnant? You either are or you aren't. A fact is a fact. This is just good spin/marketing. Jon Garrett lol @ technically pregnant :) Cliff tech•ni•cal [tek-ni-kuh l] –adjective 9. So considered from a point of view in accordance with astringent interpretation of the rules According to this definition from dictionary.com, yes, you can be technically lying. The reason I said it was technically lying is because it can be said that, based on a strict interpretation of the rules, what was done qualifies as lying. Based on this definition, you can also, by your analogy, be technically pregnant too. Based on what is defined as pregnant, if you meet the criteria (rules) of being pregnant, you are, by definition, ‘technically’ pregnant. Nunya According to your dictionary.com definition, no they are not lying, because according to a stringent interpretation what they said about having iBooks and iPod and such is true. It's the implications that you've read into it which are not. The words may be crafted to provoke you into reading those implications into it, but such reading still remains a choice on your part. alchemist007 I am an Android fan, but to be honest, none of the music buying or listening offerings are comparable to iTunes! Its just the fact we have to deal with until Google does something about it sooner than later! But the rest is pure arrogance from Cupertino! Don't you think, in a way, Apple wanted this to happen by intimidating Android fans with the new ads so it can get more free publicity? SiliconAddict Yah your right...they are better. I'll never use iCrap anything ever again. eikie Allthough apple does make some descent hardware, it makes me sick how they try to downplay the others. During the antennagate affair, during the last ipad2 event and, be it less open, in this ad. Why don't they just fovus on the strong points instead of pointing fingers to others... (almost seems they think they are not good enough) Leo Davidson Android can NOT play MP3s as well as the iPhone, sadly. Until Android gets gapless playback (and none of the four apps that claim to do it actually do yet), it's useless to a lot of people (I realise not everyone, but a lot of people) as a music player. Every time there's a glitch between joined together tracks on an album I'd be more likely to smash my phone than continue listening. Agree with the rest, on the whole, though. And I would love for Android to gain gapless playback and save people from having to use iTunes, which is the other platform's dealbreaker. Right now I still use an iPod Classic, which I've not updated in over a year because I can't bring myself to deal with iTunes any longer. Sxeptomaiac Music is pretty far down the list of things I use my Droid for. I could care less about "gapless playback". Choosing a smartphone based on a fluff feature like that is on par with overpaying for media cables, IMO. There are a number of other things I'd put way ahead on my list of things I'd like to see implemented. Hirudin When reading the internet it's important to understand that some people have opinions that differ from yours. Denigrating another person's preferences is not helpful. Gapless playback is important for people who listen to certain genres of music. Techno comes to mind but I imagine classical would also benefit. Albums like Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon also have consecutive songs that do not have breaks between them. A music player that is not capable of playing the music as it was produced is indeed annoying. Imagine a music player that would randomly "skip" from time to time. Would you consider getting rid of this annoyance a priority? What's the difference between a skip/gap in the middle of a song and a skip/gap between two -tracks- that run into each-other? Although I don't listen to music in a manor that benefits from gapless playback it does annoy me that the music players on Android are so far behind the competition (PC music players, iPods, hardware music players (particularly those made by Cowon), etc.). The "fluff feature" that I would like to see in more players is song rating support. Meridian (the pay version) is the only one I've found that does it without needing proprietary software. Of course: the ability to rate songs is another feature available on iPhones, probably since the first one was released back in 2007. I know "catching up" takes time, but, seriously, that was nearly four years ago - it's a crying shame that our dual-core powerhouses cannot even match (much less *surpass*) the capabilities of hardware players released ~6 years ago and software players released ~12 years ago in terms of playing music. Tim You're an idiot. Want to know why it takes longer for an OPEN SOURCE system to catch to a PROPRIETARY system. Android has to be able to support multiple hardware platforms, while Apple only has to design its iOS for its own hardware. So shut up and stop complaining about things you don't understand. Xcom923 I want to add something else. If you don't have an iphone you still can use itunes. Doubletwist allows you to use itunes with android, so you don't even have to compromise even if you believe itunes is the best mp3 store. SiliconAddict So its Mac vs. PC vs 2.0 just with a different set of lies and a different competitor. I swear to god as my witness if I ever met Jobs I would break his nose on the spot. Jail or not, I want to go down at the guy who broke Steve's nose. Tx/Rx Don't worry, he won't even have a nose for much longer. GetALife Seriously? This is funny. In your Mac vs. PC analogy you've got it backwards. Microsoft/IBM was the 8,000 lb gorilla (the iPhone) and Apple/Mac was the outsider (Android) trying to catch up (according to market-share). People are FAR to religious about their technology gadgets. Is there anything wrong with having choices and/or some people preferring an iPhone over a Droid or a Droid over an iPhone. You people act like it's Catholics vs. Muslims or something. Mesmorino Actually, the majority of users don't care about what product they use as long as it meets their needs. It's the COMPANIES that make it seem like a do or die affair, like this very article points out. Hank Actually, that'd be Catholics vs. Protestants, or Christians vs. Muslims... Music Anybody use the new Songbird? How is this for continuous playback, playlists, etc? Caitlin Zulewski While most of your points are valid - the Android can do most of those things, and probably does some of them better - that's not really the point. The point is the average consumer isn't as well versed as you when it comes to these devices, so many people likely won't do the extra research to see if they can get those features from a Droid. Bottom line is even if it's misleading, it's very smart messaging from a company who is brilliant when it comes to its brand. Phil And its also very smart marketing for an Android themed blog to point out to the general public that these things are misleading. ;-) David Ruddock The Apple App Store still has a huge leg up on the Android Market. It has better content filtering, better search capabilities, and is much "cleaner" in terms of spam apps. And you can actually browse it without having to do tons of sifting through trash apps. The Android Market is a mess, looking at the "Just In" list is like going to the red light district of mobile software, and frankly, it gets annoying. I cannot remember the last time I "browsed" for an app on the Market - I either get a name based on someone's suggestion or from something like our awesome weekly roundup, and go directly via QR code or an exact search. Also, ever notice how exact searches don't always make the obvious result the first one? Yeah, kings of query my ass, Google's search implementation on the Market is just plain bad. I also agree with a previous commenter that iTunes + iPod/iPhone is a far better solution than SD card MP3 storage on Android, which makes for absurdly messy directories and has terrible playlist support. Google's stock music player is so abysmal that 3rd party music players are an absolute necessity on Android. Which is fine, I guess - viva la competition. That said, Android offers more cloud/streaming music options than iOS, and I <3 Subsonic. Hopefully Google Music's cloud sync will be even more awesome once it's officially released. Combined with a Google Music store, the iTunes advantage could soon disappear. Also, Apple's iBookstore is a joke - I agree with you there. Who the hell wants a smaller, more expensive collection of eBooks when Amazon Kindle and Google Books offer competitive pricing and a massive selection? Not to mention compatibility with way more devices. Android is by no means superior to iOS in every way - now's definitely not the time to be getting complacent. bbman335 If you are still copying MP3's to a SD card, you are doing it wrong. There are plenty of apps out there can will sync your Android through iTunes or other software, many of them will even do it via wifi. This entire chain of comments really shows that even Android users don't know everything their phone can do, why would the average consumer...which is the point of this article, not fanboyism... David Ruddock Well, then you clearly didn't read my entire comment. Maybe give that a try. Hirudin You're absolutely right about the Market... how is it possible that I can search for the exact name of an app and have it 5th on the list after apps with different names? That's just absurd, 'specially from Google... you know, the "search engine people" (as you mentioned). Red light district... LOL. Well put! Have you tried to alternative Market apps? I'm not sure how many are out there, but a couple I have tried are "App Brain" (possibly "AppBrain") and "Chomp". Chomp's browsing ability is greatly improved over the normal Market app. faroscin I'm a happy owner of a Galaxy S and for a million reasons I wouldn't want an Iphone, but you should stop with the apple bashing, you sound like a silly fanboy. AndroidUK As an owner of both Android and Apple devices, I do find it strange that the Apple store does not give any idea of the number of times an app has been downloaded. Sure, they have comments and a star rating but that gives no idea really about overall popularity. The Android market does give a idea in broad terms of the number of downloads. I really find the biased opinions/reviews of both Apple and Android fans most irritating. The best non partisan review I have seen comparing the iPad2 with the Xoom was at mobiletech - just the facts not the bias. guy excellent article and im socked at the many retards posting comments. Apple is a piece of crap and android is CLEARLY better Alberto Delgado every one of my friends that doesnt have an iphone wants my iphone 4.. apple is correct in every aspect, YOU and everyone else who agrees just has iphone envy. andriod cannot beat Apple's ecosystem. my house is i-everything. and i wouldnt have it any other way. if my friends choose an andriod (shit phone) cannot wait for their contract to be over so they can get the new iphone, WHY? umm maybe because andriod is too complex and VERY VERY VERY FRAGMENTED. Alan Complex??? Are u retarded? Le3ky "apple is correct in every aspect" lol, they are perfect? Is that what you are saying. You are a merchants wet dream my friend. Phil Oh...is that the reason more people are buying Android devices than iPhone by a large margin? Joe Just would like to say that Android sales are very close with iOS sales. Which is somewhat sad for Android... Android is on hundreds of devices across all the major cellular carriers. iOS runs on three devices (four if you count the Apple TV's version) and ran on only one network up until a few months ago. So.. the fact that Android is on many handsets on every carrier and is being sold in many cases for free with a two year contract, means that it should outsell iOS exponentially. But it doesn't.. They are still very close even though iOS runs on only ONE phone on two carriers. Marc Try to think outside your borders (or walled garden as it were) just for a minute and you will see the point that Phil is trying to make. Joe What point is Phil trying to make? He said Android outsells iOS. I said Yes it does, but it does so because it's on multiple phones on multiple carriers and is given away for free in many instances. Where as iOS is on one phone on two carriers and has a somewhat high price. And there is still some debate as to whether Android truly outsells iOS but I'll go ahead and give it to you. Joe And Phil I'm not sure what the reason behind that is because according to The Nielsen ratings report twice as many Android-phone owners want to switch operating systems than do iPhone owners (14 per cent versus 7 per cent). Here's the link for you, it also shows the actual sales numbers..looks like Android might not be outselling iOS after all......http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/08/smarphone_survey_wars/ Cliff You should be mindful of the blanket statements that you make, because most of the time, statements of that nature are wrong. Speaking only for myself, I most definitely do not have iPhone envy. In fact, I’ll tell you a little story: I use to own an iPhone (3g in fact) for about a year. When the iPhone 3g came out, I just had to have it, because I thought it was the best, and it was (better than any other phone I had ever owned). That was until my wife (then girlfriend) told me about this cool new phone coming out called the Nexus One. I did research, LOTS OF RESEARCH (I’m just that kind of guy), and concluded that the Nexus One was superior to my iPhone 3g in both hardware and software, so I sold my iPhone for $250 and used the money to buy my Nexus One, which I still use to this day. Now, I’ve used both, done my research, and I will drop an inferior product like a bad habit, which is why I’m an Android user. Also, my brother use to own an iPhone 3gs, he bought a Galaxy S from a guy because he intended to resell it. Well, I told him to give the phone a try to see if he liked it. A few weeks later, he sold his iPhone, and now refuses to go back. Now I just have to get his wife to dump her iPhone hehe. John Cotton You need to get a Nexus S ;) Duffin Hah! People might listen to your troll comment if you could spell properly, had actually knowledge of grammar and punctuation, and weren't just spouting common talking points against Android instead of an intelligent discussion on the merits of the iPhone. Oh, wait...you gave NO merits to the iPhone over Android, just that it's "complex and fragmented." If those two things alone turn you away from Android, then you aren't the type of person it was meant for. Hell, if my mother (who constantly needs me to explain the difference between a file and a folder in Windows) can figure out how to use an Android phone, you and your friends must be really low on the IQ scale. Peter "too complex" the anthem of every mac/iphone user I've ever met when trying to deal with something that isn't locked down by apple into laughably basic functionality. Le3ky Thank you for this. Apple steeps down to a lower level. Phil Glad people are noticing this. I saw the iBooks ad last night and it let me know that Apple knows they are in trouble. We can talk all day about the market search not being the best or the music player not being up to par but when you look at the activation stats that hasn't stopped Android from clobbering the iPhone. Just bring brutally honest but the average person doesn't care to do more with a music player than press play and stop and they don't go searching the market all day like some of us. They basically find apps their friends have or that they read or hear about. I do think Google should improve but I just don't think those two spots are at the tops of consumers minds. Apple knows this is getting ugly for them so expect more deceptive marketing to try to paint the iPhone as the only device that can do anything. Joe First of all, this article sounds like a two year old wrote it. Like really.. Grow up.. There should be a video of two little girls fighting to the song "anything you can do I can do better". Secondly, Apple simply made an advertisement where they didn't "lie" about a single thing. The commercial says if you don't have an iPhone then you don't have the App Store. That is a fact. You may have a store that sells Apps, but you don't have the App Store. Then they said that having the App Store allows the iPhone to do many things, like use it as a boarding pass, or buy coffee. They didn't say that no other phone could do that, they just said that the App Store allows the iPhone to do it too. Then they said if you don't have an iPhone then you don't have the iBooks Store. That also is a fact. You might have a store that sells books (which by the way the iPhone has all of those third party book stores you mentioned as well) but you don't have the iBook Store. Lastly, the commercial said if you don't have an iPhone then you don't have an iPod and you don't have the iTunes Store. Surprise, this also is not a lie. You might have an MP3 player but it's not an iPod, and you might have a store that sells music, but it's not the iTunes Store. Thirdly, I love how you try and defend Android even though the iPhones features mentioned in the ad are much more robust. You even say so yourself. The App Store is much, much, much better then the Android Store. iOS has more Apps, and doesn't suffer from the fragmentation that Android does. iTunes is the largest music store in the world that caters music, movies, TV shows and Podcasts to the iPod. Android has Amazon...haha. And the iPod itself is the most successful portable music player.. What's Androids music player..?.. So if you take the best App store, best music store and best music player in the world and add them all together you get the best phone in the world. Which according to J.D power and associates, it is the best phone in the world.. For the 5th consecutive year. So, please show me where Apple and Steve Jobs lied? All I see is Apple making an advertisement that shows off the innovation they invented in the first place. They are showing people that they should buy an iPhone instead of a copy (Android). So... I think Apple wins in the "anything you can do, I can do better" fight. Cause, yeah, Apple does better. Phil I haven't watched the others but I think its quite obvious that for instance lacking an iPhone doesn't mean you don't have a bookstore in your pocket or your favorite books in your pocket. And according to Consumer Reports the iPhone is....well nothing....they won't even recommend it anymore. Now sit down troll. Joe First of all I didn't mention Consumer Reports, I said J.D Power and Associates. But a quick jump over to Consumer Reports website shows the iPhone 4 right there on the homepage. How funny, cause you just said that "according to Consumer Reports the iPhone is….well nothing….they won’t even recommend it anymore" but yet it's right there with a very high recommendation. You must have just been mistaken right? Its ok. Just go sit down for me until you can get your facts straight alright. Jose Galdamez Actually, Consumer Reports originally praised the iPhone with its highest ratings. Wall Street Journal pointed out that the site's paid evaluation rated the display, navigation, web browsing, multimedia and battery life of iPhone 4 as "excellent," gave its phoning and messaging a "very good" ranking, and described voice quality as "good." You're being *misleading* by saying CR considers it to be nothing. You're also being misleading by suggesting that CR is worth the time of day. Earlier this year at Mobile World Congress the iPhone 4 took the top award for a mobile device, yet you do not mention this. I think you're the one that needs to sit down. Joe Well said! Thank you! ObjectiveOne I agree with Joe, while Android can do many of the same things the iphone can do the mp3 player side of things is seriously lacking. Also can we have android websites that don't have to bash or criticize apple and actually just print positive stories about Android. I visit both android and apple fansites and blogs. It is much more common to see an Apple/Steve Jobs bashing post on an Android blog, not that the opposite doesn't occur but it is much less. Is it possible to focus on the positives in the Android platform instead of bashing someone else's platform??? Joe Well said. I like many of the things that Android. There are key things iOS is better at then Android and there are things Android does better then iOS. But, to comment simply on this post, I believe that Apple is correct in saying the iBooks Store, App Store and iTunes Store/iPod are some key things that they do better then Android. Just a little thing Steve Jobs said a long time ago "People need to forget the idea that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose". That's why you don't see to many Android bashers on Apple blog sites. Apple doesn't think Android needs to lose for them to win. Apple does what Apple does best. If Android wants to keep succeeding then they need to focus on their own software and not on Apples. Joe Correction "I like many of the things Android does". Kayno I think we have a winner! JOE *Standing ovation* I'm sad that the author even wrote this article.. It shows a lack of common sense. Thanks. Asphyx … with your music, and your playlists Well not really mine...Afterall if it were mine I could easily move it to another device with no DRM restrictions. I can't really call owning something that I can't move where I want MINE now can I? What they should add to the add though is this... If you don't have an iPhone then you are not supporting the Great Big Brother of the world Steve Jobs who wishes to control everything you can do via his iTunes slave software. Joe Apple dropped the DRM restrictions on music two years ago. Furthermore, why does everyone hate iProducts just because they are Apple. Just because you like Android doesn't mean you have to hate Apple. iTunes works and it connects all the iDevices Apple makes. It is an eco-system of products connected with a software. It's a genius system, that works very, very well. But, just because it has an Apple logo on it, it automatically becomes "Steve Jobs slave software". So hypocritical. Duffin I don't hate them because they're Apple products. I've owned two generations of iPod Touch, but won't buy another one after this. I don't want them because for iPods and iPhones, the environment is closed and restrictive. I only ever used the iPod for podcasts and music. I don't like being told what I can and can't do on a product I've bought. As for iOS, I dislike the simplistic nature. Again, I like Windows because it allows me to do a lot more than iOS does. Can I completely screw up my system if I do something wrong? Sure, but that's my right to do it since I paid money for it. And, as for iTunes working perfectly? I disagree. iTunes is constantly losing podcasts I was subscribed to and will often only download a few new podcasts. I always have to hit refresh and manually tell it to download podcasts despite having iTunes set to just grab everything automatically. Also, once I plug the iPod in, oftentimes even though there are new podcasts, it just won't put them on until I press Apply a second time. So, no, it's not perfect. Joe Fair enough. However, it is Apples prerogative to run their company as they wish and make their products as they wish. You can't bash them just because you don't like what they do. It's their opinion of doing business. I'm not bashing Android here at all, like ObjectiveOne said, you rarely see an Apple blog bash Android. We just don't see the need to. Android is a company and Apple is a company, they both have totally different ways or running things and they have totally different customer bases. Duffin Well, nothing I said was "bashing" them, first of all. I simply stated my opinion and my reasons for disliking their company. I am fully within my right to say what I dislike about them. And you've got to be kidding that "you" don't feel the need to bash Android. Maybe the blogs don't (I don't know, I don't read Apple blogs), but certainly tons of Apple fans do. Don't act all high-and-mighty like Apple fans don't ever say disparaging things about Android. Android fans do the same thing to Apple. I'm not saying they don't, but there's no way "you" don't feel the need to. Secondly, I don't believe this blog was bashing Apple anyway. Their commercial is blatantly false. Nothing they said in that commercial was completely true unless you take them at their play on words by saying no one else has "the App Store." Well, okay, that's true, but Android, Blackberry, and Palm all have markets where you can buy apps. Joe You referred to them as the Great Big Brother. Seems a little like bashing instead of constructive criticism. And, the commercial is not blatantly false at all. Apple said "If you don't have an iPhone, then you don't have the App Store." That is true. Just because you perceive it as a lie doesn't mean that it is. That means that no TV company can advertise for TV's that have 3D technology because they aren't the only ones that have it. That's just stupid, it's advertising, and Apple is mighty good at it. They didn't lie in the ad, period. Duffin Actually, you have me mistaken for the original poster. I never called them that. But, I will concede that, no, they didn't lie outright, but they did use every misleading tactic in the book. And, no, that's not marketing. That's misrepresenting yourself. If you want to believe they didn't intend that, fine, but I disagree. Joe It's not misleading! It's just a commercial! Good God, they showed what their phone can do! That is it! If Android wants to make an ad like this then by all means go ahead. As I recall they had that holiday ad that ran last year where they had the iPhone in the pile of toys that didn't "fit in". Yeah that's what misleading is right there, taking a phone that invented the core of your phone (android) and slamming it. Without the iPhone, we aren't even having this discussion. Before it came around phones were these hideous bricks with plastic buttons and low quality displays. Now look at them. Case and point. JCopernicus Are you guys really submitting a rebuttal to an advertisement? John Cotton Well, I am a huge Android fan, and I would agree except for the fact that Android doesn't cut it on the music front. I live in Spain and can't buy off Amazon mp3 here...as often, good American companies seem to have forgotten that anywhere exists outside of The States. Come on Google! Get your act together on the music side of things, pleaaaaase... Yobee I don't buy or use jobsPhones, jobsPads or any other kind of jobsJunk for the simple reason that I don't purchase or use overpriced, overhyped, overwrought crap that jobsJobs exerts personal control over. EOS. Interesting to note, however, how a simple jobsJobs commercial can set Android users to each others throats. ObjectiveOne Steve Jobs is not apple. Android is not Larry Sergei or Schmidt. A CEO is not a product or consumer device, nor do they actually work on these devices. They control the direction of a company with the help from the board. Anyway staying positive and optimistic, I believe android has reached maturity and is truly competing and surpassing ios in someways. I want now for manufacturers to step their game up and make products that physically compete with Apple products in terms of hardware design(like the SE Arc) and have up to date hardware. ObjectiveOne and by up to date hardware I don't be last years internals ala the SE Xperia Arch. I want something like the Galaxy S 2 in an all aluminum body or in the Arcs body. Snail Spotify. I dont need anything else Mike I agree that companies all spin their claims in advertising and it's getting out of hand but you're doing the same thing. "Maybe not, but I have an entirely bigger bookstore in Amazon’s Kindle store, in addition to having the B&N Nook Store, Google Books’ store and pretty much any other online e-retailer I want to visit (because, you know, unlike on iOS, you can actually download files through the Android web browser)." I have a kindle app, BN app, Google books app...all free...and they let me buy books right of the web. Glass houses, buddy. Mike Lothian I wonder if they'll try showing those adverts in the UK where we have quite strict advertising regulations You can't be deliberately misleading in them for one There have been quite a few famous adverts been banned for braking these regulations Zero If you dont have an Iphone you are doing great. I have an OG Droid yet. Nunya No one has an Iphone. However, many people do have iPhones... Steve It doesn't say if you don't have an iPhone you can't do this. It just says you don't have an iPhone. Nothing too see here. Stop whining and make a good product and you'll be fine. kodiak211 Google should invest in making a commercial on what the Android OS can do. theres all these commercial on Android phones but mostly to sale that phone and not the OS its self. Jon Garrett but not just make a commercial, make one just like the one Apple made and mention all of the info in this article. FX111 I would rather see them just highlight what it can do, rather then just repeat the "I'm a pc vs. I'm a mac" commercials that were crammed down our throats not to long ago. Android is good enough to stand on it's own, the only thing it's missing is it's own "I'm a mac" slogan. Have them come up with one that isn't a blatant rip of another and market it. Maff Someone needs to make an Android version of this, it can't be too hard to do infact I might do one myself, I have all the equipment, just need the wife out of the house for a couple of hours I have airsync with doubletwist, I just walk into my house and my music, playlists, videos and photos sync between my PC and my phone without wires do that on your iPhone! milk kind of preaching to the choir aren't you? noiphone if you don't have an iphone - you don't have to pay for tethering - you don't have to bother that you can't freely copy data and media files to your device and vice versa via bluetooth or USB - you don't have to pay for apps you wouldn't need if your browser would support flash - you don't have to figure out how to extract mp3s from your itunes library to share them with friends because apple software restricts you - you don't have to worry that you can't extend your memory with sd-cards or that you can't connect an usb-harddrive - you have never experienced that Apple forces you to install all your software through their system and that they could even remove software from your device and of course collect all your private and geo-data - you don't have to bother how to jailbreak/root your device because its only necessary on WP7, iOS and Android but not on free operating systems such as Symbian, MeeGo and Maemo Mh. Well. If you don't have an iphone, you're lucky. Mesmorino I have a desire hd and I don't have to pay for tethering Martin I still can't see anything false? If you don't have an iPhone, you don't have an iPhone: true! If you don't have an iPhone, you don't have the AppStore: true, Apple is claiming rights on the name. The AppStore has the largest selection of Apps: true, the fact that it might be false in the future is irrelevent. All the rest is just a list of task you can really do with an iPhone!!? Nowhere it is said that you cannot do the same with Android. Are you expecting Apple to advertise that you can do the same with a competing product? Do you know anything about marketing? Martin Here's more falsities http://tinyurl.com/4j6b5b4 David OMFG! THANK YOU!!!! I was just commenting on this today with some friends that have Iphones. At least one of them bought the Iphone to jailbreak it and use the hardware for more than just a mega duche. These Iphone wankers really need to get a life. Duffin Then you need to get your ears checked. wow you really must have no life if all you do is pick apart apple's new ad campaign. i'm sorry but that's just hilarious. apple has always been the innovators, and i agree, the new ad's kinda do suck. but that doesn't mea you go cocking about just because it's made by apple. i mean really, get a life. sexseasong you people are all lame...... Lissa Jhone Can't see something wrong using new iPhone? If you don't have an iPhone, then first of all you Buy Apple iPhone. Apple has constantly been the trend-setters, and I support.

Prototype AR glasses 'injured Apple employees during testing' Leaked health report claims Apple tester "experienced discomfort in her eye" after using mystery prototype. By Oliver Cragg April 21, 2017 11:49 BST Apple's rumoured 'AR glasses' project is expected to debut after the 10th anniversary iPhone breaks cover.Reuters Leaked documents containing over 70 injury reports for Apple employees have offered further hints that the iPhone and Mac maker is working on smart glasses that use augmented reality (AR) technology. The health and safety report includes an entry from 21 February where an employee at one of Apple's De Anza offices based in Cupertino, California, "experienced discomfort in her eye" after testing a prototype unit of an undisclosed device. "After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study," read the report, obtained by Gizmodo. "Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis." A separate incident report from the nearby Vallco Parkway office, dated 2 March, also referenced ocular strain in relation to prototype unit: "Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with." As with any leaked documentation emanating from inside the company's clandestine testing chambers, the report has sparked more than a fair share of wild speculation – including suggestions that the prototype has something to do with Apple's plans for the iPhone 8 camera. However, a source inside Apple told Gizmodo that the latter injury in particular is likely related to an AR-touting product "like glasses with an overhead display". Considering that Apple CEO Tim Cook has brazenly sung the tech's praises in multiple interviews, it would seem that the company's AR ambitions are progressing nicely behind the scenes... injuries aside, of course. The leaked documentation also arrives less than a month after Apple insiders confirmed that the tech giant's augmented reality push will become the "top priority for its next big launch" following the iPhone 8, with a possible debut in 2018. Other incidents listed in the contractor's report are slightly more mundane, unless you are really keen to learn that Apple employees are equally capable of silly office accidents – one staffer allegedly "burned his hand pulling fish out of the oven", while another suffered a knock "after running into a door". Nevertheless, one listing does reference a knee injury sustained during a "team building" skiing and snowboarding trip, which may be a clue that Apple is considering adding the two winter sports to its Workout app for the Watch.

View All Editorials → Apple Runs Up Against State Censorship in China, Again Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin 1 minute read Apr 21st, 2017 1:05 AM EDT | Analysis Apple is once again running into issues with state censorship in China, according to Xinhua. Two different agencies will call Apple into their offices to demand tighter controls over streaming apps in the App Store. The move is part of a crackdown on streaming content from three Chinese sites: toutiao.com, huoshanzhibo.com, and huajiao.com. Government regulators said those three sites were offering illegal content, including porn. Those companies had apps in Apple’s App Store in China. The Beijing Public Security Bureau and Beijing Cultural Market Administrative Law Enforcement Team want Apple more involved in policing such things. Apple’s China Syndrome This is part and parcel of the struggle Apple faces in China. On the one hand, China’s government is an authoritarian communist government in the hands of a single party very focused on perpetuating the control of that party. Really, that’s the other hand, too, but the other hand is highly interested in tamping down the success of western companies in China. And thus we have Apple forced to shut down its iBooks and movie offerings on iTunes. More recently, Apple was forced to pull The New York Times‘ app from the Chinese app store. China hates the idea of its people getting unfettered access to information. Apple is far from the first U.S. tech giant to face such pressures. Facebook is banned outright. Microsoft chose to censor Bing to stay in business in China, while Google closed down its China business and redirected Chinese queries to its Hong Kong operation. The problem for Apple is that these kinds of pressures are bound to increase. The bigger Apple gets, the more interest China has in knocking it down. At the same time, the bigger Apple gets, the more it becomes a pawn in political jousting between China and the U.S. It’s a tricky spot for Apple to be in, to be sure.

(Apple) Apple wants to “one day” end the need to mine materials from the earth to make its gadgets, the technology giant said in its annual environmental responsibility report out Thursday. “Traditional supply chains are linear,” it said. “Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products.” “We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material,” it added. The company’s research concluded that recycled aluminum should come from Apple products rather than recycling facilities because of the high-grade quality required. Watch the Apple iPhone 8 Concept look here Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products for recycling and has melted down iPhone aluminum enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories. “For tin, we took a different approach,” the company said. “Unlike aluminum, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards.” As a result, Apple has been using recycled tin for its iPhone 6s. The ultimate aim is “to one day end our reliance on mining altogether,” the company said, without specifying a date. Apple did not disclose the amount of recycled products currently used in its products. “Apple’s commitment to 100 percent recycled materials is ambitious, and highlights the need for greater urgency across the sector to reduce resource consumption and e-waste that are causing significant impacts on the environment and human health,” Greenpeace senior analyst Gary Cook said. Making new gadgets with reclaimed material reduces demand for mined metals and increases the tendency for devices to be recycled, according to the environmental group. Watch a man build an iPhone from spare parts Samsung last month said it would sell some Note 7 smartphones that were recalled for safety reasons as refurbished devices, in an effort to manage its stockpile in an “environmentally friendly” manner. The South Korean giant recalled an estimated four million of its flagship smartphones over concerns that batteries could overheat and burst into flames. A Samsung statement said that salvageable components from devices would be detached, and metals extracted by companies that specialize in recycling.

Apple is also among Silicon Valley titans investing heavily in green energy for operations, saying that 96 percent of the electricity at its global facilities comes from renewable sources and that its new ‘spaceship’ main campus is powered entirely by renewable energy. tags Apple Apple iPhone X Apple iPhone 8 Apple goes green Apple news more from tech Samsung Galaxy S8 more expensive to manufacture than iPhone 7, Google Pixel Apr 21, 2017 15:01 IST LG G6 pre-bookings open now ahead of Monday launch, to be priced around Rs 53,000 Apr 21, 2017 14:25 IST Not a Drop to Waste- A Water Day Infographic Partnered Feature Recommended for you Read more Apple’s Make in India project: iPhone-maker to start trial assembly in Bengaluru next month Apple falls 70% short of its iPhone sales target in India: BofA report Read more Your next Apple Watch, iPhone or MacBook may come with diabetes testing sensor iPhone 6S from spare parts?

Apple’s next-generation iPhone 8 is slated to debut this coming September, and it should be released either later that month or sometime soon after. But new flagship iPhones always launch in September, right? While that has been true ever since Apple shifted its release from the early summer to the late summer, recent reports suggest that Apple and its manufacturing partners are having trouble with a key piece of technology expected to debut in Apple’s tenth-anniversary smartphone According to those reports, Apple was faced with two options: either delay the launch or ditch the tech. And now, perhaps for the first time ever, loyal Apple fans are praying that the company’s hotly anticipated new iPhone is delayed. Why is everyone hoping for a delay? The answer to that question lies in a leak that we showed you on Wednesday. As you’ll undoubtedly recall, a source with a mixed track record shared a leaked schematic drawing he claimed shows the iPhone 8’s rear housing design. Here’s the image in question: The image shows a phone that looks like a flattened iPhone 5, but an extra hole can clearly be seen beneath the Apple logo. That hole, according to rumors, could be the relocated Touch ID fingerprint scanner. Apple has been working for years to embed its Touch ID sensor beneath the iPhone’s display, and the iPhone 8 was expected to be the first iPhone to feature the new tech. Apple is said to be having problems getting its new embedded scanner to a point where it can be mass-produced, however, so reports have suggested that the company is toying with relocating the scanner to the back of the phone. As we mentioned in our earlier coverage, there’s a good chance that this is fake. If it’s real, it also might just be one of several designs Apple was experimenting with. We sincerely hope one of those two scenarios ends up being accurate, because this design is absolutely awful. We explained why in yesterday’s post, and it looks like even hardcore Apple fans agree that this iPhone design would be terrible. Just about every single reaction we’ve seen to this leak has been negative. If you’re looking for one spot to check out the general consensus, this Reddit thread should suffice. The Apple subreddit is full of people who love Apple and just about any product it releases, but the idea of an iPhone 8 with a Touch ID scanner on the back is universally hated. Most of the thread is just people commenting on how awful this design would be, in general. But one user made a very important point. “Just try holding your iPhone now and reaching your index finger that far below the Apple logo,” he or she wrote. “If this is true, it is a disastrous placement of touch ID, even worse than the [Galaxy S8] in my opinion.” This is a fantastic point, and it’s probably the best indication that this leak is fake. As we noted in our Galaxy S8 review, Samsung’s fingerprint scanner placement on its new flagship phones is awful. The placement on the iPhone 8 pictured above is even worse, however. The idea of having to fumble with your phone to hit a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone that’s positioned more than halfway down the phone might actually be nauseating. The odds are fairly good that actual iPhone 8 components will begin leaking very soon, and our fingers are crossed that these schematics will quickly be debunked.         LATEST STORIES (9) France’s Syria Blowback: A Catastrophe of the West’s Making Iraqi Forces Make Further Gains in War against ISIL in Mosul Hama: Syrian Army Captures Town of Taibat Al-Imam Bahrainis Continue Support for Sheikh Issa Qassim During Weekly Protests Mosul: More Civilians Flee Battle Zone Through Iraqi Army Humanitarian corridors Terrorists' 500-Meter-Long Tunnel Connecting Baqin to Madaya Discovered in Western Damascus Syria: 15 New Buses Carrying Civilians of Fua'a, Kafraya Arrive in Aleppo Syria: More Civilians from Towns of Fua'a & Kafraya Arrive in Aleppo Iraq's Elite Forces in Battle with ISIL in Western Mosul Mass Outbreak: The Political Class in Washington Is Mentally Unstable Syrian Army Continues Assault on ISIL, Al-Nusra in Homs Syrian Fighter Jets Turn Eastern Damascus into Hell for Terrorists Terrorists' Underground Base in Hama Destroyed in Russian Airstrike Russia, Syria Holding Talks on Supplies of More Air Defense Systems Heavy Fighting Continues between Syrian Soldiers, Terrorists in Northwestern Homs France’s Syria Blowback: A Catastrophe of the West’s Making TEHRAN (FNA)- On Thursday, April 20, a French police was shot dead and two others injured in Paris in a terrorist attack claimed by ISIL.

Trending in Apple Here’s what the Hackintosh community wants in the new modular Mac Pro Yesterday AAPL: 142.27 -0.17 iPhone ASP predicted to rise to $753 in 2018, as Apple readies premium-priced iPhone 8 for the fall Benjamin Mayo - Apr. 21st 2017 2:33 am PT @bzamayo iPhone 7 iPhone 8 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Analysts are expecting the price people will pay for an iPhone to rise significantly heading into next year. Apple analyst Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley released a report (via Business Insider) predicting iPhone ASP to rise to $753 in 2018, up from $695 in the holiday quarter just gone. Much of this increase is attributed to demand for the upcoming flagship iPhone model with an all-new design, OLED display and (almost) bezel-less front face. This ‘iPhone 8’ is rumored to cost significantly more than Apple’s current lineup. Huberty also notes that more people are buying the iPhone 7 Plus than ever before, which starts at $769 and is priced at a $120 premium relative to the 4.7-inch iPhones. The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here The Morgan Stanley report indicates that Wall Street consensus estimates the iPhone average selling price at $675 for the coming year. Whilst $675 is a very strong number in itself, it does appear to be a pessimistic target. Apple already reported a $695 iPhone average selling price in the 2016 holiday quarter where the product mix leaned toward the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus models. It seems customers wanted to pay for the exclusive features the Plus model provided in this cycle, namely the dual-camera for depth-effect photos and optical zoom. With so much pent-up demand and anticipation for the iPhone 8, it follows that Apple could see iPhone ASP push higher still. The new OLED iPhone has been rumored to cost in the region of $1000. Even if that number is too high, most people agree that the iPhone 8 will be positioned as a premium item and that it will start at higher price tags than the current iPhone lineup. At the very least, it is very plausible for Apple to sell this new flagship iPhone at a $100 premium over the iPhone 7 Plus, just like the Plus is about $100 more expensive than the iPhone 7. This would mean all new iPhone buyers wanting the best, newest, device would spend at least $869 each. Obviously, not all iPhone buyers opt for the most expensive model but Huberty sees that strong demand for the iPhone 7 Plus or its successor (also expected this year) will stabilize the average around the $750 mark. Morgan Stanley raised their price target on AAPL stock to $161. Apple shares closed at $142.44 yesterday. Apple is expected to unveil the new iPhone 8 in the fall, likely at a September event although it may not ship in quantity until a couple of months later. Apple is also expected to unveil iterative updates to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, with modest component improvements and wireless charging.

He and the audience were — the Apple founder claimed — “making history”. Those who were aware of Jobs’ ego, which only reared its head away from the cameras, rolled their eyes. Among them was Hermann Hauser, another computer pioneer who founded Acorn Computers, which spawned ARM Holdings.  Hauser would mingle at conferences in the early days of computers with the likes of Jobs, Bill Gates and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. “When Jobs showed his iPhone for the first time and said he’d ‘reinvented’ the phone, I thought, ‘Oh, for Christ’s sake’,” the Austria-born entrepreneur recalls, throwing his Google phone on the table in disgust. “But he had. He actually had,” Hauser acknowledges, almost with a grimace, as if it pains him to say so. “He was absolutely brilliant, but he treated his staff like shit.” I ask if Jobs stood out from the crowd. “Steve stood out as the most unpleasant of the lot,” Hauser clarifies. When we meet in the London office of his Cambridge venture capital firm Amadeus Capital Partners, the silver-haired, tanned Hauser is dressed in his own signature outfit: a navy jacket, with beige fleece underneath, and polka-dot neckerchief. Contemporary: Apple's Steve Jobs (AFP/Getty Images) He’s so calm and laidback that it seems hard to believe this is the man who bemoaned the £24 billion sale of ARM, the chip designer he founded, to Japan’s SoftBank. “I still regret that it was sold because it’s really the last UK IT company with a global footprint,” he says. He is pleased that “out of all the acquirers”, Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s billionaire founder who pledged to more than double ARM’s headcount in the UK and keep the headquarters in Cambridge, is in charge. And he isn’t concerned by the recent decision to move a quarter of ARM into a new $100 billion fund it set up with Saudi Arabia. “As long as Son runs SoftBank, I think ARM will be fine. But he’s retired once already, and what happens when he retires in three or five years’ time? Will his successor have the same attitude to ARM or not?” Hauser makes a compelling argument. If ARM bolsters the security of the chips, he says it “could easily” be worth $100 billion — more than three times what SoftBank paid. His opinions don’t come in half measures but each is delivered with typical composure. He thinks the likes of Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland will “just not exist” as High Street banks once the fintech revolution picks up speed. “You can replace all these banks by computer.” He also believes Apple’s smartphone dominance is coming to an end — “a very sad story”. "Apple will be back as a niche player with a 10% market share — if they can keep it." Hermann Hauser “They will be back as a niche player with a 10% market share — if they can keep it — because Huawei, LG and Samsung are going to wipe the floor with them,” he says. “I like Apple, despite Steve Jobs,” he adds with a grin. Don’t get him started on Brexit, or “Britain’s worst own goal in history” as he tweeted on the day of the EU referendum result. Hauser’s frustration at Britain leaving the EU is hardly surprising, given his European roots. He left the Austrian Alps for Cambridge to do a PhD in physics after a year of military service at home. He’s been in Silicon Fen since, but manages to find time to spend with his wife on their beef farm in New Zealand (it has its own beach). When he went into physics, he was warned by a family friend that he would “never make any money”. But then he decided to start a company with Cambridge-based entrepreneur Chris Curry, whom he met socially. “I must have had some of my father’s entrepreneurial genes,” he says, referring to his father’s wine business in Austria.  Hauser and Curry went to the bank across from his halls at King’s College, Cambridge and got a £10,000 cheque, and, months later, one for £50,000. What started as Cambridge Processor Unit Ltd in the late Seventies became Acorn Computers. A deal to produce the BBC Micro for schools made it an overnight success. When the pair returned two years later, asking for £1 million, the bank manager “fell off his chair”. No company had ever asked for that amount of money so soon. “I often wonder if I would have financed myself. And the answer is probably no,” he admits. “We didn’t even have a business plan — we had a hunch that this was going to be important.” Luckily, they did find a banker to lend them the cash and Acorn grew into a company known across the land when Hauser and Curry cashed in with a £200 million stock-market float.  Just as the first ARM chips were being developed, and when they finally solved their production problems, the home-computer market collapsed. “We finally had them coming in by the lorry loads when people stopped buying them.” Read more ARM hires hundreds of staff after Softbank takeover Baillie Gifford among the big winners from ARM's Softbank deal Japan’s SoftBank grabs ARM in £24 billion deal Olivetti rode to the rescue and took a controlling stake on the cheap. Hauser spent the next three years setting up research labs for the Italian PC firm. He also helped create Advanced RISC Machines, which became ARM. It started out as a joint venture with Apple before floating on the LSE in 1998. In the meantime, Hauser established Active Book Company, which was behind a pen computer — the original tablet computer. It was bought by AT & T and incorporated into EO, which the US telecoms giant also owned, although pen computing never took off. Next, he brought online share trading to the UK in the late Nineties when he set up E*Trade UK, a joint venture with the US company of the same name. Just as it signed a one-year deal with the London Stock Exchange to get a near-live price feed, the LSE pulled the plug, and shortly after stunned Hauser by announcing it would be doing its own online share trading. With lawyers in tow, he met the then-chairman of the London Stock Exchange in “the most bizarre meeting of my life”, Hauser recalls. “He greeted me with the LSE’s motto My Word is My Bond — just after breaking the contract.” The chairman proceeded to thump the desk in anger. “As a young person, you have this great respect for a great institution like the LSE. And there was this guy who was clearly out of his tree.” The financial watchdog told the LSE to honour its contract, he recollects with satisfaction, and E*Trade UK was ultimately sold to the US partner for $280 million. At about the same time, he had started his private equity firm Amadeus with chief executive Anne Glover, a tech start-up investor at Apax, and became the person handing out the cheques rather than receiving them. The move into venture capital made sense. By then, Hauser accounted for half of all angel investment in Cambridge, having backed dozens of start-ups along the way.  Although it has kept a low profile, Amadeus has had a pretty good run in its 20 years. Early successes included lastminute.com’s float in 2000 and the $600 million sale of gene-sequencing firm Solexa in 2007. More recently, Samsung-backed Amadeus cashed in when London-listed chipmaker CSR, formerly Cambridge Silicon Radio, was sold to Qualcomm in 2015 for £1.6 billion. It also sold VocalIQ, an artificial intelligence voice firm, to Apple in 2015 for reportedly close to $100 million. Read more Apple’s £500m bombshell for UK chip designer Hauser himself — reportedly worth £150 million — is a real draw for tech founders. Those include lastminute.com and made.com co-founder Brent Hoberman, who describes him as “a pillar of UK tech investing” and “a great support” for his own businesses. “He can help predict the future and help entrepreneurs get there fast,” he adds. Amadeus has always had a fondness for biotech, a Cambridge speciality, but is also a specialist investor in fast-growing areas such as AI and cyber security. Hauser is also keen on fintech, where the London scene comes into its own.He visits the Mayfair office once or twice a week but still spends most of his time in Cambridge. While he’s “scaling back a little”, Hauser, who was awarded an honorary knighthood last year, has no plans to head off into the sunset — or to his beef farm — just yet. The joy he clearly gets from starting companies has not diminished, and he recalls almost every step of his career with the same fondness — most anecdotes begin with the phrase: “It was the most amazing time.” Although very different in personality, Hauser clearly shares the vision that made Jobs such an icon. Does it bother him that he is often described as the UK’s answer to the Apple man? “Given his achievements, it’s probably not a bad comparison.” Maybe, but I get the feeling Hauser is more popular among colleagues than Jobs ever was.

But what it lacks in other form factors or designs it makes up for in styles, branding, and limited edition models. Last year, Apple hooked up with Nike to show that the Apple Watch isn’t just a fashion statement but also a runner’s best friend. This year it is doing so again but with a more muted style. Unlike the Apple Watch Nike+ and its neon highlights, this limited edition Apple Watch NikeLab embraces a less glaring appearance while keeping the same features that runners and marathoners loved. It’s still as sporty as ever, of course. Which is to say, it might clash with your gala attire. And it has the same features as the Apple Watch Nike+, including the Nike+ Run Club, GPS, stronger water resistance, and, Nike-exclusive Siri commands. Where it differs from last year’s model is really only the color. Whereas the Nike+ sported dark straps with an inner neon yellow coating, the new NikeLab model has a Light Bone band that’s black inside. Save for the Innovation x Innovator’s logo on the underside of the strap. One other unique thing about this Apple Watch NikeLab is its availability. As mentioned, it will be limited, but that mostly refers to where you’ll be able to buy it from. Starting April 27, you’ll be able to find it on nike.com, NikeLab, and the Apple Watch Store at Istean Shinjuku in Japan. So don’t expect this watch to popup at an Apple Store near you. That is, unless you do live in Shinjuku.

Apple Inc.,  (Fed. Cir. Apr. 14, 2017) (Before O’Malley, Bryson, and Wallach, J.) (Opinion for the court, Bryson, J.) Core Wireless sued Apple for infringing its patent directed to a cellular network system including a mobile station providing for improved transmission of data packets. Core Wireless’ patent strives to do so by having a mobile station, not the network, make uplink channel selection decisions during data packet transmission. A magistrate judge construed the term “means for comparing” to have the function of “comparing said threshold value of the channel selection parameter to a current value of the channel selection parameter for basis of said channel selection,” as provided in the specification. At trial, Apple introduced evidence that its mobile stations lack the capability to select between common and dedicated channels, falling outside the magistrate’s claim construction. The jury found that Apple did not infringe Core Wireless’ patent. Core Wireless moved for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL), arguing that Apple misapplied the magistrate’s construction by arguing that “means for comparing” requires the mobile station to have the capability to perform channel selection. The district court denied Core Wireless’ motion, agreeing with Apple’s proposed construction. At issue on appeal is whether the district court misapplied the magistrate judge’s pretrial claim construction and whether the claim construction adopted by the district court when ruling on Core Wireless’ JMOL was erroneous. First, Core Wireless argued that the claim construction used by Apple at trial was clearly rejected by the magistrate. The Court found that the magistrate never clearly rejected Apple’s construction. Instead, the magistrate focused on whether control unit 803 was a general purpose processor, in light of what was taught in the specification. Next, Core Wireless challenged the district court’s JMOL order where it construed “means for comparing” to require that the mobile station have the capability to make channel selections. The Court disagreed, noting the “means-plus-function language.” Turning to the specification, to ascertain what performs the claimed function, the Court concluded that the whole purpose of the invention was to enable the mobile station to make the channel selection decision, and the examples were not merely preferred embodiments. Additionally, none of the embodiments described in the specification had a network make the channel selection decision. Additionally, the remainder of the specification, confirmed by the prosecution history and extrinsic evidence, supported a finding that the mobile station and not the network made channel selections. Last, the Court rejected the position taken by Core Wireless that Apple’s devices do infringe even if the claim requires the mobile station to be capable of channel selection. Ultimately, the Court concluded that the district court correctly denied Core Wireless’s motion for judgment as a matter of law and properly upheld the jury’s verdict of noninfringement. Means plus function limitations in a claim are interpreted based on the structures provided in the specification and the functions those structures perform. Examples may limit a “means plus function” claim term when they represent the only embodiment and the “whole purpose” of the invention.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 April 2017 by Monika Donimirska Apple Accessories Market to Grow at 4.8% CAGR through 2020 Screen Guards to remain the most important product type segment for both iPhone and iPad Modern day smartphones and tablet computers are largely touchscreen centric. The touchscreen is the most important component of these devices and is probably the most prone to damage as well. While manufacturers do tend to use some kind of toughened glass to prevent the screen from shattering, customers show a preference for additional protection as a kind of safety net. This has led to an increasing demand for screen guards to protect the screens of high-end devices like the iPhone and iPad. This factor is driving the increased adoption of screen guards in the global Apple accessories market. iPhone Screen Guards and iPad Screen Guards are anticipated to be the most lucrative segments of the global Apple accessories market. iPhone Screen Guard expected to be the largest segment by product type in the global Apple accessories market The iPhone alone accounts for approximately 2/3rd of the revenue of Apple Inc. and the company has been referred to several times as the ‘iPhone company’. The iPhone is often the only pocket computer, camera, calculator, MP3 player, or GPS that people carry with them as it has effectively replaced all of these devices. The iPhone is both extremely expensive and quite fragile and this is quite a lethal combination as even a single drop could potentially shatter the delicate touchscreen. Many people have had the misfortune of either a shattered or cracked iPhone screen at least once in their lifetime. With all these factors in mind, it is not surprising that the iPhone Screen Guard is anticipated to hold the largest chunk of the Apple accessories market throughout the forecast period (2016-2020). Request For Report Sample: http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-3374 Decline in BPS, but still clinging to leadership position In the year 2016, the iPhone Screen Guard product type segment accounted for nearly 19% of the entire Apple accessories market and this segment is predicted to stand at 18.5% by the end of the year 2020, registering a substantial BPS drop of nearly 30 points. However, the iPhone Screen Guard segment should still remain leader in the global Apple accessories market by product type, and it is likely to be closely followed by iPad Cases in the second position. The Y-o-Y growth rate of the iPhone Screen Guard segment is estimated to remain above 3% for the entire duration of the study and rise to nearly 5% by the year 2020. Absolute dollar opportunity, incremental dollar opportunity and CAGR point to a bright future In the year 2015, the iPhone Screen Guard segment had a market value of above $1 Billion worldwide, rising to slightly more than $1.1 Billion in 2016. This reflects a Y-o-Y growth rate of 3.6%. By the year 2020, the iPhone Screen Guard segment is expected to be worth nearly $1.4 Billion, registering a CAGR of 4.4% during the forecast period. A predicted incremental dollar opportunity of a little more than $210 Million during the period 2016 – 2020 implies there is good opportunity for companies involved in the Apple accessories market to profit handsomely if they create a screen guard to protect this critical component of the iPhone. Revenue growth of the iPad Screen Guard segment poised to be less prominent than the iPhone Screen Guard segment Send An Enquiry: http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/askus/rep-gb-3374 The iPad Screen Guard segment accounted for just over $1 Billion in 2015 and it is likely to witness a Y-o-Y growth of 2.5%. At the end of the forecast period, the value of the iPad Screen Guard segment is anticipated to be close to $1.2 Billion, recording a CAGR of 2.4%. This represents an incremental dollar opportunity of more than $100 Million during the four year period; something that the key stakeholders operating in the global Apple accessories market need to watch closely.

Videographer Duncan Sinfield’s got the latest visual scoop on the tech giant’s “spaceship” campus—officially named Apple Park—with his stunning drone footage of ongoing construction and a special nighttime close-up of the building interior. Hit the jump for the newest sneak peek into Apple’s futuristic campus. Drone pilot Sinfield has consistently provided the public with monthly visual updates of Apple’s 175-acre park in Cupertino since July 2015. Nearly two years later, his latest drone footage shows the campus transformed with the hilly landscape slowly filling in with trees, although turf has yet to be installed. Once complete, the site’s rolling hills will be covered with grassy fields, jogging paths, and over 9,000 native and drought-resistant trees. Designed in collaboration with Foster + Partners, Apple Park prides itself on energy efficiency and will be powered entirely by 100-percent renewable energy. Rooftop solar amounts to 17 megawatts in one of the world’s largest on-site solar energy installations. The 2.9-million-square foot main ring-shaped building will be clad in the world’s largest panels of curved glass. The building is also projected to be one of the world’s largest naturally ventilated structures, requiring no heating or air conditioning for nine months of the year. Related: Apple’s $5 billion spaceship campus to open in April as “Apple Park” The new 4K drone footage shows a nighttime peek of the interior, where construction workers are working around the clock to prep the campus for occupancy. The process of moving over 12,000 employees into the campus will begin this month and is expected to take over six months while construction continues through the summer. Apple Park will also feature a visitor’s center with an Apple Store and cafe open to the public.

It’s no secret that the Cupertino giant sees AR as integral to its future products. We know, based on recent rumours, that the upcoming iPhone 8 will get a bunch of AR features. There have also been reports that Apple is exploring AR-based wearable glasses. Now, we may have just found a slight hint that the AR glasses might actually be true. Some Apple employees have mistakenly received a safety report by an Environment Health and Safety contractor that suggests a prototype unit has been causing eye strain for testers, according to Gizmodo, which has managed to acquire one of the copies. The report has includes about 70 different incidents ranging from workplace injuries to work-related stress. Interestingly, one report on February 21 involved a prototype unit at Apple’s De Anza office in Cupertino. “After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis,” the report read. Another report involved an employee working at Apple’s Vallco Parkway office in Cupertino, who reported eye pain on March 2. “Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with.” Of course, these reports are way too vague to conclude that they are related to Apple’s VR glasses. However, VR and AR have been known to cause symptoms like eye pain, nausea and dizziness and the prototype mentioned in these reports could allude to that. Apple CEO Tim Cook has already expressed his views on AR when he said it could be as big as the smartphone. Despite the current favouritism towards virtual reality, which completely immerses you in a virtual world, Apple believes AR will be easier for people to accept as its a lot less intrusive. Augmented reality places overlays images and virtual things on the real world. The most popular example today in AR is perhaps Niantic’s smash hit Pokemon Go. While the AR glasses could still be a few years away before we get to see something concrete, we can expect to get a taste of what Apple’s team has been up to in this hardware with the upcoming iPhone.

The company is trying to lower its reliance on the raw materials that make up its phones, tablets and computers. However, it has admitted that it's still figuring out how to get to that point. “We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it,” Lisa Jackson, Apple's VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, told VICE News .

But the company still relies on materials like zinc, copper, tungsten and colbalt. The last of those has attracted negative headlines recently due to its impact in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it's mined. Mountain gorillas have seen their habitat destroyed as more and more workers use the land for mining cobalt. Read More Why iPhone users should NEVER say 108 to Siri (Photo: www.alamy.com) Apple has set out plans to turn this around by shifting to recycled materials, even though it acknowledges this isn't possible at the moment. “We are committing as a company to not necessarily having to source from the earth for everything that we need,” Jackson said. Even though it still has to make big changes to the manufacturing, Apple's report shows how it's doing in other areas. The company notes that its facilities around the world now run on 96% renewable energy. This doesn't include third-party manufacturers like Foxconn, but Apple points out that it's trying to work with them to become more efficient as well.

Seven major suppliers have now pledged to power their Apple production entirely with renewable energy by the end of next year," the report notes. "And we’re making strides toward our commitment to bring 4 gigawatts of renewable power online by 2020, a key step in reducing our manufacturing footprint. "It’s clear to us that now, more than ever, we can show the way to a better future. We’re constantly working to show what’s possible and inspire others to create a healthier environment." Previous commitments from Apple towards going green have involved a robot called Liam, which can strip down busted iPhones to help recover the materials that can be re-used in future phones.

The Liam system, which is made up of 29 robotic arms, has already been installed near Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, and the company plans to build a second robot in Europe for the same purpose. The build-up of electronic waste is an increasing problem here in the UK. Research from the memory and storage company Crucial suggests that over 13 million computers have been binned in the last five years. That's based on extrapolations from a survey in which a fifth of the 2,000 respondents admitted they threw away at least one working computer in the last half-decade rather than recycling or upgrading them. "One of the leading contributors to landfill waste in the UK is e-waste, created by disused or discarded technology including household appliances like old PCs," said Jeremy Mortenson, memory product line manager at Crucial.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile It’s official: Everyone hates the iPhone 8 design that just leaked Image Source: Gabor Balogh Zach Epstein @zacharye April 20th, 2017 at 10:08 AM Share Tweet Apple’s next-generation iPhone 8 is slated to debut this coming September, and it should be released either later that month or sometime soon after. But new flagship iPhones always launch in September, right? While that has been true ever since Apple shifted its release from the early summer to the late summer, recent reports suggest that Apple and its manufacturing partners are having trouble with a key piece of technology expected to debut in Apple’s tenth-anniversary smartphone According to those reports, Apple was faced with two options: either delay the launch or ditch the tech. And now, perhaps for the first time ever, loyal Apple fans are praying that the company’s hotly anticipated new iPhone is delayed. Don't Miss: These leaked iPhone 8 schematics are a travesty if they’re real Why is everyone hoping for a delay? The answer to that question lies in a leak that we showed you on Wednesday. As you’ll undoubtedly recall, a source with a mixed track record shared a leaked schematic drawing he claimed shows the iPhone 8’s rear housing design. Here’s the image in question: The image shows a phone that looks like a flattened iPhone 5, but an extra hole can clearly be seen beneath the Apple logo. That hole, according to rumors, could be the relocated Touch ID fingerprint scanner. Apple has been working for years to embed its Touch ID sensor beneath the iPhone’s display, and the iPhone 8 was expected to be the first iPhone to feature the new tech. Apple is said to be having problems getting its new embedded scanner to a point where it can be mass-produced, however, so reports have suggested that the company is toying with relocating the scanner to the back of the phone. As we mentioned in our earlier coverage, there’s a good chance that this is fake. If it’s real, it also might just be one of several designs Apple was experimenting with. We sincerely hope one of those two scenarios ends up being accurate, because this design is absolutely awful. We explained why in yesterday’s post, and it looks like even hardcore Apple fans agree that this iPhone design would be terrible. Just about every single reaction we’ve seen to this leak has been negative. If you’re looking for one spot to check out the general consensus, this Reddit thread should suffice. The Apple subreddit is full of people who love Apple and just about any product it releases, but the idea of an iPhone 8 with a Touch ID scanner on the back is universally hated. Most of the thread is just people commenting on how awful this design would be, in general. But one user made a very important point. “Just try holding your iPhone now and reaching your index finger that far below the Apple logo,” he or she wrote. “If this is true, it is a disastrous placement of touch ID, even worse than the [Galaxy S8] in my opinion.” This is a fantastic point, and it’s probably the best indication that this leak is fake. As we noted in our Galaxy S8 review, Samsung’s fingerprint scanner placement on its new flagship phones is awful. The placement on the iPhone 8 pictured above is even worse, however. The idea of having to fumble with your phone to hit a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone that’s positioned more than halfway down the phone might actually be nauseating. The odds are fairly good that actual iPhone 8 components will begin leaking very soon, and our fingers are crossed that these schematics will quickly be debunked.

Apple's own Podcasts app doesn't let you do this, although you can send a playlist of audio files from the Music app. The Apple Watch is the closest thing to an iPod that Apple really makes these days, so its lack of official support for podcasts has always been a little odd. And Apple is slowly making it more appealing to use the Watch away from your phone — AirPods are by far the most convenient earphone solution yet, and the Series 2 watches have features like GPS tracking and waterproofing that are designed for running and swimming, both examples of situations where it may be impractical to have your phone nearby. I like to listen to podcasts when I run, because I otherwise find it pretty boring. If I'm going to focus my attention on music, I'd rather be comfortable and use equipment that's going to provide a better experience than whatever Bluetooth buds I've brought to the gym. Podcasts work much better for me when running because although sound quality doesn't really matter, I still have to concentrate on what I'm hearing — it's a good way to take my mind off things and make the time go faster. Overcast now fills a big gap in the Apple Watch’s functionality That's why this Overcast update is great news for me: it makes running outdoors a lot more practical and fun because I can leave my phone at home. (I have an iPhone 7 Plus, which does not feel great strapped to an arm or loose in a pocket.) It fills what feels like a big gap in the Apple Watch's functionality. I just went for a quick 5-kilometer run to test out Overcast, and it mostly worked well. Once you've transferred the files to the watch, they appear in a secondary "Now Playing" interface that you can access with a left swipe. You can copy over multiple files at once, and they can be switched between via a simple menu. Playback controls are responsive and easy to press, unlike older versions of Overcast built with the first version of Apple's Watch software developer kit. I didn't run into any problems switching between apps on the Watch, either; I could start playing a playlist from the Music app and later carry on where I left off in Overcast, all with a laundry timer running in the background. The implementation isn't without its flaws. Copying over each podcast took several minutes, in my experience, and there's no indication of how far along you are in the process — it just says "Transferring" until it's done. Your play state doesn't seem to sync back to the phone properly once you get home, even if you finish the whole podcast, tap the trash icon on the watch, and select "Delete from Overcast." At one point I somehow ended up with two versions of the same file playing over each other, and it was only possible to pause one from the watch itself — I ended up having to stop the other by taking out my AirPods and reconnecting. And at one point, the app just crashed altogether in the middle of my run, forcing a restart. Apple Watch apps aren't exactly known for their stability, however, and Overcast's quirks are easy to look past for the functionality it provides. It was already my favorite podcast app for the iPhone, and now it's just made my Apple Watch quite a bit more useful as a fitness tracker. Overcast is a free download, with a $9.99 annual subscription that removes ads and adds some minor features. This update also gives subscribers the option for a new app icon that matches the dark theme, for example.

Published on April 21, 2017. 0 If you’re a die-hard Apple fan, then you most likely know that this year marks the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, the world’s most unanimously acclaimed smartphone of all time. Yep, the first every iPhone came out ten years ago, in 2007, and Apple’s flagship line has been rocking the tech world ever since with every launch. And now, towards the end of 2017, Apple will launch the anniversary edition of the iPhone, which will most probably be called either iPhone 8 or iPhone X, as far as rumor has it at least. However, seeing as last year’s initial launch of the iPhone 7 was a disaster (mainly due to the most user-hostile decision of all time, namely taking out the headphone jack), many fear that Apple will try to do something innovative again with the iPhone 8 and fail miserably. This is why the also upcoming launch of the iPhone 7S is the event many users are actually excited for this year. But Why? You might wonder what’s wrong with the iPhone 8. Well, as far as we know, the device will have a curved glass display, and no home button, which means the fingerprint scanner will have to move someplace else. And while Apple has hinted towards a screen-integrated scanner, we all remember what happened before the Samsung Galaxy S8 launch. Thus, many people believe Apple will face the same issue, and will be forced to move the fingerprint scanner to the back of the hone, much to the dismay of many users. On the other hand, the iPhone 7S will be maybe just as good as the iPhone 8 (as it has been the case with many S devices in the past), and for a fraction of the price. With the iPhone 8 already shaping up to a whopping 1000 dollars, maybe it’s best that we wait this one out and go for the iPhone 7S instead.

Published on April 21, 2017. 0 It has not been a secret for some time now that Apple has been firing up the release for their new iMac 2017 sometime this year. The company has somewhat indirectly announced a few weeks ago when it had an interview with a group of tech journalists. Subsequently, new reports seem to be confirming that the new iMacs will entering production quite soon. Reports regarding the iMac Reports from Digitimes, Apple has already sent orders for the new iMacs to be made available sometime this year. Similar to older models, the new devices will be made by Quanta Computer. The exact number of units has not yet been made public, but reports claim that they will enter production sometime around the month of May this year. This would suggest that the desktops will be made available for purchases around the same time Apple will be announcing the iPhone 7 upgrade in the month of September. Specifications It is believed that the new iMacs will be created for professional users, by being equipped with several server-grade components. Most noticeable of these components is the fact that the processor will be an Intel Xeon E3-1285 v6. Since the processor is of that caliber, the RAM will have to be the ECC variant. This is quite nice to hear as this type of memory is less prone to errors and overall more reliable. On top of this, the AIO models will have a minimum of 16GB of RAM with the possibility to expand to 64GB. Storage technology will also be vastly improved, with the addition of a 2TB NVMe SSD. Apple is quite known for its use of NVMe storage for quite a while now thanks to its superior writing and reading speeds. This would suggest that they are trying to remove entirely the older types of drives and making their iMac storages completely formed out of NVMe storage solutions.

The company has recently been focusing on renewable energy and eco-friendly solutions for creating high tech gadgets as part of its Earth Day 2017 initiative. Recently, it had launched an iPhone Red to support HIV/AIDS programs and now at its annual environmental responsibility report, Apple has decided to up the game even further by saying that  it soon wants to end mining of materials needed in making an iPhone. With a simple goal of avoiding massive draining of resources, the company now emphasises on using recycled materials rather than mining natural resources to cater to the rising demand. "We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material," said the company. Apple has already set the wheels in motion to achieve its eco-friendly goals within the 2020 deadline. The report notes that seven of its major suppliers have also pledged their allegiance to the goal and have promised to power their Apple production entirely with renewable energy by the end of next year. Apple cited that over 99% of the packaging material used were recycled or obtained from sources that were responsibly managed. Apple reported that its carbon footprint in 2016 was 29.5 million metric tonnes, which was significantly lower compared to 38.4 million metric tonnes that they had racked up last year.

While the Tame Apple Press has been singing praises of Apple’s environmental record based on the report it is choosing to ignore some very important environmental misses. While Apple said that its aim is to make iPhones and computers entirely out of recycled materials by putting pressure on the recycling industry to innovate, that is mostly a moonshot plan and not as important as Jobs’ Mob actually doing something itself. The most important is Apple’s current practices prevent recyclers from doing the most environmentally friendly thing they could to salvage phones and computers from the scrap heap and reuse them. Apple rejects current industry best practices by forcing the recyclers it works with to shred iPhones and MacBooks so they cannot be repaired or reused — instead, they are turned into tiny shards of metal and glass. After sorting, the materials are sold and used for production stock in new products. No reuse. No parts harvesting. No resale. While this is great for Jobs’ Mob, it means that users are forced to buy new gear, which places a strain on the environment.

And the numbers are finally in. While the Samsung Galaxy S8’s Qualcomm variant did not fair too well against the mighty iPhone 7 Plus, we did have our hopes high, that may the Exynos variant (made by Samsung) would fair better, since it’s newer. Turns out the Samsung Galaxy S8’s (SM-G950F) Exynos variant in our testing showed scores that were similar to its Qualcomm-enabled sibling — the Snapdragon 835 — and could not defeat the 6 month-old Apple iPhone 7 Plus, except in one test. Before we go ahead with the benchmarks comparison, we would like to inform our readers that benchmark comparisons we conduct are only to test the capability of the smartphone’s hardware and are in no way an indicator of everyday performance which will vary as per usage. These numbers should not be taken as the final verdict on any device. We observed Samsung’s Exynos 8895 chipset inside the Galaxy S8 that we have received for review, shows a minimal performance difference between the Snapdragon 835 model. While the numbers are higher than the previous 2015 iPhone 6s Plus model and the Snapdragon 835 variant of the S8, they just could not keep up with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which was launched six months ago. Benchmark Samsung Galaxy S8 (SM-G950F) Apple iPhone 7 Plus Apple iPhone 6s Plus AnTuTu 3D 174480 187388 125319 Geekbench 4 Single 2020 3513 2559 Multi 6730 5944 4438 Compute 8074 12052 9944 3D Mark (Ice Storm) Ice Storm Unlimited 31660 37529 29532 3D Mark (Sling Shot) Sling Shot Extreme 3212 2000 1510 The above scores are just an indicator of raw performance and not everyday usability. Every handset was benchmarked in our office. Scores marked in bold are the highest on the table. Looking at the scores above, its easy to conclude that the Apple iPhone 7 Plus with its A10 Fusion chipset (which is 7 months old now) still runs circles around Samsung’s top-of-the-line Exynos 8895 chipset. One detail to note, is that the Galaxy S8’s Exynos chip did do better when it came to the multi-core Geekbench 4 scores and the Sling Shot Extreme test by delivering higher framerates overall. Now that both the Exynos and Snapdragon variants of the Samsung Galaxy S8 have been benchmarked, it really got us thinking as to what Apple will have in store in its upcoming iPhones 7s, 7s Plus and the exotic iPhone 8/X in September.
