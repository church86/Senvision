Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 12, 2016 at 6:45PM The Mac isn't doing so hot right now. Image source: Apple. The latest estimates are out on the state of the PC market. Spoiler alert: The market is still stagnant. Both Gartner and IDC have put out their most recent best guesses, and global shipments fell either 3.9% or 5.7%, depending on who you ask. This isn't surprising considering the age and maturity of the global PC market. I generally prefer IDC's numbers, so let's see what the market researcher has to say. Vendor Q3 2016 Worldwide Units Growth (YOY) Lenovo 14.5 million (3.2%) HP Inc. 14.4 million 3.3% Dell 10.8 million 6.2% Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 5 million (13%) ASUS 4.7 million 5.2% Others 18.6 million (13.2%) Total 68 million (3.9%) Data source: IDC. Figures may not sum due to rounding. YOY = year over year. Lenovo remains the market leader, and the rest of the usual suspects are there. However, there is an important trend worth discussing: Apple got crushed...again. Do you see what happens when you don't refresh the Mac lineup? Do you see what happens? For many years, Apple enjoyed touting that it was continuously gaining share each quarter, as Mac unit volumes outperformed the broader market. The Mac either grew more, or declined by less, implying share gains. This is now the second consecutive quarter where the Mac underperformed the broader market, implying share losses. In Q2, Apple's unit volumes fell 8.3%, compared to the broader market's 4.5% decline, according to IDC. For what it's worth, Apple's official reported numbers show its Mac units fell 11% in the second quarter. Apple's Mac lineup has become stale, though, with the expected result of cooling demand. Some Macs haven't been updated in years, and the ones that have been updated recently don't have the latest and greatest Intel processors. The 27-inch iMac 5K is the only Mac with Skylake chips, a chip family that was launched in 2015. The good news is that Apple is widely expected to be launching new Macs in just a matter of weeks, which will likely bring its computers up to speed. Hopefully, demand will pick back up if and when that happens. Responding to a customer email last month, CEO Tim Cook said to "stay tuned." We're also seeing Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continue to make inroads in the educational market. IDC notes that Chromebooks expectedly had another "banner quarter in the K-12 market" (Gartner's figures do not include Chromebooks). Of course, Apple also addresses the educational market with iPads as well as Macs, but neither can compete with Chromebooks on price. The expected October event can't come soon enough -- and it'll be just in time for the holiday shopping season.

LATEST VIDEOS More Videos: Rates from Bankrate.com Mortgage Credit Cards Auto Amazon launches for-pay streaming music service 10/12/2016 - 6:47 PM EDT NEW YORK >> Amazon is launching a paid streaming music service, the latest entry in an increasingly crowded field. Amazon Music Unlimited is being positioned to compete against existing services such as Spotify and Apple Music. It will cost $8 per month, or $80 a year, for members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime loyalty program. Non-Prime members will pay $10 a month, the same monthly fee charged by Spotify and Apple Music. Owners of Amazon's Echo smart speaker, meanwhile, will be able to get the unlimited music service on one device for $4 per month. More Headlines Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election Disney embraces streaming as ratings sag Macy's says clothing sales strong, gives better outlook Little People, Dungeons & Dragons top Toy Hall of Fame class Stocks mixed as investors seek clarity on Trump policies The steaming service is one more perk -- like two-day free shipping and Amazon Video -- that the Seattle-based company hopes will attract people to its Prime program and thus encourage them to spend more on its flagship site. Amazon already offers Amazon Prime Music for free to Prime members, but that includes about two million songs, while the new service boasts a catalog of "tens of millions" of songs. "Think of this as two different levels: Prime is now the introductory service and Unlimited is the full service," said Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of digital music. The service's launch comes as the way people listen to music is changing. According to Nielsen , during the first half of 2016, digital purchasing of single tracks was down 24 percent and digital albums were down 18 percent, while streaming was up 59 percent, compared with the same period a year ago. "The recorded music industry has been fumbling for a digital business model that really works, and I think streaming has come into its own," said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna. In fact, streaming of audio has eclipsed video streaming, according to Nielsen. Audio's share of streaming is 54 percent as of June 30, compared with 44 percent a year earlier. But it still faces the music industry's problem of low margins, Verna said. "There is definitely room to grow the pie simply because more and more music consumers are choosing this way of accessing their music," he said. "But the potential rewards are not huge and infinite, they're sort of modest and there are already quite a few players in the space." Most streaming services now offer similar catalogues of music and pricing is about the same. So services have differentiated by user interface, Verna said. One way Amazon is hoping to stand out is with its Alexa voice control, via the Echo or other Alexa-enabled devices. Users can ask the Echo to play a certain song or playlist, but can also search for music just by saying they want to hear the "new" song by any artist, a genre of music from a certain decade, or by saying the lyrics of a song if they can't remember the name. 1 2 next  last »
TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud Reviews MacBook review MacBook review By Kane Fulton Laptops and netbooks  Apple's rosier MacBook brings nippier performance Shares 1. Introduction 2. Specifications and features 3. Performance and benchmarks 4. Verdict Recommended Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict Apple has given the MacBook's performance a much-needed boost, and it helps OS X zip along much better. Its critical flaws remain, but the 2016 version is less of a risk than it was last year. We just wish it was a bit cheaper. For Gorgeous Rose Gold color Improved performance Terrific design Great speakers Against Single USB-C port No price cut? Controversial keyboard Did you buy the 12-inch MacBook? I did, but not because I wanted one. No: the laptop I really wanted was a new MacBook Air, or even a redesigned 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro with a sleeker chassis. Of course, neither came. And like many other Air fans, I realised that another year was to pass by without Apple's best laptop getting an upgrade. So I bought the next best thing. The MacBook is all about compromise. With more pixels than the Air, its display allows me to be more productive on the move and slinging it into a backpack almost feels like cheating. While no powerhouse (editing 4K images on it is slightly painful), it handles basic tasks with ease. One year later, Apple has refreshed the MacBook with Intel's sixth-generation Skylake processors while introducing faster storage, memory and graphics for the same price. The most interesting change is on the outside: a new Rose Gold finish that genuinely makes me consider owning a shiny pink laptop for the first time. Gender stereotypes be damned. But despite its upgrades, the new MacBook is not the MacBook Air replacement that rumors once again predict will arrive this summer - it's the same unique, dazzling and challenging laptop as the one that launched one year ago. Only faster, and with longer-lasting battery life. A new processor, coupled with faster internal storage, memory and graphics has brought tangible improvements to the MacBook's performance. You'll still have to somehow manage with a single USB-C port, bolting on adapters and connectors to equip your FrankenMac with vital extra limbs. And if you didn't get on with its super-shallow keyboard, your fingers will remain as unconvinced as they were before - especially during long typing sessions. The MacBook brings more megahertz, and I'm not talking about clock speed. Recent developments Since Apple introduced the Rose Gold-tinted MacBook earlier this year, macOS 10.12 Sierra has shaken the featherlight laptop to its core. Featured as an automatic download, the operating system introduces Siri to Mac for the first time ever as well as Auto Unlock, which allows users to log in using a tethered Apple Watch.  See how the MacBook compares to Microsoft's Surface Book Moreover, rumors of a MacBook 2017 have already begun to circulate. Several patents have suggested, for instance, there may be a future MacBook refresh featuring mobile LTE connectivity. That being said, many patents don’t see the light of day beyond initial filing. Meanwhile, the latest round of MacBook Pros has made this fantasy of fingerprint authentication a reality, thanks to the onboard Touch Bar in certain models. And, as Jony Ive has promptly declared, these are only the first steps in Apple's new direction. Big money Mac Some people expected Apple to discount its refreshed MacBook to sweeten the deal. It didn't. The entry-level model still costs £1,049 ($1,299 or AUS$1,999), around $50/$73/AUS$99 more than the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro. If the cost remains too high for you, then consider picking up last year's version from Apple's refurb store. While the 2016 refresh is technically the better machine, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two when undertaking low-level tasks such as surfing the web or typing up documents in Pages. At the time of writing, the entry-level version is on there for £749 (around $1,108 or AUS$1,457) alongside eight other models of varying specs and price.

Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 739.01 -3.37 -0.45% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 108.43 +0.64 +0.59% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 59.02 +0.32 +0.55% Intel Corp INTC ▲ 34.61 +0.11 +0.32% What it hasn’t delivered are many jobs. Google’s Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. had at the end of last year a total of 74,505 employees, about one-third fewer than Microsoft Corp. even though their combined stock-market value is twice as big. Photo-sharing service Instagram had 13 employees when it was acquired for $1 billion by Facebook in 2012. Hiring in the computer and chip sectors dove after companies shifted hardware production outside the U.S., and the newest tech giants needed relatively few workers. The number of technology startups fizzled. Growth in productivity and wages slowed, and income inequality rose as machines replaced routine, low- and middle-income, human-powered work. This outcome is a far cry from what many political leaders, tech entrepreneurs and economists predicted about a generation ago. In 2000, President Bill Clinton said in his last State of the Union address: “America will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology.” His economic team trumpeted “the ferment of rapid technological change” as one of the U.S. economy’s “principal engines” of growth. The gap between what the tech boom promised and then delivered is another source of the rumbling national discontent that powered the rise this year of political outsiders Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. The tech-powered disappointment is subtler than the anger caused by the crushing impact of China’s import invasion and the perceived failures of government institutions like the Federal Reserve in guiding the economy. Instead, it stems from the idea that Americans expected larger economic gains from these amazing new machines and the companies that created them, not a widening between the haves and have-nots. “There is a growing sense of frustration that people haven’t seen the progress that their parents and grandparents did,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist whose work has chronicled how technology widens the income gap between rich and poor. “That frustration spills into the political arena.” In 1997, Time magazine named computer-chip maker Intel Corp.’s chief executive, Andrew S. Grove, who died in March 2016, as “Man of the Year.” Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos won in 1999. Companies spent billions of dollars reprogramming their computers for the Year 2000 bug, and profitless dot-com startups won giant valuations from optimistic investors.© David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News The bursting of the dot-com bubble in early 2000, the recession in 2001 and deepening globalization proved to be turning points for the tech economy and its broader impact on American prosperity. U.S. tech companies accelerated the reshuffling of their supply networks to China and elsewhere in Asia, places filled with growth potential and cheap labor. Hardware makers concentrated production overseas to supply U.S. and foreign computer makers. After rising through the 1990s, total employment at computer and electronic firms in the U.S. sank to 1.03 million in August 2016 from 1.87 million in 2001, according to Labor Department statistics. Employment at semiconductor makers fell by half to 359,000 in the same period. In the 1990s, Micron Technology Inc. was a successful example of how far the tech industry reached beyond its nexus in Silicon Valley. Based in Boise, Idaho, Micron was founded by Idaho farmers and businessmen, including the late billionaire J.R. Simplot, who supplied McDonald’s Corp. with most of its frozen french fries and had “MR SPUD” license plates on his pickup truck. Micron’s workforce quadrupled to 18,800 between 1994 and 2000, with the growth overwhelmingly in the U.S. The company fought with Japan in the 1980s to restrict imported memory chips and protect its U.S. base. These days, Micron is a case study in how technology companies have exported jobs to other countries. As of 2013, the most recently disclosed data, Micron had 11,300 workers in the U.S., down from 14,000 in 2000. The company’s non-U.S. workforce surged to 19,600, mainly in China and other Asian nations, from 4,800. Securities filings show that the percentage of employees at Micron who were in the U.S. shrank to 37% from 74% in the same period. The company stopped disclosing the annual percentage in 2014. A Micron spokesman says much of the growth outside the U.S. came from acquisitions. “What we’re doing is replacing more resources there to support the growing customer base—both the multinationals that are leveraging the low labor-cost areas in China, in particular, as well as the indigenous Chinese manufacturers,” Mike Sadler, Micron’s head of sales, told analysts in 2014. He is now Micron’s strategic chief. The Semiconductor Industry Association says semiconductors remain a big U.S. business and are America’s third-largest export, trailing cars and aircraft. Apple Inc. followed a similar path. Co-founder Steve Jobs made it a mission early in his Apple career and after creating NeXT Inc., another computer maker, to revitalize U.S. manufacturing. Macintosh computers rolled off the line at an Apple factory “like a Holiday Inn toaster turns out toasted bagels,” says Brent Schlender, who co-wrote a biography of Mr. Jobs. By the time Mr. Jobs died in 2011, Apple made nearly every one of its products outside America, largely in Asia. Apple halted U.S. manufacturing in 2004 and didn’t resume until 2013, when it began producing Mac Pro personal computers in Austin, Texas. Apple says it employs about 80,000 workers in the U.S., or two-thirds of the company’s overall workforce. About half the U.S. employees have retail jobs. An Apple spokeswoman says it is “creating jobs in new industries like the App Economy,” or apps developed for the iPhone, and is “a major contributor to U.S. manufacturing” by buying American-made components and materials. Mr. Schlender, the Jobs biographer, says it made sense to assemble the iPod outside the U.S. when production began in 2001. “The components were hard to make, and putting them together was a labor-intensive job because everything was so small,” he says. “You had to piece it together by hand.” The computer-hardware exodus spread. International Business Machines Corp., the company that turned computers into a big business, was born in Endicott, N.Y., and built its first factories there. From 2001 to 2015, though, employment in computer and electronics manufacturing in surrounding Broome County fell about two-thirds to 3,055 jobs. Warehouses and transportation companies scooped up some laid-off workers at salaries of less than half those paid in high-tech manufacturing, says Christian Harris, an analyst for the New York State Department of Labor. American tech workers are getting a smaller piece of the economic pie created from what they produce. As of 2014, employee compensation in computer and electronic-parts making was equal to 49% of the value of the industry’s output, down from 79% in 1999, according to the Commerce Department. While other tech jobs have been created in sectors such as software publishing, that growth is smaller than the losses in tech manufacturing. Since 2002, the number of technology startups has slowed, hurting job creation. In a 2014 study, economists Javier Miranda, John Haltiwanger and Ian Hathaway said the growth of tech startups accelerated to 113,000 in 2001 from 64,000 in 1992. That number slumped to 79,000 in 2011 and hasn’t recovered, according to the economists’ calculations using updated data. The causes include global competition and increased domestic regulation, says Mr. Haltiwanger, an economics professor at the University of Maryland. Another problem is that fewer tech companies have gone public, which can enrich early employees and spawn more jobs as companies grow. Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida’s Warrington College of Business, says there were 548 initial public offerings of technology-related companies from 2001 to 2015. From 1990 to 2000, by contrast, 1,853 went public. The latest generation of hot tech startups has attracted a mountain of venture-capital funding and gigantic valuations, led by Uber Technologies Inc., which was worth $68 billion as of June. The influx of wealth has created more prosperity in Silicon Valley but exemplifies the economic polarization rippling through America. WhatsApp had more than 450 million users world-wide when Facebook bought the messaging service for $19 billion in 2014, turning founder Jan Koum into a billionaire several times over. At the time of the acquisition, WhatsApp had 55 employees. Economists call the phenomenon “skill-biased technical change.” The spoils of growth go to those few people with skills and luck and who are best positioned to take advantage of new technology. The five largest U.S.-based technology companies by stock-market value—Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Oracle Corp.—are worth a combined $1.8 trillion today. That is 80% more than the five largest tech companies in 2000. Today’s five giants have 22% fewer workers than their predecessors, or a total of 434,505 as of last year, compared with 556,523 at Cisco Systems Inc., Intel, IBM, Oracle and Microsoft in 2000. Amazon uses 45,000 small robots at about one-third of its U.S. warehouses to automate order processing. The robots look like bread boxes on wheels, lifting modular shelves stuffed with products and carrying the shelves to workers who pick out pieces. An Amazon spokesman says the company has added about 200,000 employees since it began using the robots in early 2012. Amazon has 268,000 employees world-wide. Robots aren’t dexterous enough yet to identify different sized-packages, pick the right ones and place them safely in boxes, says Mr. Brynjolfsson, the MIT economist. That is the fundamental skill in warehousing. Researchers now are trying to automate that part of the job, too. In coming decades, machines are likely to replace new forms of routine work done by humans. From 1991 to 2001, the number of secretaries declined about 35%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of textile and apparel workers fell 37%. For a long time, those with bachelor’s degrees in science seemed to be safe from automation-related layoffs because their cognitive knowledge was tough for computers to duplicate. Less-educated workers who dispense personal service, such as home health aides or masseuses, also seemed safe. Harvard University economist David Deming estimates that the hollowing-out of work spread to programmers, librarians and engineers between 2000 and 2012. As much as $2 trillion worth of human economic activity could be automated away using existing technologies, such as Amazon’s robots, in coming years, consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates. Knightscope Inc., based in Mountain View, Calif., makes robots that serve as night watchmen. About three dozen are on patrol, including at shopping malls, corporate campuses such as Microsoft’s in Mountain View and the new home arena of the Sacramento Kings. Knightscope clients pay $7 an hour per robot. “Robots don’t complain,” says Stacy Stephens, a Knightscope co-founder and vice president of marketing and sales. “There’s no pension. And there’s no worker’s comp,” he adds.

They don't have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called "machine learning" to organize your pictures and video " and along the way, help you rediscover last year's vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple's tools are part of last month's iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories " and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here's a look at how they take you down memory lane: ___ APPLE'S MEMORIES Apple's new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn't just a slideshow. There's slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you're ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file " so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple's app created a "Florida to Illinois" package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a "Together" package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an "At The Beach" package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to "Related." You can also add or delete images within Memories " in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Continued below. Related Content Kiwi workers prefer a dress code Cartoon: Labour's Auckland light rail plan Land War remembrance will be 'major national event', says Te Ururoa Flavell Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let's face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren't necessarily ones I'd choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they're presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually ... someday. ___ GOOGLE'S ASSISTANT Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image . Unlike typical "GIF" animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady " without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google's Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation " although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn't require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google's choices aren't necessarily ones I'd make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called "Rediscover this day." Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you'll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. ___ SEARCHING Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple's version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. ___ STORAGE To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you're online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition " good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple's iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos. ___ Online: Apple Memories video from January trip: https://youtu.be/dkm99o8tL88 Google animation of fountains: https://goo.gl/photos/p1iL9STfCmqhxxGx6 Google collage: https://goo.gl/photos/zkn1ZcLAPTqRQoJh7 AP This story has been automatically published from the Associated Press wire which uses US spellings Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) FILE - In this Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, file photo, Brian Rakowski, Google vice president of product management, talks about the camera in the new Google Pixel phone during a product event, in San Francisco. Apple and Google are both applying machine learning to organize your pictures and video, and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (3) New York • If you're like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you've posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don't have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called "machine learning" to organize your pictures and video — and along the way, help you rediscover last year's vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple's tools are part of last month's iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories — and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Here's a look at how they take you down memory lane: ——— APPLE'S MEMORIES Apple's new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn't just a slideshow. There's slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you're ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file — so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple's app created a "Florida to Illinois" package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a "Together" package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an "At The Beach" package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to "Related." You can also add or delete images within Memories — in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let's face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren't necessarily ones I'd choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they're presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually ... someday. ——— GOOGLE'S ASSISTANT Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image . Unlike typical "GIF" animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady — without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google's Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation — although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn't require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots.

The behavior was discovered by at the Carindale Apple Store after an employee caught a technician looking through a customer's iPhone in the repair room. In the biggest scandal to hit the technology giant in Australia, The Courier-Mail can reveal that more than 100 close-up and explicit photos were taken of female staff and customers without their knowledge and photographs were also lifted from some Apple customers' phones. The victims' pictures were then shared with employees at other Queensland stores to receive a ranking out of 10.Apple has reportedly brought in an HR executive from "overseas" to "manage the fallout," but has not yet let employees and customers know who was involved in the breach. Apple confirmed in a statement that the Carindale store is under investigation. "Apple believes in treating everyone equally and with respect, and we do not ­tolerate behaviour that goes against our values," the statement read. "We are investigating a ­violation of Apple's business conduct policy at our store in Carindale, where several employees have already been terminated as a result of our findings."According to The Courier Mail, four male employees have been let go from the Carindale store as Apple continues to investigate the incident. Update: On Thursday Apple released a statement, which reads: "Based on our investigation thus far, we have seen no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees. We have met with our store team to let them know about the investigation and inform them about the steps Apple is taking to protect their privacy." Note: Due to the political nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Politics, Religion, Social Issues forum.

Rating: 7 Votes Analog Kid 5 weeks ago I think it's absurd that the Apple Store asks for your password. Brought an iPhone in and when they told me they needed my passcode, I told them I'd just wait in the store and made them bring me the device every time they needed to unlock it. Brought a MBP in for an overnight repair, and when they told me they needed an administrator password, I created a new account, deleted all of the others and then made them wait while I did a "overwrite empty space" on the drive. She looked at me with alarm, and I just said "this is what backups are for". I've sent feedback to Apple on this, and it's the only comment I've sent directly to Tim Cook's email. Maybe this story will get some other people to do the same.

Define your site main menu How to Delete WD SmartWare Western Digital (WD) Portable Hard Drives are capable of storing quite a bit of information. Modern Western Digital drives come with a firmware called “SmartWare,” which can be useful to some users. The SmartWare can provide backup solutions that may not be available with the operating system in use. WD hard drives with SmartWare also have some utilities that some users will find useful if their computer can support them. The WD SmartWare may also be useless to some users who may want to remove it. The most common reasons for removing SmartWare are: Storage Capacity – A hard drive that has SmartWare on it no longer has full storage capacity. The software is located on a hidden drive partition, which removes a reasonable amount of storage capacity. Therefore, less than a gigabyte to more than a few gigabytes are missing on the main partition due to the hidden partition and software that are included. Virtual Drive Appearance – The virtual drive loads onto both Windows and Apple computers’ desktops. Linux based systems can also see the partition, but cannot make changes to the partition due to the drive’s onboard hardware. The drive may be an eyesore for those who keep the hard drive loaded on their system and it normally cannot be removed easily. Resource Usage – When the SmartWare is loaded, it takes up a sizable portion of the computer’s resources. Memory and CPU use can easily be overwhelmed when the SmartWare  is on the WD drive. Removing the WD SmartWare prevents these resources from being consumed while the drive is connected to the system. Removing the SmartWare from the Desktop Note: This method does not delete the SmartWare from the WD drive, but simply prevents it from loading. This process will not regain lost storage on the disk and simply makes the partition and the virtual drive that loads from it disappear. The virtual disk will no longer load when the drive is connected. Disabling the Virtual Drive in Windows This process is meant for Microsoft Windows OS users. Navigate to the machine’s Device Manager. In order to access the Device Manager, head to the Start Menu through the Task Bar and click “Control Panel.” Select “Hardware,” then select the Device Manager from the available list. Windows Vista or Windows 7 users should type in “Device Manager” in the search bar on the start menu and wait for the option to load. Clicking “Device Manager” will open it directly. Another way to do this directly is to open a run prompt by holding down the “Windows” key on the keyboard and pressing “R.” Type “devmgmt.msc” in the run prompt and select “OK” to run the direct process for the Device Manager. Once in the Device Manager, look at the list of devices. Click the “+” sign to open up the list of CD/DVD drives that are installed on the system. Right click “WD Virtual CD XXXX USB Device” (where XXXX is a number assigned to the drive) and select the option to disable the drive. This disables the Virtual Drive. If the drive is connected to another PC or compatible computer, the WD SmartWare virtual disk will still show up unless the process is repeated on that computer. Disabling the Virtual Drive in Apple Computers The process is different for Apple computers and must be built into an AppleScript, which automatically ejects the WD SmartWare upon startup. Note: This will not remove the SmartWare, but tells the drive to eject and prevents it from being seen from the desktop. Within the AppleScript Editor, it is easy to create a script that automatically takes the VCD down. The AppleScript: ScriptEditor.app is located in the Applications folder and displays an editable text field when opened. Type or copy the following commands into the app: tell application “Finder” activate try eject disk “WD SmartWare” end try end tell Running this script and keeping it active helps to prevent the WD SmartWare software from loading the VCD on the desktop. Simply compile the script so that it can be loaded again without having to rewrite it each time. Updating the Firmware Updating the firmware does not remove the virtual drive or partition, it simply prevents it from appearing. The firmware for the specific WD drive product being updated is available directly from Western Digital. The firmware update for the WD Drive can be found at: http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/wdsmartwareupdate/ How to Update the Firmware for the WD SmartWare Drive Backup the data on the drive (if necessary) before proceeding. Download and install the latest SmartWare for the appropriate WD drive. The update process will go through and ask the user to power cycle the drive. Launch the WD SmartWare once the drive has finished power cycling. Select the “Settings” Tab then “Set Up Drive.” Select the Virtual CD Button on the left portion of the application. Select the option to disable the radial button between “Enable VCD” and “Disable VCD” that is located on the right portion of the screen, then click “Apply VCD Settings.” Safely eject the drive then disconnect it from the computer and the power source (if included). Reconnect the cable(s) after 10 seconds elapse. From this point on, the VCD will no longer load from the drive in Windows. This process is similar for Apple computers. True WD SmartWare Removal Note: The following is only possible with a Windows machine that can run the HP USB Disk Format Tool. The tool is available at: http://files.extremeoverclocking.com/file.php?f=197 http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,64963-order,4-c,peripherals/description.html http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Hard-Disk-Utils/HP-USB-Disk-Storage-Format-Tool.shtml The process to remove the WD SmartWare partition is as follows: Backup data on the computer beforehand. Load the HP USB Disk Format Tool and select the WD drive from the list of available options. Be sure to choose the correct disk so as to avoid losing the data on other drives. Once the appropriate WD drive is selected, choose the file system to be used. Input the drive’s Volume Label (if any). Select “Quick Format” and deselect “Enable Compression” and “Create a DOS Startup Disk.” Once that is done, select the “Start” button. The program will warn that all of the data on the drive will be lost on the WD drive if formatting is done and will ask to confirm the process. Select “Yes” and another dialog box with information about the drive will be shown once the formatting is complete. The result of this process is a singular drive without the unnecessary partition of the WD SmartWare. The drive will not load the VCD because it no longer exists. Formatting the drive with the appropriate File System during the process allows the drive to be used with whichever OS the user chooses. For instance, Windows Operating Systems can readily read and write NTFS, but Apple and Linux/Unix systems can only read it. Windows, Apple, and Linux/Unix systems can read and write the FAT32 option. It is possible to format other options that are OS specific with another formatting utility after initially formatting the drive with the HP USB Disk Format Tool. Follow Us!

Rohan Is this process of removing permanently with hp tool is reversible? Joe Sorry to disappoint you but the HP Format Tool does not remove the Smartware firmware. The confusion is that WD has changed the hardware last year but has kept the model numbers the same.  In the old models the virtual CD shows up right away and the Smartware software is in a part of the disk beyond the “maximum capacity” of the disk given by the disk’s ROM.  The HP tool does not reach this area and I am not sure if any tool will.  In the newer models, the virtual CD does not show up until you try to lock the drive.  In this case the Smartware software is in the regular part of the disk and can be deleted by reformatting. In neither case will you be able to delete the actual firmware and the most you can do is hide the virtual CD so it doesn’t mount.  However the firmware is still active and will interfere with booting from the disk and in some cases, depending on the computer’s BIOS, even booting from the internal hard drive. (In the latter case, you are supposed to plug in the WD drive after you have booted). anna Hi,  sorry I am probably totally ignorant, but I just bought a WD passport 1tb 3.0 usb and would simply like to put my movies and pics on it.   I am installing WD smartware but this forces me to back-up my computer.. when I just want to use my external hard drive as a really big USB stick.. is this even possible?   Can I just drop movies and drag them back on my computer if I feel like it..? hope so, because this whole smartware stuff is totally annoying and time consuming to figure out.. memenode You can. My sister has a WD and if I remember correctly when she plugs it in she gets two virtual disks mounted. One contains the annoying SmartWare stuff and the other is for your actual data. Just try looking for the other one and put your stuff there. Alice I would like to sell my smartware but it has some of my infor. on it.  How do I empty it so the new owner starts out fresh with it empty? Thanks  Deborah Loth Unfortunately as we approach 2016 I find that WD has sent me a warranty replacement drive (for a drive that was less than a year old) which has this annoying WD Unlocker VCD drive baked in. Your HP Format Tool most certainly does not remove the VCD. It only renders the rest of the drive unreadable on a Windoze machine. My main computer is a Mac, and none of the WD tools, from firmware updaters to Smartware to VCD removers won’t run on the current operating system. This is ridiculous.

BMW’s G30 5 Series debuts wireless Apple CarPlay integration, which eliminates the use of a cable. If you’re anything like this writer, with a ritualistic phone charging routine, this will be a godsend. Originally, Apple CarPlay could only work over a wired ‘Lightning’ USB connection, due to concerns over battery life and the data bandwidth required by the Bluetooth protocol. Additionally, CarPlay now supports vehicle manufacturer produced applications, which allow the user to control certain aspects of the car without leaving the CarPlay interface. This feature has begun to appear in the vehicles of other brands, in recent months. High-resolutions screens, like the 10.25-inch display in the new 5 Series, also benefit from changes to the protocol CarPlay uses, now supporting greater screen resolution mirroring, along with modification to screen display ratios. Note: image at top of article is a CarAdvice mock. An official image of CarPlay operating within BMW iDrive is still to be revealed. The changes officially made their way through to developers with the introduction of iOS 9, the 5 Series being the first production vehicle with the wireless CarPlay technology. Wireless CarPlay tech is backwards compatible all the way through to iPhone 4S users. And, while it’s not a first for a production vehicle, the 5 Series also features wireless phone charging and Android Auto. CarAdvice will bring you a video demonstration of wireless Apple CarPlay when we get up close and personal with the G30 5 Series.

Apple Pay will be available to customers with a Visa Debit or personal ANZ Visa credit card. ANZ CEO New Zealand David Hisco said: “More than 50 per cent of ANZ Visa transactions are contactless and this number is steadily increasing as more retailers adopt contactless technology. Adding Apple Pay to our mobile payment offering will make it fast and convenient for more customers to securely make every day purchases wherever there is a contactless terminal.” “Following on from our highly successful goMoney mobile banking app, ANZ is pleased to continue leading the industry with innovative solutions for customers.” Security and privacy is at the core of Apple Pay. When you use a credit or debit card with Apple Pay, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is authorised with a one-time unique dynamic security code. ANZ New Zealand Head of Digital and Transformation Liz Maguire said: “Our customers asked us for Apple Pay and we’re thrilled they can now use it, continuing our commitment to giving our customers innovative digital ways to do their banking. We’re confident they will enjoy this easy, simple and secure way to pay without having to present cards or cash.” Apple Pay can be used anywhere you can tap and pay in New Zealand, including at major retailers: BP, The Warehouse, Warehouse Stationery, Noel Leeming, Torpedo 7, McDonalds, Domino’s Pizza and Burger King. Apple Pay is easy to set up and users will continue to receive all of the rewards and benets offered by credit and debit cards. In stores, Apple Pay works with iPhone SE, iPhone 6 and later, and Apple Watch. Online shopping in apps and on websites accepting Apple Pay is as simple as the touch of a finger with Touch ID, so there’s no need to manually fill out lengthy account forms or repeatedly type in shipping and billing information. When paying for goods and services on the go in apps or Safari, Apple Pay works with iPhone 6 and later, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3 and later. You can also use Apple Pay in Safari on any Mac introduced in or after 2012 running macOS Sierra and confirm the payment with iPhone 6 or later or Apple Watch.

Monday, November 14, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Samsung stumble opens opportunity for rivals October 13, 2016, Thursday PARIS: Smartphone customers losing faith in Samsung have plenty of choice at a time when Apple, Google and China’s Huawei are each pushing new models that up the features ante and do not self-combust. “All of Samsung’s competitors are rubbing their hands in glee,” said Thomas Husson, an analyst with the Forrester technology research and consultancy firm. “It’s basically a good product, released at the right time, but a slip-up, and we’ve seen in the past with Nokia or Blackberry that these can have disastrous effects,” he added. While it is too early to predict a similar disappearance from the phone market of the South Korean company, rivals are nipping at the heels of the market leader. These include not only Apple and Chinese companies like Huawei, but also internet titan Google, which entered the smartphone market last week with its own device – the Pixel. “There will inevitably be some moderate-to-marginal benefit for Samsung’s handset rivals, more particularly Apple, perhaps faster-growing Huawei can benefit more from Samsung’s Note 7 travails,” said analyst Ken Odeluga at the online trading firm City Index. However Ian Fogg, senior director and head of the mobile and telecoms team at the IHS technology consultancy, said that “Huawei will be the biggest beneficiary from brand damage to Samsung.” One of the largest providers of network infrastructure globally, Huawei has been pushing into the smartphone market, including the top-end segment with its P9 model that features a camera with two Leica lenses. “Huawei will look to pick up sales right across its portfolio,” said Fogg, noting that Huawei was already the third-largest smartphone maker. “Like Samsung, it uses Android and offers smartphones at a wide range of prices.” The blow to Samsung is unlikely to be fatal, however. “Competitors might enjoy a short-term boost to sales as a result of a major player having to withdraw its new model, though overall it is likely to remain a competitive market,” said Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown brokerage. Part of the reason is that its competitors have their own challenges to surmount. Huawei, for instance, still needs to build its brand in Europe and North America. Meanwhile Apple needs to recapture the excitement around its products that has disappeared in recent years. Thomas Husson at Forrester believes “it is too early to say what the long-term impact will be” from this incident, although the recall is likely to set it back a considerable amount. Linda Sui, wireless smartphone strategies director at Strategy Analytics, estimated that Samsung could lose “US$10 billion or more” over the recall. “The loss of sales from the Galaxy Note is only the tip of the iceberg,” warned CMCMarkets analyst Jasper Lawler. “Demand for the flagship Galaxy S8, scheduled for release early next year, could be severely impeded by the loss of consumer confidence in the Samsung brand.” But City Index’s Ken Odeluga said that “nobody wants to believe Samsung has ‘lost its touch’ at producing beautiful and advanced consumer technology. “So there is some underlying sentiment that views its problems as the kind of bad luck which could afflict almost any smartphone maker that is pushing boundaries.” But ManMohan Sodhi, a professor of operations and supply chain management at Cass Business School in London believes that it wasn’t bad luck as much as bad judgement. “They should have figured out the product but with Google coming out with the Pixel, they did not give it enough time,” said Sodhi. While Google has developed the Android operating system that powers the smartphones made by Samsung and other manufacturers, except for Apple, it has generally stayed on the sidelines when it comes to handsets. The release of the Pixel, along with its Google Home virtual assistant, indicates that Google aims to get its artificial intelligence technology into the hands and homes of consumers. — AFP What do you think of this story?

They don't have to stay forgotten.  Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called 'machine learning' to organize your pictures and video — and along the way, help you rediscover last year's vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Scroll down for video  This image shows a Google collage generated by machine using images taken on Sept. 13, 2016, in New York, of Binu Paulose playing with a dog. Apple and Google are both applying machine learning to organize your pictures and video. Apple's tools are part of last month's iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories — and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here's a look at how they take you down memory lane: RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Samsung's engineers STILL don't know what causes the firm's... Handle with care! They've been in people's pockets for... How the REAL 'Death Star' was born: Astronomers reveal how... Can the Galaxy S8 save Samsung? Artist's impression reveals... Share this article Share 11 shares APPLE'S MEMORIES  Craig Federighi, Apple senior vice president of software engineering, speaks about Photos in iOS 10 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco. With iOS 10, the Photos app has more options for searching and viewing highlights. Apple's new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party.  Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn't just a slideshow. There's slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you're ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file — so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple's app created a 'Florida to Illinois' package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location.  Apple created a 'Together' package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an 'At The Beach' package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to 'Related.' You can also add or delete images within Memories — in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let's face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time.  The machine-generated selections aren't necessarily ones I'd choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they're presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually ... someday.   GOOGLE'S ASSISTANT Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image . Unlike typical 'GIF' animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady — without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google's Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation — although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn't require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google's choices aren't necessarily ones I'd make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called 'Rediscover this day.' Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you'll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. According to the firm, Google's AI can now describe images with nearly 94 percent accuracy and may even ‘understand’ the context and deeper meaning of a scene. The AI was first trained in 2014, and has steadily improved in the time since SEARCHING Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple's version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. FILE - In this Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, file photo, Brian Rakowski, Google vice president of product management, talks about the camera in the new Google Pixel phone during a product event, in San Francisco. Apple and Google are both applying machine learning to organize your pictures and video, and along the way, help you rediscover last year¿s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) STORAGE To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you're online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition — good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple's iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos.  MICROSOFT'S CAPTION BOT GETS IT HILARIOUSLY WRONG  Microsoft's CaptionBot, which analyzes pictures in order to formulate captions, has been spot on with some results, but horridly wrong for others – it thought the First Lady Michelle Obama was a cell phone. When it was released to the public earlier this year, the program seemed to be accurate with almost all of the images it received.

It was the company's first seven-day win streak since the week ending February 18, 2015, and the stock's upward move had the most positive impact on the Dow and the Nasdaq 100. Its shares are up about 4 percent over the past week. It all comes just a day after Apple's stock hit its 2016 intraday high of $118.69 a share, as rival Samsung cut $2.3 billion off its profit guidance for the third quarter. Samsung officially discontinued one of its premium handsets, the Galaxy Note 7, after it was plagued by reports of batteries catching on fire amid a massive recall. Though the product is only one of many phones made by Samsung, analysts say that Apple stands to gain at least some of the former Note 7 users. Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse, estimates Apple could capture at least half of the volume of Note 7 phones that Samsung was poised to sell. Brian White, a Drexel Hamilton analyst, estimated in a research note that Apple could pick up at least 8 million extra unit sales this calendar year, out of the 10 million to 14 million Galaxy Note 7 phones he expected to be sold in the second half of the year. Samsung said it is working diligently with the appropriate regulatory authorities and that safety remains a top priority for the company. — With reporting by CNBC's Gina Francolla Anita BalakrishnanNews Associate Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change AAPL --- SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Specialized processors might reignite performance scaling, but they’ll also change the nature of computing forever Specialized processors might reignite performance scaling, but they’ll also change the nature of computing forever By Joel Hruska on October 4, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Modern CPU scaling has largely flatlined, thanks to a combination of scaling challenges, intrinsic limits to silicon performance, and a general shift in the market towards lower power devices. Chip designers who want to continue to push the limits of what computers are capable of need to look to specialized architectures and custom designs. That was the message at the Linley Processor Forum according to Linley Gwennap, principle analyst at the Linley Group. Dean Takahashi covered the event for VentureBeat and reports that Linley’s comments dovetail with the industry trends we’ve seen emerging over the last few years. Companies like Nvidia are marketing their chips as ideal for deep learning and AI calculations. Intel purchased the FPGA manufacturer Altera and has built its own specialty coprocessor hardware, dubbed the Xeon Phi. From IBM’s TrueNorth to Qualcomm’s heterogeneous compute capabilities in the Snapdragon 820, a number of companies are attacking performance problems in a wide variety of ways. Self-driving cars, drone deliveries, and even chatbot AI could transform computing as we know it today  — but not without fundamentally changing how we think about computers. Unintended consequences, industry trends, and power consumption For most of the past 40 years, the story of personal computing was, well, personal. Desktops and laptops were positioned as devices that allowed the customer to rip music, explore the Internet, write, work, game, or stay in touch with family and friends. In the beginning, the hardware that enabled many of these functions was mounted in separate expansion slots or installed in co-processor sockets on the motherboard. Over time, these capabilities were either integrated into the motherboard and CPU socket. Channel I/O and FPU coprocessors went away, as did most independent sound cards. Dedicated GPUs have hung on thanks to intrinsic thermal issues, but on-die graphics solutions from AMD and Intel have improved every single year. There was a simple, virtuous cycle at work: The computer industry collectively delivered faster hardware, consumers bought it, and developers took advantage of it. The initial end to CPU clock scaling went nearly unnoticed, thanks to the widespread availability (and superiority) of dual-and-quad-core chips compared with their single-core predecessors. This cycle has been repeated in smartphones and tablets, but we’ve already seen signs that the rate of improvement is slowing. To demonstrate, here’s a graph of Apple iPhone single-core CPU performance in Geekbench 2 and Geekbench 3. We split the data into two sections to capture how the various iDevices compared over time, and to capture the shift from GB2 to GB3 when the latter became available. We’re using Apple because that company has spent more resources on improving its single-core performance than the various Android SoC developers, which tend to prioritize higher core counts. From 2008 to 2012, single-core CPU benchmark scores in Geekbench 2 increased from 141 on the iPhone 3G to 1602 on the iPhone 5. That’s a nearly 12x improvement in just four years. From 2012 to 2016, Apple’s single-threaded CPU performance improved from 699 to 3500. While this still represents excellent scaling, the net improvement is roughly 5x  — less than half the level of scaling we saw from 2008 to 2012. There are a number of reasons for this. Apple’s CPU designs are maturing and process node shrinks often don’t offer the same degree of improvement. But the other explanation is thermal — smartphones and tablets have hard TDP limits that prevent them from scaling upwards indefinitely. The slideshow below steps through some of the major advances in computing from the 1950s through the present day. How cloud computing changes the equation These limitations drive research in two different, seemingly contradictory outcomes. On the one hand, we’ve seen the smartphone industry integrate sophisticated sensors, DSPs, and other specialized co-processors to provide additional functionality without increasing power consumption. At the same time, there’s been a huge push towards the idea of cloud computing. Whether you’re riding in a self-driving car, conversing with a chatbot, or searching the web, companies like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia have been jumping on the specialized processor bandwagon. IBM has TrueNorth, Google has TensorFlow, and we’ve written about other alternative architectures and methods for solving complex problems at multiple points at ET. AMD is the only company that’s really shipped an integrated programmable device with specialized hardware and heterogeneous compute support — and there are no publicly available HSA applications in-market that we’re aware of. As AMD’s issues demonstrate, the problem with pushing specialized new architectures into the consumer market is that there’s little reason for developers to take advantage of them, and therefore little reason for consumers to take interest. This classic chicken-and-egg problem is only worse now that consumers hold on to PC hardware for longer and longer periods of time. If you don’t upgrade, you don’t get the general performance or battery life improvements baked into newer hardware, much less any specialized acceleration equipment. Instead of trying to nudge products out into the market and then encourage broad adoption, Microsoft, Google, and other companies are building their own data centers in-house and applying their own expertise directly to hardware. That’s not to say the trend is entirely in one direction — Microsoft’s HoloLens depends on a custom-built HPU, or Holographic Processor Unit. But hardware like the HPU may be more of an exception than the rule, particularly considering that the device costs $3,000 and is explicitly marketed to developers. Microsoft’s HoloLens. Image by EETimes There are practical advantages to bringing hardware development in-house. It’s much easier for a company to tweak an algorithm or experiment with new features or data analysis when it doesn’t have to worry about pushing that update out to thousands of customers. Desktop PCs and some laptops could handle the heat output from custom microprocessors, but nobody wants an FPGA in a smartphone. Giving the customer what they want means keeping portable devices thin and light, particularly since battery scaling historically hasn’t kept pace with existing computing power. Move those workloads to specialized cloud databases, and you can deliver the services customers want without waiting on developers to take advantage of features. When Microsoft began integrating FPGAs into its data centers, it was able to tweak algorithms constantly rather than trying to push those updates out to consumer hardware or otherwise take advantage of specialized fixed-function hardware. This trend isn’t all upside, at least not if you prefer the existing model that puts premium performance in the hands of individuals who invest a relatively limited amount of money in hardware. By keeping advances in software tied to hardware running in custom data centers, Google, Facebook, and other companies can also keep their algorithms and intelligence proprietary and strictly off-limits. If you want to run an open-source operating system today, there are a wide range of choices with varying degrees of openness, some of which rely on no closed-source code. There’s no real equivalent in the realm of AI — no Cortana or Siri-equivalents, at least not yet (there are some projects underway). The other risk in this kind of model is that it truly makes Internet connectivity essential — and that means it pushes more people towards carrier plans that often have no basis in objective reality when it comes to per-GB costs for data. But it also suggests a future in which computing performance continues to advance, provided certain issues related to network scaling, cost, and availability can be overcome. It could help drive down the long-term cost of computing devices, but the current carriers in the US have data plans that will soak up any one-time savings in long-term fees. Moving away from the personal and into the cloud could restart scaling and allow manufacturers to deliver much faster experiences than they can today. But the hardware that drives said experiences may never be available to common consumers. Whether this is a good thing depends on whether you think widespread availability and low cost were key drivers of the computer revolution or merely temporary factors that are no longer necessary.

Register for an Exam Today> Amazon Launches For-Pay Streaming Music Service By Mae Anderson PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 12 2016 Amazon is launching a paid streaming music service, the latest entry in an increasingly crowded field. Amazon Music Unlimited is being positioned to compete against existing services such as Spotify and Apple Music. It will cost $8 per month, or $80 a year, for members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime loyalty program. Non-Prime members will pay $10 a month, the same monthly fee charged by Spotify and Apple Music. Owners of Amazon's Echo smart speaker [pictured above], meanwhile, will be able to get the unlimited music service on one device for $4 per month. The steaming service is one more perk -- like two-day free shipping and Amazon Video -- that the Seattle-based company hopes will attract people to its Prime program and thus encourage them to spend more on its flagship site. Amazon already offers Amazon Prime Music for free to Prime members, but that includes about two million songs, while the new service boasts a catalog of "tens of millions" of songs. "Think of this as two different levels: Prime is now the introductory service and Unlimited is the full service," said Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of digital music. The service's launch comes as the way people listen to music is changing. According to Nielsen , during the first half of 2016, digital purchasing of single tracks was down 24 percent and digital albums were down 18 percent, while streaming was up 59 percent, compared with the same period a year ago. "The recorded music industry has been fumbling for a digital business model that really works, and I think streaming has come into its own," said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna. In fact, streaming of audio has eclipsed video streaming, according to Nielsen. Audio's share of streaming is 54 percent as of June 30, compared with 44 percent a year earlier. But it still faces the music industry's problem of low margins, Verna said. "There is definitely room to grow the pie simply because more and more music consumers are choosing this way of accessing their music," he said. "But the potential rewards are not huge and infinite, they're sort of modest and there are already quite a few players in the space." Most streaming services now offer similar catalogues of music and pricing is about the same. So services have differentiated by user interface, Verna said. One way Amazon is hoping to stand out is with its Alexa voice control, via the Echo or other Alexa-enabled devices. Users can ask the Echo to play a certain song or playlist, but can also search for music just by saying they want to hear the "new" song by any artist, a genre of music from a certain decade, or by saying the lyrics of a song if they can't remember the name. The service is available starting Wednesday in the U.S. and in the U.K., Germany and Austria this year. © 2016 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Apple Case Written by Charles Duan October 12, 2016 // 03:18 PM EST Copy This URL Tuesday morning, the Supreme Court heard arguments in the long-running smartphone war litigation between Apple and Samsung. The arguments centered on the value of certain iPhone designs—the famous rounded-corner rectangles—that Samsung’s phones used. There has been much commentary on the millions of dollars at stake and the importance of the case. But what hasn’t been said is that the designs can’t be worth much, since hardly anyone uses them anymore. The lawsuit dates back to 2011, when Apple charged Samsung with infringing a number of iPhone design patents. Unlike regular patents, which are granted for inventions, design patents are given for the appearance of useful things like the shape of a piano, the design of a rug, or the contour of a smartphone. So when Samsung was found to have infringed Apple’s rounded-corner patents, Apple demanded all the profits on Samsung’s lookalike phones. Design patents also have an unusual feature that makes them especially valuable compared to other patents. According to a law dating back to 1887, if a court rules that a design patent is infringed by another product, then the infringer must pay not just damages relating to the design, but rather must pay the infringer’s “total profit.” So when Samsung was found to have infringed Apple’s rounded-corner patents, Apple demanded all the profits on Samsung’s lookalike phones—even though many of the profits were based on features of the phones that had nothing to do with the rounded-corner designs. And a federal appeals court agreed, interpreting that 1887 law to require payment of all the profits on “the product as sold,” that is, on the whole phone. At the Supreme Court, everyone—Apple, Samsung, the justices—agreed that the appeals court was wrong, and that the “total profit” award should be limited to what the 1887 law calls the “article of manufacture,” rather than the whole product as sold. In the case of design patents on rounded corners of phones, Samsung argued that only the profits on the front face of the phone casing, not the entire phone, were owed to Apple. So much of the argument revolved around a related question: how does one separate out the profits on the front casing from the profits on the “innards” of the phone? The lawyers offered differing theories, but one particular fact that did not come up in the argument stands out in my mind: the version of the iPhone that was at stake in the case. The lawsuit was filed in 2011, and the patents predated the lawsuit by several years. Those patents dealt with the design of the iPhone 3. A figure from U.S. Design Patent No. D593,087, one of the patents in the lawsuit. Image: United States Patent and Trademarks Office That phone model, of course, is long gone. In 2011 it was replaced with the much more angular iPhone 4. The more curved form factor would not reappear until (arguably) the most recent iteration, the iPhone 7. That the lawsuit was over a long-obsolete iPhone design is important for two reasons. First, it shows how little importance people place on the design of smartphones. Apple spent much of its argument (and the lawsuit) trying to show that the phone design was the primary reason that people chose their phones. But when a radically new design was released, iPhone users did not hold onto their phones because they loved the shape so much; they practically all upgraded to have the latest and greatest features. A study earlier this year found that the iPhone 3 accounted for 0.03 percent—less than one in three thousand—of phones currently in use. Several of the justices noted the oddity of the idea that people buy useful products like phones purely for the design. Much discussion was over a hypothetical design patent on the Volkswagen Beetle, which the attorneys described as an “iconic” car shape. But Justice Alito observed: "I can't get over the thought that nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think, $1800 when it was first sold in the United States? What if it cost $18,000? What if it got 2 miles per gallon? What if it broke down every 50 miles?" Just like cars, people buy phones for the practical features. Indeed, if the design were the only important thing, then people would be perfectly satisfied with the noPhone, a functionless piece of plastic that has the shape of an iPhone. The second reason that the changes in iPhone design are important is that they reflect how the design industry actually works. Even a successful design company like Apple can’t rest on its laurels with a single smartphone shape; it must constantly develop new designs and appearances for its products. That again cuts against the idea that design is all-important to value. How much can a particular phone shape be worth, after all, if that shape is going to be discarded after a year in favor of a new look and feel? In the end, the justices of the Supreme Court looked willing to reject the idea that Apple deserves all the profits on Samsung’s phones, instead opting for an option that would more closely cabin Apple’s design patent infringement award to something reasonable. That is obviously a game changer for the smartphone wars, but it’s also important to the whole technology industry, which depends on balanced patent laws that don’t turn patents on rounded corners into billion-dollar lawsuit tools.

Posted By Philip Montoro on 02.11.13 at 02:00 PM No connection with comedian Redd Foxx should be inferred.Here's a first—I've never reviewed a beer with a twist-off cap before. This post is also the first serious treatment I've given to a product of a big industrial brewer—in this case MillerCoors. I won't pretend to have sought out Redd's Apple Ale. I got a box in the mail at the Reader that was the right size and heft to contain a couple bottles, and because just a few weeks earlier I'd been sent a promotional sampling of Deschutes beers, I opened it pronto. Nothing in the package indicated that Redd's is a MillerCoors product. I began to suspect as much after I passed a bottle around the office and someone said, "Oh yeah, there were a shit-ton of ads for that stuff during the Super Bowl." A quick Internet search revealed that Redd's is already sold in several other countries, including Poland, Russia, Colombia, and South Africa. An article that ran last spring in Advertising Age, prior to a summer 2012 test launch in the southern and southeastern states, described it as "an apple-flavored ale MillerCoors is positioning to compete with flavored malt beverages such as Mike's Hard and Twisted Tea, which [marketing director] Ms. [Sarah] Ross noted do not come in apple flavors." The national U.S. roll-out was earlier this month. Promotional copy that's appeared in many dutiful writeups of the launch describes Redd's as having "low malt and bitterness cues," which is code for "targeting people who don't like beer." I mean, competing with Mike's Hard and Twisted Tea is setting the bar pretty low. If against all preliminary evidence you're still imagining that Redd's might turn out to be something like New Glarus Apple Ale, the fact that it comes in clear glass bottles ought to dash those hopes. Because clear glass offers almost no protection against ultraviolet and visible light, beers in such bottles are easily "lightstruck"—that is, bitter compounds from the hops photodegrade, imparting a "skunky" taste. Some beers packaged in clear glass, like Miller High Life, use hop extracts that don't contain the vulnerable compounds, but in this case I reckon clear bottles didn't present a liability because little if any hops were used. If you receive an unsolicited promotional package of Redd's Apple Ale, it may likewise include one of these branded glasses. As far as the government is concerned, in the making of an "ale" or a "malt beverage" (a common industry term for alcopop) there's no rule against treating a brew made with grain to remove most of its malt character, then arriving at a finished product by adding flavorings and sweeteners. If I understand the regulations properly, in most cases beers can't be fortified with alcohol, but malt beverages can. Redd's weighs in at an entirely reasonable 5 percent. The label on Redd's includes the words "natural apple flavor and caramel color." I'm no food scientist, but I can't imagine caramel color being necessary in anything brewed with the kinds of malts we're used to seeing in beers—under ordinary circumstances they contribute all the color themselves. This is just speculation, of course (alcoholic beverages don't have to include ingredients on their labels), but it would help explain why Redd's can legally be called an "ale" while sharing so few of the usual characteristics of beers. Anyhow. I'm beginning to feel like I'm procrastinating. The bottle I reviewed bore the date code APR1513. Redd's fizzes vigorously, like a soda, but the bubbles disappear in seconds—there's no head at all. This isn't terribly surprising from a beverage with "low malt cues"; the polypeptides in malts play a crucial role in head formation. Hard ciders often behave the same way, but you don't expect to find malts in something that's fermented from apple juice. The smell is basically apple juice, or even hard apple candy—I can't detect any hops, malt, or yeast character. You can just barely tell that something has been fermented. Redd's is aggressively carbonated, as I think I mentioned. The taste is of apple juice or weak cider, with a lick of tartness that's not present in the nose. The fruit flavor is one-note and shallow, though—I suspect there's no actual apple juice involved at all. (If you could legitimately say "made with real apple juice" instead of "natural apple flavor" on your label, wouldn't you?) Redd's is also pretty sweet, but according to MillerCoors the Polish version is sweeter. There's no finish to speak of, and hops are just as absent from the taste as they are from the aroma. As the beer reaches room temperature, I think I can pick up a very faint graininess, but it's a little like wet cardboard. Protip: Don't let this stuff warm up. It gets nasty. Not the sort of head you'd expect on something calling itself an "ale." This was about a minute after a very rough pour. Given the minimal labeling requirements, the best way to tell whether Redd's is sweetened (short of submitting it to a lab) would probably be to drink a whole bunch and wait to see if you wake up with a praying-for-death hangover the next day. But I'm not about to do that. To be fair, Redd's accomplishes what I figure it was intended to: if it's well chilled, it's easy to drink and pleasant enough. In the context of a craft-beer column, I could safely beat up on big bad MillerCoors by carrying on like this stuff is worse than having Hitler piss in your mouth, but Redd's honestly isn't offensive or even disagreeable (the apple flavor, however, leaves a strange funky aftertaste that apple juice doesn't). At the same time, though, neither does taking a sip of it especially motivate you to take a second. It's not like there's any complexity to explore. It's an apple-flavored alcoholic fizzy drink, and that's about all there is to say about it. For the price—roughly nine bucks a six-pack, based on what I've seen in the wild—you could do better without putting in much of an effort. And of course if you do try Redd's, you'll have to reconcile yourself with the fact that it's likely so expensive only because somebody has to pay for the incredible marketing blitz that might have persuaded you to give it a chance. I'll let tragically underrated Virginia stoner-metal band King Giant play us out with a tune from their 2012 album Dismal Hollow. <a href="http://kinggiant.bandcamp.com/track/6-oclock-swill">6 O&#39;Clock Swill by King Giant</a> Philip Montoro writes about beer and metal, singly or in combination, every Monday.

But camera improvements should continue with next year's iPhone 8, especially if a pair of patents are any indication of what Apple's planning. The patents spotted by AppleInsider deal with a multisensor camera capable of producing "super resolution" images. Specifically, one patent awarded to Apple details a light splitter cube that can break incident light into different color components, sending them to different sensors. A second awarded patent describes how plural image sensor arrangements are used to create a combined image data structure. MORE: The Best iOS Apps You're Not Using (But Should Be) The patents get pretty deep into the weeds of image sensor technology, but the bottom line is that sensors described by Apple would be better at capturing light, resulting in high-quality images. AppleInsider's report notes how Apple would fit this system in the confined space of a smartphone, using a folded camera design. That wouldn't just save space, AppleInsider says: It would also allow for other features like optical image stabilization and greater zoom capabilities. Let's face it: camera capabilities are increasingly how smartphone makers differentiate their devices, and adding megapixels to a camera adds only so much. From the patents Apple's received, it sounds like the company is looking at multiple ways for its phones to produce sharper, more colorful images, and we could be reaping the rewards as soon as next year.

Apple Pay was announced two years ago, and the Australian's have had it since December last year for American Express, April this year for Visa and August for MasterCard, both via ANZ. There is evidence that the Australian banks weren't happy with what was on the table from Apple which could explain why this part of the world didn't get the digital payments service until late. Either way, it's here, through ANZ. Let's look at why you might want Apple Pay. First, yes, the whole thing is designed very well in typical Apple fashion and just works. Setting up Apple pay is very easy. Just use the credit card registered with iTunes, or scan in the plastic and click a few times in the Wallet app on your iPhone or iPad, and you're done. We'll it'll have to be ANZ cards of course, at least for now. If you have a Watch, this too can be used for contactless payments and it's equally easy to set up. Using Apple Pay is very simple: just hover your iPhone over any Paywave-enabled terminal that can do contactless payments, and put a finger on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. That's it, you've just paid for your coffee or something else, with no need to wake up the phone, fire up an app, or enter a PIN (as long as the transaction is below $80). Continued below.

This is a great feature, as it means you no longer have to bloat your wallet with increasing amounts of plastic - or having left them at home, when you need to use them. In theory at least: Apple Pay is new, and it'll take a while before loyalty schemes cotton on to this. Another reason for ANZ iPhone owners to use Apple Pay - there's no setup, fees or application required to get it going - is that you pay for stuff in the US, UK, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong and other countries, with more coming onstream. You don't need internet access to buy stuff either, as the terminal records the transaction, and the Apple devices provide the authentication for it, so nothing has to be sent networks to cloud servers. The caveat here being ANZ's fees for overseas card transactions, and I hope the bank thinks hard about charges, and makes the minimal and transparent. The wait is over.... Apple Pay is here. Use it anywhere you can tap and pay #ANZApplePay https://t.co/fT3Px394AJ pic.twitter.com/S5wiGZxeAN— ANZ New Zealand (@ANZ_NZ) October 12, 2016 One feature that was definitely worth waiting for is the ability to use Apple Pay with the macOS Safari web browser for purchases. No need to create an account and login, just click the Apple Pay button on participating sites, put a finger on the iPhone's Touch ID sensor, and you're away. Web purchases are PIN-less until $80, ANZ's Liz MaGuire who worked on bringing Apple Pay to New Zealand, and the bank's mobile apps, said. Apple reckons that Pay is more secure than standard plastic, and I can see what they mean: credit and debit card numbers are not stored in Apple Pay and not visible to anyone; the card verification value (CVV) security number is generated anew for each transaction, and it's not static like on plastic. Ergo, a shoulder surfer isn't going to find out your credit card details from Apple Pay. As the FBI found out, getting into iPhones is very difficult. If you lose your phone, it's very unlikely that anyone will be able to use Apple Pay fraudulently. Whereas if your normal wallet goes astray, you have to be quick to contact the bank to cancel cards as the information for payments authorisation is totally visible on them. i-Devices use a special chip, the Secure Element to store payment information safely from malware and hackers - it's out of reach of the iOS operating system even. Tim Cook who runs Apple has come out publicly to say that your data is not the business model for the company, and they'll only sell hardware and software and not people. So far that statement has held true, and Apple is at pains to explain that it collects no information about what you buy, where and when with Pay. That makes total sense to me, not having to give up your privacy for shopping convenience. All the above notwithstanding, my favourite Apple Pay feature has to do with accessibility. We live in a cashless society, yet credit and debit cards are almost unusable if you're blind or partially sighted. There's no Braille on them, so you have to ask sighted friends and family to order them in your wallet for you, to get the right one. Even then, they usually get mixed up, so you never know which one you give out at the cafe or supermarket. When it's time to pay, hi-tech terminals often use touch screens for PIN entry. This means you have the option of cancelling the transaction or giving your PIN to the cashier to enter, neither which is acceptable. Worse, shameless people can rip off the blind and partially sighted by increasing the transaction value because... they can't see how much is being charged. Appalling. Apple Pay fixes many of those issues by reading out which card is being used, the transaction amounts, and other information. You can also go back and forth, and have your iPhone read out transactions to you. Full marks to Apple for that. Why would you not want Apple Pay? Well, you're an Android user, or baulk at the paying the price for iPhones and Watches, and it's kind of annoying it's only ANZ doing it at the moment. Taking the bigger view, I wish Apple had teamed up with the local guys, EFTPOS, and other smaller payments providers, and not just the big banks and credit card issuers. Guess that one went out of the window when smartphones became a hit and those Paywave contactless credit/debit cards appeared and EFTPOS carried on with a magnetic stripe. Anyway, it's uncomfortable having basic stuff like payments being controlled by massive overseas conglomerates. - NZ Herald By Juha Saarinen Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

The “Coming Soon” table has been removed and the Apple Pay New Zealand website and New Zealand website Stuff now confirms that Apple Pay is functioning in the country. Apple Pay will be available via a partnership with ANZ bank, meaning that it will only work with debit and Visa credit cards through ANZ at this time. Unfortunately, some banks in New Zealand and Australia have been reluctant to accept Apple Pay due to processing fees Apple collects. “For us it much more about the value it brings out customers than anything else. I think we’re going to see a lot of people using it because it’s so easy.” She said the bank had received enquires from new customers but did not say how many. “We think there’s a lot of interest for Apple Pay in the market and when it was announced there was a lot of commentary on social media saying ‘when is my bank going to offer Apple Pay'”. Apple Pay will work with the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, and SE. It’s also available on the iPhone 5, 5c, and 5s when paired with an Apple Watch. In New Zealand specifically, Apple warns that PIN may be required for purchases over 80 NZD. Similar restrictions are placed in other countries for security purposes. For purchases under 80 NZD, nothing beyond Touch ID is required (or an unlocked Apple Watch). Support for Apple Pay will be coming to Japan, Spain, and Taiwan soon.

The newly filed US patents suggest that in addition to a more powerful camera, Apple is working on a new kind of sensor that may let the iPhone ditch its bezels for a entirely full-screen display. Specifically, the patents include concepts for a display-integrated light sensor, a way to split light using cubical prisms, and a miniaturized camera capable of what the filing calls “super resolution.”  I sensor a disturbance in The Form Factor The display-integrated light sensor is particularly notable, as it could potentially replace the sensors normally seen on the top part of an iPhone, allowing the screen to completely take over the entire front face of the handset. As for the camera patents, the filings suggest a new way to utilize a light-splitting cube to break light down into its red, blue, and green components. Once digitized using a new sensor technology, the result is high-quality images using a small construction. Unfortunately, it’ll be a while before we’ll know for sure if Apple plans to outfit its next smartphone with a super resolution camera - or even what that entails, exactly. However, we won’t be surprised if Apple continues to push the envelope on squeezing the most from those tiny lenses, especially in light of competitor Google’s recent claim that its Pixel phones boasts the highest-rated smartphone camera on the block.  The best (but affordable) cameras of 2016 (Via AppleInsider) Tags iPhone Related news "Instant games" are coming to your Facebook Messenger chats The best Xbox One games - 20 of this generation's must-play titles Still using your Galaxy Note 7?

Politics 'We're called redneck, ignorant, racist. That's not true': Trump supporters explain why they voted for him BUSINESS Technology With new music streaming service, Amazon is trying to lure customers to its Echo home gadgets Amazon Echo Handout/TNS Amazon's voice-activated Echo smart-home speaker. Amazon's voice-activated Echo smart-home speaker. (Handout/TNS) Samantha Masunaga and Randall Roberts Amazon.com Inc.’s new streaming music service isn’t just the firm’s latest foray into digital media. It could also be a way to boost sales of the e-commerce giant’s voice-activated assistant devices and help them become essential appliances in customers’ homes, analysts say. Amazon Music Unlimited, a subscription streaming hub with tens of millions of songs announced Wednesday, is available to any Amazon customer. But those who own Amazon Echo gadgets — household devices that serve as a speaker and double as an artificially intelligent home aide called Alexa — pay less, just $3.99 a month compared with $7.99 for Prime subscribers and $9.99 for others.  Music was already one of the “top activities” on Echo devices, said Ryan Redington, director of Amazon Music. But they can “provide a lot more than just music,” he said. Echo and competing devices and services such as Apple’s Siri and Google’s Home are commonly used to answer questions, give updates on weather and control smart-home systems, such as thermostats. Rolling in a new low-cost streaming music service might persuade more customers to take one home. “For us, we see that the next frontier in growing the streaming music market is in the home,” said Redington. “We see voice as certainly an entry point into the home.” But it’s e-commerce that is the ultimate goal, analysts said.  “Whatever can ultimately drive more profitable volume or traffic to their e-commerce business is really their grand approach,” said Josh Olson, technology analyst at Edward Jones Customers who buy an Echo because of the discounted streaming of songs could easily be persuaded to start buying groceries via Alexa from Amazon Fresh or purchasing household items from Amazon.com by voice.  “The true value lies not only in streaming, not only in the Echo, but in the portfolio of all of the different services and all of the different hardware devices that Amazon is offering to the consumer,” said Werner Goertz, research director for personal technologies at Gartner. A Gartner analysis this month predicted that consumer spending on virtual personal assistant devices like Echo could reach $2.1 billion by 2020, up from $360 million in 2015. Market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimated in April that Amazon has sold 3 million Echo devices since it was introduced in late 2014.  For now, Olson said Amazon’s streaming music service is likely more about expanding Amazon’s user base than driving large amounts of sales. This is not Amazon’s first foray into the music scene. The e-commerce firm already offered Prime customers access to about 2 million songs. But the company is betting that it can draw subscribers by tempting them with an Echo and having Amazon Music Unlimited communicate seamlessly with that device. For example, rather than searching the millions of songs, users can ask Echo’s Alexa voice-control system to put on a playlist based on mood or genre. Through voice commands, it can recommend new songs, find and play tracks based on lyrics and respond to general commands such as “play music.”   A display of Amazon Music Unlimited, a paid streaming music service Amazon is launching.

(Amazon Music) Although the new streaming service was an “expected move,” it doesn’t really fit that well with Amazon’s broader music strategy, said Mark Mulligan, music analyst at Midia Research. “Amazon has been a mass market, [a] mainstream music buyer’s destination,” he said. “What Amazon has got to try and do if it really wants to win over its super fans, you've got to persuade them to ditch services they've already spent many months, sometimes years of building playlists.” SIGN UP for the free California Inc. business newsletter » Though the new service puts Amazon in more direct competition with streaming firms such as Spotify and Pandora, Amazon is ultimately more concerned with dominating a connected home, analysts said. “It’s an attractive potential market opportunity for a lot of these firms, so I think yes, Amazon is definitely interested in being one of the competitors there,” Olson said.

Police: 3 young girls lived in raided Clyde house David Yonke , Editor 3:25 p.m. EDT October 12, 2016 Bobbie Jo Durst (Photo: Sandusky County Jail) 698 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE CLYDE - When the Sandusky County Drug Task Force raided a basement residence of a Clyde house on Friday night, the initial charges filed against three suspects were for child endangering, not drugs. "There were children who lived at the residence with the three people who were arrested," Mark Apple, commander of the task force, said Wednesday. "There were syringes out where the children had access." The three girls who lived in the house at 502 Race St. were 7, 11 and 12 years old, according to a Clyde Police report. Alex Palyshka  (Photo: Sandusky County Jail) According to Apple and police reports, drug task force agents found a total of 198 syringes, mostly used, in the basement of the house where two suspects, Bobbie Jo Durst, 35, and her boyfriend, Alex Palyshka, 35, were arrested. Agents also seized heroin, methamphetamine and crack cocaine, miscellaneous drug paraphernalia such as pipes and scales, and $2,000 in cash. Also arrested was Silas Renfro, 38, of Clyde. "Durst was known to us for a while," Apple said, adding that the drug task force had been investigating her for "a couple months." During the raid, "Durst began to breathe heavily, sweat heavily, and seemed to be in need of medical attention," and was taken by ambulance to Bellevue Hospital, where she told an emergency room doctor she had swallowed heroin and meth, according the Clyde police report. A "heroin kit" was found in Durst's purse containing a dirty spoon, syringes, a shoelace, a half straw and several cotton swabs, the report said. In addition to child endangering, Durst was charged with drug possession, tampering with evidence, obstructing official business and conveying prohibited items to a detention facility, according to jail records. She is being held in the Sandusky County Jail on a $500,000 bond. Durst is accused of bringing two plastic bags of suspected heroin into her jail cell, "and she is suspected of having that concealed within her body," according to Clyde police. The police report said drug task force agents had contacted David Miller, 69, owner of the Race Street house, which is less than a half-mile north of Clyde High School at 1015 Race St., before the raid and advised him of his Miranda rights. Agents entered through an open garage door, went down the steps to the basement door, and announced, "Search warrant. Open the door." When there was no response, they entered the unlocked door and confronted Renfro. Silas Renfro  (Photo: Sandusky County Jail) "I told him go to the ground, and he did so on his own at gunpoint, he complied," Detective Brian Weaver of the Clyde Police Department wrote in the report. Renfro was handcuffed, searched, and placed in a chair. A search of his person revealed suspected methamphetamine, heroin, and $1,186 in cash, police said. The entry team then forced open the door later found to be Durst's room, where they encountered and handcuffed Durst and Palyshka. The three children living at the Race Street house were not in the residence when the raid was conducted, according to Apple. Apple said the case will be presented to a grand jury and that more charges are likely. dyonke@gannett.com 419-334-1041 Twitter: @davidyonke1 698 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2esv4bq TOP VIDEOS Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 WWII veteran - Richard Willer 10:30 WWII veteran - Carl Cooley 10:00 WWII veteran - Alice Miller 10:00 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 World War II: In their own words promo 1:00 Lexington at Clyde football 3:11 Prosecutor says sheriff not above law 2:39 Attorney's reaction to sheriff jailed 0:08 Sheriff's bond revoked 1:12 More Stories Community service, carols wraps up Winesburg weekend Nov. 12, 2016, 3 p.m. Old Fort nurse helped WWII sailors Nov. 12, 2016, 2:35 p.m. November political cartoons from the USA TODAY Network Nov. 13, 2016, 8:45 a.m. After Tensing mistrial, what will Deters do next?

ADVERTISEMENT Irish officials insisted that the fine — the European Commission's largest — “flies in the face” of international tax consensus. It came after the commission ruled in August that Apple improperly benefited from the country’s tax laws. The Obama administration has backed Ireland in the dispute, and the Irish parliament’s leader on international finance has been meeting with American companies with business in Ireland. Ireland is expected to file an appeal of the ruling, which charged the country with providing special assistance to Apple that let them pay very little in taxes on all European sales. 'We're confident that we'll win the appeal," Eoghan Murphy, a member of Ireland’s parliament who serves as minister of state for financial services, eGovernment and public procurement, said in an interview with The Hill. "We are building a very successful consensus around making sure companies pay their fair share in tax, and pay in the appropriate place, and the commission's decision flies in the face of that,” Murphy added. Murphy assists Ireland’s minister of finance and minister of public affairs and reform, the country’s cabinet chiefs in those jurisdictions. He said he’s been meeting with American corporate leaders to explain the pending appeal and renew their faith in investing in Ireland. “I think there's a shared understanding that the decision is a mistake," said Murphy of his meeting with business leaders. "It will be some years before they know." “What they do understand is that even if the appeal were unsuccessful, things like our corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent, things like our commitment to the [international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] process, those won't be changed and can't be changed by anyone but our government." The White House, Treasury Department and both Democratic and Republican leaders panned the commission decision. They claimed such rulings hamper U.S. and EU economic partnership and make cracking down on tax evasion harder. “The Commission’s actions could threaten to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU,” a Treasury spokesperson said at the time.  House Speaker Paul RyanPaul RyanLawmakers, pundits react to Bannon, Priebus White House roles Trump, GOP leaders pledge secure border before deportation policy Trump vows to deport millions immediately MORE (R-Wis.) called it “awful.” Apple called the ruling “legal mumbo jumbo” and expressed confidence that the appeal would win. Murphy said he’s not worried about the precedent the ruling would set but acknowledged that it could complicate setting international guidelines on corporate taxes. "We're not trying to facilitate companies avoiding taxes,” said Murphy. "We're trying to make sure they're paying the taxes in the appropriate jurisdiction, so that's what we want to achieve." Murphy also pitched Ireland’s stability in the midst of the United Kingdom’s pending exit from the EU and building skepticism of trade deals. Murphy declined to comment on presidential nominees Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonTrump on prosecuting Clinton: ‘I don’t want to hurt' her #NeverTrump GOP organizer: Hope for peace, prepare for war Reid endorses Ellison for DNC chief MORE (D) and Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump faces decisions and opposition on counterterrorism proposals ‘Simpsons’ nods to 2000 election prediction Trump: 'I'll take a year' as president MORE (R) specifically but noted that opposition to trade deals can stem from broader concerns about the global economy. “Maybe it isn't actually about the trade itself or about the agreement, but maybe it’s more fears about challenges that technology is posing to people, to information flows, to jobs prospects and the challenges of increasing globalization, said Murphy. "There are real fears people have and we see that in Europe as well. We see it in the refugee crisis, we see it the Brexit debate and this kind of uncertainty around jobs and employment," he added.  “Trade has to happen between countries, and we all want to make sure that trade is mutually beneficial."

The group will invite academics, other nonprofits, and specialists in policy and ethics to join its board, which will represent corporate and noncorporate members equally. The partnership will conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license. It will address topics such as ethics, fairness and inclusivity, transparency, privacy, and interoperability collaboration between people and AI systems, as well as AI technology's trustworthiness, reliability and robustness. There are no plans to lobby government or other policymaking bodies. Discussions with professional and scientific organizations such as the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, as well as nonprofit research groups including the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, an AI research organization set up by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen, were ongoing, the partnership said. A Time of Great Turmoil Salesforce and Apple are notably missing from the group's roster. Salesforce recently announced Einstein, designed to embed AI in all of its offerings. Apple just purchased machine learning and AI startup Turi. "Salesforce may have been locked out by Microsoft," speculated Ray Wang, a principal analyst at Constellation Research. Apple "tends to take a go-it-alone strategy, though they've worked closely with partners like IBM," he added. As for the smaller players, "the concept started with bringing a few anchor vendors into the alliance and then growing it from there," Wang told TechNewsWorld. "Right now we're in an era of AI babel. The machine learning algorithms, neural net designs, and data standards are a cacophony of hell." We're at an inflection point in the progress of AI, according to Frost & Sullivan. Breakthroughs in deep learning due to more data, faster processing and better algorithms have led to dramatic improvements in computer vision, natural language processing and robotic motion systems. All of the fundamentals are in place for AI to revolutionize every business in every industry. "I think the participants are thinking in terms of controlling the Frankenstein factor that seems to be developing around AI," said Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "People, especially the mainstream media, are getting concerned about the rise of the machines, and I think a lot of this is in the nature of PR," he told TechNewsWorld. Several universities have begun studying the possible dangers AI might pose. High-tech visionary Elon Musk and renowned physicist Stephen Hawking are among the people who have voiced concerns. His concerns led Musk to help establish OpenAI, a nonprofit AI research organization that includes Amazon Web Services among its members. We will "see a rise in digital ethics and a potential call by other alliances and organizations, like the EFF, for an international human right to privacy and digital and AI ethics standards," Wang predicted. Potential Impact Partnership on AI "should provide more rigor and initial standardization, particularly around safety protocols, definitions and certifications," noted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "All of these are needed to validate [it] as viable and not just a time or money hole," he told TechNewsWorld. Its founding members "have deep AI experience," Enderle pointed out, and therefore "should be able to establish rules and frameworks for the group far more quickly." Partnership on AI might help the advancement of artificial intelligence by convincing the public that governmental controls aren't necessary, Frost's Jude suggested. "Governments are beginning to get interested in the technology," he said. "There have already been hearings on AI in Congress, and the public policy types are clearly interested in potentially regulating this space. If the industry can demonstrate that in a sense, it's self-regulating, that may keep the regulators at bay." Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to. Will implanted RFID chips in humans be the Mark of the Beast? Will nanotech solve our coming food crisis? Does Sturgeon's Law still hold true? You can connect with Richard on Google+.

The Music Unlimited subscription from Amazon will be available for $9.99 a month, in line with offers from Spotify and Apple Music, but Prime customers would pay $7.99, or $79 a year, Amazon said in a statement Wednesday. The Seattle-based e-commerce giant plans to offer a family-subscription plan later this year. The new offer will give Prime members access to a catalog of tens of millions of songs, up from about 2 million previously, Amazon said, and thousands of hand-curated playlists and personalized stations. Listening to music through the Echo voice-activated speaker was already one of the most popular features of the hit device. The new expanded selection, including features that allow listeners to search by lyrics, artist, decade and more, will likely only tighten bonds between users and the Echo’s voice recognition technology, Alexa. Amazon is also offering an Echo-only subscription plan for $3.99 a month, providing access to all of the music catalog on a single device. Amazon is counting on the Echo, a surprise success when it was introduced two years ago, to help set its music offerings apart from those of established powerhouses and new entrants like Google. Music has always been an integral part of the Echo and Amazon is willing to lose money on a cheap offering to attract more shoppers to the device, with the ultimate goal of embedding all of its services more deeply in people’s everyday lives. With the Echo, Alexa can be summoned to order a pizza, check the weather or of course buy items from Amazon. Available in three versions including the Dot and Tap, the Echo is central to Amazon’s strategy for a connected home and as a way to boost membership in Amazon’s Prime subscription program, which includes delivery discounts, video streaming and online photo storage. Amazon is betting that a stand-alone music streaming service will also enhance Echo’s appeal to non-Prime members, ultimately whetting their appetites for further offerings from the online retailer. People who are happy with the music service are likely to upgrade and get the full benefits of Prime membership, making them more loyal to Amazon with their overall spending. Amazon introduced a stand-alone video subscription service in April, another potential gateway to Prime membership. Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

The growth of subscription services has boosted music industry revenue for the past year and a half, offsetting declines in sales of physical and digital albums. U.S. streaming revenue grew 57 percent to $1.6 billion in the first half of 2016 and accounted for almost half of industry sales. Ad-supported streaming accounted for just 12 percent of that total. Record labels still aren’t satisfied with their deals with many services, which they say offer too much for free. The labels have been pushing Spotify, the biggest streaming service, to limit some new releases to its paid tier, according to people familiar with the matter. Bringing in new competitors like Amazon could put more pressure on Spotify in negotiations. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

But now it appears that Apple has a seat on its board just weeks after the initial investment, according to The Information. The report says Apple had secured a seat on the board in late June. This reinforces the angle in Apple’s investment. To take it a step further, Uber in China sold its operations to Didi Chuxing, which was mostly because Didi had Apple backing its case. Apple got a seat on the board of Didi Chuxing a few weeks after investing $1 billion in the company, which is known as the ‘Uber of China,’ according to a person briefed on the move. At the time, news reports about the investment quoted Didi as saying Apple hadn’t received such a seat. At the time, it was unclear why Apple would invest in Didi Chuxing. Most assumed it was because Apple wanted to learn about the Chinese market and overall ride sharing market to prepare its own vehicle. Being on the board also means that Apple has access to top execs in the car industry. As for the future, we’ll have to wait and see as we have no indication on where Apple plans to take its investment. Tags: Didi Chuxing About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

In a new interview with Billboard, Iovine discusses the team behind Apple Music and its future. He starts by addressing the “story” of Apple Music and how it’s much more than just a music streaming service. He noted that the music and technology industries would be working together after meeting Steve Jobs and Eddy Cue in 2003. Iovine says that he approached Jobs about partnering with Dr. Dre headphones, but Jobs told him to do it himself. From there, Iovine began gathering up his team. I realized, okay, the future of music is going to be intertwined with distribution through technology companies. It just looked like that to me, and I realized how far behind I personally was. So I set out to really understand. So I worked with those guys for about two years, and I said to Steve, “I’d like to do headphones with Apple with [Dr.] Dre,” about two or three years later. He said, “Do it yourself, you can do it.” So I tried it myself. Iovine says that the future of Apple Music includes something that’s both technologically and culturally adept. While no details were given, he says that Apple Music will be more than just blending the record industry with streaming music. He says that Apple Music is a “hybrid” between culture and technology. In the interview, Iovine praises Eddy Cue for being “incredibly natural” and “gifted” because of how Jobs handpicked him for his team. Eddy Cue is incredibly natural; he’s gifted, because he was Steve’s guy, so he learned a lot about this and he’s very open and has a great feel for popular culture and media. So you put that team together, and you’ve got a shot. And what we’re going to do, what we’re doing now that hasn’t been revealed yet, is we’re building the right hybrid. And we believe it’s the right hybrid, and the combination of these things together, we’ll build a music service that is technologically and culturally adept. But Iovine wants to clarify that they’re not looking to take over the record industry in any stretch of the imagination. “We are building something that can help labels and artists and undiscovered artists.” Eddy Cue is incredibly natural; he’s gifted, because he was Steve’s guy, so he learned a lot about this and he’s very open and has a great feel for popular culture and media. So you put that team together, and you’ve got a shot. And what we’re going to do, what we’re doing now that hasn’t been revealed yet, is we’re building the right hybrid. And we believe it’s the right hybrid, and the combination of these things together, we’ll build a music service that is technologically and culturally adept. The interview can be found in its entirety on Billboard. Tags: Apple Music, Jimmy Iovine About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Apple designed the Safari Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari. Safari Technology Preview release 15 includes bug fixes and updates for fetch API, JavaScript, CSS, web APIs, Web Inspector, media, accessibility, URL handling, and Safari Extensions. Starting with release 14, Safari Technology Preview includes regular updates and bug fixes for Safari's WebDriver implementation. The Safari Technology Preview update is available through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store to anyone who has downloaded the browser. Versions are available for developers running both macOS Sierra and OS X El Capitan. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari Technology Preview website. Apple's goal with Safari Technology Preview is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. Safari Technology Preview can be run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.

Anyway, which browser would you recommend then? Yes, bug fixes on the fetch API that is still not available in the public channel. http://caniuse.com/#search=fetch I'm really happy with Chrome v56 on the Canary channel. Features, performance, RAM consumption, and energy have never been better in macOS. Rating: 3 Votes Andres Cantu 5 weeks ago Safari needs to catch-up in the HTML5 test score. Even Microsoft beats it now! Rating: 2 Votes blanks 5 weeks ago unfortunately i gave up on this last release and don't see myself going back... just too many bugs It's for web developers to know what's coming down the pipe and make fixes/enhancements to projects accordingly. It's not meant for the average Joe to be using as a daily browser. Rating: 2 Votes JaguarF 5 weeks ago Safari needs to catch-up in the HTML5 test score. Even Microsoft beats it now! Well the Safari Technology Preview 15 gets 415 points on html5test.com, which is the first time Safari has been able to get 400 or more points. Safari 9 had a score of 360, Safari 9.1 had a score of 370 and Safari 10 managed a score of 383 points. So, Safari is headed in the right direction, only a bit slower than I would have preferred.

To install the update, the Apple Watch must have 50 percent battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the iPhone. watchOS 3.1 requires an iPhone running iOS 10 to install. watchOS 3.1 appears to focus on bug fixes and under-the-hood performance improvements rather than outward-facing changes, as no new features were discovered in the first two betas. Should any changes be found in the third beta, we'll update this post. watchOS 3 brings a new interface to the Apple Watch, with a dedicated App Dock and instant launch apps. There are new Activity sharing features, a "Breathe" app guides you through daily deep breathing sessions to cut down on stress, and there are new Reminders, Find My Friends, and Heart Rate apps. Three new watch faces are included, and an SOS feature can automatically call emergency services. A revamped Messages app makes it easier to reply to incoming texts, plus there's a new "Scribble" feature for writing replies on the Apple Watch face with a finger. For more details on what's new in watchOS 3, make sure to check out our watchOS 3 roundup.

The case arguments came as Samsung faces a fresh but unrelated crisis as it halted production of a flagship handset for safety reasons, potentially imperiling the powerhouse South Korean brand. Samsung, which has been ordered to pay US$400 million for violating certain iPhone features, is challenging the legal precedent which requires the forfeiture of all profits from a product even if only a single design patent is infringed upon. This key question on the value of design patents has rallied Samsung supporters in the tech sector, and Apple backers in the creative and design communities. The justices Tuesday offered some support for both sides without providing a hint on the outcome of the case. Justice Anthony Kennedy said Samsung's argument would create confusion for jurors in trying to apportion damages. “If I'm the juror, I just don't know what to do,” Kennedy told attorneys during the hearing. “I'd have the iPhone in the jury room; I'd — I'd look at it. I just wouldn't know.” VW Beetle Example The court debate moved from smartphones to automobiles, and the importance of design to the Volkswagen Beetle, for example. Justice Samuel Alito appeared to lean toward Samsung's position, saying, “Nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks ... What if it broke down every 50 miles?” Offering a similar view, Justice Stephen Breyer said a single component cannot account for all profits: “A Rolls Royce thing on the hood? No, no, no. You don't get all the profit from the car.” Samsung attorney Kathleen Sullivan said the justices should consider all the components of a smartphone. “A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work,” she said. She said the case could lead to more litigations because patent holders “carve the product up into multiple partial design claims... and find a little sliver of the phone on which infringement can be found.” Design 'not a component' Apple lawyer Seth Waxman fired back that Samsung made a conscious decision to revive its fortunes by copying the iPhone. “A design is not a component, a design is applied to a thing,” Waxman said. Waxman contended that Samsung's own documents showed that the South Korean giant acted to deal with “a crisis of design” and sought to copy the iPhone. He noted that limiting the damages would offer little deterrence and encourage “counterfeiters and copyists.” Observers are watching to see how the court — which has not taken up a design patent case in more than a century — tips the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. A ruling is expected in several months. The case is one element of the US$548 million penalty Samsung was ordered to pay for copying the iPhone's distinctive front screen and graphical touchscreen interface. Matt Levy of the Computer & Communications Industry Association said the debate suggested the justices were open to lowering the jury award. “The damages statute for design patents was written to protect products like rugs, where the design was essentially the entire thing being sold,” Levy said in a blog post. “Congress certainly didn't intend to treat complex products as if only the outer appearance is what matters.... Based on what I heard, I think it's very likely that the (justices) will modify the lower court's decision.” Samsung has won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Apple is supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. An amicus brief filed on behalf of design professionals, researchers and academics said they have no financial interest in the case but argue on the basis of “fundamental principles of visual design.” They cite precedents like the Coca-Cola bottle, which is an integral part of the value of the product. The Supreme Court hearing took place hours after Samsung announced it was scrapping the production of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, its new flagship device that has been mired in a disastrous recall over exploding lithium-ion batteries.

You look at the whole package on the outside and within a fraction of a second make up your mind whether you like something or not. Psychologists say this is the way people form first impressions of each other as well. And so it was with the iPhone 7’s, launched in September this year. Even though every feature and spec was leaked ahead of the launch, there was still some disappointment all round to have the rumours proved correct and discover that there was no visual change worth mentioning to the set of new and expensive phones. Users like to know they have a fresh brilliant design on their favourite phone. But this time around, Apple urges you to look on the inside. Accordingly, I put the iPhone 7 Plus into its red leather case and forgot all about its looks.Tap to feel The first thing that you will notice physically on the iPhone, apart from little design tweaks, is the change in the Home button. It no longer clicks in the same way. Instead of giving way under your finger, it gives you what feels like a virtual click. This is what Apple calls Taptic Engine and it's in the MacBook and on the watch too. The Home button is a little difficult to get used to at first, but the haptic technology used in various actions is rather nice and satisfying. For instance, when you scroll a setting to set the time, each change of number is associated with a tactile feel. It is difficult to explain but the experience is fun and natural. I soon found myself wanting to feel that little buzz more often, such as when swiping a screen or flipping a page.Better than ever Apple execs are very fond of saying their new device is better than it has ever been. That of course is stating the obvious since no new phone could or should be worse than those that preceded it — unless it is busy exploding. And so yes, there is lots about the new iPhone that makes it better. It is water resistant now: not to the extent that Samsung’s S7 is but enough to save the iPhone from accidental spills. It has a new and much faster A10 Fusion chip, the storage has been stepped up (important for storing photos and music) and the battery life is pretty good. Personally, I find the iPhone 7 Plus the better of the two devices, not just because of the dual wide angle and telephoto camera but of the spaciousness of the screen, which is brighter than before. But for me, as for many others, it’s all about the camera.The camera to beat For the past many years, just about every smartphone with a worthy camera has been pitted against the iPhones in detailed tests. The Galaxy S7s surpassed it in many respects. Now, the 6 element lens 12MP dual camera on the iPhone 7 Plus has a larger f1.8 aperture that lets in more light. It also has optical image stabilisation and an optical zoom which is quite impressive. Press the ‘1x’ symbol to zoom in 2x and find a closer image which can then be zoomed further through software, though this is not a favourite trick of photographers as it only introduces noise. The two cameras combine to create a single photograph. An update to Apple’s iOS will bring in more capabilities including shooting portraits with bokeh, the blurring in the background that looks so good in images. The iPhone 7’s camera is good in low light and even compensates when you shoot a subject against the light. There's a Quad LED flash. What is not so good and the subject of endless discussion is of course the now famous headphone jack removal. You will need to use headphones of your own choice; ones that fit well and sound the way you want them to. The adaptor in the box will take little time to get lost, which is when you will find yourself a little stuck. The upcoming Air Pods’ biggest problem will also be that they will fall right out, as each ‘ear-print’ is different. The decision on whether to upgrade to or buy an iPhone 7 is getting more difficult over the past couple of releases. In India, a bunch of deals on both old and new models complicates the picture a bit more. It really is users with an old model of the iPhone who should consider an upgrade. And anyone who wants to give up on Android and buy the ultimate aspirational flagship.

I feel cool wearing them for a while and then switch to something more jewellery-like. But this time, with the Apple Watch Series 2, I think I will stick with it for a while. Finally, a watch has me getting up and reducing some of the damage my sedentary life must be causing. Series 2 is faster, easier to use, and more health and fitness focused than before. And how it has me moving with its stand up reminders, which were there in the previous watch, but more usable now because overall the watch has evolved a little. At a starting price of ₹32,900 however, one has to give it a good long think. Who needs it? One thing is for sure. If you have the previous version of the Apple Watch, there really is not too much benefit to upgrading. Updating the software will get you some features and the watch looks exactly the same, though there is now a ceramic model available. Unless you specifically want to use the GPS (for maps, running routes and more), and swim with the watch on, because you can go down 50 meters with it, the new watch is not a must-have. If you have the money to spare and want a smartwatch, not just a fitness tracker, think about the Apple Watch if you happen to own an iPhone. But deciding between an expensive smartwatch and an everyday fitness tracker is a tougher decision and a personal one. The Apple Watch is very well built and a very Apple design. There are hundreds of straps and accessories available – at an additional cost, of course – so you have to see if you want to indulge yourself. The straps are part of the reason the Apple Watch feels cool to me, specially with the double tour leather band that is a statement in itself. But it is an expensive hobby. Stop for a breath The emphasis on fitness is strong on the Apple Watch Series 2, even though there is a separate Nike-Apple watch just for runners. Working with the watch, you can get stats on your heart rate in the longer term. Several trackers led me to believe my heart rate was unreasonably high. With the Apple Watch I was able to see that it my stats were in a healthy range. Your activity is tracked through the day with progress reports in case you want to step it up. You also get an alert to stand up and stay up for a minute. A couple of times a day, you can also stop to breathe deeply. The watch will guide you with its haptic feedback, with a sensation for inhaling and a bigger one for exhaling. You can start a variety of workouts and have them tracked for activity and calories and, because of the addition of GPS, relate activity to routes while running or cycling. There is also full support for third party apps. With the waterproofing, you can take the watch for a swim. If a little water should get in, Apple has come up with a clever way to eject the water. It pushes it out with a few loud beeps when you press the button to do so. Dock your apps The Apple Watch is not a specialised tracker, like some are. What it does is track a number of parameters but besides its focus on health and fitness, do what smartwatches do, such as let you dictate reminders or notes or replies to messages, locate your phone, get notifications on the news and social media posts, control a presentation on Keynote, and more. You can scroll through photos, browse your Instagram feed and even scribble on the screen, though this is by no means easy. The ecosystem of apps is probably the best for this smartwatch than for any other. They do however, need your involvement as you explore, select and collect into the ‘dock’ what you want to work with on an everyday basis. The Apple Watch Series 2 uses a button, and the rotating crown and swipes on the screen to use. The display is definitely brighter and crisper than before and the device works in a snappier more intuitive manner. Overall, it’s a good refinement of the previous generation and a worthy, though expensive, companion to the iPhone.

Apple and Google are both applying machine learning to organize your pictures and video, and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. (AP Photo/Anick Jesdanun) More NEW YORK (AP) -- If you're like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you've posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don't have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called "machine learning" to organize your pictures and video — and along the way, help you rediscover last year's vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple's tools are part of last month's iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories — and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here's a look at how they take you down memory lane: ___ APPLE'S MEMORIES Apple's new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn't just a slideshow. There's slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you're ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file — so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple's app created a "Florida to Illinois" package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a "Together" package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an "At The Beach" package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to "Related." You can also add or delete images within Memories — in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let's face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren't necessarily ones I'd choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they're presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually ... someday. ___ GOOGLE'S ASSISTANT Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image . Unlike typical "GIF" animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady — without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google's Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation — although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn't require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google's choices aren't necessarily ones I'd make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called "Rediscover this day." Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you'll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. ___ SEARCHING Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple's version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Read More Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. ___ STORAGE To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you're online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition — good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple's iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos. ___ Online: Apple Memories video from January trip: https://youtu.be/dkm99o8tL88 Google animation of fountains: https://goo.gl/photos/p1iL9STfCmqhxxGx6 Google collage: https://goo.gl/photos/zkn1ZcLAPTqRQoJh7 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Polls Show Hillary Clinton Leading Donald Trump in Election’s Final Days Fortune iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech All the Photoshops of this photo of Donald Trump and Barack Obama are perfect BGR News New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Are you are sitting comfortably? Then I shall begin. Downtown Boonville was hopping on Saturday night and as I flew over the heaving metropolis. In the early evening the throngs on the streets and “traffic jam” in the heart of the “City” was quite a sight to behold. At the Redwood Drive-In there was a birthday celebration attended by many from our Mexican community, while the three other Boonville restaurants, Aquarelle, The Hotel, and Lauren’s had large numbers of vehicles parked outside each of them. Further down the road there was a clearly popular event at the Pennyroyal Farm, while at The Brewery’s Visitor Center people had gathered to watch Game 2 in the Giants/Cubs series. But the biggest gathering was at The Apple Hall for a Quinceañera hosted by the Perez/Sanchez family where over 200 folks were assembled. Four hours later, following a Giants defeat and a drowning of the subsequent sorrows, I flew over again and the town had calmed down, except of course at the Apple Hall where the music blared at an acceptable Saturday night level and the fun was clearly still in full swing. And City people ask me what there is to do up here? Meanwhile, in a parallel universe know as The Real World, a place far removed from the Boonville Bubble, The Old Buzzard has some interesting, and quite disturbing observations on a “new” Donald Trump. Please note: this was written both before Trump’s comments about women surfaced last Friday and also prior to the excruciatingly ugly debate on Sunday evening. “Donald Trump made a big play this past week with a revival of the Populist theme that has served many ‘dictators’ well in the past. He was lying about his intentions of course but at this point nobody seems to be unduly worried by a little outright fabrication and deception. This is what Trump said. “We will rebuild our roads, our bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools, and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads. American planes will soar the skies and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send skyscrapers — new, beautiful skyscrapers — into the clouds. American hands — hands, hands, hands! — will rebuild this nation. And American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job, not workers from other countries. We will put new American steel into the spine of the United States. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation.’ “Good stuff, right? Whether he's hired new speechwriters, or his staff simply has found the right dosage, The Donald is dealing out the real thing there — true, classic America First populism. Is it all a charlatan's boast? Of course it is. He can't do any of that stuff if he's also going to ram even more wealth upwards with his preposterous economic program. But, for the first time since I've been listening to him, Trump has stumbled into a rich vein of American political history and a productive maelstrom of American political gobbledygook, both of which have sustained the other ever since this nation was founded. “Of course, there is a dark side to this brand of populism. Germany in the 1930s comes to the mind of doom-mongers like myself. It would be absurd for Donald Trump to go even more all-out racist and anti-Semite on the country at this point. Besides, he can subcontract that job to his factions of his supporters on social media. But to hear him talk about the ‘collusion’ between the ‘special interests’ and the ‘corrupt media executives’ is to hear echoes of the shiny boots on cobblestones, without the inconvenient swastika armbands and militaristic brown uniforms. He will play that card as readily as he will talk about the new ‘American steel in the spine of the country.’ This is why he remains the most dangerous presidential candidate of my lifetime. “The bright vision coupled with the conspiratorial darkness in which Trump is now trafficking has sold well in this country since they first put it together. Trump will no doubt be selling it until Tuesday, November 8th. I cannot quite fathom how we have bungled things enough to have reached this point, to have such a diabolically awful candidate being opposed by one who has consistently showed herself to be naively carefree with the truth. But, given that we have this choice, this election is nowhere near over and one is left with the mantra of ‘May the less worse person win’.” Thanks for really scaring me, Buzzard.

It was a world he knew intimately. After 14 years at Ubisoft, AAA console development was Naud's bread and butter, and Montreal had a richer pool of suitable talent than anywhere else in the world. Then, the brief changed: Square Enix wanted its Montreal studio to shift focus to mobile. "It's something we wanted to do," Naud says, recalling the team's immediate enthusiasm for leaving its comfort zone. "We were still in pre-production for the next Hitman and we thought, let's try this. The mindset of the studio was very, very premium. The mindset was Montreal, actually. Montreal is premium. It's about big, blockbuster experiences." "The mindset of the studio was very, very premium. The mindset was Montreal, actually. Montreal is premium" The strategic shift didn't mean abandoning those premium values, however. Square Enix wanted to introduce AAA standards to the mobile market, an objective that Naud and his team were well equipped to satisfy. What they couldn't do was easily fit in with the prevailing trend towards free-to-play, a model that demands very specific skills and expertise. Square Enix Montreal had "the DNA to make premium games," Naud tells me, and Square Enix had the kind of IP that could justify a price-tag in a marketplace that seemed to have abandoned that concept altogether. The three games that followed have used Eidos' most storied franchises to create one of the most distinctive brands in mobile gaming - premium or otherwise. Hitman GO, Lara Croft GO and, most recently, Deus Ex GO were all built to get past what Naud describes as, "the curse with mobile." "There's so much content coming out that you're exposed to a lot, but it's not all good," he says. "On a given week where you might get featured by Apple, there's another 100 games that aren't at the same level of quality. The player might not be getting a great experience, especially the kind of player that will try a lot of free-to-play games without being really satisfied. It doesn't help the cycle. "We are running a successful business with premium games. It's challenging. I won't deny it, because yeah, the market has evolved [towards free-to-play], but if you look only a few years back traditional handheld consoles were 20% of the console market. There are people who are looking for high quality experiences on the go." There is something gratifyingly old-school about Square Enix Montreal's business strategy as Naud describes it; a call-back to the days of bricks, mortar and plastic boxes in a marketplace where spending millions of dollars on user acquisition is de rigeur. "We've heavily invested to make the best premium games out there," he says. "This helps us get press coverage, Apple and Google coverage, Editor's Choice, Game of the Year, Apple Design Awards. It establishes our products as games that people need to play on mobile. That has always been our strategy, and that will be our strategy going forward. "We are used to designing enclosed experiences, with a start and an end. With free-to-play you need to design a never-ending game" "We always knew that Apple would support high quality products. In a survey of our players, we found that half of them discovered our games through the app stores. But one quarter still came from the press: because of our IP, because we talked a lot to the gaming press, because we are at all of the events. We get that extra reach." Naud doesn't attempt to mask the advantages that Square Enix Montreal enjoys. There is no doubt that the studio has made three games that compare favourably to the vast majority of mobile releases, but the importance of having iconic names like Hitman, Deus Ex and Lara Croft attached cannot be underestimated. Nevertheless, some insight can be gleaned from that success, not least that the support of the enthusiast press can still make a significant difference to mobile sales. Indeed, a lack of ease with the free-to-play model is a major contributor to the dearth of mobile games coverage on so many of the biggest enthusiast websites. Speaking from experience, games journalists are simply more comfortable with writing about premium products. Square Enix Montreal simply gave those journalists an increasingly rare opportunity to do so. Nevertheless, with Deus Ex GO, Square Enix Montreal has used its observations of free-to-play to address a shortcoming of the series' previous two entries. "We are used to designing enclosed experiences, with a start and an end," Naud says, referring to his team's track record of AAA console titles. "With free-to-play you need to design a never-ending game. The GO series was all about having a beginning, an end, we had a story. But one of the issues we have is that a lot of people know about the games, but when they are done with the content after eight hours, what can they do? There's not enough replayability. It's hard to be an evangelist for a game you're not playing any more." Following "great" launch periods, the sales of both Hitman GO and Lara Croft GO started to fall away. In an era defined by digital distribution, when a given product's tail could theoretically stretch on for years, the fact that two highly praised and widely promoted releases followed a similar sales pattern to a boxed AAA console game was a clear indication of opportunity missed. With that in mind, Deus Ex GO features a level editor, allowing its players to create and share their own puzzles, and Naud's team to quickly and easily generate new content. The content plan is based on the New York Times crossword, Naud says, with increasingly difficult puzzles released throughout the week, building to a final puzzle on Friday that will take an entire weekend to solve. "Deus Ex: Go is a premium game, at a premium price, but we focused a lot on long-term retention" "Deus Ex Go is a premium game, at a premium price, but we focused a lot on long-term retention," he says. "We've been learning. Deus Ex Go takes all of our learning from Hitman and Lara Croft to offer a product that people will talk about, that will get full press coverage, that will get front page of the App Store when it comes out and hopefully pick up some awards. But we'll also engage players on a longer time scale. We believe that having a game that is always active will help drastically with organic downloads down the road." Naud won't be drawn on what comes next for the GO series, but one need only look at the Square Enix IP library to see the possibilities. What is certain, though, is that the Montreal studio will continue to build premium products, offering a counterpoint to the idea that mobile games with a price-tag are long since dead. Indeed, Naud now oversees two other mobile teams in London and Copenhagen, and there is no shortage of support from the very top of Square Enix. "We invest a lot more in our products than most of our competitors, so we feel like every product we put out there has a chance of succeeding," Naud says. "It's not every company that would allow us to spend so much effort on premium. "We are being told to succeed in mobile. Greenlight. Go. Go. Make great games."

There's just one catch - they'll need to be ANZ customers with a Visa or debit card. "We are so excited to be able to welcome Apple Pay to New Zealand - it's even more exciting that ANZ is the first bank in New Zealand to offer Apple Pay to our customers," says Liz Maguire, head of Digital and Transformation at ANZ. Apple Pay is the only mobile payment system that will work on iPhones. It's available on the iPhone 6 and later models, the Apple Watch and newer iPads. Unlike other mobile payment systems, it doesn't require users to open up an app on their phone. They simply hover the device over a contactless terminal and then authenticate the purchase with their fingerprint. If the purchase amount is more than $80, they will also be prompted to enter a pin. Credit card details aren't stored or passed onto the retailer. They're just entered once, when first setting up, and the bank then issues a unique number. "It's so quick and it's so convenient," Ms Maguire says.  "The phone knows it's near a terminal and wakes up - you don't even have to wake up your phone, it's really fantastic." The devices contain 'Near Field Communication' chips, meaning there is no need for an internet connection to make a payment. The Apple Watch can be used to make a payment without the person having to carry their phone. Ms Maguire says there's already been great feedback on social media since the announcement. "We know that there's lots of customers that are really keen to use this new service," she says. With more than 50 percent of the bank's Visa transactions already contactless, it expects Apple Pay to be popular. Kiwis with Android phones currently have a choice of using mobile payment apps offered by individual banks. Semble, a locally developed app for android phones, was shelved this year after low take up and Google's offering, Android Pay, already available in Australia, has yet to arrive here. ANZ in Australia reported a surge in applications for credit cards and deposit accounts after it introduced Apple Pay last year, which has forced the other major banks to re-enter negotiations with the technology giant. The main issue seems to be how to divide up the billions of dollars of fee income banks earn from processing payments. Other New Zealand banks are likely to be watching ANZ's progress here with interest. Newshub.

Politics 'We're called redneck, ignorant, racist. That's not true': Trump supporters explain why they voted for him ENTERTAINMENT MUSIC Low-price Amazon Music Unlimited streaming service looks to take on Spotify and Apple Music Amazon Music Jacob Thomas Amazon has announced the arrival of Amazon Music Unlimited, a new music streaming service. Amazon has announced the arrival of Amazon Music Unlimited, a new music streaming service. (Jacob Thomas) Randall Roberts Online retail giant Amazon unveiled on Wednesday the introduction of Amazon Music Unlimited, a full-catalog streaming service designed to compete in an already packed marketplace led by Spotify and Apple Music. The service will be offered through a tiered pricing system that undercuts its competition, in the process further disrupting the market. Specifically, said Amazon, subscribers of its Amazon Prime program can get the full service for $7.99 per month (or $79 per year), and Prime members who own the popular Echo hands-free speaker unit can subscribe for $3.99 per month.  At that latter price, the service will deliver the same millions of songs as its competition, but will do so for $6 a month less than the industry-standard $9.99 charged by Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal and others. Amazon will offer its service at that same $9.99-per-month price for non-Prime members. The news comes during what promises to be an active period for streaming platforms. In addition to Amazon’s announcement, online radio giant Pandora, which counts about 78 million users for its free platform, has confirmed that it will begin offering an on-demand service before the end of 2016. In addition, speculation rose over the summer that German streaming site Soundcloud was seeking suitors, and that Jay-Z's Tidal service was in talks with Apple. No deals have been struck, however, and the companies have declined to confirm negotiations.  Amazon’s initiative isn’t its first foray into music streaming. Prime subscribers already have access to a limited selection of approximately 2 million songs. But the company is betting that it can draw subscribers by tempting them with an Echo, and have designed Amazon Music Unlimited to communicate seamlessly with that device. For example, rather than searching the millions of songs, users can ask Echo’s Alexa voice control system to play a playlist based on mood or genre. Through voice commands, It can recommend new songs, find and play tracks based on lyrics and respond to general commands such as, “play music.”   Those who expect the device to then pull out a banjo to play “Foggy Mountain Breakdown,” however, still have a few years to wait.  Caption 'Arrival' movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews 'Arrival' directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker, Michael Stuhlbarg, Tzi Ma, and Mark O’Brien.

Apple and Google are both applying machine learning to organize your pictures and video, and along the way, help you rediscover last year's vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. (AP Photo/Anick Jesdanun) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........NEW YORK — If you’re like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you’ve posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don’t have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called “machine learning” to organize your pictures and video — and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple’s tools are part of last month’s iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories — and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here’s a look at how they take you down memory lane: Advertisement Continue reading ___ APPLE’S MEMORIES Apple’s new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn’t just a slideshow. There’s slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you’re ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file — so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple’s app created a “Florida to Illinois” package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a “Together” package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an “At The Beach” package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to “Related.” You can also add or delete images within Memories — in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let’s face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren’t necessarily ones I’d choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they’re presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually … someday. Advertisement Continue reading ___ GOOGLE’S ASSISTANT Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image . Unlike typical “GIF” animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady — without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google’s Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation — although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn’t require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google’s choices aren’t necessarily ones I’d make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called “Rediscover this day.” Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you’ll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. Advertisement Continue reading ___ SEARCHING Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple’s version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. ___ STORAGE To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you’re online. Advertisement Continue reading Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition — good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple’s iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos. ___ Online: Apple Memories video from January trip: https://youtu.be/dkm99o8tL88 Google animation of fountains: https://goo.gl/photos/p1iL9STfCmqhxxGx6 Google collage: https://goo.gl/photos/zkn1ZcLAPTqRQoJh7 Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Technology Suggested Stories: Review: Slick iOS 7 shines on Apple's new iPhones – Sep 11, 2013 Review: Refinements add up in new Mac system – Oct 23, 2013 Review: Google photo service is strong on search – Jul 23, 2015 Apple makes Siri smarter, rolls out software improvements – Jun 13, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Apple To Open Second R&D Center In China Posted: Oct 12 2016, 11:43am CDT | by IANS, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   In a fresh move to bolster its ties with China, Apple has announced it would open a research and development centre in Shenzhen -- the hardware manufacturing hub for the world, media reported on Wednesday. Don't Miss: The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals It is the second R&D centre in China announced by the Cupertino-based tech giant lately. "We are excited to be opening a new Research and Development centre here next year so our engineering team can work even more closely and collaboratively with our manufacturing partners," an Apple spokesperson told Quartz. "The Shenzhen centre, along with the Beijing centre, is also aimed at strengthening relationships with local partners and universities as we work to support talent development across the country," the spokesperson added. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly met government officials to formally announce the new centre. "Today, when it comes to manufacturing, Shenzhen is still a very important city for us -- we now employ over 100,000 workers," Cook was quoted as saying. Shenzhen is home to key Chinese tech companies like Huawei and social media giant Tencent. According to an earlier report in China Daily, the Beijing facility will be set up in Wangjing area. "The centre will have nearly 500 employees and the total investment will eventually reach 300 million yuan ($45 million)," the administrative committee of Zhongguancun Science Park posted on social media. Zhongguancun Science Park has 40 premier universities and colleges such as Peking University and Tsinghua University as well as more than 200 scientific institutions. "The centre will focus on developing computers, softwares, audio and video devices as well as other consumer electronics," the report added. During his China visit in August, Cook pledged to set up a full-fledged research and development facility in the country. In May, Apple invested $1 billion into Didi Chuxing, China's biggest ride-hailing platform. Apple and Chinese bank card association UnionPay Shoppers also launched Apple Pay earlier this year. Cook last year said China would be Apple's largest market within two years and that the number of Apple stores in China would almost double to 40 within that time frame.

Semiconductors have fallen about 2.75 percent in October with one of the biggest names, Qualcomm, dropping almost 4 percent during the same time. The Apple supplier had just seen its stock surge at the end of September after news of a possible $30 billion acquisition of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors. But since then, Qualcomm has dropped and traders have decided it's time to opt out. While the stock saw two times its average daily call volume on Tuesday, Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com points out that the volume was more due to traders "selling out of prior bullish bets." For instance, one trader sold to close 2,000 of the January 67.5-strike calls at $2.42 when the stock sat at $65.50 in the afternoon. However, it does remain to be seen what happens out of Qualcomm's possible acquisition of NXP Semiconductors. "Who knows what they end up paying for them," said Nathan Tuesday on CNBC's "Fast Money." "But I think it does make sense if you're playing for further upside in Qualcomm to be long calls rather than stock right here."

Multimedia, audio quality8. Camera9. ConclusionApple iPhone 7 Plus specificationUser opinions and reviewsReview comments (233) Introduction The iPhone 7 Plus hardly needs an introduction. Apple's latest always get the attention no matter how much or how little the company has changed. An aura of controversy has always been part of Apple's marketing and some might argue that the polarized opinions actually work in their favor. And the iPhone 7 duo tops the polarizing scale this season thanks to ditching the standard audio jack and the iconic hardware key. It seems this doesnt get in the way of the iPhone providing superb performance and superb user experience for yet another year in a row. Weve already brought you the iPhone 7 review, and now its time for its bigger sibling. Compared to its predecessor, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with a more refined design, it packs even more processing power, and ups the game with a new dual-camera setup on the back. And while the 7+ isn't the first to slap two snappers next to each other, it is the first to attach telephoto lens onto one of these. And did we mention its waterproof now? The iPhone 7 Plus is certainly a nice upgrade over the 6s Plus even if, the design and screen bezels are the same for the third year in a row. Key features Water-proof metal unibody with redesigned, less-obtrusive antenna strips 5.5" 16M-color LED-backlit IPS LCD screen of 1080p resolution, 401ppi, wide color gamut, 3D Touch tech Pressure-sensitive Home key powered by a brand new Taptic Engine Quad-core (2+2) 64-bit Apple CPU, hexa-core GPU, 3GB of RAM, Apple A10 Fusion SoC Dual 12MP camera: wide-angle F/1.8 + telephoto F/2.8, easy switch and live bokeh effects, optical image stabilization, quad-LED flash, phase detection auto focus, wide color capture, face and body detection; 2160p@30fps video recording 7MP F/2.2 front-facing camera with BSI sensor and HDR mode, 1080p@30fps video Comes in 32, 128, and 256GB of built-in storage Second-gen Touch ID fingerprint sensor 4G LTE Cat.9 (600Mbps); Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac; Bluetooth 4.2; Lightning port; GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS; NFC (Apple Pay only) 2,900mAh battery Main disadvantages No 3.5mm audio jack (ships with a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter) No microSD slot NFC functionality limited to Apple Pay Still no fast or wireless charging, no IR port or FM radio No user-replaceable battery Scratch-prone Jet Black model Last year's snap-on cases won't fit the iPhone 7 Plus due to the different camera module footprint Indeed, a lot has changed since last year, but you can tell Apple is holding something back. Whether the company is keeping its best game for the iPhone's tenth anniversary next year, or just don't want to give it all at once, it doesn't really matter. If it weren't for the new Black editions, you can hardly tell the new iPhones from the previous generation. Same shape, same looks, same big screen bezels. The list of omissions is shrinking with each year, but it's still far from a short one. But then again, opting for Apple has its ups and downs, and the latter don't come cheap. In order to keep iOS free of bugs, glitches, and throttles, Apple still poses lots of restrictions to both developers and users. But these are hardly a surprise to anyone, so let's not dwell on what can't be changed right now. Stays with us right after the break to see what's new, what got better, and what's gone for good.

The music service is being positioned to compete against existing services such as Spotify and Apple Music. (Amazon Music via AP) AP i By MAE ANDERSON AP Technology Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK Amazon is launching a paid streaming music service, the latest entry in an increasingly crowded field. Amazon Music Unlimited is being positioned to compete against existing services such as Spotify and Apple Music. It will cost $8 per month, or $80 a year, for members of Amazon’s $99-a-year Prime loyalty program. Non-Prime members will pay $10 a month, the same monthly fee charged by Spotify and Apple Music. Owners of Amazon’s Echo smart speaker, meanwhile, will be able to get the unlimited music service on one device for $4 per month. The steaming service is one more perk – like two-day free shipping and Amazon Video – that the Seattle-based company hopes will attract people to its Prime program and thus encourage them to spend more on its flagship site. Amazon already offers Amazon Prime Music for free to Prime members, but that includes about two million songs, while the new service boasts a catalog of “tens of millions” of songs. “Think of this as two different levels: Prime is now the introductory service and Unlimited is the full service,” said Steve Boom, Amazon’s vice president of digital music. The service’s launch comes as the way people listen to music is changing. According to Nielsen, during the first half of 2016, digital purchasing of single tracks was down 24 percent and digital albums were down 18 percent, while streaming was up 59 percent, compared with the same period a year ago. “The recorded music industry has been fumbling for a digital business model that really works, and I think streaming has come into its own,” said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna. In fact, streaming of audio has eclipsed video streaming, according to Nielsen. Audio’s share of streaming is 54 percent as of June 30, compared with 44 percent a year earlier. One way Amazon is hoping to stand out is with its Alexa voice control, via the Echo or other Alexa-enabled devices. Users can ask the Echo to play a certain song or playlist, but can also search for music just by saying they want to hear the “new” song by any artist, a genre of music from a certain decade, or by saying the lyrics of a song if they can’t remember the name.

October 12 AAPL: 117.34 1.04 Quick Review: You probably shouldn’t buy this awesome MacBook Pro MagSafe 2/ 5-port USB Charger Seth Weintraub - 1 month ago @llsethj MacBook Pro USB-C MagSafe MagSafe 2 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit After a lot of abuse, my MacBook Pro’s 85W MagSafe 2 adapter finally died last week. Often Apple adapters fray at joints and this one did to an insane degree but somehow it kept working for 3 years through tons of travel, work and even some fun. My MagSafe needs to last another month. What’s the over/under? https://t.co/dZeV3ZHz1Z pic.twitter.com/EnKkmdX0d6 — Seth Weintraub (@llsethj) September 29, 2016 So what to do? Typically I’d buy a new Apple Magsafe 2 adapter. But clearly Apple has some redesigned MacBook/Pro/Airs coming later this month and they will likely be charged via USB-C, at least in some cases. So that means I only need MagSafe to power this 2013 MacBook Pro for at least a few more weeks before it gets relegated to backup machine, kid’s computer or sold off when I get Apple’s new OLED/USB-C creation. So I thought I’d get a little creative and save a few bucks at the same time. As I was looking for options on Amazon, I came across an interesting product: The “BND 85W MagSafe 2 Replacement Power Adapter Charger w/ 5 USB Ports for Apple MacBook Pro”. For less than half the price of a discounted $77 Apple MagSafe Adapter this $37 charger includes 5 USB ports and gets solid 4.3/5 star reviews. What the heck, I’ll give it a try… A week in, all is well. It shipped quick in easy to open packaging and the product feels solid.  My 2013 15″ Retina MacBook Pro charges just as fast as it did with the Apple MagSafe 2 adapter and I’m able to keep a number of USB devices plugged at the same time or when my MacBook isn’t around.  Keep in mind that this thing only directs 4.5A of power to the USB section which means even though this thing has 5 ports, you will only be able to fast charge (>2A) about 2 USB devices at a time. The MacBook charger which plugs in via a dedicated 4.5A x 19V = 85.5W port doesn’t slow down and is on a different circuit from the USB ports. It has worked well so far. When you charge a bunch of things,  like the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro at the same time (image below), things get a little warm – but if I recall not any warmer than the power adapter it replaced. For me, this is just to tide me over for a few months while I wait for Apple’s new MacBook Pros, but I could see using this as a secondary or travel MagSafe Adapter. The catch is that obviously this isn’t an Apple approved MagSafe implementation and therefore I must add that this could burn your neighborhood down or something. Originally Apple protected its MagSafe products pretty vigorously even though it is a dumb charging port standard, unlike Lightning for example. Apple even went so far as to sue battery maker Hyper for making a MagSafe battery which forced them into a complicated workaround (interestingly, the MagSafe cable included here works with the excellent Hyperjuice batteries!). Lately however, tons of Magsafe adapters have been showing up on Amazon and elsewhere. It isn’t clear why Apple has stopped threatening all of these unlicensed third party makers of MagSafe power adapters, but perhaps MagSafe is on the way out. That would be a shame because the technology has saved a few of my Macs from being thrown onto the floor. To summarize: Yes, this is an awesome solution for charging not just a MacBook Pro but a bunch of USB things like iPads and iPhones, but maybe you shouldn’t buy it because Apple might be getting rid of MagSafe and it isn’t “MagSafe Compliant” – nothing not made by Apple is.  If these are indeed the last days of MagSafe, I’m going out in style with this $37 BND 85W MagSafe 2 Replacement Power Adapter Charger w/ 5 USB Ports for Apple MacBook Pro.     Guides MacBook Pro View THe Guide USB-C View THe Guide MagSafe View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Software Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Laptop News / Is this Apple’s new MacBook keyboard design? – update Is this Apple’s new MacBook keyboard design? – update by Sean Keach 13 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Update: A Sonder spokesperson has confirmed to TrustedReviews that the company did recently attend Foxconn’s Innoconnn demo day, and that Sonder is currently closing procurement contracts with three third-party laptop companies “to integrate our technology into their products”. On the matter of Apple, the spokesperson added: “Sonder has been in discussions with Apple’s procurement board regarding Sonder’s laptop module. Foxconn International Holdings and E Ink Holdings – both strategic partners of Sonder Design Pty. Ltd. are assisting with the above discussions." We've asked Apple for comment on this again, and we've also asked Foxconn for confirmation of Sonder's claims. Original Article: Apple may be planning to introduce a customisable keyboard, according to a tipster from China. A Reddit user has posted seemingly intimate details about a new keyboard design that may be rolled out on future MacBook laptops. The poster, who is named only as ‘Foxconninsider’, claims that chief Apple supplier Foxconn showed off secret Apple designs at the Tsinghua University campus in China, where he supposedly works. According to the user, Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn hosted a demo day on the campus, where an Australian start-up called Sonder was present. Sonder hit the headlines last year after revealing a smart keyboard module that feature a backlit e-ink display that allowed for shortcut- and language-swapping. Sonder's keyboard is customisable, allowing you to swap out different languages and shortcuts The users claims that an executive from Foxconn said Apple’s Procurement Board Office “was closing an acquisition” for Sonder, a company that Foxconn itself has invested in. He also claims that he saw DFT (design for testing) versions of the new MacBook keyboard module, as well as Apple’s 2018 E Ink Magic Keyboard. The moderators of the /r/Apple subreddit have verified the identity of the Reddit user, but obviously weren’t able to confirm that the information provided in his post that relates to Apple was accurate. In any case, Sonder’s technology does sound very interesting. Here’s a quick demonstration of the technology: “The Sonder keyboard is performance and design, right at your fingertips,” reads a description the Sonder website. “We meticulously designed and engineered the Sonder keyboard, from the inside out. The final product is an advanced, elegant keyboard with transparent keys and a bespoke display that’s as much a work of art as it is state of the art.” Unfortunately, there’s no guarantee that the Apple MacBook or Magic Keyboard will ever feature the technology. For a start, we don’t know whether Apple really plans to invest in the company, and even if it does, that doesn’t mean we’ll ever see the designs debuted in genuine Apple products. Take this report with a healthy degree of scepticism. However, we are expecting a MacBook redesign to launch later this month, at least according to rumours. It’s said that Apple plans to replace the top row of function keys on the MacBook with a touch-friendly OLED display. This secondary screen will show notifications, and also offer up customisable buttons, if recent reports are to be believed. We’ve asked Apple and Sonder for comment and will update this article with any response.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Apple event’s secret MacBook accessories detailed in brief Eric Abent - Oct 12, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If you believe the talk, Apple isn’t quite done with product announcements for 2016. Even though the announcement and launch of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are in the bag, Apple is said to be hosting another event before the year is out to reveal, among other things, a revamped MacBook. If a new leak is to be believed, however, hardware refreshes aren’t the only thing Apple is plotting to reveal at this event. In a post to the Apple subreddit, a user by the name of Foxconninsider has posted details on two incoming Apple components. After their identity was confirmed by subreddit moderators, Foxconninsider wrote that they work for Tsinghua University which, as they describe it, is “like Chinese MIT.” It was there that the poster attended a Foxconn presentation that showed off the keyboard module for the new Macbook and a separate keyboard that might serve as the next iteration of the Magic Keyboard. We’ve heard about the new MacBook keyboard in the past, with multiple rumors claiming that it’ll sport an secondary OLED display that can offer different buttons depending on the app that’s running. What’s particularly interesting about this leak are the details on the new Magic Keyboard. The device is said to take the idea of the new MacBook’s OLED panel one step further, giving each button on the keyboard an individual e-ink display. The keyboard is made by a startup called Sonder, which Apple is currently in the process of acquiring. After subscribing to Sonder’s mailing list, Foxconninsider received a very brief video of the e-ink keyboard in action, which you can see above. Should this leak prove to be a product that Apple is actually planning to launch, then the new Magic Keyboard would offer a certain level of customization that’s hard to find in other keyboards on the market. Still, what we’re seeing is a very early prototype, and it’s said that Apple won’t release a new Magic Keyboard until sometime in 2018. With that in mind, don’t be too shocked if we close out 2016 without any official confirmation from Apple. If we catch wind that Apple has succeeded in its buyout of Sonder, though, it seems like we’ll have a pretty good idea of what’s going on behind the scenes. Stay tuned.

 Hillary Clinton's campaign drew inspiration from the Apple logo Kif Leswing Oct. 12, 2016, 12:12 PM 3,824 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Illustration Apple has one of the strongest brands in the world, with surveys frequently ranking it as the most valuable global brand. So it's no surprise that Hillary Clinton's campaign for president might want to "think different" and take a little bit of inspiration from the iPhone maker.  Wendy Clark, a marketing executive who is currently CEO of DDB, compared Clinton's "window logo" in development at the time to Apple's famous rainbow logo in an email included in the John Podesta emails leaked by Wikileaks.  Clark had been rumored to be working on Clinton's campaign. In her self-described "branding diatribe," she explains that although Apple's logo has nothing to do with computers, it has become associated with its products — the same way Clark hoped that Hillary's logo would become associated with her campaign and policy positions.  "Similarly, Apple, the world’s most valuable brand, launched with their rainbow apple mark in 1976. It simply stood for creativity, thinking differently," Clark wrote. (The rainbow Apple logo was actually introduced in 1977, and was retired in 1998.) "Their repeated, consistent use of the mark along with some of the world’s most creative advertising has imbued that bitten apple logo with meaning but no one would look at that mark standalone and say it means Apple is the leader in human-centered designed, electronic devices with a vision for the future," she concluded.  When the email was sent, in February 2015, it was still months before Clinton officially announced her bid, and the logo had yet to be finalized. In fact, the leaked messages discuss potential changes.  "We want to create a visual representation for Secretary Clinton that is equally as compelling, interesting, exciting and inviting as Obama’s mark was eight years ago. And to use techniques that some of the best brands have done and continue to do around the world," Clark concludes, also comparing the logo to Target's.  The "window logo" they are discussing sounds a lot like the campaign's official logo, which was revealed in April to high praise.

Butler plans first Apple Fest Courtney Day , Reporter 12:08 p.m. EDT October 12, 2016 After launching a new community festival last year, the Butler Area Merchant's Association added a theme for the event and is inviting the community to the 2016 Butler Apple Fest Oct. 14 and 15. (Photo: Submitted) 627 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE BUTLER - Apple season in Johnny Appleseed country calls for an apple-themed festival, the Butler Merchant's Association believes. The first event of its kind in Butler will be Friday and Saturday and will feature rides, food vendors, contests and entertainment. The village will close Main Street downtown to make room for the festivities. Rides will be stationed in the Richland Bank branch parking lot, and a Civil War encampment will be set up in Hitchman Park. Several years after Butler Old Fashioned Days fell by the wayside, the Merchant's Association started a new festival, Butler Community Fest, in 2015. The idea was to foster community and promote local businesses and organizations. The volunteer-run event was fairly successful in its first year, and the association decided to add a theme this year, making it the Butler Apple Fest. "We liked the apple theme because it's fall and because the town's motto is 'The Core of Appleseed Country,'" said Natasha Waltz, secretary of the Butler Merchant's Association. Event organizers tried to plan a variety of activities to please all ages and all types of festival-goers. Festivities will kick off with an opening ceremony at 2 p.m. Friday, featuring village mayor Kin Kinley. Also Friday afternoon, a Johnny Appleseed lookalike contest winner will be selected from among grade level winners chosen at Butler Elementary School. The school will have an early dismissal time Friday to allow students to enjoy the fest. Magician Mike Hemmelgarn will perform at 4 p.m. Friday. A returning favorite from last year's community fest, Hemmelgarn mixed comedy, juggling, ventriloquism and audience participation into his shows. At 5 p.m. on the main stage, each contestant for the Miss Butler Apple Fest pageant will be asked two questions. Following the interviews, a winner will be crowned. The fest will feature a Civil War encampment Friday night, and Civil War storyteller Steve Ball will speak at 6 p.m. Headlining the evening is a musical performance by Red Ball Jets at 8 p.m. The festival continues Saturday with a 9 a.m. 5K race. Registration for the race starts at 7:30 a.m. The $20 registration fee includes a t-shirt, and proceeds go to the Merchant's Association to support future festivals. A "Kenducky Derby" race will be at 10 a.m. Saturday. Rubber ducks will be available for a donation during the fest Friday or at local merchants in advance of the fest. The ducks will be dumped in the river, and the owner of the first duck to cross the finish line will win half the money collected through duck sales. A book sale will be held at Mansfield Richland County Public Library's Butler branch from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. A parade will begin at noon Saturday, starting from Butler Elementary School and travelling down Main Street. The parade lineup includes Miss Butler Apple Fest, representatives from local law enforcement and first responder agencies, politicians, tractors and floats created by families and community organizations. Pedal pull races will begin at 2 p.m. Saturday. Winners of the apple dessert baking contest will be announced at 2:30 p.m. Anyone who wishes to take part in the contest may drop off an apple dessert between 10 and 11 a.m. at Weekley Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram of Butler. Desserts will be sold in a bake sale to benefit the association and the fest. An apple fritter eating contest will begin at 3:30 p.m. and will be followed by a bath tub race at 4 p.m. Teams of two contestants will be provided a tub outfitted with wheels and filled with water and apples. While one person sits in the tub, the other drives the tub. The team with the fastest time to the finish line wins. Rib Ticklers will perform at 4 p.m. Saturday. Headlining the evening will be Amy Sailor at 8 p.m. A flower show will be held in the Butler Clearfork Adult Center and a kids' art show will be at Weekley's. Both shows will run from 2 to 7 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday.

The company is rumored to be planning a press conference later this month at which it may unveil a number of updated products in its Mac lineup. The star of the show, if recent reports pan out, will be a completely redesigned MacBook Pro with a special secondary touchscreen display above the standard keyboard that will be home to a row of morphing function keys. Rumor has it this screen will show different keys depending on which app is being used, opening up a wide range of new functionality for MacBook Pro owners. But according to a new report, that’s not the only innovative new peripheral Apple is has in development right now. DON’T MISS: Does the iPhone 7 have any competition now that the Note 7 is dead? An anonymous Reddit user named “Foxconninsider” took to the site early Wednesday morning with some very intriguing claims. She says she works at Tsinghua University, which she notes is “like the Chinese MIT.” The user supplied some evidence to Reddit moderators behind the scenes, and they have since vouched for him and confirmed his identity. Foxconninsider says that Foxconn hosted a closed-doors event at the University recently, during which representatives from the manufacturing giant allegedly showed off prototypes of two unreleased Apple products. Foxconn, as most readers will recall, is Apple’s main manufacturing partner and it builds a number of Apple devices at its various facilities. The first unreleased device Foxconn supposedly had on display was the “new Macbook keyboard module” expected to appear on Apple’s next-generation MacBook Pro. As we’ve seen in mockups of the new MacBook Pro created by well-known designer Martin Hajek, the OLED function key panel is shaping up to be one of the most exciting new laptop features we’ve seen in years. But we already knew that. In addition to the new OLED panel expected to hit the next MacBook Pro, the Redditor also claims to have seen a second new Apple device that no one even knew was in development. The device in question, according to his claims, was a very early prototype of a next-generation Magic Keyboard. Apple’s current Magic Keyboard is a simple wireless keyboard model that users are quite familiar with at this point. According to Foxconninsider’s claims though, the new model features some exciting new technology that could completely change the way people use their Macs. Carrying forth a concept similar to what we’re expecting from the OLED panel on the MacBook Pro, Apple’s next-generation Magic Keyboard accessory will supposedly feature an individual E Ink display on every single key. This way, the graphics on individual keys or groups of keys can change depending on a person’s needs or the application currently in use. The anonymous Redditor said that Apple is working with a startup called Sonder on the keyboard, and she said that Apple is currently in the process of acquiring the startup. The video below shows Sonder’s current E Ink keyboard to give you an idea of what to expect, though Foxconninsider wrote in a later post that Apple’s next-generation Magic Keyboard could feature color E Ink instead of grayscale. According to the post, Apple plans to release its new Magic Keyboard sometime in 2018.

Non-Prime members will pay $10 a month, the same monthly fee charged by Spotify and Apple Music, while owners of Amazon's Echo smart speaker will be able to get the unlimited music service on one device for $4 per month. Scroll down for video This image provided by Amazon Music shows a display of Amazon Music Unlimited, a paid streaming music service Amazon is launching. The music service is being positioned to compete against existing services such as Spotify and Apple Music. It will cost $8 per month, or $80 a year, for members of Amazon¿s $99-a-year Prime loyalty program. Non-Prime members will pay $10 a month, the same monthly fee charged by Spotify and Apple Music. HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?  It will cost $8 per month, or $80 a year, for members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime loyalty program.  Non-Prime members will pay $10 a month, the same monthly fee charged by Spotify and Apple Music. Owners of Amazon's Echo smart speaker, meanwhile, will be able to get the unlimited music service on one device for $4 per month. 'Amazon Music Unlimited brings real value to the millions of people who are already Prime members,' said Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos. 'And if you want a sense of the future of voice-controlled music, go ahead and ask Alexa (Amazon's digital personal assistant) for a free Music Unlimited trial, and play around on your Echo,' Bezos said. 'If you don't know the name of a song but know a few lyrics, if you want to hear songs from a specific decade, or even if you're looking for music to match your mood, just ask.'

Share this article Share 17 shares The steaming service is one more perk — like two-day free shipping and Amazon Video — that the Seattle-based company hopes will attract people to its Prime program and thus encourage them to spend more on its flagship site.  Amazon already offers Amazon Prime Music for free to Prime members, but that includes about two million songs, while the new service boasts a catalog of 'tens of millions' of songs. 'Think of this as two different levels: Prime is now the introductory service and Unlimited is the full service,' said Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of digital music. The service's launch comes as the way people listen to music is changing. According to Nielsen , during the first half of 2016, digital purchasing of single tracks was down 24 percent and digital albums were down 18 percent, while streaming was up 59 percent, compared with the same period a year ago. THE STREAMING MUSIC WARS  Amazon's new US offering comes a month after Sweden's Spotify said it had passed 40 million paying subscribers, consolidating its position as world leader in the streaming sector. Spotify stands well clear of its nearest rival Apple Music, which had some 15 million paying subscribers in June, but it has yet to post an annual profit, spending most of its revenue on compensating artists and rights-holders. Apple's Eddy Cue unveiled a major overhaul of Apple Music at the firm's WWDC in San Francisco earlier this year, which came after repeated complaints from customers over the streaming service Streaming music services are also offered by Google, Pandora and a number of other groups. Last month Norwegian media said the Tidal streaming service, owned by rap megastar Jay-Z, had posted heavy losses and was having problems making payments on time. HOW THE SERVICES COMPARE Service  Cost  Apple Music  $9.99 a month or $14.99 for a family plan (up to six family members) - both with a three-month free trial (£9.99 and £14.99 in UK) Tidal $9.95-a-month for standard sound quality and $19.99-a-month for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality' (£9.99 and £19.99 in the UK) Spotify   Free level with adverts, Premium $9.99-a-month service (£9.99 in the UK) Beats Music   $9.99-a-month or $99 per year Pandora  $4.99-a-month for Pandora's ad-free internet radio service Deezer  Free with adverts, $9.99-a-month for Premium+ (£9.99 in the UK) Rdio  Free with adverts, Rdio Unlimited costs $9.99 (£9.99 in the UK) and US users can also get Rdio Select for $3.99 a month with limited downloads Tidal had a major boost earlier in the year when Beyonce - who is married to Jay-Z - released her album 'Lemonade' exclusively on the service. 'The recorded music industry has been fumbling for a digital business model that really works, and I think streaming has come into its own,' said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna. In fact, streaming of audio has eclipsed video streaming, according to Nielsen. Audio's share of streaming is 54 percent as of June 30, compared with 44 percent a year earlier. But it still faces the music industry's problem of low margins, Verna said. 'There is definitely room to grow the pie simply because more and more music consumers are choosing this way of accessing their music,' he said.  WHAT IS AMAZON'S ECHO? The Amazon Echo and smaller Echo Dot speakers will be available in black or white. The Echo will cost £149.99 (€179.99) and will also be available for Prime customers at a reduced rate of £99 (€129.99) for a limited time. Amazon Echo is a voice-controlled smart speaker that works alongside a smartphone app. Using a virtual assistant called Alexa, the speaker can respond to voice commands from the user, such as setting an alarm or ordering a cab. Echo also works with services like Spotify as a 360-degree wireless speaker.  'But the potential rewards are not huge and infinite, they're sort of modest and there are already quite a few players in the space.' Most streaming services now offer similar catalogues of music and pricing is about the same. So services have differentiated by user interface, Verna said. One way Amazon is hoping to stand out is with its Alexa voice control, via the Echo or other Alexa-enabled devices.  Users can ask the Echo to play a certain song or playlist, but can also search for music just by saying they want to hear the 'new' song by any artist, a genre of music from a certain decade, or by saying the lyrics of a song if they can't remember the name. The service is available starting Wednesday in the U.S. and in the U.K., Germany and Austria this year.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 17 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Malcolm Turnbull accuses Lisa Wilkinson of 'interrogating' him Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

Amazon Music Unlimited is being positioned to compete against existing services such as Spotify and Apple Music. It will cost $8 per month, or $80 a year, for members of Amazon’s $99-a-year Prime loyalty program. Non-Prime members will pay $10 a month, the same monthly fee charged by Spotify and Apple Music. Owners of Amazon’s Echo smart speaker, meanwhile, will be able to get the unlimited music service on one device for $4 per month. Amazon Music Unlimited (click on image for complete screen shot) (Amazon Music via AP) |  The steaming service is one more perk – like two-day free shipping and Amazon Video – that the Seattle-based company hopes will attract people to its Prime program and thus encourage them to spend more on its flagship site. Amazon already offers Amazon Prime Music for free to Prime members, but that includes about two million songs, while the new service boasts a catalog of “tens of millions” of songs. “Think of this as two different levels: Prime is now the introductory service and Unlimited is the full service,” said Steve Boom, Amazon’s vice president of digital music. The service’s launch comes as the way people listen to music is changing. According to Nielsen, during the first half of 2016, digital purchasing of single tracks was down 24 percent and digital albums were down 18 percent, while streaming was up 59 percent, compared with the same period a year ago. “The recorded music industry has been fumbling for a digital business model that really works, and I think streaming has come into its own,” said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna. In fact, streaming of audio has eclipsed video streaming, according to Nielsen. Audio’s share of streaming is 54 percent as of June 30, compared with 44 percent a year earlier. But it still faces the music industry’s problem of low margins, Verna said. “There is definitely room to grow the pie simply because more and more music consumers are choosing this way of accessing their music,” he said. “But the potential rewards are not huge and infinite, they’re sort of modest and there are already quite a few players in the space.” Most streaming services now offer similar catalogues of music and pricing is about the same. So services have differentiated by user interface, Verna said. One way Amazon is hoping to stand out is with its Alexa voice control, via the Echo or other Alexa-enabled devices. Users can ask the Echo to play a certain song or playlist, but can also search for music just by saying they want to hear the “new” song by any artist, a genre of music from a certain decade, or by saying the lyrics of a song if they can’t remember the name. The service is available starting Wednesday in the U.S. and in the U.K., Germany and Austria this year. --Associated Press Comments Latest News view all Heavy Security As Sting Reopens Bat...09:01 AM, 11/13/16 |   Rocker Leon Russell Dies In Nashvil...08:39 AM, 11/13/16 |   Bikers Help Springsteen, Stranded O...07:01 AM, 11/13/16 |   Blake Shelton06:59 AM, 11/13/16 |   Rolling Stones Documentary To Scree...10:01 AM, 11/12/16 |   Beyoncé’s Family Helps Champion Bat...09:01 AM, 11/12/16 |   Ellie Goulding08:59 AM, 11/12/16 |   Texas Man Accused Of Stalking Taylo...08:01 AM, 11/12/16 |   Police Seek Stolen Image Of Bruce S...07:01 AM, 11/12/16 |   Lawyer: Cosby Expects To Be Cleared...06:01 AM, 11/12/16 |   Mint Condition05:59 AM, 11/12/16 |   Sting To Reopen Bataclan Hall 1 Yea...05:01 AM, 11/12/16 |   Frankie Ballard Is All ‘Heartland’05:01 PM, 11/11/16 |   ‘Death Of A Ladies Man’04:59 PM, 11/11/16 |   Los Campesinos!

May Not Be the Biggest Winner The real beneficiary of Samsung's struggles may be closer to home. Jamal Carnette (TMFJCar) Oct 12, 2016 at 10:50AM Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 has been recalled and discontinued. Image source: Samsung. Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are on a tremendous run. Over the last three months, shares of the consumer electronics company are up approximately 21% versus the S&P 500's gain of 2%. Even with the recent outperformance, Apple still trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.5, approximately half the valuation of the greater S&P 500's P/E ratio of 25. In the last month, Apple's returns have been turbocharged due to Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) struggles. In September, Samsung issued a voluntary recall for 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to a "minor flaw in the battery manufacturing process" that led to phones exploding. Samsung's situation took a turn for the worse when the company recently announced it would cease Galaxy Note 7 production after replacement units proved no safer than the initial models. Conventional wisdom states any loss for Samsung is Apple's gain, and that's most-likely true in some aspect. In the end, however, the biggest beneficiary of Samsung's struggles may be the company that provides Samsung's ecosystem: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Ecosystem is important as device and switching costs are increasing A base analysis of smartphones typically compares on-device features and specifications. While things like processing clock speed, camera megapixels, and design are important, in many cases the differences between premium smartphones are so minuscule they're unlikely to drive the buying decision on their own. What does drive the buying decision is the ability to quickly access photos, emails, and purchased content and to understand the device layout. The simple truth is the ecosystem -- the seamless experience between hardware, operating system, and content -- is becoming the true differentiator between smartphones more so than device specifications. And when it comes to ecosystem, the operating system is the key differentiator. While both Apple and Android-powered phones have taken steps to encourage cross-OS switchers, it's increasingly difficult for an Android user to become an iOS user, and vice versa, due to the increasing switching costs from cloud storage, purchased content (music, movies, and TV shows), and other OS-specific applications. Ecosystems have become so key to the buying decision that many smartphone users refer to themselves as "iOS-only" or "Android-only." Against that backdrop, it's likely Samsung's stumbles benefits other high-end Android smartphone vendors. Alphabet's new Google Pixel smartphone. Image Source: Alphabet Samsung's Note 7 disaster is good news for Alphabet Samsung's stumbles could not have occurred at a better time for Alphabet. The company's recently announced Google Pixel smartphone is a major step in Apple's direction. The company always had control over the operating system, but took a page from Apple by essentially taking control of the Pixel's hardware and software design to control the user experience. Why analysts have typically compared Samsung and Alphabet to Apple, the bigger risk for these Android partners is internal. A few years ago The Wall Street Journal [subscription required] reported Alphabet (then Google) was so scared of Samsung's Android dominance it actively encouraged other hardware partners to manufacture Android devices. On the other hand, Samsung is actively involved with its Tizen OS and even runs the company's smartwatches off of the Android competitor. More recently, apprehension between the two has ameliorated as a combination of Samsung market share losses (particularly at the low end) and Tizen's inability to gain a large following has resolved earlier concerns. Alphabet's Pixel smartphone appears to be a strong offering and should win over Samsung smartphone users that are looking to upgrade to an Android-powered smartphone. It's likely Apple will benefit from Samsung's struggles, but Alphabet's smaller-scale smartphone business will most likely get a larger boost.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

But the problems are just starting. Samsung still has a lot of work ahead to fix this mess, and the company stands to lose even more money in lost profit on top of the estimated $17 billion in missed sales because Samsung is going into the Christmas quarter without a hot new smartphone in stores. The worst thing about it as far as Samsung is concerned, however, is that the Galaxy Note 7 debacle might help Apple sell even more new iPhones. MUST SEE: This video might be our first look at a new Apple device no one even knew was in development Apple’s iPhone 7 isn’t expected to break iPhone sales record this quarter. But Brian White from Drexel Hamilton wrote in a note to investors seen by Barron's that Apple stands to sell at least 8 million more iPhones this year because of the mess with the Note 7. “With original market expectations for approximately 10-14 million Galaxy Note 7 units in H2:2016 (availability began on August 19), we believe Apple has an opportunity to pick up at least 8 million incremental units in CY:16.,” the analyst said. “Moreover, this fiasco could permanently damage the Samsung brand in the smartphone market, a big opportunity for Apple to gain market share.” Additionally, White also said that the iPhone 7 is already doing very well in markets around the world, including in China. “During our visit to over 30 smartphone stores and electronic retailers in Shenzhen this week, we could feel the momentum of Apple’s iPhone franchise and the struggles at some of its important competitors in China,” he wrote. "The iPhone 7 Plus is clearly favored over the iPhone 7 in China, while the two new black colors were the most popular." Moreover, two leading China-based telecom carriers said that iPhone 7 demand has exceeded last year's iPhone 6s demand. Samsung should indeed be worried about the quarter ahead.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Next-gen Magic Keyboard reportedly in the works with e-ink display on every single key By Christian Zibreg, Oct 12, 2016 Tweet 10 Comments According to a post by an anonymous user named “Foxconninsider” that surfaced Wednesday morning on Reddit, Apple is allegedly working with a startup called Sonder on a next-generation Magic Keyboard that’s supposedly outfitted with an individual e-ink display on every single key. Having e-ink-enhanced keys would let the graphics on each individual key change depending on the app currently in use. To me, that sounds a lot like an OLED strip that the rumor-mill believes will be debuting on the next MacBook Pro. The poster, who claims to work at Tsinghua University (it’s “like the Chinese MIT”), added that Apple is currently in the process of acquiring Sonder. BGR has more: “Foxconninsider” says that Foxconn hosted a closed-doors event at the University recently, during which representatives from the manufacturing giant allegedly showed off prototypes of two unreleased Apple products. Foxconn, of course, is Apple’s key manufacturing partner that assembles many of its devices at its various facilities scattered in China, Taiwan and elsewhere. The below video of Sonder’s current e-ink keyboard gives you an idea of what might be expected from the next Magic Keyboard. “Foxconninsider” claimed in another post that the rumored Apple keyboard refresh could use a color e-ink display on each key instead of a grayscale one. He added that Foxconn also had on display a “new Macbook keyboard module” that should appear on the next MacBook Pro (he’s likely referring to the rumored OLED touch bar replacing the row of function keys). For what it’s worth, Reddit moderators who saw evidence “Foxconninsider” provided have vouched for him and confirmed his identity. The new keyboard is reportedly coming sometime in 2018. The current Magic Keyboard costs $99 a pop and was last refreshed alongside other Magic accessories in October 2015 with a built-in lithium-ion battery, Bluetooth 4.0 with pairing via Lightning, a Lightning port for recharging, San Francisco typeface on the keys, sleek new design and more.

Scotow Getting the special functionality is cool but I think it’s not worth having cmd key vs windows key etc … Diego Milano I don’t know, I couldn’t tell since I never tried these keyboards; I’m using Logitech K810 and happy with it but I’ve never seen a keyboard as good as the diNovo Edge series they used to have a while ago. The new keyboards don’t last long… Tony Keep the same 99.99 pricetag and I’ll pick one of these up for my older imac, assuming they also allow it to be used connected via lightning/usb and not bluetooth. JohnS Would this even be backlight compatible? These days that’s really the only feature I look for in a keyboard. rockdude094 Imagine if the keyboard layout changes depending on if youre using windows or mac … therealjjohnson I guess thats cool. I dont really need it though… :D Ooh would be good for multiple key shortcuts, e.g. Hold command and then Z displays an undo symbol. Not sure Id like the beige colour though Stefano Dafuqqqqqq Leslie Bee This has many potential uses, including international keyboards and maybe even showing the font you’re using at the moment.

The company is rumored to be planning a press conference later this month at which it may unveil a number of updated products in its Mac lineup. The star of the show, if recent reports pan out, will be a completely redesigned MacBook Pro with a special secondary touchscreen display above the standard keyboard that will be home to a row of morphing function keys. Rumor has it this screen will show different keys depending on which app is being used, opening up a wide range of new functionality for MacBook Pro owners. But according to a new report, that's not the only innovative new peripheral Apple is has in development right now. DON'T MISS: Does the iPhone 7 have any competition now that the Note 7 is dead? An anonymous Reddit user named "Foxconninsider" took to the site early Wednesday morning with some very intriguing claims. She says she works at Tsinghua University, which she notes is "like the Chinese MIT." The user supplied some evidence to Reddit moderators behind the scenes, and they have since vouched for him and confirmed his identity. Foxconninsider says that Foxconn hosted a closed-doors event at the University recently, during which representatives from the manufacturing giant allegedly showed off prototypes of two unreleased Apple products. Foxconn, as most readers will recall, is Apple's main manufacturing partner and it builds a number of Apple devices at its various facilities. The first unreleased device Foxconn supposedly had on display was the "new Macbook keyboard module" expected to appear on Apple's next-generation MacBook Pro. As we've seen in mockups of the new MacBook Pro created by well-known designer Martin Hajek, the OLED function key panel is shaping up to be one of the most exciting new laptop features we've seen in years. But we already knew that. In addition to the new OLED panel expected to hit the next MacBook Pro, the Redditor also claims to have seen a second new Apple device that no one even knew was in development. The device in question, according to his claims, was a very early prototype of a next-generation Magic Keyboard. Apple's current Magic Keyboard is a simple wireless keyboard model that users are quite familiar with at this point. According to Foxconninsider's claims though, the new model features some exciting new technology that could completely change the way people use their Macs. Carrying forth a concept similar to what we're expecting from the OLED panel on the MacBook Pro, Apple's next-generation Magic Keyboard accessory will supposedly feature an individual E Ink display on every single key. This way, the graphics on individual keys or groups of keys can change depending on a person's needs or the application currently in use. The anonymous Redditor said that Apple is working with a startup called Sonder on the keyboard, and she said that Apple is currently in the process of acquiring the startup. The video below shows Sonder's current E Ink keyboard to give you an idea of what to expect, though Foxconninsider wrote in a later post that Apple's next-generation Magic Keyboard could feature color E Ink instead of grayscale. According to the post, Apple plans to release its new Magic Keyboard sometime in 2018.

Monday November 14, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage CULTURE MacBook Pro 2016 release dates: Apple expected to announce new MacBook this month Alsteine Diapana 12 October, 2016 10:24 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Reuters/Stephen Lam)MacBook Pro display at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco, California in June 2012. The Christmas Holiday season is waiting right around the corner and it seems like tech enthusiasts are expecting Apple and Microsoft to bring out new computers to celebrate the season. According to a report by BGR, gadget lovers may expect new computers to be revealed by competing tech moguls, Apple and Microsoft. Apple is going to hold an event on Oct. 27 on Thursday to announce its new MacBooks this year after moving its briefing for its company earnings from Oct. 27, to Oct. 25. Apparently, the move was made due to a conflict in the company's schedule, and while the issue was not explained by Apple, rumors have sprung that the move was because of an intent to hold an event to reveal the 2016 MacBook to the public. A radical redesign for the MacBook Pro is also expected to be unveiled at the event as well, along with a line of the other products Apple is preparing for its Mac brand. According to reports, the MacBook Pro 2016 is expected to be much lighter and a whole lot thinner than the line's older models, featuring a secondary OLED display that will take the place of the function key line in order to present shortcuts that are aware of their context. Microsoft, on the otherhand, is said to follow suit, with Paul Thurrott writing in a report that Microsoft is scheduling a major press conference a day before the expected MacBook 2016 announcement on Oct. 27. Held in New York City, the press conference will run on Oct. 26 with many anticipating the unveiling of a few new Surface gadgets like a few peripheral tech and the Surface All-in-One device. Meanwhile, in other MacBook Pro 2016 news, University Herald reports that others claim that Apple may delay the release of the device because of being undecided on whether to make use of the sixth Gen Skylake chips from Intel or the seventh Gen Kaby Lake processors.

How Key Features of Google Pixel, Apple iPhone 7 Stack Up As the fight for smartphone market share continues, we compare the latest handsets from Apple and Google and discuss the major similarities and differences between them. Which Operating System Do Customers Want? The Pixel and iPhone 7 come with the latest versions of their creators' mobile operating systems. On the iPhone side, users will find iOS 10, an operating system with enhanced Siri support, an improved Messages experience and rich notifications. The Google Pixel comes with Android's Nougat, which also has improved notifications and a nice design. Both operating systems are widely viewed as substantial improvements over last year's options. The Designs Should Be Considered The iPhone 7 and Google Pixel come with similar designs. Both devices are thin and have curved corners. However, the fingerprint sensor on the Pixel is on the back. On the iPhone 7, users will find the Touch ID sensor on the front below the screen. Both smartphones come with a metal body and mechanical buttons. Overall, both the iPhone 7 and Pixel are nice-looking handsets. Choose a Display Size It's important to draw some distinctions between screen size in the Pixel and iPhone 7. Apple's smartphone comes in two flavors, featuring 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens. The Pixel also has a 5.5-inch version, but its base model has a slightly larger screen, measuring 5 inches. Google has been quick to point out that distinction in its attempt at appealing to consumers and enterprise users. Consider the Carrier Options Apple's iPhone 7 is available to just about anyone. The smartphone is supported by all four major carriers in the United States, and customers can buy the unlocked model to put it on the network of their choosing. Google, however, has formed an exclusive partnership with Verizon, which will sell the smartphone in its stores. But, for those who don't want a Verizon-locked phone, Google is offering an unlocked version that can be used on other networks. Google Trumpets Unlimited Storage Google is offering free unlimited storage of photos and videos through its cloud-based servers. The move places the Pixel in stark contrast to the iPhone 7, which stores content locally. Users can also store their photos and videos in the cloud, but they need to pay a monthly fee for iCloud storage. Heavy picture-takers who want to save a little cash and storage, in other words, could benefit from owning a Pixel. How Important Is the Headphone Jack? If customers want a headphone jack, they'll need to buy the Google Pixel. In a move that surprised some, Apple shipped the iPhone 7 without a headphone jack, and users need an adapter that connects through the smartphone's Lightning port to use wired headphones. The Pixel, however, comes with a headphone jack, making it quite literally plug and play. Various App Options Available Software could prove to be a selling point for some customers. On the Google side, the Pixel offers support for the company's virtual reality service Daydream, as well as its virtual personal assistant Google Assistant. Users will also find Chrome, YouTube and other Google apps built in. The iPhone 7 comes with several Apple apps, including Maps, iTunes, Apple Music and Podcasts, among several others. An Eye on the Fisheye Both Apple and Google stake claim to the best smartphone camera on the market. Apple's iPhone 7 has a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with optical image stabilization. The larger iPhone 7 Plus offers two cameras to suppose wide-angle and telephoto shots. The Pixel has a 12.3-megapixel rear-facing camera and f/2.0 aperture for bright photos. Its large pixel support also works well in low-light conditions. Compare the Battery Life The Pixel comes with better battery life than the iPhone 7. According to Google, the smaller model can last for 26 hours of continuous cellular talk time and 13 hours of video playback. Those figures go up to 32 hours and 14 hours, respectively, on the larger version. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus can last for 14 hours and 21 hours, respectively, during continuous cellular talk time. Video playback lasts 13 hours on iPhone 7 and 14 hours on iPhone 7 Plus. Get the Right Price The Google Pixel and iPhone 7 start at the same price: $649. However, those who want a larger screen or more storage will pay a higher price on both models. The bigger Google Pixel with additional storage, for instance, goes for $869. Apple's top-of-the-line 256GB iPhone 7 tops out at $969. For $869, iPhone 7 customers will get the same screen size and storage amount as the bigger Pixel. 10 Features Samsung Should Build Into the Galaxy S8 Smartphone View Slideshow » Why DNS Servers Are an Unprotected Back Door into Your Network View Slideshow » 11 Revolutionary Advances in Wireless Tech in 2016 View Slideshow » Panasonic Updates Toughpad FZ-G1 With More Power, Longer Battery Life View Slideshow » Broadcom, Qualcomm Latest Acquirers in Busy Chip Space View Slideshow » Why Donald Trump and Silicon Valley Don't See Eye to Eye View Slideshow » CIOs Expect Steady Growth in Health Care IT Spending, Cyber-Threats View Slideshow » Ransomware Takes Off, Web Browsers Under Attack: Kaspersky Report View Slideshow » TrueOS Succeeds PC-BSD Desktop-Friendly Unix OS View Slideshow » Comparing Microsoft's New Surface Book to Apple's MacBook Pro View Slideshow » View All Slideshows >   The battle for smartphone supremacy is on between Apple and Google. On Oct. 4, Google announced its new Pixel smartphone, the first to be designed and engineered by the company. The Pixel comes with the customer's choice of a 5-inch or 5.5-inch display, a refined design and Google's latest Android Nougat operating system. At its core, the Pixel is a high-end smartphone designed to take on Apple. In fact, Google referred to Apple's iPhone during its Pixel unveiling, discussing its smartphone's unlimited storage. In interviews about the Pixel, the company also pointed to similarities between Apple and Google's design and engineering process to show customers the search giant is ready to take on the hardware giant. Given that, it's perhaps a good time to compare the latest and greatest smartphones from Apple and Google and discuss the major similarities and differences between the devices.

While it enters a crowded market that also includes the French streaming service Deezer, Google Play Music and Tidal, which is partly owned by a group of artists including the rapper Jay-Z, Amazon is aiming to undercut its rivals by offering discounts to members of its Prime subscription service. COMPARED | Apple Music, Spotify, and Amazon Music Unlimited It will still cost the monthly $9.99 that equivalent services charge, but Amazon is subsidising the service for those who pay for Prime, the annual subscription that includes free next-day delivery. Prime members will pay $7.99 a month, with Amazon paying the difference. To date, music labels have resisted attempts to push the costs of streaming services below $9.99, a price that has stuck for years. Amazon is also selling a $3.99 a month version that will play exclusively on the Echo, the company’s Wi-Fi speaker. It said the service will launch in the UK, Germany and Austria later this year, although pricing was not announced. Amazon Music's interface Credit: AP The launch extends Amazon’s ambitions in music. In 2008, it launched a rival download service to iTunes which aimed to undercut Apple on price, as well as offering songs without the digital rights management that iTunes employed. However, Apple continues to dominate a shrinking download market. Amazon also offers an on-demand service as part of its Prime membership with a more limited song selection. While the company enters a competitive field for music streaming, it may see the discounts it offers to Prime users as a way of encouraging listeners to sign up for Prime itself. Those who sign up to Prime spend several times more than other shoppers, so Amazon is testing new ways to encourage people to sign up. Music industry revenues from streaming are due to overtake those from downloads this year. In 2015, the number of people using a streaming service rose from 41m to 68m.

Jayson Derrick , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} October 12, 2016 10:53am   Comments Share: Related What's Amazon Doing In Korea? SAMSUNG ELECTRONIC KRW5000 (OTC: SSNLF) has decided to permanently end production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, and the company's decision will impact members of its supply chain and competitors. In a research report on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs' Simona Jankowski took a look at what impact, if any, will be felt by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW). Apple: Potential Share Gains According to Jankowski, every one million iPhone 7 Plus units sold to clients who otherwise would have bought the Note 7 would translate to $770 million in incremental revenue for Apple and $0.03 in earnings per share. Related Link: Galaxy Note 7 News Has Apple Shares On Fire Again The analyst originally estimated Samsung to sell 10 million Note 7 units prior to the battery issue was first reported. After the battery issue was brought into the spotlight the analyst lowered her estimate to 6 million units sold. Granted, Apple won't capture the entire 10-million-unit shortfall as it will be shared with other high-end Android competitors and even by Samsung's other high-end device, the Galaxy S7 Edge. Qualcomm: Modest Near-Term Negative Jankowski noted that Qualcomm supplies components to 50 percent of all Note 7 devices. Granted, Qualcomm likely also supplies components to devices that consumers will now pick instead of the Note 7, the company derives a higher selling price in Samsung's flagship devices of around $60. By comparison, Qualcomm's average selling price to Apple and other Android devices is around $20. The analyst is now modeling a "modestly negative" revenue impact for Qualcomm of $65 million, or 1 percent of total revenue and an earnings per share impact of ($0.01). Corning: Negligible Impact Finally, Corning also supplies its cover glass called Gorilla Glass 5 to the Note 7. Similar to Qualcomm, the analyst expects most units will be recaptured by other smartphone makers but the content per device could present a risk to Corning. However, Corning's total Glass revenue is around 8 percent of total revenue, so the impact to the company would "likely be negligible." Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

Apple's Macbook Pro 2016 will launch ahead of Microsoft's Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2. (Photo: Sean Gallup/Getty Images) The Macbook Pro 2016 has been delayed for the second part of October, but it looks like, not even its competitor is ready to challenge the Apple device. In the latest news surrounding the laptop, this will be the thinnest and lightest Macbook Pro version in the history of the company. With an OLED display that replaces the first row of the keyboard, these are just some of the few new features of the 2016 Macbook Pro. Advertisement So why did we say it won't have any competitions this October? Apparently, Microsoft is not set to reveal its rival Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2. According to BGR, technology journalist Paul Thurrott said, Microsoft will definitely not refresh the Surface Pro and Surface Book lines this year. When Microsoft will hold its major press conference on October 26 in New York City, don't expect the device to be included. In fact, he said the event will mostly discuss the Windows 10 on PC, Hololens and the Xbox One will grace the event. Advertisement That puts Apple's Macbook Pro 2016 on top of the tech market this October. Meanwhile, one of the main factors that led to the delay of the 2016 Macbook Pro, is the apparent updating of its software concept. In fact, Apple was able to release a beta version of the OS in order to get possible feedback from user, prior to releasing the laptop. Just recently, news about Apple and NVIDIA revolutionizing the new laptops made news online. This is why, consumers are all excited to see the new Macbook Pro 2016. Apple is expected to launch the event and introduce the all new 2016 Macbook Pro series this coming October 27, 2016. Are you still excited to experience the revolutionized laptop from Apple?

Why? Because from all the evidence we've seen via rumours, patents, and renders, both Apple and Samsung are preparing to unveil smartphones with displays that cover the entire front of the devices. This week we've already had a patent from Apple which shows how the firm is looking at ways of integrating light sensors into a device's screen, but now a new render has us excited to see whether Samsung can beat Apple to the punch with the Galaxy S8. The video below, which comes from Android blog Techdroider, shows a Galaxy S8 render based on rumors that the phone will have an edge-to-edge screen and no home button. Related: Galaxy S8 – Everything we know And while this is just a render, we're hoping Samsung will produce a handset that takes at least some of its cues from such a design. The South Korean firm will be looking to make a big impact with its next flagship, following the disaster that has been the Note 7 and its explosive tendencies. Some of the likeliest Galaxy S8 features include Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 830 chip or Samsung’s Exynos 8995, both of which are unannounced, as well as a 4K display and the new edge-to-edge screen. However some analysts have suggested Samsung will bring the launch of the S8 forward to make up for financial losses from the Note 7 debacle, which means some of the more dramatic design changes may not make it to the new handset. Still, we're hoping Sammy has managed to figure out how to add the edge-to-edge display to the S8, as this latest render has us excited for a big design overhaul. WATCH: Galaxy S8: Everything We Know So Far Let us know what you think of the video in the comments. 0 shares Read Comments John Gass October 12, 2016, 7:40 pm I moved from an LG G3 to a Samsung S7 Edge and, whilst I'm mainly very pleased with the Samsung, there are two things which are still constant niggles, even after several months use. The first is that I much preferred the volume and power buttons being on the back. Perhaps it's because I'm left-handed that the Samsung's side-mounted buttons either don't fall to hand, or I find I'm pressing them by mistake. But the big thing I just don't get is this fad for curved screens. I chose the Edge becuse of the larger display and bigger battery, but I did expect to find the curved screen useful - after all, why else would Samsung do it and reviewers praise it? But, despite trying all its available uses, all I see is text that's falling off the edge of the display when double-tapped to set it to fit the screen width. And the little tab on the curved edge of the screen that accesses user-defined panels and apps? I use it occasionally but it would work equally well on a flat screen. Perhaps Samsung consider it less intrusive on a curved screen because the edges become less visible and less utilised? If so, I think my point is confirmed. Also, the curved display makes secure and effective case design far more difficult, given how narrow the phone's sides are. And now we're to get screens that wrap around all four sides? Based on my current experience, cases won't be useable unless maybe glued to the back of the phone. Remember how all the reviwers loved curved screen TVs when they were first launched? Yet now most seem to have changed their minds. Just because manufacturers can do something, it doesn't mean they should. toboev October 14, 2016, 2:14 pm The whole curved edge thing is just bling in search of a reason, but there is none. Like you say, no function or feature that appears on the curved edge depends on or is even enhanced by the curvature. They could all operate just as well or better on a flat screen. Well, maybe except the coloured notifications you are supposed to be able to see bleeding from under an inverted phone on the meeting-room table (yeah, right). If they would just come out and say it; "I think it looks nice", I could understand. But all this cr@p about its higher purpose? Frostbite October 31, 2016, 12:53 pm But will it include the hand warmer feature?

With Swift Playgrounds, real coding concepts are brought to life with an interactive interface that allows students and beginners to explore working with Swift, the easy-to-learn programming language from Apple used by professional developers to create world-class apps. The Swift Playgrounds app is approachable enough for students with no previous programming experience to begin exploring key coding concepts, but also powerful enough for skilled programmers to experiment and express their creativity using Swift. “Everyone should have the opportunity to learn coding, and we are excited to bring Swift Playgrounds to the next generation of programmers looking for a fun and easy way to explore key coding concepts using real code,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “More than 100 schools around the world have already committed to adding Swift Playgrounds to their fall curriculum, and we can’t wait to see what students create with it.” Swift Playgrounds includes Apple-developed programming lessons that guide students through a series of challenges and puzzles to guide three on-screen characters through an immersive graphical world as they learn core coding concepts, like issuing commands, creating functions, performing loops and using conditional code and variables. Apple will also regularly release new standalone challenges so users can continue learning new skills. Swift Playgrounds also features built-in templates that users can modify and build on to create their own programs with graphics and touch interactions. They can then share their creations with friends using Mail or Messages or even by posting to the Web. And since Swift Playgrounds uses real Swift code, projects can be exported directly to Xcode and ultimately be turned into full-fledged iOS and Mac apps.

(AMZN) Challenges Apple Music With Launch of Amazon Music Unlimited AMZN’s streaming music service is live By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 12, 2016, 10:51 am EST     Popular Posts: Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit GoPro Inc.

(GPRO) Stock Slammed by Karma Drone Recall View All Posts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) took the wraps off its rumored new streaming music service this morning. Amazon Music Unlimited is now live and ready to take on Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Music, Spotify and Alphabet Inc‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Play. Source: Amazon Amazon clearly took the time to think this streaming music thing through, putting all the pieces together to hit the ground running with a competitive service right at launch. The press release sent out this morning ticks off all the boxes for competing against established services like Apple Music, Spotify and Google Play. Key features of Amazon Music Unlimited include: $9.99/month fee 30 day free trial App for iOS, Android and desktop offers curated music discovery Ad-free Download for offline listening Support for streaming devices including Sonos Personalized “stations” Family subscription plan (arrives later this year) for $14.99/month In addition, to matching key features and pricing of the competition, Amazon has responded to concerns that its music library would be seriously outclassed. Prime Music had only two million songs, compared to the 30 million claimed by Apple Music and Spotify. AMZN says Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers will have access to a catalog of “tens of millions of songs.” 10 Hottest Gadgets for the 2016 Holiday Shopping Season That choice of words suggests that Amazon’s service might not yet be at the 30 million mark, but it’s probably close enough that most people wouldn’t notice. Amazon Music Unlimited Is a One-Two Punch for AMZN AMZN is actually fighting several battles at once with Amazon Music Unlimited, taking on two high tech rivals. It’s going toe-to-toe with AAPL’s Apple Music and while it will also battle Google Play on the streaming music front, the company is also taking a swipe at the new Google Home, which is in turn trying to knock out its Echo line of connected home speakers. That all sounds a little complicated, but let’s start with pricing. Amazon Prime members get a discounted $7.99 Amazon Music Unlimited membership, or a yearly $79 fee (which works out to $6.58/month). If you’re a Prime member, that significantly undercuts the $9.99/month going rate for everyone else. However, if you own an Amazon Echo, that Amazon Music Unlimited membership fee drops to just $3.99/month. That’s unheard of pricing for streaming music without ads. Better yet, with the Echo, you can use Alexa to control the music by voice, including picking artists, specific tracks and playlists. Alexa will also learn your listening habits and can play random music based on your preferences. AMZN has also created a new Echo-only feature called Side-by-Sides. When a user requests Echo to play a Side-by-Side for a supported album, the tracks will play as the artist provides song commentary. Apple Inc. (AAPL): The Luckiest D*mn Company on Earth The streaming music market experienced a shake-up when AAPL muscled its way in with Apple Music. So far, Spotify has managed to weather that storm, but having Amazon Music Unlimited to contend with as well is not going to help the situation. Even worse is the potential for AMZN’s move to spark a three-way war for subscribers between Amazon Music Unlimited, Apple Music and Google Play. The three tech giants have deep pockets and could easily weather a price war. They also have machine learning capabilities they can leverage for features like personalizing music payback — as Amazon is doing with the Echo. Spotify, which lost $194 million last year, would be the likely loser if either scenario takes place. Amazon Music Unlimited is available now. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. More From InvestorPlace: Apple Inc.

Needs New Management Will this troubled Apple supplier fare better under new leaders? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 12, 2016 at 10:26AM InvenSense (NYSE:INVN), the chipmaker best known for supplying motion sensors for iPhones and other devices, has shed nearly 70% of its market value since peaking at almost $26 in Aug. 2014. That decline can be attributed to troubling design losses to STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM), slowing sales of smartphones worldwide, and the company's murky plans for the future. Image source: InvenSense. I've discussed InvenSense's core problems in a previous article, but today I'll highlight three red flags indicating that the chipmaker might fare better under new management. 1. A CEO who overpromises and under-delivers CEO Behrooz Abdi, who took over the top job in 2012, often tries to pin InvenSense's name to widely hyped markets. Last year, Abdi claimed that InvenSense held a 100% market share in smartwatch motion sensors. That statement led many investors to believe that InvenSense would supply sensors for the Apple Watch, since it already supplied motion sensors for iPhones. As a result, many investors were stunned when InvenSense lost that socket to STMicro. That made InvenSense's socket in future iPhones look less secure, since STMicro also supplied Apple with iPhone motion sensors in the past. Samsung already dumped InvenSense and installed STMicro's six-axis sensor in its S7/S7 Edge earlier this year. Apple Watch. Image source: Apple. When Pokemon Go conquered the world earlier this year, Abdi declared that similar augmented reality (AR) games could expand the company's total addressable market for high-performance gyros in "mid-tier and low-tier smartphone markets." However, most modern smartphones already have adequate hardware to play simple AR games like Pokemon Go. Abdi also claims that InvenSense's motion sensors will be used in higher-end VR headsets. Its sensors power HTC's Vive, but Facebook's Oculus Rift uses Bosch's sensors instead. 2. A poorly diversified business model Abdi talks a lot about InvenSense diversifying into new markets like AR, VR, drones, and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, 46% of its revenue still came from Apple last quarter, up from 38% in the prior year quarter. Therefore, InvenSense's dependence on Apple is increasing as the iDevice maker's growth is peaking. 63% of InvenSense's revenue still came from smartphones and tablets last quarter, compared to 72% a year earlier. Optical image stabilization sensor revenue generated 12% of sales, compared to 16% a year earlier. The IoT unit's revenue share more than doubled to 25%. Image source: InvenSense. That diversification is encouraging, but it isn't really reducing the company's dependence on Apple or boosting overall sales, which are expected to fall 24% this year. Moreover, larger rivals like STMicro and Bosch are expanding into the same markets on a superior scale -- which could apply additional pressure to InvenSense's margins. Therefore, InvenSense might benefit under a management team which is more keen on pursuing aggressive inorganic growth or setting itself up to be acquired. 3. A lack of insider confidence Faced with these challenges, it isn't surprising that InvenSense's insiders lack much confidence in the company's future. Over the past six months, insiders sold over 130,000 shares without buying a single share. Abdi sold $1.74 million in shares over the past two years, but didn't buy a single share on the open market. CFO Mark Dentinger, who didn't buy a single share over the past year, sold over $260,000 in shares during that period. That kind of insider selling didn't fuel much confidence in institutional investors, who sold 21 million shares last quarter. The bottom line I personally don't like to invest in small and poorly diversified supply chain players like InvenSense. The problem is simple -- InvenSense depends heavily on Apple and Samsung, but neither company is obligated to stick with InvenSense if bigger rivals like STMicro or Bosch offer comparable (or superior) sensors at lower prices. Apple and Samsung's recent selection of STMicro's sensors over InvenSense bodes will for the struggling chipmaker. Unless InvenSense's management aggressively diversifies into defensible adjacent markets, I believe that the chipmaker could face much darker days ahead.

Tired of seeing all these notifications? No worries. They’re easy to disable. RELATED ARTICLES How to Use Activity Monitor on Apple Watch to Track Your Fitness How to Stop Your Apple Watch from Nagging You to Stand Now, the Activity app on the Apple Watch can be useful. I sometimes like knowing how many steps I’ve taken in a day, but I want to check on that myself and not get a notification on my progress, or lack thereof. I also prefer not to get reminded to stand in the middle of my work. So, I disabled the activity notifications on my watch and I thought I had disabled all of them, but I was still getting Progress Updates. I finally figured out which setting I had missed. If you don’t want to use your Apple Watch as a fitness tracker, or you just don’t want to be bothered by all the notifications, I’ll show you how to completely disable all the activity notifications on your Apple Watch. To completely silence activity notifications, tap the Watch app icon on the Home screen on your iPhone. Make sure the “My Watch” screen is active. The My Watch icon at the bottom of the screen should be orange. Scroll down on the My Watch screen and tap “Activity”. If you only want to turn off the reminders for the day, tap the “Mute Reminders for Today” slider button. However, to disable all activity notifications, let’s make our way down the screen. Tap the slider button for “Stand Reminders” to prevent reminders from displaying on your watch telling you to stand (slider buttons should be black and white when they’re off on this screen). The setting I missed initially is “Progress Updates”. Notice it says “Every 4 hours”. Tap the setting to change it. On the Progress Updates screen, tap “None” to turn off the updates. Then, tap “Activity” in the upper-left corner of the screen to return to the Activity screen. To avoid receiving notifications when you reach your daily Move, Exercise, and Stand goals, tap the “Goal Completions” slider button to turn it off. Tap the Achievements slider button to avoid getting notifications when you reach a milestone or personal best. Finally, tap the “Weekly Summary” slider button to turn off that notification. Now, you won’t be bothered by any activity notifications. Let’s not get lazy, though, huh? JOIN THE DISCUSSION (1 REPLY) Got Feedback?

Amazon Music Unlimited is being positioned to compete against existing services such as Spotify and Apple Music. It will cost $8 per month, or $80 a year, for members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime loyalty program. Non-Prime members will pay $10 a month, the same monthly fee charged by Spotify and Apple Music. Owners of Amazon's Echo smart speaker, meanwhile, will be able to get the unlimited music service on one device for $4 per month. The steaming service is one more perk — like two-day free shipping and Amazon Video — that the Seattle-based company hopes will attract people to its Prime program and thus encourage them to spend more on its flagship site. Amazon already offers Amazon Prime Music for free to Prime members, but that includes about two million songs, while the new service boasts a catalog of "tens of millions" of songs. "Think of this as two different levels: Prime is now the introductory service and Unlimited is the full service," said Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of digital music. The service's launch comes as the way people listen to music is changing. According to Nielsen , during the first half of 2016, digital purchasing of single tracks was down 24 percent and digital albums were down 18 percent, while streaming was up 59 percent, compared with the same period a year ago. "The recorded music industry has been fumbling for a digital business model that really works, and I think streaming has come into its own," said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna. In fact, streaming of audio has eclipsed video streaming, according to Nielsen. Audio's share of streaming is 54 percent as of June 30, compared with 44 percent a year earlier. But it still faces the music industry's problem of low margins, Verna said. "There is definitely room to grow the pie simply because more and more music consumers are choosing this way of accessing their music," he said. "But the potential rewards are not huge and infinite, they're sort of modest and there are already quite a few players in the space." Most streaming services now offer similar catalogues of music and pricing is about the same. So services have differentiated by user interface, Verna said. One way Amazon is hoping to stand out is with its Alexa voice control, via the Echo or other Alexa-enabled devices. Users can ask the Echo to play a certain song or playlist, but can also search for music just by saying they want to hear the "new" song by any artist, a genre of music from a certain decade, or by saying the lyrics of a song if they can't remember the name. The service is available starting Wednesday in the U.S. and in the U.K., Germany and Austria this year. ____ Online: www.amazon.com/AmazonMusicUnlimited Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Men's Faux-Fish Heel Costume Shoes for $46 + pickup at Walmart WalmartPosted 12 hr 47 min ago SHOP NOW Lenovo Flex 3 Skylake i7 16" Touch Laptop for $500 + free...

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Amazon Music Unlimited launches: $9.99 per month, $3.99 for Echo-only streaming By Christian Zibreg, Oct 12, 2016 Tweet 9 Comments Amazon today announced its long-rumored music streaming service to better compete with the likes of Apple Music, Spotify, Google Play Music, Tidal and others. The service is called Amazon Music Unlimited and starts at $9.99 per month for individual accounts or $14.99 per month for a family of six, which is the standard pricing offered by Apple Music and others. However, Amazon has undercut Apple Music with a $7.99 per month tier for members of its $99 per year Prime service. And if you want to only stream music to your Echo wireless speaker, Amazon Music Unlimited is just $3.99 per month. Amazon Music Unlimited gives you access to tens of millions of songs from all the major labels like Sony, Universal and Warner, as well as hundreds of independent labels. Like with other services, a free 30-day trial is available as well. The $14.99 per month family tier is coming soon. The service is available on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch via the redesigned Amazon Music app on the App Store. Amazon Music Unlimited offers offline listening, themed playlists curated by music experts, song and album recommendations personalized for you, a search feature and more. Echo owners can sign up for a low-priced $3.99 tier that limits streaming to their wireless speaker while offering integration with Amazon’s intelligent assistant Alexa to use voice commands to find and play music. In fact, Echo owners can easily sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited by asking Alexa to start their free trial. Amazon Music Unlimited is available starting today in the United States and will launch later this year in the United Kingdom, Germany and Austria. The new service shouldn’t be confused with Prime subscriptions that come with unlimited music streaming from a limited catalog of about a million songs in total.

Impreza You think it’s getting a bit like too many mobile phone manufacturing companies? Diego Milano More like Facebook and their different apps that flood the system with icons pointlessly. Diego Milano Still more expensive than Spotify, at least in Argentina. Alan Aurmont As a student, I pay $4.99 for Apple Music. A dollar more gives me the best iOS integration, the best UI, and so much more. Out of three giants (Apple, Google, Amazon), Amazon has the ugliest looking apps.

He also discussed the difference between the engineer culture in Silicon Valley and the creative culture in Hollywood and underscored the importance of technology in popular culture and other tidbits. Here are some choice quotes from that interview. “The people from popular culture had to understand how to talk to engineers,” said Iovine. “It isn’t just them talking to record people. The engineer culture doesn’t understand what you’re talking about, doesn’t take you serious and writes you off.” Apple is not in the record business, he underscored. We are an adjunct to labels and artists. We are building something that can help labels and artists and undiscovered artists. Yeah, it’s a popular culture company, but it’s also a tool. And that’s what we’re building. We’re not in the record business. On “hybrid” Apple Music future: What we’re going to do, what we’re doing now that hasn’t been revealed yet, is we’re building the right hybrid. And we believe it’s the right hybrid, and the combination of these things together, we’ll build a music service that is technologically and culturally adept. We’re going to do whatever we believe is great. We are going to make a combination of tech and popular culture that is exciting and adept at both areas. So that’s what you’re starting to see. It’s going to have a voice. It’s not going to be just a utility — “Go here and get your music, good luck,” or, “We’re going to send you a list” — that’s great, but that’s not what this is. That’s not what this was, anyway. Apple Music launched seventeen months ago and now has seventeen million paid subscribers, a little more than half of Spotify’s 30 million paid accounts. Iovine, who is 63 years old, has made a career in the music industry as a versatile producer, engineer, label executive and co-founder of Interscope Records. In 2014, he founded Beats Electronics and Beats Music with his friend, Dr. Dre. Iovine reflected on starting the company: I met Steve Jobs and Eddy Cue in 2003. I realized, okay, the future of music is going to be intertwined with distribution through technology companies. It just looked like that to me, and I realized how far behind I personally was. So I set out to really understand. So I worked with those guys for about two years, and I said to Steve, “I’d like to do headphones with Apple with [Dr.] Dre,” about two or three years later. He said, “Do it yourself, you can do it.” So I tried it myself. So I built a tech company. And we built this whole company and we needed certain types of individuals for the kind of company we wanted to build. We wanted to build a tech company that had a big presence in popular culture, which was what Apple had, but no one claims to be Steve Jobs. But we wanted to have that understanding. So one of the first things I did was to hire Luke Wood, because he understood both languages. Because language is tricky. He was referring to Beats President Luke Wood, who now works on Apple Music alongside Trent Rezonr, Larry Jackson and others. Iovine says Treznor was “really, truly involved” on every level of Apple Music’s redesign on iOS 10. It took a decade to develop the current Apple Music team, he said. According to the interview, Apple had to bring over 250 people from popular culture and the media business to help push its music streaming service. After the Cupertino firm acquired Beats in a deal worth $3 billion, Iovine, Dr. Dre and key Beats managers have become Apple executives. Jimmy Iovine photograph courtesy AllThingsD.

Global perspective. advertisement Supreme Court hears argument on Samsung design, juror bias Wednesday 12 October 2016 at 7:38 AM ET by Steven Wildberger ©  WikiMedia (Daderot) [JURIST] The US Supreme Court [official website] on Tuesday heard argument [day call, PDF] in the cases of Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple, Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado and Manrique v. United States [SCOTUSblog backgrounders]. In Samsung Electronics, Samsung Corporation challenged [transcript, PDF] a $400 million verdict [opinion, PDF] in Apple's favor that held Samsung's copying of the graphical user interface and front screen of the iPhone infringed design patents held by Apple. The challenge involves interpretation of a portion of the US Code that provides that any person who applies a patented design "to any article of manufacture" is "liable ... to the extent of his total profit." The question is whether "total profit" considers only the income from the infringement, the screen and interface, or all of Samsung's phone sales. In Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, the court is considering a challenge [transcript, PDF] to a Colorado rule of evidence [Rule 606(b)], known as the "no impeachment rule," that prevents jurors from testifying after a verdict as to what happened during deliberations. Pena-Rodriguez, a Colorado man of Mexican descent, was found guilty of assaulting two teenage women at a racetrack. After finding Pena-Rodriguez guilty, two jurors came forward and alleged that another juror, a former police officer, had made racially biased statements asserting the defendant's guilt "because he's Mexican, and Mexican men take whatever they want." The question presented is whether the "no impeachment" rule violates the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of trial by an impartial jury. The Colorado Supreme Court previously affirmed [opinion, PDF] that the juror's bias falls within the "no impeachment rule." The Supreme Court also heard argument in the case of Manrique v. United States, in which a defendant appealed an initial verdict [transcript, PDF] but not a post-hearing award of restitution. The longstanding practice of incorporating restitution into an initial sentencing order, but amending the order with a later-defined amount, was previously upheld [opinion] by the Supreme Court. Now, the Supreme Court is asked to determine whether an appeal of an initial sentencing order is sufficient as an appeal of a restitution order as well. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled [opinion, PDF] that the failure to appeal deprived the appeals court of jurisdiction to hear the issue.

Magazine information Current issue Past issues Bulletin Newsletter Research services Billboard store Archives Events Jimmy Iovine on the Future of Apple Music and Why Everyone Is Getting Everything Wrong News Digital and Mobile By Dan Rys | October 11, 2016 3:27 PM EDT Jimmy Iovine at The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Benefit Celebrating the Opening of Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City on May 2, 2016. Billy Farrell/BFA/REX/Shutterstock  5 0 6 Jimmy Iovine has something to get off his chest. The Apple executive, 63, has spent decades in the music industry as a producer, engineer, label executive and co-founder of Interscope Records, before founding Beats Electronics and Beats Music alongside Dr. Dre and, in 2014, moving to Apple after its purchase of that company in a deal worth some $3 billion. Now, 17 months after the launch of Apple Music -- which has generated plenty of headlines due to its exclusives strategy and aggressive pursuit of original content on its way to 17 million paid subscribers -- Iovine still feels like his mission is misunderstood. "What everyone's writing is the obvious right now," he tells Billboard. "They're writing, 'People in the record business are getting into tech so they can talk to people in the record business.' That's hogwash." [Ed. Note: That topic was the subject of several articles last week, including ones in Billboard and Music Business Worldwide, though Iovine's ire appeared to be aimed at a Rolling Stone article published on Yahoo.com.]  The topic is one that's of particular interest to Iovine, who alongside Dr. Dre donated $70 million to the University of Southern California at Los Angeles in 2013 to create a new institute dedicated to educating students in the arts, technology and business of innovation, which he says means "everything" to him. It's also in the context of the recent migration of former music business players such as Troy Carter, previously manager to Lady Gaga and Meghan Trainor, and Lyor Cohen, the longtime Def Jam and Warner Music Group veteran, who both recently shifted to Spotify and YouTube, respectively. But while that shift has become a trend in recent months, particularly as streaming has overtaken all other areas as the dominant revenue stream in the music industry's digital era, Iovine feels that the 'liaison narrative' being put forward is an oversimplification of a larger issue. Read more: Is Tech's Future Music's Past? Why Silicon Valley Is Looking to Music Execs "It took 10 years to develop this team," he says of those around him at Apple, including Trent Reznor, Luke Wood and Larry Jackson. "The people from popular culture had to understand how to talk to engineers. It isn't just them talking to record people; [otherwise] the engineer culture doesn't understand what you're talking about, doesn't take you serious, and writes you off." With Apple Music's recent redesign and its continuing foray into exclusives, both in audio streams and now its latest push into video, Jimmy Iovine breaks down the misconceptions of his strategy at Apple, the difficulty of marrying the music world with the tech world and the evolution of the company he's building now. "We are an adjunct to labels and artists," he says. "Yeah, it's a popular culture company, but it's also a tool. And that's what we're building. We're not in the record business." Read more: Apple's Brain Trust -- Iovine, Reznor, Cue and Kondrk -- on Streaming's New World Order and Why 'We All Should Be' Worried Billboard: Apple Music has accomplished plenty in the past year... Jimmy Iovine: Before we get into that, we have to get into the why. It's a story, it's complex. Because what everyone's writing is the obvious right now. They're writing, "People in the record business are getting into tech so they can talk to people in the record business." That's hogwash. And why it's hogwash is, it takes a certain individual... For example, I met [Apple executives] Steve Jobs and Eddy Cue in 2003. I realized, okay, the future of music is going to be intertwined with distribution through technology companies. It just looked like that to me, and I realized how far behind I personally was. So I set out to really understand. So I worked with those guys for about two years, and I said to Steve, "I'd like to do headphones with Apple with [Dr.] Dre," about two or three years later. He said, "Do it yourself, you can do it." So I tried it myself. So I built a tech company. And we built this whole company and we needed certain types of individuals for the kind of company we wanted to build. We wanted to build a tech company that had a big presence in popular culture, which was what Apple had, but no one claims to be Steve Jobs. But we wanted to have that understanding. So one of the first things I did was to hire Luke Wood, because he understood both languages. Because language is tricky. Then I needed somebody with an artist's point of view who understood the language of technology, and that was Trent Reznor. This new [user interface] that you see at Apple Music, Trent Reznor was really, truly involved on every level of it. Both in design and engineering, every week, to get it to where it was both technically right and culturally right, to do what we want to do with culture. So then I left Interscope, and Larry [Jackson] was a guy who also could speak both languages, so I took him with me. So this was a 10-year process. Then we sold to Apple. Then Apple brought over 250 people from popular culture, from the media business -- not one, 250 people. Right? So that's why all of this is missing the point: it took 10 years to develop this team. We're so committed to this that Dre and I started a school at USC.  Read more: Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine Donate $70 Million to USC for New Arts, Tech and Biz Center So people that hire record executives -- I don't know what these people can or can't do -- but Larry and Trent and Luke were guys that I just knew, instinctively and through working with them, that they could learn this. That's very important. Because every time I read, "Oh, they're hiring music people!" How naïve! You know what's wrong? There are too many journalists, too many articles and not enough time to do the research and the depth of what you need to get a story right. What I read on Yahoo this morning was so f---ing absurd. Anyway, so I had a good morning. [Laughs] What was it about guys like Larry, then, that made you think he was the type of person who would be able to walk that line? A lot of young people have that feel because they were brought up communicating through technology and got their entertainment through technology and dealing with technology. So they really have a feel for it. Some of them go the extra yard to really try to understand -- they're not coders, but at least they understand the language and want to learn about it. Larry had those qualities and had the capacity and the inclination for that. So I believe I was right. And he's been doing very well at Apple, and he's been working with people from the tech world. And that's very, very, very difficult, and it's why I started my school. This isn't something that just happened overnight, this has been going on since 2004. This year, though, those 10 years of prep and build up have manifested themselves in a lot of projects, and that's why I wanted to ask you --  Yeah, and there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes to make this balance work. Robert Kondrk and I work constantly on blending the cultures, and he should be mentioned because he's working very, very hard on blending the cultures with me, of blending Apple and the people from Beats. And Eddy Cue is incredibly natural; he's gifted, because he was Steve's guy, so he learned a lot about this and he's very open and has a great feel for popular culture and media. So you put that team together, and you've got a shot. And what we're going to do, what we're doing now that hasn't been revealed yet, is we're building the right hybrid. And we believe it's the right hybrid, and the combination of these things together, we'll build a music service that is technologically and culturally adept.  Read more: 'All Boats Rise': Jimmy Iovine & Eddy Cue Explain Apple Music, Working With Labels, Pricing Can you share anything about what that might look like? I can't. But I can tell you that we are, you know... Larry, Trent, Luke on the headphones side, Zane Lowe [with Beats 1], we're all working to create something -- and Robert Kondrk -- that we can just blend into correctly and not just say, "Let's just get somebody from a record company to go make the deal we want." That has nothing to do with what it -- capital IT -- is. And, you know, it's been a road. The last three years both sides have had to work to really understand each other. And I have to have people with the capacity and the capability of learning. You guys have taken some risks since the launch of Apple Music, I'd say most recently with Drake's short film, Please Forgive Me. Will you be getting more into video and film projects? We're going to do whatever we believe is great. We are going to make a combination of tech and popular culture that is exciting and adept at both areas. So that's what you're starting to see. It's going to have a voice. It's not going to be just a utility -- "Go here and get your music, good luck," or, "We're going to send you a list" -- that's great, but that's not what this is. That's not what this was, anyway. Do you ever look back at -- I don't have a rear-view mirror. I'm just working so hard, because it's so hard to get right, how to work in the tech world. It's not the same. You're going from one world to another world, and we are starting to succeed. But this has been 10 years of preparation, two companies built -- Beats Electronics and Beats Music -- and then the people were chosen and understood how to work in both worlds. This is not something where you can just pluck somebody out of the air. Larry's been with me for eight years. Trent's been with me for 20 years. Luke's been with me for 15 years. I'm hoping you get the feel for what I'm talking about.  Read more: Education By Dre (And Iovine, Too): Music Biz Philanthropists Help Schools Rise Up So are you looking at building a future where there is no line between those two industries? No, no, no, no, no. We are an adjunct to labels and artists. We are building something that can help labels and artists and undiscovered artists. Yeah, it's a popular culture company, but it's also a tool. And that's what we're building. We're not in the record business. For some reason, this has to be the case for it to really work. That's why there are so many people out there in media companies that don't understand; they work on the digital side of the record companies, but they don't understand the language of the world of technology companies, what it's like to be in a technology company and how they perceive things. Like I said, we built the number-one headphone company in the world today. We didn't go out and make a headphone company and say we're in the tech business, we built the number one headphone company. And that went to Apple with all the people. So those people are trained, multi-disciplined. And that is important to me. And that's what I hope you get out of this, the understanding. I'm constantly finding and training people that can be in both worlds. And I would like to include them, because it takes a lot. It takes a lot from our side and a lot from their side. Ed.

The eight justices on the top court appeared divided on how to resolve the complex dispute over damages the South Korean smartphone giant owes Apple for copying key design features of the iPhone. The case arguments came as Samsung faces a fresh but unrelated crisis as it halted production of a flagship handset for safety reasons, potentially imperiling the powerhouse South Korean brand. Samsung, which has been ordered to pay $400 million for violating certain iPhone features, is challenging the legal precedent which requires the forfeiture of all profits from a product even if only a single design patent is infringed upon. This key question on the value of design patents has rallied Samsung supporters in the tech sector, and Apple backers in the creative and design communities. The justices Tuesday offered some support for both sides without providing a hint on the outcome of the case. Justice Anthony Kennedy said Samsung's argument would create confusion for jurors in trying to apportion damages. "If I'm the juror, I just don't know what to do," Kennedy told attorneys during the hearing. "I'd have the iPhone in the jury room; I'd -- I'd look at it. I just wouldn't know." VW Beetle example The court debate moved from smartphones to automobiles, and the importance of design to the Volkswagen Beetle, for example. Justice Samuel Alito appeared to lean toward Samsung's position, saying, "Nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks... What if it broke down every 50 miles?" Offering a similar view, Justice Stephen Breyer said a single component cannot account for all profits: "A Rolls Royce thing on the hood? No, no, no. You don't get all the profit from the car." Samsung attorney Kathleen Sullivan said the justices should consider all the components of a smartphone. "A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work," she said. She said the case could lead to more litigations because patent holders "carve the product up into multiple partial design claims... and find a little sliver of the phone on which infringement can be found." Design 'not a component'  Apple lawyer Seth Waxman fired back that Samsung made a conscious decision to revive its fortunes by copying the iPhone. "A design is not a component, a design is applied to a thing," Waxman said. Waxman contended that Samsung's own documents showed that the South Korean giant acted to deal with "a crisis of design" and sought to copy the iPhone. He noted that limiting the damages would offer little deterrence and encourage "counterfeiters and copyists." Observers are watching to see how the court -- which has not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- tips the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. A ruling is expected in several months. The case is one element of the $548 million penalty Samsung was ordered to pay for copying the iPhone's distinctive front screen and graphical touchscreen interface. Matt Levy of the Computer & Communications Industry Association said the debate suggested the justices were open to lowering the jury award. "The damages statute for design patents was written to protect products like rugs, where the design was essentially the entire thing being sold," Levy said in a blog post. "Congress certainly didn't intend to treat complex products as if only the outer appearance is what matters.... Based on what I heard, I think it's very likely that the (justices) will modify the lower court's decision." Samsung has won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Apple is supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. An amicus brief filed on behalf of design professionals, researchers and academics said they have no financial interest in the case but argue on the basis of "fundamental principles of visual design." They cite precedents like the Coca-Cola bottle, which is an integral part of the value of the product. The Supreme Court hearing took place hours after Samsung announced it was scrapping the production of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, its new flagship device that has been mired in a disastrous recall over exploding lithium-ion batteries.

According to the BBC, the Dobsons were taken to court by Hartford and Bigelow and the case was heard at the Supreme Court, which agreed the Dobsons stole designs and tried to sell them off as their own. The problem was that the judges couldn't determine an appropriate fee since the design of a carpet is merely a small part of the overall carpet. For instance, a carpet can look beautiful but if designer poorly and isn't comfortable then it is unlikely to sell. Hartford and Bigelow received a fee of six cents each from the Dobsons for stealing their design. Related Link: How To Time The iPhone Release Cycle Orville Platt, a senator from Connecticut lobbied Congress to make changes to the Patent Act to ensure that design patents are given more weight. By 1887, changes were written into law. Why Does This Matter? Fast forward 130 years and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and rival SAMSUNG ELECTRONIC KRW5000 (OTC: SSNLF) are arguing over the same thing. Apple accused Samsung in 2011 of being the "Dobsons" and copying several aspects of the iPhone design, which were used in their own smartphones. A court agreed with Apple's claims last year and based on Senator Platt's changes to the patent law, Samsung was forced to pay all of the profits it made in damages or $250, whichever amount is higher. Samsung ended up paying Apple $548 million but now the South-Korea based company feels it should be given back at least $399 million of that amount. Similar to the carpets, Samsung is making the argument that the design of a phone isn't the only factor consumers consider when buying a phone. A lot of hardware and software are at work inside the phone and this also influences consumers' decisions. Samsung will make its case to the Supreme Court but a final decision isn't expected until June 2017. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

The company is launching its new service as Amazon Music Unlimited, a on-demand competitor to the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Play Music. Amazon has done a number of things to differentiate Music Unlimited from its competitors, but the most notable one is its price: the service will be available to Amazon Prime members for $7.99 per month or $79 per year, which is cheaper than the premium options from Spotify or Apple Music. In addition, owners of one of Amazon’s voice-controlled Echo devices will be able to get the service for just $3.99 per month. At its core, Amazon Music Unlimited is very similar to the other services you could subscribe to. It has a catalog of "tens of millions" of songs (Amazon’s Steve Boom tells me it has deals with all three major labels, in addition to "hundreds" of indies); a recommendations engine to surface new music; both algorithmic and hand-made playlists; and apps for Android, iOS, Sonos, and desktop (plus Amazon’s Fire tablets and set top boxes). Amazon’s new Music apps have been completely redesigned with fresh typography, revised navigation, and a focus on artist imagery and album art. They feature some clever perks, such as the ability to automatically download music Amazon thinks you’d like while in the background, so you’ll always have something to listen to while offline, as well as lyrics integration. Amazon’s main pitch is tight Echo integration But while Spotify relies on its intelligent music recommendation and discovery as a draw and Apple pushes people toward its service with major album exclusives, Amazon is touting Music Unlimited’s tight integration with its Echo devices and Alexa voice assistant as the real differentiator here. Not only do Echo owners have access to a discounted version of the service (though it’s only available on one Echo device at a time), they can request songs from Music Unlimited in a variety of ways just using their voices. In addition to fielding specific song, artist, album, or playlist requests, Alexa can pull up the "latest song" from an artist, play music based on a requested mood or time period, or even find songs from snippets of lyrics. Requests can be strung together — one of the examples Amazon demoed to me was "play U2 songs from the '80s" and the Echo started playing the only listenable songs from Bono and crew. Amazon says that the more people use the service, the better its responses and suggestions will get. (For example, if you ask the Echo to "play workout music" and have a history of listening to metal, it won’t start bumping EDM.) Amazon In addition, Amazon Music Unlimited has a new feature called Side-by-Side, which pairs artist commentary with selected tracks from the their catalog. The company says it is launching with a few dozen Side-by-Side features, including from artists such as The Chainsmokers, Jason Aldean, Lindsey Stirling, Sting, Norah Jones, One Republic, and Kongos, with more to come in the future. Readers of a certain generation might liken this feature to an updated take on MTV’s Unplugged or VH1’s Storytellers. Amazon isn’t launching the new service with any major artist or album exclusives, but vice president of Amazon Music Steve Boom says the company "doesn’t have a firm stance on full-on exclusives" and it is still evaluating whether or not to pursue them. For now, Boom points to the service’s ease of use, voice integration, and recommendations technology as the main differentiators for it. But for many, Amazon Music Unlimited’s price will likely be its main draw. The yearly plan option for Prime members brings the price of the service down to about $6.58 per month, well below the cost of single-account plans from other services. (Non-prime members will be able to sign up for $9.99 per month, which is the same price as competing services.) Amazon says it will also introduce a six-account family plan for $14.99 per month or $149 per year before the end of the year, matching similar options from Spotify, Google, and Apple. The Echo-only plan offers the same content and features as the main service And while the Echo-only plan is limited to only one device (you cannot use it on your phone, PC, tablet, or even more than one Echo device), it still offers the same content library, recommendations, and other features that the full service provides. Amazon is pitching it as a good way for casual listeners that have an Echo to get their feet wet with an on-demand service. The company says its current Prime Music service will still be available to those that don’t subscribe to Music Unlimited, which offers a library of 1 to 2 million songs. The on-demand streaming music service world is fiercely competitive, with Spotify and Apple commanding the lion’s share of attention and paying subscribers. But Amazon has a compelling option with Music Unlimited — especially if you own an Echo — and it has the deep pockets to ride out the market and pony up for exclusives if it needs to. According to Boom, this is just the first iteration of Amazon’s take on an on-demand music service, and there’s plenty more to come in the future. Correction October 12th, 7:30AM ET: An earlier version of this article said Amazon was replacing its Prime Music service with Music Unlimited. The article also said that Amazon had signed deals with thousands of indie labels, when it has actually signed up hundreds. Both errors have been corrected.

California-based Apple announced in August a similar facility would be built in Beijing. Situated close to the border with Hong Kong "Shenzhen is an incredibly dynamic city... we are impatient to open a new research and development centre next year", Apple said in a statement sent to AFP. Apple has seen its market share eroded in China's booming smartphone market this year, beaten out by rising Chinese firms -- market leader Huawei and three companies little known elsewhere, Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi. Apple has also struggled with the country's Communist authorities, despite regular visits from chief executive Tim Cook. Apple's iTunes Movies and iBooks services were launched in China last year, but were then promptly blocked by Beijing. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Gerry Harvey rounds on 'short-sellers'AAP Gerry Harvey claims gripes over Harvey Norman's accounting methods originate from short-sellers trying to drive … Shorten, PM at odds over jobs outlookAAP Harvey blasts share plotters over rumoursAAP Underground rail to link CBD to ParramattaAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7545 +0.0005 +0.06% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6016 +0.0027 +0.45% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6993 +0.0037 +0.53% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Robert Vaughn Toyota AU US refugee Gumtree Four Nations Perth Accommodation Trump protests Car insurance comparison Cecil the Lion Life insurance Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Home News Business, Financial & Legal Apple's shares hit new high since last year While Samsung is experiencing a major crisis, Apple's stock jumped by 2.3 percent By: Lana Jelic | Business, Financial & Legal News | Posted: Oct 12, 2016 1:23 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA While Samsung is trying to forget the Note7 ever happened after the second global recall and the end of production of the device, Apple has reasons to celebrate. Not only did they lose their main competitor to their new iPhone 7, but their stock jumped by 2.3 percent, reaching highest point since last year's December. Part of this can be attributed to the fact that many analysts expect that Apple will gain some sales of their controversial new iPhone even though it was panned by many critics for not having a headphone jack.     Apple's stock was up $2.66 on Tuesday, while at the same time Samsung's dropped by 5%. Samsung is experiencing a major crisis after the decision to permanently end the production of the Galaxy Note7 was made.   On the other hand, Apple is doing pretty well. Although its shares hit a very low point in May, when rumors about "weak and boring" new iPhone started to float around, Apple's new iPhone is in high demand, and the rise of their stock value confirms it.   Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha told Reuters that "that a 5 percent gain in high-end smartphone market share would increase Apple's earnings per share by as much as 7 percent." This is because Apple makes most of their profits off smartphones and the more smartphones the company sells, the better their profits look.   Samsung is the world's largest seller of smartphones by volume, with about 23 percent market share, followed by Apple with 12 percent, according to market research firm IDC. While Samsung is still having strong sales of the Galaxy S7 and other smartphones, there is no question that the Note7 has tarnished the brand's reputation and Apple is benefiting from it.

Gottlieb/Ira and Leonore S. Gershwin Fund Collection, Music Division, Library of Congress. Ella Fitzgerald Apple Music will exclusively release the project with the National Jazz Museum in Harlem on Oct. 14. It’s a real-life treasure hunt that lasted more than 30 years. But now jazz fans can listen to the fruits of that long pursuit on Oct. 14 when the National Jazz Museum in Harlem exclusively releases the first volume in The Savory Collection through Apple Music. “Imagine finding an unknown play of Shakespeare’s or an unknown novel by Mark Twain -- that’s what this is,” declares Loren Schoenberg, founding director and senior scholar of the National Jazz Museum. “It’s as close to a musical time capsule as you’ll ever find. You are right there, in the moment, hearing never-before-heard sounds in truly remarkable fidelity.” Formally titled The National Jazz Museum in Harlem Presents the Savory Collection, Volume 1 — Body and Soul: Coleman Hawkins and Friends, the series’ first release is comprised of 18 digitally restored tracks recorded between 1936-1940. In addition to jazz tenor saxophone legend Hawkins, the set features such swing era icons as Ella Fitzgerald, Fats Waller and Lionel Hampton. Two grat tracks are available now through pre-orders at iTunes.com/SavoryCollection and AppleMusic.com/SavoryCollection: Hawkins and his orchestra’s 1940 live, six-minute take on “Body and Soul”-- two times the length of the original studio recording-- and “Dinah,” a track from a 1938 Hampton jam session. Noted historian and filmmaker Ken Burns wrote the project’s accompanying foreword. These tracks -- performed in nightclubs and ballrooms -- have never been heard since they were initially broadcast on the radio decades ago. Long-rumored to be in existence, these performances were recorded off the air by sound engineer and jazz fan Bill Savory. It was Savory’s son Eugene Desavouret who discovered the unique archive of 975 discs and hundreds of hours of music that were subsequently acquired by the National Jazz Museum. The Savory Collection, Volume 2 will be released later this year, boasting rare tracks performed by the Count Basie Orchestra with saxophonist Lester Young. Additional volumes are slated to be issued in 2017.

 Apple's top M&A exec is a director of the Uber of China Kif Leswing Oct. 12, 2016, 9:09 AM 3,418 facebook linkedin twitter email print Tim Cook/Twitter Apple made an unusually large investment of $1 billion into Didi Chuxing, a ride-hailing giant best understood as the "Uber of China," earlier this year. At the time, Apple officials, including CEO Tim Cook, said the investment would help Apple better understand the Chinese market, and would deliver a strong return on capital. It turns out Apple got one other thing from the deal: a seat on Didi Chuxing's board. Adrian Perica, Apple's vice president in charge of M&A, has joined Didi Chuxing's board, according to a report from The Information.  He joins representatives from other investors on Didi's board, including representatives from Tencent and Alibaba. Earlier this year, a Didi spokesperson had said that Apple would not be joining Didi's board of directors, Dan Primack reported.  Apple's investment in Didi has been seen as a way to placate Chinese regulators who are often defensive towards foreign technology companies.

Apple design patent case By Steve Brachmann October 12, 2016 12 Print Article On the morning of Tuesday, October 11th, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments by counsel representing either party in the Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple case. Much of the court’s line of questioning at times sought answers to whether a standard could be applied in a design patent infringement case in such a way that adequately identifies the amount of profit that could be attributed to a particular aspect of a product’s design. The case was appealed by Samsung Electronics (KRX:005930) after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Fed. Cir.) upheld a $400 million design patent infringement award to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) The award was granted under U.S. Code Title 35 § 289, which gives a plaintiff the right to a defendant’s total profits on any products which are deemed to infringe upon design patents held by the plaintiff. Samsung is trying to argue that the award should be less, as the design patents only cover a few aspects of the smartphone including the rectangular, round-cornered front of a phone and the display screen upon which the graphical user interface is displayed. The day’s arguments were begun by Kathleen M. Sullivan on behalf of Samsung. She led off succinctly stating Samsung’s case in this matter: SULLIVAN: “A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work. But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 of the Patent Act entitles the holder of a single design patent on the portion of the appearance of the phone to total profit on the entire phone. That result makes no sense. A single design patent on the portion of the appearance of the phone should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the profit on the entire phone.” As confirmed by the transcript of the oral argument, it appeared Sullivan was given long periods of time to respond without being interrupted compared to other counsel presenting arguments on the day. Justice Anthony Kennedy initially took up a charge against Sullivan’s argument, noting that there was no way to apportion damages for a design patent the way that the statute is currently written: KENNEDY: “You can’t really have apportionment, so it seems to me you leave us with no — one choice is to have a de minimis exception, like the cup-holder example that’s in the car — maybe the boat windshield, which is a little more difficult — and just follow the — and just follow the words of the statute. But it seems to me neither side gives us an instruction to work with.” Sullivan noted, however, that Samsung did not propose a test that leaves the question as to what portion of profits a patent owner is entitled to after successfully arguing design patent infringement to the jury without guidance. Samsung supported a two-pronged test for determining what constituted the article of manufacture without getting into an apportionment argument. Sullivan indicated that juries in design patent infringement cases could be guided to answer two questions. First, juries should be instructed to decide the specific article of manufacture covered by the design patent. The second step would be to determine the amount of profits specific to that article of manufacture. To determine the amount of profit in that second step, juries could look at ordinary accounting related to the cost of the goods sold in relation to revenues for the relevant component, profit margins if the company buys the component from an original equipment manufacturer or transfer pricing between corporate divisions when different divisions of a company are responsible for manufacturing different components. Were the jury so instructed, there was no way they could have found in favor of Apple, Sullivan said. SULLIVAN: “But the reason we think it’s consistent with Congress’s purpose, Your Honor, is that what Congress was trying to do was design a rule that gives design-patent holders total profit from the article of manufacture. That’s a little bit overinclusive, because if you get total profit on the rugs that were at issue in the Dobson cases, you’ll get a little profit from the design, and there will be a little extra you’re getting perhaps from the fiber or the weave. We think Congress was entitled to exercise its fact-finding powers to say that it is appropriate as a matter of causation to say that design causes value in a single article product like a rug.” After Sullivan, the next oral arguments were made by Brian H. Fletcher who represented the government of the United States in support of neither party. Fletcher argued that while Fed. Cir. correctly read the Section 289 statute in deciding how to award damages in the case, it was a mistake to award total profits as damages in such cases. He noted that, for damages in both utility patent and copyright infringement cases, successful plaintiffs are not entitled to total profits as damages. FLETCHER: “Sometimes you — you might try to build up the share of the profits from bottom up by saying, what’s the cost of each of these components, and then what share of the revenue is attributable to each of these components. And then you say this component is 10 percent of the cost and 20 percent of the revenue, and we — we do a bottom-up calculation and try to do it that way. Courts haven’t always done that. Sometimes that won’t be feasible. Sometimes instead they’ve — they’ve done a more impressionistic approximation and said the total profits are $10 million, and we think that the component at issue here, based on expert testimony, is responsible for a quarter or 25 percent.” Multiple justices tried to hammer down on the difficulty of determining how much profit for which a design element was responsible. Fletcher tried to explain using the example of a Volkswagon VW, a car well-known for it’s “bug”-shaped design. FLETCHER: “So, supposing that we’ve decided that the Bug — the relevant article in the Bug is just the body of the Bug. […] Then I think the question is the best way to determine that, at least I can think of right now, would be consumer surveys addressed to, to what extent are people who buy Bugs making their purchasing decisions based on the look of the car, and to what extent are they instead valuing other things…” This line of reasoning did not play well with every justice on the bench, especially Justice Samuel Alito: ALITO: “This hypothetical is not helpful to me, because I can’t get over the thought that nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks. What if it, you know, costs, I think, $1800 when it was first sold in the United States? What if it cost $18,000? What if it got 2 miles per gallon? What if it broke down every 50 miles? So if that is a real question, if it is a real question whether the article of manufacture there is the design or the entire car, gives me pause about the test for determining what is the article of manufacture.” Fletcher was followed in his remarks by Seth Waxman, counsel for Apple. Despite any question Samsung could raise over the potential that a jury was improperly instructed how to determine the article of manufacture, the Court had no power to overturn the Fed. Cir.’s decision in the case. WAXMAN: “There were two trials below. In neither trial did Samsung, either in argument, statement, or witness testimony, ever identify for the jury any article of manufacture other than the phones themselves. In both trials, Samsung’s expert witness, Mr. Wagner, calculated total profits under 289 only on the phones themselves. And thus there is no — no reasonable juror in these trials could possibly have awarded total profits on anything other than the phones…” It should be noted that earlier, Sullivan said that Samsung did try on six occasions to get the court to identify individual components of the phone as infringing the design patents instead of the entire phone, but each of those arguments were denied because the court felt the argument was seeking apportionment which was denied under Section 289. Compared to the other counsel making oral arguments, Waxman was not given the ability to speak much at length and received more counter-arguments from the SCOTUS bench, which is somewhat unusual. In patent matters Waxman is generally given broad latitude by the Court to make his arguments largely uninterrupted. Chief Justice John Roberts, for one, seemed to have difficulties understanding Apple’s position in the case. ROBERTS: “I — maybe I’m not grasping the difficulties in the case. It seems to me that the design is applied to the exterior case of the phone. It’s not applied to the — all the chips and wires, so why –” WAXMAN: “That’s right.” ROBERTS: “So –” WAXMAN: “That’s absolutely right. And, you know, of course you can’t get a design patent on something that the consumer can’t see. And yet Congress –” ROBERTS: “So there should — there shouldn’t be profits awarded based on the entire price of the phone.” WAXMAN: “No. The profits are awarded on the manufacture to which the design is applied.” ROBERTS: “The outside, the case is part of it.” WAXMAN: “Well, maybe and maybe not. I think the — the difficulty here is that it’s important to understand that design is not a component and that a patented design is not the article of manufacture. The patented design is something that’s applied to an article of manufacture.” ROBERTS: “Okay. Well, these — these little, the chips and all are articles of manufacture, right? How is the design of the case applied to those chips?” Waxman responded to this by noting that many of the earliest design patents issued as far back as the 1840s were filed for stoves and steam engines which had other components, much like smartphones do: WAXMAN: “There’s no doubt the steam engine had plenty of working components, but a design is not a component. A design is applied to a thing. And the jury has to decide in the case of the VW Beetle that you have either a cup-holder or a patented hubcap, or the iconic shape of the car, I think that a jury could very well conclude that because someone who sees the iconic shape of a VW Beetle buys it because they think they are buying Beetle, that is, after all the reason why the infringer copied it.” Waxman also pointed to court documents showing that Samsung realized that it had a “crisis of design” during development of its smartphone products. But although Waxman tried to steer clear of apportionment, going so far as to call it “a really bad word,” he didn’t seem like he was able to direct every justice away from that concept. In the words of Justice Kennedy: “Once you’ve identified the relevant article, then it seems to me necessarily what you’re doing is apportioning profits. I just don’t see how we can get away from that word.” After Waxman’s oral argument time had fully waned, Sullivan was able to return to her arguments with some of the time she had reserved after opening. Although she noted that Samsung conceded that you can’t apportion the value of the design in relation to the article, she noted that Congress did not say that a party couldn’t segregate the proper article from the other articles that make up the product. SULLIVAN: “So you must remand and tell the nation’s economy that no one can claim a partial design patent on a portion of a front face of an electronic device and come in and get the entire profits on the phone. Juries should be instructed that the article of manufacture is either is the Beetle exterior or there might be […] still today, there might be cases of unitary articles, just like the Dobson rugs. The Gorham spoon might be a unitary article. The patents on the handle, but nobody really cares about the sipping cup of the spoon. So we say the article of manufacture is the spoon. And if you get the profits from the spoon, that’s all right.” GINSBURG: “Who has the burden of showing what is the relevant article? I assume in a case like this, Apple will say it’s the whole phone.” SULLIVAN: “Justice Ginsburg, if I leave you with the most important disagreement we have with the government and with Apple, the burden is on the plaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show what the article of manufacture is. Why is that? The burden is on the plaintiff to show damages. And subsidiary questions subsumed in what the damages are are also always the plaintiff’s burden, as the entire market value rule in the Federal Circuit shows. With respect, we request that you remand — vacate and remand.” At 11:07 a.m. ET, Chief Justice Roberts declared: “The case is submitted.” Now we wait for a decision that will come sometime before the end of the Court’s term in June 2017. While it may have seemed that the oral arguments went well for Samsung, that is not always, or even usually, a good gauge of how the Court will ultimately decide. Of course, time will tell.

Anon October 12, 2016 11:02 am Slicing up the item actually sold into constituent “articles of manufacture” IS apportionment. The words of the statute cannot be “interpreted” to a level that re-writes them. Such would be the correct judicial response (perhaps accompanied by a plea to Congress to change the actual words of the law). I do not make a prediction here whether the Court will follow the proper course and limits of its powers, or will (once again) take to scrivining to reach its own desired ends. Gene Quinn October 12, 2016 12:53 pm Anon- It seems that Congress has largely become an irrelevant branch of government. Executive Power is at an all-time high and the Supreme Court is really the Supreme Legislature. Although the statute is clear, the talk of a de minimus exception to the clear language is appalling. Sounds a lot like they are going to create judicial exceptions to the statute. After all, they work so well to re-write 101, so why not damages. -Gene IPdude October 12, 2016 1:05 pm FYI – MCM denied. Hello Reform Era. Anon October 12, 2016 1:19 pm Don’t speak so loudly about Congress being “irrelevant,” as that just might affect the amount of “voices” they can stick into their pockets (vis a vis Citizen’s United). If that were to happen, Congress might be forced to awaken from its slumber and recall its authority over writing statutory law. The Founding Fathers were extremely concerned with checks and balances. Our modern day has seemed to have lost this perspective. There is no doubt in my mind that we (all) will reap what is sown with that lackadaisical mindset. JD October 12, 2016 1:22 pm From a legal perspective, it would be shocking if Samsung won this one. The statute on its face is clear that a design-patent infringer should cough up its entire profits on the infringing article of manufacture. (Digest of Apple’s argument). Further, even if the profits should be apportioned, Samsung didn’t offer evidence to support an apportionment theory. (Digest of Samsung’s argument). The initial burden was on Apple to prove the fact of damages. And Apple met this burden by showing infringement. The burden then shifted to Samsung to show that the lost profits should be apportioned to something less than that of the entire phones. Samsung didn’t meet this burden. Anon October 12, 2016 1:23 pm IPdude, When money and ideology hold sway, that is not called “reform” (if one is being inte11ectually honest). If you want to ape “1984,” on the other hand, your “reform” is well underway. IPdude October 12, 2016 1:43 pm Anon @6 – my mistake. Era of Infringement. Anon October 12, 2016 4:30 pm IPdude, Perhaps “Era of Efficient Infringement” (not quite sure yet whether the “little guys” will be “getting away” with the same level of “efficiency”) Paul F. Morgan October 13, 2016 10:16 am Did I read the same transcript of this oral argument? I thought I read a statement by a Justice that both parties and the Government were all in agreement that the decision below of the Fed. Cir. agreeing to the award to Apple of the entire profits of the entire Samsung phone was incorrect? Does that not guarantee some kind of reversal here? Anon October 13, 2016 11:12 am Paul, Not necessarily. If all parties want the law (as written) to mean something other than what the law actually is, the fact that all parties want a different law is simply not enough to change the law as written to be a different law. This does highlight the problem with “legislating from the bench” especially in regard to statutory law. Prizzi's Glory October 14, 2016 12:31 pm As far as I can tell, the exterior of the iPhone is a separate article that can be purchased separately to replace a broken or damaged exterior. The exterior comes in two pieces: a front display and a rear case. Here are instructions for replacement of the iPhone exterior. https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+5+Rear+Case+Replacement/10899 Anon October 14, 2016 1:14 pm Prizzi’s Glory, Even if what you say is true, that would only pertain to the aftermarket sales and would not pertain to the protections afforded the initial sales. You do not get such a “pass” on the initial sales if there exists a separate after-sales market. Post a Comment Respectfully add to the discussion.

Such was the golden fall Clearwater Valley morning on Saturday, Oct. 1, as several dozen people gathered at the Tahoe QRU building on Leitch Creek Road to combine apples and elbow grease into smooth, sweet cider. “This was a great apple year,” said Irene Finehout, EMT for Tahoe QRU, which has organized this fund-raiser now in its third year. Participants are encouraged to bring apples and containers, and they can use the available hand presses to grind up the fruit, the end product of which is squeezed for juice and the remaining mash made available for livestock feed or to make other products such as apple cider vinegar. Donations toward the QRU for this service were accepted About 50 people participated that morning for the event — which raised a total $156 for Tahoe QRU — bringing a range of apples from red and golden delicious to McIntosh and gala. Loma Ulmer of Kamiah, with her husband, Jack, were running some “good cooking apples” through the press that came from a tree their parents had planted in the 1950s. “About four gallons,” Loma said they gleaned from their pressing and poured into milk jugs. The product was a medium brown with light froth, and at ambient temperature it gave a refreshing light sweet taste to start off the month of October. Participants brought in apples from their own orchards or from those gleaned off trees along country roads. Pretty much any apples would do. “It’s a great way to use the smaller, wormy apples,” Finehout said. Presses for the event were provided by Dick Tucker, Lewis Ulmer and Dale Cooper. Of these, Ulmer’s press held seniority at 100 years old; still working smooth to chew apples into ragged strips before being placed in a round slatted-sided bucket topped with two corresponding wooden disks that would be pressed into the mass. A lever was used to screw the press downward, squeezing juice between the slats and out onto the wooden platform into a catch trough below. “They aren’t a problem,” one man said of the few yellow jackets attending the event. There’s enough for all, and they were there long enough just to fill up their gullets before flying off.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) received some bullish commentary from analysts at Mizuho Securities today. The firm reiterated its Buy rating on AAPL and lifted its price target from $120 to $130. That new target suggests a 12% upside to the stock’s Tuesday closing price of $116.30. Noting that Apple will deliver fiscal fourth quarter earnings on October 25 after the market close, Mizuho expects revenue and EPS to come in-line to slightly above Wall Street estimates. However, the firm sees possible significant upside for the all-important upcoming holiday quarter, with Apple likely benefitting from recent smartphone woes at primary competitor Samsung. Samsung has been on the ropes lately amid a botched product recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, which reportedly burst into flames for several users. The device was banned from air travel as a result, and Samsung attempted to replace the phones with newer versions before pulling the plug on the device entirely yesterday. Samsung stock plunged yesterday on that news, while Apple gained. With Samsung’s brand quality at risk, Mizuho continues to see compelling risk-reward at Apple’s current share price levels, with significant potential upside to forward-looking earnings estimates in the near term. Apple shares rose $0.65 (+0.56%) to $116.95 in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, the largest stock in the world by market cap has risen 10.49, easily outpacing the benchmark S&P 500’s 4.69% return in the same period.

Amazon Music Unlimited will offer "tens of millions of songs" to subscribers, the company said, a step up from the two million available on its existing Amazon Prime streaming service. The new service costs $9.99 a month -- the same as rivals Spotify Premium, Apple Music and Google Play -- but Amazon is offering a discounted rate of $3.99 for subscribers who limit use to its voice-controlled Echo speakers. Current Prime customers can switch to the new service for $7.99 a month or $79 a year, Amazon said. Amazon Music Unlimited also comes with a new redesigned app. Music streaming has boomed this year, with the number of streams more than doubling in the first six months of the year compared to the same period last year, according to trade specialists BuzzAngle Music. Amazon's new US offering comes a month after Sweden's Spotify said it had passed 40 million paying subscribers, consolidating its position as world leader in the streaming sector. Spotify stands well clear of its nearest rival Apple Music, which had some 15 million paying subscribers in June, but it has yet to post an annual profit, spending most of its revenue on compensating artists and rights-holders. Last month Norwegian media said the Tidal streaming service, owned by rap megastar Jay-Z, had posted heavy losses and was having problems making payments on time. Tidal had a major boost earlier in the year when Beyonce -- who is married to Jay-Z -- released her album "Lemonade" exclusively on the service. The new Amazon service is scheduled to launch in Britain, Germany and Austria later this year. 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1. Foreign residents account fo... 2.

Listeners in over 100 countries can now stream Vancouver’s CKNW AM 980, Calgary’s News Talk 770, Edmonton’s 630 CHED, Winnipeg’s 680 CJOB, London’s AM 980, Hamilton’s AM 900 CHML and Toronto’s AM 640 with Apple Music on any of their Apple audio devices, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV and Apple Carplay.  According to a statement sent to MobileSyrup, Corus Radio is the first Canadian commercial radio company to make its way onto Apple Music. Apple Music is a streaming service that gives users access to Apple’s entire music streaming catalogue for $9.99 per month, or $14.99 per month for a family subscription. “With Apple’s immense role in the music and technology space, we’re offering our audience the best possible listening experience on a wide variety of devices,” said Chris ‘Dunner’ Duncombe, director of digital at Corus Radio. “Our goal is to deliver high quality programming on every platform that matters to our listeners and we are thrilled to be the first Canadian broadcaster to do so on Apple Music.” Corus completed a $2.65 billion acquisition of Shaw media back in April, which granted it full ownership of the company’s media assets, including the broadcaster Global News. Furthermore, streaming technologies have steadily become more and more popular options for audio and video consumption around the world. Streaming services like Apple Music, Spotify, and Amazon have accelerated the growth of this industry, forcing traditional media to adapt to these new mediums.  Corus will join the likes of BBC Radio, Bloomberg, NPR and ESPN on Apple Music.

Home News Operating Systems On this day: NeXT computers changed the course of IT The NeXT Computer was not a significant commercial success, but it had a huge impact on the IT By: Lana Jelic | Operating Systems News | Posted: Oct 12, 2016 12:27 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Following a long power struggle, Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985. After leaving Apple, Jobs took a few of its members with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in state-of-the-art computers for higher-education and business markets.     The new company began to build the NeXT computer that has been launched on this day in 1988 in San Francisco. The NeXT Computer was revealed at an invitation-only gala launch event on October 12th, 1988. The following day, selected educators and software developers were invited to attend the first public technical overview of the NeXT computer, and they had to pay $100 registration fee to witness Steve Jobs himself introducing the computer.   The NeXT Computer was not a significant commercial success. It failed to reach the level of sales of Apple II, Commodore 64 and Macintosh. However, this vast and expensive black cube is quite important for the IT history, and Jobs said the NeXT computer was ahead of its time.     The NeXT introduced several innovations to then PCs, which included an optical drive and a built-in digital signal processor that enabled voice recognition and object-oriented programming language.   The NeXT computer was a high-performance workstation that ran the Mach- and BSD-derived, Unix-based NeXTSTEP operating system, with a proprietary GUI using a Display PostScript-based back end. It came in case dimensions of 30x30x30 cm, which is why it had been named the Cube.     The original NeXT computer came with 25MHz Motorola processor and 8MiB of RAM, which could have been expanded up to 16MiB. It had 256 MiB magneto-optical drive and optional hard disk. It came with a 17-inch black and white screen.   But even though it was powerful, its high price of $6,500 is equivalent to $13,005 in 2016, prevented the NeXT from achieving success on the market. The workstations were mainly sold to universities, financial institutions, and government agencies.   However, the NeXT computer had a huge impact on the industry as a whole. NeXT Computer and its object-oriented development tools and libraries were used by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at CERN to develop the world's first web server software, CERN httpd, and also used to write the first web browser, WorldWideWeb. It was also used by Jesse Tayler at Paget Press to develop the first electronic AppStore The Electronic AppWrapper in the early 1990s.     NeXT later became a software company which Apple bought in 1997, and the NeXTSTEP platform became the foundation of Mac OS X operating system. Eventually, Apple's iOS, which runs the iPhone and iPad, was based upon Mac OS X, hence the link to the NeXT. So basically, if it weren't for the NeXT computer back in 1988, modern computers today would look and behave very differently.

Amazon's music streaming service has arrived Watch out Spotify? Amazon's music streaming service has arrived Wednesday, 12 October 2016 Amazon will give Spotify and Apple a run for their money in the world of music streaming with the launch of a long-rumoured streaming service. Amazon Music Unlimited will offer access to music for as little as $3.99 (£3.26) per month in the US and is incorporating the service into its Prime offering, which already gives customers a vast array of services such as delivery and video streaming. *Read more*: Eight very cool ways Amazon Echo can make your life easier For users not signed up to Prime, it will be priced at $9.99, exactly that of Spotify and Apple Music. That will go down to $7.99 for Prime subscribers, while the $3.99 price is reserved for those subscribing via Amazon Echo, its smarthome speaker with AI voice assistant. The addition of music streaming to Echo adds another string to its bow in a bid to create the smart home of the future as it faces new competition from Google which last week launched its own voice activated home speaker.  "The first phase of growth (in music streaming) was driven almost entirely by smartphones. We believe pretty strongly that the next phase of growth in streaming is going to come from the home," said Amazon Music vice president Steve Boom, in an interview with Reuters. *Read more*: Twitter has invested $70m in music streaming service SoundCloud But, by wrapping it up under the Prime banner at a cheaper price, it's just another reason for people to sign up to the monthly subscription service which is priced at £79 per month in the UK and includes a host of benefits. It will also launch a family subscription in the coming months, letting a number of different users sign up collectively for less - $14.99 for six people. That's the same as Spotify and Apple Music. The service is initially available in the US only, but will roll out to the UK, Germany and Austria by the end of the year. *Amazon Music, Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer and Tidal subscription prices compared* Service  Standard price Family price Other price Other price Amazon Music $9.99 $14.99 $3.99 (Echo user) $7.99 (Prime member) Apple Music $9.99 $14.99 Three month free trial - Spotify $9.99 $14.99 30 day free trial - Deezer $9.99 $16 30 day free trial - Tidal $9.99 $14.99 30 day free trial $19.99 (HiFi high quality) » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Entertainment - on October 12, 2016< > Embed Amazon Launches For-Pay Streaming Music Service 00:39 Amazon is launching a paid streaming music service, the latest entry in an increasingly crowded field.

Home Companies Apple to set up second R&D centre in China Apple to set up second R&D centre in China US tech giant Apple will open a second research and development centre in China to focus on manufacturing and software development as it looks to increase its foothold in in the world's second largest economy amid tough competition from domestic rivals. By: PTI | Beijing | Published: October 12, 2016 6:04 PM Around 100,000 people are developing software for Apple in Shenzhen currently, Cook, who rated the quality of Shenzhen software developers’ products as top in the world said. (Reuters) US tech giant Apple will open a second research and development centre in China to focus on manufacturing and software development as it looks to increase its foothold in in the world’s second largest economy amid tough competition from domestic rivals. The announcement to set up second R&D centre was made by Apple CEO Tim Cook during a meeting with top Shenzhen officials on Tuesday at the sidelines of 2016 National Mass Innovation and Entrepreneurship Week, according to sources with the municipal government. Around 100,000 people are developing software for Apple in Shenzhen currently, Cook, who rated the quality of Shenzhen software developers’ products as top in the world said. He said Apple planned to seize the worker advantage to increase investment on research, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. China is Apple’s major overseas market. But iPhones are facing growing challenges posed by Chinese competitors like Huawei, Oppo and Vivo. During his visit to China in August, Cook unveiled Apple’s first research center in Beijing. Shenzhen is China’s hi-tech hub, investing a whopping 4.05 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) into research and development, and hosting a number of top tech firms like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, and ZTE Corp. Apple has established its first directly invested research and development centre in Beijing last month to develop advanced technologies. It was established with registered capital of 100 million RMB, ($16 million) and the total investment is 300 million RMB ($50 million). China is the largest smartphone market in terms of shipments. Apple currently placed in fifth position in terms of its mobile phones behind the local brands Huawei, Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi which are now the top four smartphone makers in China with a combined market share of 53 per cent. In the second quarter 111.2 million units were shipped, an increase of 4.6 per cent from the previous year’s June quarter. Though dominated by local players like Huawei, Apple has built substantial market in China by expanding its net work of show rooms. Observers say Apple looks to grab Samsung market in China as the Korean giant is grappling with crisis stirred by the faulty batteries. The recall decision will have a big impact on Samsung’s plan to regain the top position in China,a ccording to Forbes magazine. Samsung  market share has dropped to less than 10 this year in Chinese market from about 20 percent in 2013 as local competitors rolled out cheaper products with better designs. The company was banking on the Note 7 smartphone to revive consumers’ interest in the brand. Please Wait while comments are loading...

News Sports Things to Do Life Obituaries e-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Amazon launches for-pay streaming music service Wednesday Oct 12, 2016 at 8:14 AM Amazon is launching a paid streaming music service, the latest entry in an increasingly crowded field. Amazon Music Unlimited is being positioned to compete against existing services such as Spotify and Apple Music. It will cost $8 per month, or $80 a year, for members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime loyalty program. Non-Prime members will pay $10 a month, the same monthly fee charged by Spotify and Apple Music. The Associated Press Amazon is launching a paid streaming music service, the latest entry in an increasingly crowded field. Amazon Music Unlimited is being positioned to compete against existing services such as Spotify and Apple Music. It will cost $8 per month, or $80 a year, for members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime loyalty program. Non-Prime members will pay $10 a month, the same monthly fee charged by Spotify and Apple Music. Owners of Amazon's Echo smart speaker, meanwhile, will be able to get the unlimited music service on one device for $4 per month. The steaming service is one more perk — like two-day free shipping and Amazon Video — that the Seattle-based company hopes will attract people to its Prime program and thus encourage them to spend more on its flagship site. Amazon already offers Amazon Prime Music for free to Prime members, but that includes about two million songs, while the new service boasts a catalog of "tens of millions" of songs. "Think of this as two different levels: Prime is now the introductory service and Unlimited is the full service," said Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of digital music. The service's launch comes as the way people listen to music is changing. According to Nielsen , during the first half of 2016, digital purchasing of single tracks was down 24 percent and digital albums were down 18 percent, while streaming was up 59 percent, compared with the same period a year ago. "The recorded music industry has been fumbling for a digital business model that really works, and I think streaming has come into its own," said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna. In fact, streaming of audio has eclipsed video streaming, according to Nielsen. Audio's share of streaming is 54 percent as of June 30, compared with 44 percent a year earlier. But it still faces the music industry's problem of low margins, Verna said. "There is definitely room to grow the pie simply because more and more music consumers are choosing this way of accessing their music," he said. "But the potential rewards are not huge and infinite, they're sort of modest and there are already quite a few players in the space." Most streaming services now offer similar catalogues of music and pricing is about the same. So services have differentiated by user interface, Verna said. One way Amazon is hoping to stand out is with its Alexa voice control, via the Echo or other Alexa-enabled devices. Users can ask the Echo to play a certain song or playlist, but can also search for music just by saying they want to hear the "new" song by any artist, a genre of music from a certain decade, or by saying the lyrics of a song if they can't remember the name. The service is available starting Wednesday in the U.S. and in the U.K., Germany and Austria this year.

October 12 AAPL: 117.34 1.04 Samsung looks likely to win Supreme Court appeal against damages in Apple patent case Ben Lovejoy - 1 month ago @benlovejoy AAPL Samsung Patent trial View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The never-ending court battle between Apple and Samsung over three iPhone design patents finally reached the Supreme Court yesterday. It had earlier been found that a total of 11 Samsung phones copied three design elements patented by Apple – including the famous ‘black rectangle with rounded corners.’ Lower courts ruled that Samsung should have to pay 100% of the profits earned from those phones, while Samsung thinks it should pay less. Remarks by two of the Justices seem to indicate that they are leaning heavily towards Samsung’s side of the argument. Samsung’s position is that the patented features represent only part of the reason for purchase, and that they should accordingly have to hand over only part of the profits earned from them … Chief Justice John Roberts agreed that the exterior design represented only part of the appeal of a phone. Maybe I’m not grasping the difficulties in this case. It seems to me that the design is applied to the exterior case of the phone. It’s not applied to all the chips and wires. Justice Stephen Breyer gave an even more definitive indication of his own view, which accords with that of many law professors. For wallpaper, you get the whole thing [100% of the profits]. A Rolls-Royce with the thing on the hood? No, no, no you don’t get profits on the whole car. Roberts agreed that the award should reflect only the value apportioned to the exterior casing. Apple lawyer Seth Waxman didn’t directly dispute this, but argued instead that Samsung had failed to make this point in earlier hearings, and therefore the jury was correct in awarding damages based on the entire phone, not just elements of the design. However, Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested that consumers might indeed be basing their purchase decision purely on the visible design elements which Samsung had copied from the iPhone. The phone could be seen by a purchasing consumer as being just … that rounded edge, slim outer shell. There was also a discussion of the iconic VW Beetle, whose visual design may have represented the primary reason for purchase. A lawyer for the government – which is not taking sides in the dispute, but participating as an interested party in terms of how the law is interpreted – said that a decision might be aided by bringing in expert witnesses and examining consumer surveys on reasons for purchase. A Supreme Court ruling on the case is expected to take two to three months. If the court does rule that lower damages are appropriate, it will not itself decide that amount, but instead pass the case back to a federal court to rule on the revised sum. With recent events, Samsung will be trying to hang on to all the money it can … Drawn from reports by ArsTechnica, MacWorld, Fortune, Reuters and Buzzfeed.

October 12 AAPL: 117.34 1.04 Apple announces plans for second R&D center in China to ‘work more closely with manufacturing partners’ Ben Lovejoy - 1 month ago @benlovejoy AAPL china Shenzhen skyline View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Even before Apple has built its first Chinese R&D center in Beijing, Tim Cook has announced that a second one is on the way. Reuters reports that the second one will be in the country’s largest manufacturing district, Shenzhen. Apple said that this center will be specifically focused on allowing Apple to work more closely with its manufacturing partners in the country … “We are excited to be opening a new Research and Development center here next year so our engineering team can work even more closely and collaboratively with our manufacturing partners,” Cupertino-based Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said in emailed comments. Strengthening relationships with local universities is a secondary aim, added Rosenstock. While the Beijing center may be partly geared by political motives, the company seeking to establish better relationships with the Chinese government, a Shenzhen center makes perfect sense for a company which has always said that manufacturing feasibility is a key consideration right from the earliest stages in new product design. Shenzhen’s importance as a manufacturing center stems from being China’s first Special Economic Zone, which allow inward investment by foreign companies without prior approval from central government. Tax incentives are also provided to encourage growth, and the city is home to many tech companies.

Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said in a note to investors that Apple could get as many as 8 million new buyers after the Note 7 fiasco, explaining that this marks “a big opportunity for Apple to gain market share.” Android is currently the leading mobile operating system with as much as 80 percent, depending on research firm and region, and Samsung is the number one device manufacturer, partly thanks to new models such as the Galaxy S7, which sold in record numbers. Strong iPhone 7 sales The iPhone 7 is doing well even without Samsung’s help, the analyst explains, and the Chinese market, which has often been considered a rather unfriendly region for Apple, seems to be very successful for the new model. The Plus version is experiencing better sales in China, but overall the iPhone 7 lineup is recording strong demand across the entire country. “During our visit to over 30 smartphone stores and electronic retailers in Shenzhen this week, we could feel the momentum of Apple’s iPhone franchise and the struggles at some of its important competitors in China,” the analyst explained. “The iPhone 7 Plus is clearly favored over the iPhone 7 in China, while the two new black colors were the most popular. Moreover, today’s meetings with two leading China-based telecom carriers highlighted better demand for the iPhone 7/7 Plus launch compared to the iPhone 6s/6s Plus. In Hong Kong, one of our contacts indicated that the 256GB Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus was selling for HK22,000 (US$2,835) shortly after launch.” Apple hasn’t provided any details on iPhone 7 sales, and the company has even refused to disclose first-weekend sales for the new model, but demand is believed to be very high, especially because the top models in Black and Jet Black were listed as out of stock shortly after launch. #Apple#iPhone 7#Samsung#Note 7 explosions#Note 7 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone 7 Allegedly Explodes like a Grenade, Causes Injuries to Owner’s Face Apple Releases the Fourth Developer and Public Beta of macOS 10.12.1 Sierra Apple Starts Investigating Exploding iPhones Too After Samsung’s Note 7 Disaster Apple Releases iOS 10.1 Public Beta 3 with Portrait Camera for iPhone 7 Plus Five Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked Nikon Updates Firmware for Its COOLPIX A300 Camera - Get Version 1.2 Microsoft Releases Interactive Mail Notifications for All Windows 10 Users KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive    iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments iPhones Get a Feature to Secretly Call the Police Without Anyone Noticing more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

I don’t have a job in the private sector thinking government doesn’t matter; it does.’” Read more. Story Continued Below MM DECODER — So does this mean Sandberg won’t serve in a potential Clinton administration? Nope. This is pretty standard boilerplate for any serious potential Cabinet secretary. The absolute last thing you want to do is suggest you have any interest in a job. That’s a quick way to get your name off the list. It’s also what Sandberg has to say to ensure no impact on Facebook’s stock price. Will she wind up at Treasury or somewhere else? Maybe not. But she’s still a leading candidate. And this was hardly a categorical denial that she would serve if asked. The fact remains, as several Clinton confidantes have noted to MM, that if a president-elect calls you and asks you to serve in a critical position, saying no is a very difficult thing to do. It would be even harder if it’s the first-ever female president asking one of the nation’s highest-profile female executives for help. Again, no guarantee this happens. But it still could. MM FLASHBACK — Back when the NYT first reported then Goldman Sachs CEO Hank Paulson as a potential Treasury Secretary, Paulson and his aides went to great lengths to push back against the idea that he would go to Washington. Paulson had turned the job down in the past. Then Paulson became Treasury Secretary. In other words, things change. SPEAKING OF FACEBOOK … Hannah Kuchler in San Francisco: “Facebook is fighting back against US tax authorities, which the social network says are asking for too much information over allegations that the company undervalued assets when it transferred them to Ireland. The world’s largest social network has accused the IRS of being ‘extraordinarily broad’ when it issued summonses to obtain documents that may help it establish if Facebook’s accountants undervalued the assets by billions of dollars. “In documents filed in court on Tuesday, Facebook argues the tax authority is responsible for delays in the process, having frequently asked for extensions on its audit, being inconsistent about when it works and uncoordinated internally. The company said it was asked for ‘hundreds of thousands of documents about virtually every aspect of Facebook’s core business’, as the IRS requested information about its growth.” Read more. WARREN HAS A LIST — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren attempted to influence Hillary Clinton's personnel picks, presenting the campaign with a list of potential hires, the latest batch of WikiLeaks emails shows. The emails … . provide a rare glimpse into Warren's attempts to keep Wall Street allies out of the next administration and her skepticism about Clinton's intentions. An unverified January 2015 email from Clinton speechwriting director Dan Schwerin to other campaign officials describes a discussion with longtime Warren aide Dan Geldon, following a meeting that Warren and Clinton had the previous month. “The adviser to the Massachusetts Democrat was ‘intently focused on personnel issues,’ the email read. He ‘laid out a detailed case against the [former Treasury Secretary] Bob Rubin school of Democratic policymakers, was very critical of the Obama administration's choices, and explained at length the opposition to Antonio Weiss’” Read more. AS TRUMP FADES, RATE HIKE ODDS RISE — FT’s Adam Samson: “A torrid few weeks for … Trump, the US Republican presidential candidate, may be good news for investors hoping for a 2016 rate increase. Goldman Sachs on Monday increased the odds it is pinning on a 2016 rate increase to 75 per cent, from 65 per cent, on more upbeat economic data and ‘the swing in the presidential election race’ towards Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. … Goldman’s reference to Mr Trump highlights the unusually large impact the presidential election is having on the financial market. “The probability of a victory by Mr Trump … has fallen to 10 — 20 per cent, from 30 — 35 per cent over the past two weeks, the New York investment bank estimated, citing betting markets and poll aggregators … ‘This is important because market participants seem to view a Trump victory as a potential trigger for a significant tightening in financial conditions, which in turn could result in another delay’, Goldman noted” Read more. MAY CALMS INVESTORS — Bloomberg: “Prime Minister Theresa May has accepted that Parliament should be allowed to vote on her plan for taking Britain out of the European Union, but asked lawmakers to do it in a way that gives her space to negotiate. The decision seemed to calm investors after they dumped the pound on concern May was taking a gung-ho approach to the negotiations. “The currency took a beating after May signaled her intention to put immigration curbs before the City of London’s interests in pulling Britain out of the European Union. Parliament will debate on Wednesday a motion from the opposition Labour Party calling for a ‘full and transparent debate on the government’s plan for leaving the EU’ and for Parliament to be able to ‘properly scrutinize that plan’ before she begins formal talks.” Read more.

QUITTING TO GET AHEAD — Via Third Way: “Rising quits usually indicate rising wages to come. But while quits have increased steadily in the years following the recession, wages are only just beginning to show signs of life. A new report from Third Way looks at how labor market reentry and industry dynamics play into the quits-wages relationship.” Read more. BATTLE OF THE TAX PLANS — POLITICO’s Brian Faler: “When it comes to taxes, voters face a stark choice this November, a pair of new reports shows. Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes by $1.4 trillion while Donald Trump would cut them by $6.2 trillion. The wealthy would be the big winners under his plan, the centrist Tax Policy Center said Tuesday, with the top 1 percent seeing an average tax cut of $215,000. The rich would bear nearly all of Clinton's tax increases, the group said, with the top 1 percent seeing their tax bills climbing by an average $118,000. “Trump would cut business taxes by more than $2.6 trillion, while Clinton would increase them by $130 billion. Her plan, with its mix of tax hikes on the rich and tax cuts for certain targeted groups further down the income ladder, would make the tax code a lot more complex. Trump's plan would simplify the code, the group said, though he would introduce his own complications, especially when it comes to taxing small businesses” Read more. CHELSEA CLINTON RAISED FOUNDATION CONCERNS — POLITICO’s Kenneth P. Vogel: “Chelsea Clinton flagged ‘serious concerns’ about her father’s closest aides trying to cash in by using the former president’s name to gain access to government officials on behalf of paying clients, according to hacked emails released this week. “The emails, which were disseminated by WikiLeaks, reveal the bitter tensions within the Clintons’ inner circle that were inflamed when Chelsea Clinton tried to put an end to practices that blurred the line between the foundation, governments and a consulting firm called Teneo that paid Bill Clinton” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life!

SAMSUNG — FT’s Tim Bradshaw: “The US Supreme Court heard its first case involving design patents for more than a century on Tuesday, as Samsung Electronics and Apple took their fight over iPhone copying to America’s highest judges. “The blockbuster legal clash between the world’s top two smartphone makers began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung in California for patent infringement. A jury in San Jose initially awarded Apple more than $1bn in damages for the copying of the iPhone’s rounded corners and grid of colourful app icons. While some of those damages have been reviewed in separate appeals, hundreds of millions of dollars were still at stake in Tuesday’s hearing.” Read more. WELLS WAR COUNCIL — WSJ’s Emily Glazer: “Wells Fargo & Co.’s top brass laid out the bank’s strategy to move past its sales-tactics scandal on an hour-long call Monday with around 500 senior executives, according to a recording of the call reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. “One executive asked how the bank will use metrics to measure efforts to rebuild trust with customers. Mr. Sloan said the main focus is measuring remediation and consumer sentiment toward Wells Fargo. That is something the bank is doing in real-time to determine how quickly it can roll out its new marketing campaigns.” Read more. CFPM STRUCUTRE SMACKED DOWN — POLITICO’s Lorraine Woellert: “An appellate court on Tuesday called the CFPB constitutionally flawed and gave the White House the authority to remove its director at will, boosting congressional efforts to rein in the powerful agency and undercutting its independence.” "The CFPB is unconstitutionally structured,” read the opinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. “Never before has an independent agency exercising substantial executive authority been headed by just one person.” The president will now have the authority to "direct the director" and remove him or her for any reason, the court wrote.

SAMSUNG — FT’s Tim Bradshaw: “The US Supreme Court heard its first case involving design patents for more than a century on Tuesday, as Samsung Electronics and Apple took their fight over iPhone copying to America’s highest judges. “The blockbuster legal clash between the world’s top two smartphone makers began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung in California for patent infringement. A jury in San Jose initially awarded Apple more than $1bn in damages for the copying of the iPhone’s rounded corners and grid of colourful app icons. While some of those damages have been reviewed in separate appeals, hundreds of millions of dollars were still at stake in Tuesday’s hearing.” DEUTSCHE BOND DASH — Reuters’ Shankar Ramakrishnan and Natalie Harrison: “Deutsche Bank made a rapid-fire return to the US high-grade bond market on Tuesday, satisfying investor demand by tapping last week's $3 billion deal for another $1.5 billion in fresh cash. “Investors who bought into Friday's deal were clamoring for more, leading the bank to sell new debt for the second straight session - and show it still has significant access to funding.” Read more. A FAMILY AFFAIR — WSJ’s Jonathan Cheng: “A worsening crisis over faulty Samsung Electronics Co. smartphones has thrust the conglomerate’s heir apparent, Lee Jae-yong, into his first critical leadership test. “Since his father was incapacitated by a heart attack more than two years ago, Mr. Lee, a 48-year-old Samsung Group vice chairman and the third-generation scion of South Korea’s biggest business empire, has been thrust into the limelight, overseeing a sprawling conglomerate whose businesses span the gamut from shipbuilding to life insurance, refrigerators to biologic drugs.” Read more. SUPPLY SHOCK SOON? — FT’s Andrew Ward: “The world risks another oil supply crunch because of the collapse in capital spending by energy companies over the past two years, the head of the largest crude producer warned on Tuesday. “Amin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s state-controlled energy group, cited research showing that $1tn of investment in oil and gas exploration and production had been cancelled or deferred since crude prices crashed in 2014.” Read more. CFPB FLY-AROUND — Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg: “The federal appeals court decision to subject the CFPB director to the control of the President rather than to invalidate the single-director structure is a net negative, in our view, for the banks. This creates a more political and less predictable agency. It also suggests the prepaid debit rule and expected proposal on bank overdrafts will proceed on schedule. “The federal appeals court ruled that the single director structure was unconstitutional. The judges, however, declined to invalidate the CFPB or any of its rules. Instead, the court simply invalidated the language in Dodd-Frank that sharply limits the ability of the President to fire the CFPB director. This means the director now reports to the President and can be removed by the President whenever the commander and chief desires.” ABA statement: "We’ve long believed that a five-member, bipartisan commission, as originally proposed, would strike a reasonable balance between independence and accountability. A commission would broaden the perspective on any rulemaking and promote fair enforcement activity at the Bureau, and it would provide necessary and appropriate checks and balances in the exercise of the CFPB’s authority, consistent with the court’s decision. Competitive Enterprise Institute: “Today’s ruling will play a major role in providing proper accountability for this rogue agency … It also opens the door for CEI’s district court case, State National Bank of Big Spring v. Lew, to move forward, challenging the constitutionality of other aspects of CFPB.” Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky: “This decision is undoubtedly a win for PHH, but its victory is far from flawless given market expectations and lingering uncertainty given that the matter is now remanded back to the CFPB for further review. Our sense is that PHH will ultimately benefit from the Court’s contouring of the case, especially in relation to the statute of limitations, but it is difficult to gauge the precise impact at this stage given lingering methodological and timeline uncertainties.” WSJ’s Brent Kendall and Yuka Hayashi: “The Tuesday ruling was the latest legal setback to the Obama administration’s postcrisis financial-regulatory regime. … The panel’s decision limited the broad discretion granted the five-year-old [CFPB] … in the name of tilting the balance of power from industry to small borrowers, calling it a ‘gross departure’ from the checks and balances normally imposed on regulatory agencies. “The judges also harshly criticized the enforcement action that led to the court ruling. It ordered the agency to reconsider the penalties that the CFPB had imposed on a mortgage lender for allegedly overcharging consumers. If it stands, the … would reduce the agency’s independence, empowering the White House to supervise the agency and remove its director, in contrast to the current arrangement where the director’s five-year term is intended to outlast a president’s” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — G7 ADOPTS CYBER ACCORD — POLITICOs Martin Matishak: “Seven of the world's largest economies have adopted a new agreement aimed at bolstering the digital defenses protecting the financial sector. The non-binding compact, which the Group of 7 revealed, lays out eight suggested principles for private firms and government agencies to follow, including strategies for protecting the financial sector from attacks and coordinating responses to lessen the impact of hacks.” Read more. NBC DUMPS BUSH — WSJ’s Joe Flint: “NBC is expected to part ways with ‘Today’ show anchor Billy Bush after the emergence of a tape in which he engaged in a lewd conversation about women with … Trump … The network is negotiating Mr. Bush’s exit, which could be finalized in the next several days, the person said. He had already been suspended indefinitely from his job co-anchoring the 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. hour of ‘Today.’" Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements.

The Pogba: 1,200Pg = NHS annual budget EU legal eagle: Euro court should review Intel's €1.6bn fine ‘Alan Turing law’ to give posthumous pardons to 59,000 men for 'gross indecency' Even without the €13bn tax bill which Ireland was told collect from Apple, the nation's arrangements with Cupertino is driving tax revenue and spending increases in its budget for 2017. The Irish government has this week put forward its budget for the next year, including an extra €1.3bn package of spending increases and tax cuts which arrive as the nation seeks to prepare itself to deal with the plummeting value of the Sterling and other potential Brexit fallouts. Key amongst the budget proposals was an unchanged corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent, which has continued to drive investment in the nation, especially from American technology firms. Earlier this year, the European Commission declared that tax arrangements with Apple were in breach of state aid rules, and demanded that Ireland collect €13bn from the company. The Irish government was quick to appeal against the demands, however, assessing the Commission's ruling as posing a threat to its ability to encourage domestic growth and investment brought in through corporate tax on the firm, who has recently moved all of its IP to subsidiaries located in the country. Indeed, according to the Irish Examiner's Eamon Quinn, this budget and the budget for 2016 could be called the Apple Budgets due to the role that corporate tax receipts have played in funding increases. The 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate managed to bring in €6.87bn in 2015, more than €2bn than what had been anticipated. "That is a staggering bounty," wrote Quinn, who warned that more transparency was needed when budgets were being funded "disproportionately on a single tax source — corporate tax revenues". The increase in spending has been criticised as being beyond what is prudent by the head of Ireland's Fiscal Advisory Council, John McHale, according to the Irish Times, but it was largely welcomed after years of biting austerity measures. The budget watchdog also warned that the plans were set to place Ireland in breach of European Union rules regarding the reduction of its structural deficit, now being reduced by only 0.3 per cent and not the 0.6 per cent the EU demands. McHale added that an additional breach regarding allowable expenditure growth was taking place, but claimed that the breaches were not large enough to bring fines from Brussels. The finance minister, Michael Noonan, explained that “Brexit has increased risk to the Irish economy and, as well as introducing specific measures to assist particular sectors of the economy, we must also put in place safety nets to protect us against future economic shocks.” Noonan responded to McHale's claims by saying the budget was "prudent fiscal policy" and explained his expectations that the country's budget deficit would fall to 0.4 per cent of GDP in 2017, down from the whopping 32 per cent of GDP that had been the case when he took office in 2010. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 25 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

On September 29 Patently Apple posted a report titled "China Reports that Apple Set to Open a New R&D Center in Zhongguancun Science Park Later this Year." In that particular R&D center, Apple intends to hire 500 engineers focused on the development of computer software and hardware products, communication, audio and video devices, as well as advanced technologies for consumer electronics products and the information industry. It's being reported today by the Shenzhen Economic Daily, that Apple's chief executive Tim Cook announced the plan to set up yet another R&D center in China, this time in Shenzhen. Cook made the announcement during a meeting with senior officials from the southern Chinese city where he is attending a nation-wide innovation event.   Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said in emailed comments that "We are excited to be opening a new Research and Development center here next year so our engineering team can work even more closely and collaboratively with our manufacturing partners."   Another Chinese publication stated this morning that "Apple, which counts China as its third-largest global market, is already supporting -- together with its contract manufacturer Foxconn Technology Co -- over 200,000 jobs between advanced manufacturing and an economy built around applications, Apple said in an emailed statement.'   Dr. Neil Wang, greater China president for Frost & Sullivan told the publication that 'The establishment of a new R&D centre in Shenzhen allows Apple to facilitate better communication with iOS developers and come up with better products that cater to local customers."   Kitty Fok, managing director for IDC China, said that an Apple center in Shenzhen would 'make sense,' since much of China's technology talent is centered in the region. The investment in research is also a show of 'commitment' to the Chinese market.'"    According to Wikipedia, Shenzhen has a population of 10,778,900 and a metropolitan area population of over 18 million.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Apple Music vs Spotify vs Tidal and more Max Langridge and Luke Edwards12 October 2016App Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Music streaming is fast becoming the most popular way for us to consume music. Where once we had to import and rip CDs to our computers, or download songs (legally we hope), we now access to the world's music catalogue through our smartphones. There's fierce competition between music streaming services too. Swedish service Spotify was one of the first services to launch and has since emerged to place itself at the top of the streaming hierarchy with around 40 million paying subscribers. That's thanks in no small part to it offering an extensive library of music and an easy-to-use app.  Apple has also now joined the music streaming market after relying on the iTunes download store for many years. With so many people buying iPhones and into Apple's ecosystem, it's a genuine contender for Spotify's crown. With so many different services offering largely the same catalogue of music, they're now having to resort to exclusive content or new and intuitive features to get customers to sign up. Which means the only real problem is picking the service that is right for you, which is where we are here to help. Here are the music streaming services available and what they offer to help you work out which is best for you. Apple Music In a nutshell: Apple Music is a service with access to tens of millions of songs. It has been designed to combine music you have bought with music you've saved from Apple's cloud services in the Apple Music library. The app received a huge update with the introduction of iOS 10 and now has five tabs/features comprising Library, For You, Browse, Radio, and Search. The For You tab serves up a mix of handpicked albums and playlists based on the music you like, while the Browse tab presents the week's newest tracks, videos and playlists that have been selected by Apple Music editors. The Radio tab is where you'll find Beats 1, which is a 24-hour live global station led by DJs such as Zane Lowe, Ebro Darden, and Julie Adenuga, as well as other expertly-created stations created by radio DJs. Library is where you'll find all your music, whether it be songs you've imported from your computer, songs you've bought from iTunes or songs you've added from Apple Music's servers. And finally, Search is where you, well, search for any music you want. Siri has been programmed to work with Apple Music so you can ask her to play the best songs from 1994... and she will do just that. Once you've started playing a song, you can swipe up to reveal the next songs in the playing queue or lyrics to the song that is currently playing (you'll only get these features if you have iOS 10 installed).  If the song you're listening to isn't in your library, you can add it, add it to a playlist, create a station of songs based around the one playing or share it with friends. Price: Apple Music costs £9.99 a month per user. Apple has also made it possible for an entire family of six to have one account subscription for £14.99 a month. You can also get the first three months free via a trial. Those without a membership but an Apple ID will be able to listen to the Beats 1 radio station. Everything else requires an Apple Music membership. Devices: Apple Music is available for iOS, Mac, PC and Android. Conclusion: Apple Music is a single app that combines your music, a streaming service and a worldwide live radio station. Everything lives in one place, so you can stream anything choose or you can let Apple Music choose.  Spotify www.spotify.com In a nutshell: Spotify is the big guy in the music streaming world. It launched in 2008 and now boasts around 125 million users, 40 million of which pay for the service. The rest subscribe to Spotify's free tier, which limits music quality and plays adverts every few songs. The free tier also excludes users from using other features such as being able to use it with Sonos and Spotify Connect. You'll be able to add your purchased music into Spotify using your computer, making it similar to Apple Music in that it offers access to streaming and local files, but you'll have to add local files manually. Apple Music on the other hand, does this process automatically because of the integration with iTunes. You will be able to listen to tracks offline if you pay for the Premium version , meaning you can listen to your favourite playlist on the plane or underground. You can't download songs for offline playback with the free tier. Spotify gives you access to millions and millions of tracks, as well as ready-made playlists and Spotify radio. Like Apple Music, it will learn as you listen and through associations, will make recommendations based on your tastes. There is also a band merchandise store front that will give you easy access to your favourite band's T-shirt, for example. Spotify also offers Facebook integration so you can follow your friends to see what they're listening to. Additionally, Spotify teamed up with Google to offer Chromecast and Chromecast Audio support allowing anyone to turn any speakers into smart connected players and Spotify Connect allows you to play the service through compatible speakers. Apple Music isn't supported by Chromecast at the moment, but both it and Spotify can be integrated into multi-room music systems such as Sonos. Price: Spotify is available for free on mobile, tablet and computer but comes with adverts. Premium subscribers are charged £9.99 a month but this doesn't just enable you to use Spotify anywhere, it is ad-free and offers unlimited skips and the ability to play any track. Students get 50 per cent off Premium with Unidays or NUS Extra and PlayStation Music users get Premium for free for two months. Spotify Family allows one account holder to sign up a further five people to all enjoy separate Spotify Premium login accounts. At £15 per month that works out as £2.50 per person. Devices: Android, BlackBerry, Boxee, iOS, Linux, MeeGo, Microsoft Windows, Openpandora OS X, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Roku, S60 (Symbian), Samsung Smart TV, Sonos, Squeezebox, Telia Digital-tv, TiVo, WD TV, webOS, Windows Mobile, Windows Phones and Withings Aura. Home entertainment systems and even cars can also access Spotify via Spotify Connect and integration with the car's infotainment system respectively. Conclusion: Spotify is the most widely available music streaming platform that offers a huge range of songs at a reasonable price, despite being more expensive than Apple Music. It has a streaming top end of 320kbps, so if you are after something of higher quality, that's where you need to look at services like Qobuz or Tidal Qobuz www.qobuz.com In a nutshell: Qobuz is a French music streaming service that offers high-resolution music streaming to the discerning audiophile. It offers three separate packages based on the quality of music you want to hear. The cheapest is the same 320kbit/s as Spotify, but Qobuz also offers True CD quality at 16 bit/44.1kHz and Studio Masters at 24 bit/192kHz. Qobuz "cherry-picks" what it finds interesting across each musical genre, offering access to over 30 millions tracks, which can be enjoyed through the app or across its various Hi-Fi partners. As we mentioned, there are three packages available. The Premium option is all about MP3 quality tracks. The Hi-Fi option is all about True CD quality at 16 bit/44.1kHz and the Sublime option is where 24-bit Hi-Res Audio tracks come into the mix. With the Hi-Fi package, you'll get the entire catalogue of tracks in True CD quality, while the Sublime package will offer you that, plus 24-bit downloads for MP3 prices, which you will then be able to stream. Price: Qobuz costs £9.99/month for the Premium, £19.99/month for the Hi-Fi tier with True CD quality FLAC files and £220/year for the Sublime subscription. Sublime is only available as a yearly subscription, you can't pay for it on a month-by-month basis. Devices: Qobuz will work on Mac and PC, offering FLAC, Apple Lossless or Windows Media files. Qobuz works with Sonos sound systems offering high-quality audio even in 5.1 surround, although Sonos doesn't support 24-bit as yet, and Samsung has also added functionality for its Wireless Audio Multiroom System. Qobuz is also available in app form for iOS and Android devices.  Conclusion: If quality is of great importance to you, this is a great service for you. It also represents a potential saving over Spotify and Apple Music if you pay annually. Deezer Deezer www.deezer.com In a nutshell: Deezer is another French company and it has 16 million monthly active users, including 6 million paying users. It boasts a whopping 35 million tracks in its library, but there is also Deezer Elite that offers high-quality FLAC streaming. This streaming service has over 20,000 news and entertainment shows too, along with live football commentary for Premier League and FA Cup games thanks to a partnership with talkSport. Like Spotify and Apple Music, Deezer will also recommend tracks to suit your tastes. There is a feature called Flow that knows your library and selects the songs you want to hear. You can tell Flow what you do and don't like and it will react accordingly. The more you listen, the more Flow learns your tastes and therefore the better the recommendations. As you would expect, you can create playlists, as well as import your favourite MP3s, as you can with competing services. It's also possible to sync those playlists and tracks in order to listen offline, but you'll need the Deezer Premium+ account for both the importing and listening offline. This subscription plan also gives you high-quality sound over standard. Price: Deezer offers a free unlimited ad-supported service and Premium+, which is ad-free. There is a free 30-day trial with the latter if you want to try out what it has to offer before you commit, although you can cancel the subscription at any time. Deezer Premium+ costs £9.99 a month for unlimited, ad-free listening and offline playback. Deeper also offers an Elite service that gives access to 16-bit/44.1kHz CD-quality audio tracks costs: £14.99 per month for 12 months, £9.99 per month for 1 year (£120 paid upfront), £9.99 per month for 2 years (£240 paid upfront). The only catch with the Elite service is that it is available exclusively through a Sonos Multi-Room music system.  Devices: Deezer works on PC and Mac but can also be found in app form for iOS, Android, BlackBerry and Logitech and Sonos home entertainment systems. It also works on many smart TVs like LG and Samsung, Xbox 360 and even BMW cars and Parrot systems. Conclusion: Deezer offers a huge catalogue of tracks for the same price as Spotify and Apple Music. It is also available on a wide range of devices and there are some good offers for Sonos users which could make this a very appealing service for some.  Napster www.napster.com In a nutshell: Napster is the original peer-to-peer music sharing client that started all the furore about digital rights. It's had a rough ride, being shut down and restarted, but it's back with over 40 millions songs, available in 16 European countries, including the UK. There are curated playlists and this streaming service also offers interviews with artists and a feature called TrackMatch that will allow you to match a track that you are listening to, a bit like Shazam but within the Napster app. There are two plans available, Napster Unlimited and Napster Unlimited + Mobile. The former will only let you listen via a PC or Mac, and you can't download songs for offline playback. The Unlimited + Mobile tier will let you listen to music on your smartphone or tablet and let you download songs to listen to when you don't have signal. The Mobile tier can also be integrated to home entertainment systems. There are also a range of radio stations and Napster also offers a 'New & Good' playlist for new releases so you'll be able to find them easily. Another good feature is the ability to import your previously built playlists into Napster for those that are looking to switch streaming services. Like Spotify and other, Napster offers a bit rate that tops out at 320kbit/s. Price: Napster can be trialled for a free 30 days like many of its competitors. After that point you can opt for the online only Napster Unlimited for £5 a month or the app-compatible Napster Unlimited plus Mobile for £9.99 a month. Devices: The online only version works on Mac and PC. The app is available on up to three phones, your home entertainment system and your computer. The app works on iOS, Android and Windows Phone. Conclusion: Despite being the first of its kind to make it big, Napster offers more or less the same as everyone else at this stage. It's well spread across Europe but has no killer function that makes it special over Spotify, other than the transfer of playlists from other services. Google Play Music  www.googleplaymusic.com In a nutshell: Google Play Music All Access has 35 million songs in its library, but also allows you to add up to 50,000 of your own locally stored tracks, to stream to your device and download it for offline playback with the Unlimited tier. It's able to curate radio stations from artists of your choosing if you pay for the Unlimited package, but you'll get recommendations based on your tastes within the free subscription. The option for offline listening also comes with the Unlimited option, which also applies to radio stations. At the moment there is no option to expand your personal collection above the 50,000 mark but Google+ is built in so you can share your music choices with others and see what your friends are listening to for recommendations. Price: As usual you get a 30-day free trial. After that point you can continue to use the online locker for your 50,000 tracks for free. For the full streaming of 35 million other songs and the other features, you'll need to pay £9.99 a month. Devices: Android devices are obviously supported, as well as computers, but it's also on iOS - making it a real threat to Spotify. Conclusion: This sounds like one of the best services out there. It's affordable, it has a large library, allows sharing, radio and smart suggestions, plus you can keep your own music library backed up and easily accessible. Groove Music www.music.microsoft.com In a nutshell: Xbox Music has been rebranded as Groove Music, a service that allows you to stream and download new tracks and familiar favorites from a selection of over 40 million songs across a range of devices. Groove will enable you to play and manage your music, as well as add MP3's and iTunes tracks to OneDrive so you can listen to them on all your devices through the Groove app. If you opt for Groove Music Pass subscription, you'll be able to listen to artist-based radio, curated playlists and there is support for offline listening. This service also offers an ad-supported version for those who don't want to pay for the full subscription however, but like the others, you won't get the full rack of features. Groove Music is available on Windows PC, Windows Phone, iPhone, Android, Xbox, a Web Player for Mac and Sonos. Price: You can stream everything for free on your Windows 10 devices or any browser window from Mac and older PCs. The full version is free for 30 days and then it will cost you £9.99 for a one month pass. Devices: Groove Music is available on Windows PC, Windows Phone, iPhone, Android, Xbox, a Web Player for Mac and Sonos. Conclusion: Groove Music offers a huge library of songs, and is available on most platforms. It streams at 256kbit/s and can offer offline playback as well as a free, ad-supported version. Groove Music is attractive music service that, when paid for annually, is cheaper than the competition.  Tidal www.tidal.com In a nutshell: Tidal describes itself as a streaming service that offers "high-fidelity CD sound quality, high quality video, expertly curated content and editorial, and unique artists experiences." The company was recently bought by Jay-Z's company and it offers 35 million songs and 85,000 videos at your fingertips. There are two subscription options comprising Tidal Premium and Tidal HiFi. Tidal Premium offers standard sound quality, high definition music videos and curated editorial. Tidal HiFi is where this service differs slightly from some of the other competitors offering the same as the Premium option but with lossless high fidelity sound quality instead. Offline listening is available for both subscription plans. Price: Both subscription services offer a free 30-day trial. The Premium service will then cost £9.99 a month or £8.49 a month if you pay six months upfront. The HiFi plan is £19.99 a month or £16.99 a month if you pay six months upfront. There is also a family plan available that gives other members of the family (up to four attached to a main account) their own logins for 50 per cent of the normal fee so you and four people would cost £29.95 on a Premium subscription and £59.95 on the HiFi option. Devices: Along with PC and Mac, Tidal also works on iOS and Android devices. It is also compatible with Sonos, Bluesound, Linn, Auralic, Mirage, Squeezebox, Amarra, Wadia, Electrocompaniet, Meridian and Lode. Conclusion: With the backing of Jay-Z and a library that should continue to grow, this is a great service for those that want the extra sound quality.  MixCloud MixCloud www.mixcloud.com In a nutshell: MixCloud is an online radio platform that combines DJ mixes, podcasts and radio shows. MixCloud was funded by its founders and is still owned by them as it grows. Anyone registered can upload their mix which will get shared and rated, presuming it's good enough to be enjoyed. The app allows you to listen to MixCloud anywhere and you can listen and upload as much as you like. It claims to offer the largest collection of radio shows, podcasts and DJ mixes. Users can search by music genre to discover music shows, as well as by topic for discovering talk shows. Price: Free to use as it's an online platform. Devices: Web browser access allows for instant playback for anyone. The iOS and Android app is also free to download. Conclusion: As a way of listening to music and mixes that have been crowd-sourced by other users, this is a great platform and community. Since it's free all the music must be accredited in order to maintain intellectual property rights - this likely limits some artists who don't play nice with shared free music. Amazon Amazon Music Unlimited www.amazon.com In a nutshell: Amazon Music Unlimited is Amazon's own fully-fledged music streaming service. It's only just launched in the US in October 2016 and has promised to make its way across the pond to the UK. It may be late to the party, but Amazon's service has a few tricks up its sleeve to entice customers. The service has access to "tens of millions" of songs from the major labels which can be accessed via the Amazon Music app, available for a range of devices. Music Unlimited has just one tier, but different pricing options depending on whether you're a Prime subscriber or if you want to use it solely through one of the company's Echo devices.  Price: If you're not a Prime subscriber, Music Unlimited will set you back $9.99 a month, however if you do subscribe to Amazon's Prime service this reduces to $7.99/month or $79/year making it slightly cheaper per month. But if you want to just use it through the Echo devices it will cost $3.99/month. Amazon has said there'll be a Family Plan soon, which will cost $14.99/month or $149/year. Devices: The Amazon Music App is available on Android, iOS, Mac, PC, Web Player, Echo, Amazon's Fire devices and select home entertainment systems and cars. Conclusion: Amazon Music Unlimited has some ground to make up on its competitors, but with a number of pricing options that undercut them, it could certainly be a force to be reckoned with.

Vestager The European Commission does not have an issue with Ireland's 12.5% corporate tax but wants to ensure that tax rulings are not used to give selective advantage to companies "through the backdoor", competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has said.12 Oct 2016 Corporate tax EU & Competition Tax State aid Tax Disputes and Investigations UK Europe Germany France Speaking to Irish Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee members in a hearing on competition policy, Vestager discussed the Commission's recent decision that Apple should pay €13 billion plus interest in unpaid taxes to Ireland, the European Parliament said in a statement. The Commission said in August that Ireland must recover the tax, in the largest proposed recovery order seen by the EU. Vestager acknowledged that it is inconvenient to have to ask someone to give something back, but "this is something you have to live with", she said. The European Commission does not have direct authority over national direct tax systems. However, under EU rules it is unlawful for any EU country to give financial help to selected companies in a way which would distort fair competition. If an APA contravenes market principles so as to confer a selective advantage, it could be considered to be state aid. The Commission said that the APAs allowed Apple to establish the taxable profits for two Irish incorporated companies of the Apple group, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe in a way "that did not correspond to economic reality".

Back in August, reports began appearing from iPhone 6 owners describing an apparently latent manufacturing issue that causes a flickering bar to appear at the top of the screen and the display to become unresponsive or less responsive to touch. A week later, three iPhone 6 owners filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court of Northern California after their devices presented symptoms of the problem – dubbed "touch disease" by repair website iFixit – which Apple has yet to publicly acknowledge. Yesterday, Motherboard reported that lawyers who filed the class action complaint earlier this fall have now signed on three additional law firms to support their case, while an additional class action lawsuit related to the issue has been filed against Apple in Utah. Richard McCune, an attorney in the California case, said he has been contacted by 10,000 people asking to join the suit, which accuses Apple of violating the state's consumer fraud statutes, negligent misrepresentation, breach of implied warranty, unjust enrichment, and other consumer act violations. The "touch disease" flaw is thought to be caused by the touchscreen controller chips soldered to the iPhone's logic board losing contact after a period of normal usage, because of Apple's failure to incorporate a metal shield. So far, Apple has refused to repair the out-of-warranty iPhones without charge when the defect manifests. Worse, replacement refurbished handsets costing owners $329 have reportedly shown symptoms of the same problem within days or weeks of being issued. Motherboard claims five separate current and former Apple Geniuses have confirmed that Apple is aware of the problem but will not tell customers about it. However, Apple's filed response to the most recent Utah complaint appears at least to signal a legal acknowledgement of the issue and the company's lawyers have requested an "extension of time to respond to the Complaint" and asked that the Utah and California cases be combined into one.Given the similarity between the [Utah] and [California] actions, it would unnecessarily tax judicial resources if these actions were to proceed in separate class action lawsuits—especially where the [Utah] and [California] Plaintiffs purport to represent the same putative class of all consumers who purchased an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. On Friday, McCune filed an updated lawsuit against Apple that includes several new plaintiffs and formally adds the three separate law firms to the legal battle. "Each of the firms (who had their own clients) brings strength to the case, including Stephen Larson of Larson O'Brien, who is a former Federal Judge," McCune told Motherboard. "With these firms working with us, we believe it gives us the best chance of obtaining a positive result in the case for the owners of the phones."Related Roundup: iPhone 6s Tag: lawsuit Buyer's Guide: iPhone (Buy Now) Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit News - on October 17, 2016< > Embed Sandy Hook Lawsuit Dismissed 00:38 A judge has dismissed the class action lawsuit filed by the families of victims killed in the Sandy Hook mass shooting against the manufacturer of the gun used to murder their children.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung's Heir Apparent was hoping for the Galaxy Note 7 to outflank the iPhone 7 | Main | Apple Announces Second R&D Center Coming to China in the last two Weeks, this Time in Shenzhen » October 12, 2016 The Supreme Court to create new Design Patent Rules for the Lower Court, not Rule on the Case (Transcript Available)   Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report titled "U.S. Supreme Court Hears Arguments from Apple and Samsung, Hints that Design can drive a Sale of a Phone," which provided a broad overview of the main arguments. For those wishing to review the full arguments before the court in this case could review the transcript provided to you at the end of this report.   The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported this morning that "The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared frustrated over how to resolve a high-stakes battle between Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., indicating it may not provide final resolution of how much money the South Korean electronics company owes for infringing patents on the iPhone's design.   The high court took the case to decide whether a company can be required to pay all of its profits on products that infringe someone else's patented design, or whether infringement damages should be limited only to the portion of profits specifically attributable to the design of a device.   As the morning session unfolded, justices across the bench suggested that neither Apple nor Samsung had argued for an approach that would better help jurors decide the appropriate compensation to patent holders when someone copies their distinct designs.   'It seems to me neither side gives us an instruction to work with,' Justice Anthony Kennedy said. 'If I were a juror, I wouldn't know what to do.'   Apple and Samsung didn't appear to disagree deeply on the type of legal rules that should govern damages for design patents. Instead, their clash was mostly about how those rules should apply to the specific facts of their smartphone litigation.   The justices made clear they were less concerned with that issue, suggesting they will come up with new rules and then give lower court judges the first opportunity to apply them to the iPhone fight."   The Obama administration participated in Tuesday's argument. Justice Department lawyer Brian Fletcher said a monetary damages rule that automatically awarded total profits for an entire product had the potential to overcompensate patent holders in some circumstances. Mr. Fletcher said both Samsung and Apple seemed to agree on this basic point."   In this case, Apple's next-gen smartphone design was absolutely dramatic and new by eliminating physical phone pad and function keys that made a phone look like a mobile calculator. Apple's dramatic design was a visual winner in the eyes of consumers worldwide. A simple clean slate with an all-GUI approach to a smartphone created a new approach to functions through apps and a multitouch display. Samsung's phone was a clunky design jammed packed with ugly physical buttons. Racing to copy Apple's design is what this is really about. Their smartphone design was a loser and they decided to steal Apple's design. The design isn't just about dumbing the argument down to round corners, though for this case it plays a central argument. Apple's design and approach to the smartphone struck a chord with consumers and the rest is history.   From what was argued yesterday, it doesn't look like the Supreme Court will actually rule on the specifics of this case but rather hand down to the lower court new rules and guidelines that they could use to instruct the jury with for final decision. As Apple argued, the jury has already sided with Apple. For more on this, read the full WSJ report here.   Patently Apple. Transcript Samsung v.

The latest proof? Apple is opening a new research and development center in the city, the company's second in China following a $45 million hub being built in Beijing. Apple CEO Tim Cook even made a surprise visit to Shenzhen on Tuesday to celebrate the news. According to comments reported by local paper Economic Daily and translated by Quartz, Cook praised Shenzhen as a manufacturing powerhouse. "We realized the skill level of Shenzhen’s factories was gradually leading other places in the world," said Cook of his early visits to the city. According to statement from Apple spokesperson Josh Rosenstock, the Shenzhen base will allow the company's engineers to work "even more closely and collaboratively" with manufacturing partners. "The Shenzhen center, along with the Beijing center, is also aimed at strengthening relationships with local partners and universities as we work to support talent development across the country," said Rosenstock in comments reported by Reuters. Apple's desire to further integrate its business with Chinese companies comes as iPhone sales slowed in the country. Apple's revenue from the Greater China region (which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong) fell 33 percent in the last quarter compared to 2015, the worst decline of any of Apple's major operating markets. This slowdown is due to decreased interest in the iPhone, with local companies like Huawei and ZTE continuing to challenge Apple's flagship product. Luckily, both Huawei and ZTE are headquartered in Shenzhen, along with Chinese internet giant Tencent and dronemaker DJI. That means Apple won't have to look too far to find its competition, or, no doubt, local talent to recruit.

October 12 AAPL: 117.34 1.04 Amazon launches its own $9.99/month music streaming service to compete with Apple Music, with discounts for Prime/Echo users Benjamin Mayo - 1 month ago @bzamayo Apple Music View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Amazon has launched its own music streaming service today called Amazon Music Unlimited for $9.99/month, adding another worthy competitor to Apple Music and Spotify. The service offers access to tens of millions of songs from major labels like Sony, Universal and Warner. Music Unlimited features a 30 day free trial so you can give it a go without committing any money for the first month. On iOS, users access their streaming libraries through the Amazon Music app. Amazon is incentivizing signups with some discounts for loyal Amazon users. If you subscribe to Amazon Prime, then Music Unlimited is cheaper: just $7.99 per month. If you use Amazon Echo smart speakers in your home, you can also sign up to a dramatically cheaper $3.99 monthly plan, but this option limits music streaming to only Echo devices. Amazon had previously launched a music service as part of Amazon Prime, which bundled about a million songs as a perk of subscribing to Prime. The new Music Unlimited offering is a completely separate service with a full content library from labels and indies, albeit requiring an additional monthly subscription. Prime members only have to pay $7.99 a month for Music Unlimited, however. Music Unlimited includes download options to listen offline so you can still listen to a subset of your library whilst offline. A family plan has also been announced for Amazon’s service, mirroring Apple Music’s family plan deal supporting up to six people for $14.99 per month. Amazon’s family plan option is “coming soon” and will launch in a few months. The problem for Amazon is that it will be difficult to attract members as the service is pretty samey, aside from the loyalty discounts. There’s not really a reason for people who already subscribe for $9.99 on Spotify or Apple Music to jump ship. Spotify and Apple Music currently report 40 million and 17 million paid subscribers, respectively. Perhaps, customers invested heavily into the Amazon ecosystem will want to take advantage of Music Unlimited’s integration with Alexa. iPhone and iPad users will always get better integration into the system when using Apple’s service, of course. Amazon Music Unlimited is available today in the United States with availability in the UK and Germany coming later in 2016. The Echo option is the main differentiator here to what is already available and may attract a dedicated market of people who just want to stream music around their own home and are already bought into the Amazon Echo ecosystem of speakers. Apple Music has relied heavily on exclusivity arrangements with artists to attract members. It is unclear if Amazon intends to work closely with artists in the same way. Universal, a major music label, has pushed back against these practices saying it will no longer sign exclusivity deals for any music service.

Culture Film Features Oliver Stone, Snowden interview: ‘Entertainment comes first but you don’t sacrifice the truth for that’ Director Oliver Stone talks to Kaleem Aftab about meeting ‘boy scout’ Edward Snowden for the first time, how he kept his script from leaking and the need to balance facts with drama Kaleem Aftab @aftabamon Wednesday 12 October 2016 10:42 BST The Oscar-winning film director says he struggled to find a studio that would put its name behind the film Getty Oliver Stone says that making Snowden was harder than putting together his films on American presidents, Nixon, W. and JFK. He says it’s because studios are being controlled by corporations who baulked at the prospect of making a film on the fugitive American whistleblower currently in exile in Russia. “There was as much drama in the making of the film, as on screen,” claims the director who recently turned 70. Speaking at the Zurich Film Festival, he complains that studios would have meetings with him and declare their interest before it all turned sour. “But they don’t tell you that they are going to send it upstairs for approval, because they are embarrassed by the upstairs corporate lawyers, who say this is too much, we don’t want anything to do with it because we have a merger going on with this other company and the US government and Department of Justice have to look at it.” He names BMW and Apple as companies that tried to prevent Snowden from being made. “Our German producer does all of his films with deals with BMW but they say no, because their satellite BMW say it’s too risky.” Read more Snowden film labelled 'preposterous' by former NSA deputy director Edward Snowden slams congressional report that calls him 'serial exaggerator and fabricator' Edward Snowden calls Theresa May 'Darth Vader in the UK' As for Apple he believes problems may have arisen because, “Apple was named as one of the collaborators on the PRISM program.” PRISM is one of the clandestine surveillance programs that Snowden revealed was set up by the American government to spy on American Internet search providers.” Stone is also worried by the influence that the American government has on the movie business. “The government are influencing films too,” he explains. “There is a study that the CIA and the Pentagon have played a large role in filmmaking since the 1990s. They have collaborated on TV shows and it’s not just giving money, they are giving advice and that’s even better than sponsorship.” Of course, Stone, who has famously been tarnished with the brush of being a conspiracy theorist, is given no such advice. He is a director who looks to real life events, whether it be his own experiences as a US infantryman in Vietnam to use in his 1986 Best Oscar winning picture Platoon, or the life of Jim Morrison for the biopic The Doors and the events in New York on September 11th 2001 for World Trade Center. More often then not, he’s been cited as a left-wing sympathiser. Although he smirks when he says, “It was the left who were criticising me when I made W as they said that I made Bush too sympathetic.” Stone found the real life Edward Snowden to be like a ‘boy scout’ when he met him (EPA) There is the need to balance facts with drama. It’s a see-saw that Stone sits on both sides of, as he struggles to get equilibrium, but when he has to decide, “Entertainment comes first, but you don’t sacrifice the truth for that. The truth is important and it’s always my goal to find out more. I would not pervert the truth knowingly.” He talks about how Snowden had numerous supervisors in the 9-year period that the film covers, but they were condensed into one character for Snowden.  His first impression of the whistleblower, who he met in a private Dacha in Russia in 2014, is that “frankly by most standards he is a boy scout. He is pretty straight and narrow. He’s had one woman in his life for nine years. There is no drinking and there is no drugs or smoking. There are no vices apart from sitting behind a computer or you could call it emotional stunting. He is withdrawn and shy as a lot of people in that world are. He is pleasant and polite. He has a southern background but there is a difficulty in emotional expression, a difficulty in expressing himself. He has epilepsy and in the movie and you can argue that that epilepsy is the signal of his inner stress. Some have accused me of making him a white knight but they don’t know the real man.” Originally, he says he had no intention of making a film about Snowden: “You don’t chase the news as a moviemaker, are you crazy! It takes two years to make a movie. I met him and I was very impressed. He was wary.”  In the end Snowden began telling him about his life, and helped with descriptions of what the computer programs the government were using looked like, as well as offices in Hawaii.  Hearing about the levels of surveillance, Stone took a number of precautions to stop the script from leaking or getting into the wrong hands. He wrote the script on a single computer that was never plugged into the Internet. When they wanted to share the script, they would print off one copy, mix up the pages on the floor, and then make four piles and send them to different addresses. Someone would pick them up from these addresses, collate them and hand-deliver the script.  Playing Snowden is Joseph Gordon-Levitt: “I was not chasing movie stars on this one,” says Stone. “I went to Joseph right away. I don’t know him but I thought that he had that physical and emotional resemblance, the kind of restraint.” Stone was immediately drawn to the idea of Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Snowden in his film  Shailene Woodley, who won the role by writing the director a letter, plays Snowden’s girlfriend Lindsay Mills. Clearly not a fan of Divergent or The Fault in Our Stars, Stone says, “I didn’t know who she was either. She’s an activist of sorts.” So, given his concerns about government surveillance, I ask the director if he fears that he is being watched? “I try to keep tabs and use the information act to make requests, and I have paid the lawyers to act, but I have not found anything of consequence yet or else they are lying. It could be that, but I don’t think they are. It will be kind of hard to go after a filmmaker, a director who is relatively harmless in their world and it would cause tremendously embarrassing publicity for them to be tracking entertainers. It’s like they are tracking Banksy or something.” Snowden plays at the London Film Festival as a Headline Gala on 15 and 16 October More about: Oliver Stone Snowden Edward Snowden Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.
