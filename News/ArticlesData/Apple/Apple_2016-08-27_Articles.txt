Let’s See Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: August 29, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Some interesting rumors have been floating around regarding the upcoming Apple iPhone 7, most notably that the device is going to omit the standard 3.5mm headphone jack. Users were understandably upset at the idea, but we’ve also been hearing some critical voices that hold much more weight in the industry and Apple themselves, such as that of Steve Wozniak. The cofounder of the tech giant claims that it wouldn’t be a good idea for Apple to get rid of the classic headphone jack, and predicts that users would not be pleased with the device if that turns out to be true. He added that this would also affect his personal opinion of the new iPhone, but that should be the least of Apple’s concerns if they really do manage to alienate a large portion of their fan base as Wozniak predicts. It doesn’t take Steve Wozniak’s experience to see that this would be a bad move with regards to publicity though as there are already plenty of heated discussions all over the Internet on this topic. It’s hard to find anyone who agrees with the move, and most see it as an obvious cash grab by Apple when they inevitably introduce an expensive propriety headset that users would have to buy. And according to many, that’s all this move is about – control of the market. Headphones are, so far, one of the few accessories that cannot be controlled, as users are free to use anything that plugs into a 3.5mm socket. Apple are known for enjoying a more controlled approach to their products, so if they see this as an opportunity to ensure that their users are required to buy their headphones, they would likely do that. Of course, they could present other reasons for it, such as better waterproofing capabilities, but in the end not many users would trust them on that. Meanwhile, there are some other worrying rumors about the new phone. Some reports indicate that there could potentially be a shortage of units once it comes out, as Apple could be experiencing issues with their supply chain behind the scenes. While the company has had some minor problems in this aspect before, it was never bad enough to force them into a supply shortage, so this could be something new. Of course, those could also be malicious marketing rumors meant to drive up public interest in the device. After all, if many people are convinced that it would be almost impossible to get their hands on the latest iPhone when it comes out, there would likely be a huge rush of purchases and pre-orders as soon as the device is made available. Hopefully Apple won’t resort to such underhanded tactics – they generally aren’t the kind of company to do that – but we never know what could happen next in the dynamic world of smartphones. We’ve already been hearing various reports claiming that the iPhone 7 has been spotted in the wild, so at least from this perspective it doesn’t really seem like there is any actual shortage of units so far. If that was the case, Apple probably wouldn’t be investing that much in pre-release promotions like giving out devices to people for daily use. But of course, the alleged iPhone 7 handsets popping up in the wild might be just a fabrication itself, so fans should take it with a grain of salt.

News Tech Don’t Buy iPhone 5s: Here Are Top Reasons Not to Buy iPhone 5s Right Now By Jack Gary - October 3, 2016 89 0 SHARE tweet Apple iPhone 5s, is one of the most cutest phone I have ever seen. It comes with a 4 inch screen with mesmerizing edges. I swear, it is one of the most attractive device from the technology giant Apple.  The price of the device has been abruptly reduced to the half of its release price, after the release of iPhone 6s and followed by the release of iPhone SE. As a result, people all round the globe are looking for iPhone 5s and also in a dilemma, whether to buy iPhone 5s or not. The decision will not be a great one, if they opt to buy iPhone 5s right now. Here, I shared top 8 reasons, why one should avoid buying the device. Longevity of the device’s Hardware is the main things, which should be considered before buying a device. A few months back, Apple has disclosed officially that the company will not be responsible for the hardware defects in new iPhone 5s. Since the hardware components of an average iPhone will last for 3 years, the support for iPhone 5s will be withdrawn soon. Buying a device, which old approx three years will not be a wise decision. I suggest that spending $300 on an older specification mobile will not be a wise option. The iPhone 5s is not at all considered as a flagship model and three models has been hitting the market from Apple, after the release of iPhone 5s. The device can be bought even for free, by choosing two years of contract with mobile carriers. Not only the above mentioned points, the device has been even removed from Apple’s official website and hereby, the support for the device will be also revoked soon by the company. The next point to be considered is its 4 inch display. Living the era of larger smartphone and opting for a tiny new 4 inch screen with older specification will make us to appear awkward in the real world. The device bundled with Apple’s A7 Processor, which is considered as very older processor in the current generation of processors. It is highly anticipated that Apple will unveil its A10 processor with iPhone 7. Buying an A7 processor with 1 GB of RAM is not at all a recommended one. The front facing camera of the device has been just 1.2 MP, iPhone 6s come with 5 MP of front camera. If you’re a selfie type of person, do not ever think about iPhone 5s. Last but not the least, the device powered by 1560 mAh battery, which is not a better one, when compared with other smartphone in the current market.

Technology Apple is going to release – iPhone 7 on September 9th after so many design flaws in Last Smartphone series By Adriana Contreras - August 28, 2016 65 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter IPhone 7 and 7 Plus in on the way and will be in town on September and every tech lover is waiting for it (both who loves Apple and who hates Apple). Much information related to release date, pre-order and retail sales have been spread over the internet and even some famous people, such as the famous tipster Evan Blass has confirmed the sale date on September 16th. Just to clarify, this refers to the retail release, not the launch event. To be even more specific, it should happen on Friday, Sept. 16th. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) July 23, 2016 People may pre-orders the new handsets on September 9th, and if you aim to pre-order the new larger capacity iPhone or fall in love with the rumored electric blue version, I would suggest you grabbing it as fast as you can and I wish you luck, as the stocks are usually out at launch. The date when Tim Cook’s on stage and introduces the new iPhones is expected to be September 7th. Contents Pop star spotted with iPhone 7 Annoying touchscreen error on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus Pop star spotted with iPhone 7 It was Jimmy Lin, again, the Taiwanese pop star who has never missed a chance to show off himself with his new iPhone – before the release date (Well, he forgot the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, but as they are too similar to the iPhone 6, so maybe, he was not interested). I always wonder how he can keep the habit of publishing the secret of Apple on Twitter every year without being stopped once. Taiwanese celebrity Jimmy Lin spotted w/ an #iPhone7Plus but is #iPhone7 going to be boring? https://t.co/vBxHxNu5nY pic.twitter.com/c00WGLsIKC — Michael Sherlock (@therevivedone) August 23, 2016 This time, a picture of Lin was captured inside a café with his new phone, matching exactly with the rumored iPhone 7, which has been leaked over the internet for months. In his hand was the iPhone 6 with new instantly recognizable dual camera system, which might be whether a terrible Apple’s design or a most welcome upgrade. Annoying touchscreen error on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus Everyone who loves technology once heard the name of iFixit, the team of professional engineers who enjoys carefully break latest tech devices into parts then try to repair it and rate how much difficult to fix one. They have studied and commented on the recent annoying errors of iPhone 6 and 6 plus, in which people find that their touch screen not working or a mysterious gray bar appears at the top of their display. “The error is not in the touchscreen, but in two of the touchscreen controller chips on the logic board of the smartphones”. The team claims that these were flaws in the hardware design of Apple. Apple has moved these controller chips to a new location, which leads to the problem that they are easy to be leveraged from the logic board. The Apple warranty team has not been trained to deal with this advanced problem; therefore, even if they try to replace the touch screen, the errors will obviously appear again.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone SE is not selling well in the massive smartphone market that is India. STORY Chris Neiger's story for the Motley Fool tipped us off to this new data. Here's what's happening. First, while smartphone sales growth is slowing in many of the mature markets like the United States and China, it is booming gin India. Here is a chart of the forecasts for Indian smartphone growth: That's 204 million smartphone users in India in 2016. By 2017, India will be larger than the United States. Apple Inc., however, has a tiny footprint in the market due to a bevy of reasons from high prices to very low local brand awareness. All of that seemed to change for the better after a deal was struck between the iPhone maker and India's government which allowed Apple to side-step the 30% local sourcing rules by way of a new rule for "cutting-edge technology." It was all very neatly orchestrated, how Apple Inc. and India danced together to get the iPhone maker into the country and it has worked out well for India. Apple will be building a R&D center there and opening Apple stores. This was all great news for both parties. But, IDC has released data that is not really what Apple Inc. had in mind. "Apple's iPhone SE failed to make any significant impact in the premium segment while its previous generation iPhone 5S continued to contribute majority volume." Source: Jaipal Singh , Market Analyst, Client Devices, IDC India The iPhone SE is Apple's newest iPhone that went back to the smaller screen but with vastly upgraded technology inside the phone. The iPhone SE sold very well last quarter and was in fact the primary driver for Apple's numbers coming in above consensus estimates. But the aspirations for the iPhone SE go much further. The average middle class shopper in India doesn't have the same level of wealth as a consumer from the United States or China. Apple's phones are extremely expensive in India, where the average phone sells for about $150 per IDC. While the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S are far more expensive, the iPhone SE cuts the price by about $150. Still, even at the lower price point for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), it comes in at about $580 for the Indian consumer. Still very, very expensive. Without strong brand recognition in India, consumers simply are unwilling to pay up for the iPhone SE, but rather have chosen to go with the iPhone 5Sm which is the same size but less expensive and with less powerful hardware. IS APPLE FAILING IN INDIA? A gut reaction to this data could be the disastrous kind -- that Apple is failing in India. Apple is not failing in India. Apple's market share in tier-I Indian cities jumped to 5.8% in calendar Q4 of 2015, up from 1%. but, the iPhone SE is a serious concern and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has to do something. Apple Inc. will be opening up its first Apple stores in India soon, and those stores have a gem for Apple everywhere else in the world. That's a start. The elephant in the room, of course, is Apple's average selling price. The company has held tight to its margins on the iPhone, almost like a battle cry. But, as Chris Neiger shrewdly points out, perhaps it's time for Apple to change its mode of operation -- at least for India. We believe the Apple brand will see an upswing in recognition when the Apple inc. stores open and do believe the iPhone SE will be a success at some level in India. The phrase "failed to make any significant impact" will not be the end game -- it's the starting point and it was expected. We also add that the $25 million technology center Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) opened in May of this year, which will create 4,000 jobs, will have a direct impact on the company's brand recognition and that means, the iPhone's recognition. The author is long shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). WHY THIS MATTERS There's so much going on with Apple, that it's nearly impossible to keep up with.

According to Bloomberg, Apple may not build cellular networking into the upcoming wearable. While there are some questions on the veracity of the story, there is an argument that the Apple Watch 2 would not benefit from cellular connectivity anyway. Apple Watch 2 unlikely to get cellular connectivity, and that’s ok While it may seem like a great idea to have your Apple Watch connected even away from your iPhone, there are plenty of reasons why the feature is, at least for now, unnecessary. The first is a practical concern. The fact is that cellular radio takes up space and power, which are two things that the Apple Watch is already short of. As it stands the Apple Watch is an amazing feat of engineering, cramming in a huge number of features into a tiny package that you don’t mind wearing on your wrist. There isn’t the tiniest amount of space wasted in the current Apple Watch, but the company has form for pushing to get its technology to be thinner and lighter. Power consumption a concern Even though that thinner and lighter is a huge priority for Apple, it must still be argued that the addition of cellular radio would mean making sacrifices elsewhere. The battery is the largest thing in the Apple Watch, but you need it to power the components and potentially a newly added cellular radio. Apple has revealed that watchOS 1 managed power very conservatively in order to boost battery life. The company says that watchOS 3 will sacrifice some power management in order to bring better performance. However it’s worth noting how much power a cellular radio uses. You need only consider how much longer your iPhone lasts on Airplane mode to get an idea. There is a chance that Apple could somehow only activate cellular radio when you aren’t tethered to your iPhone or any WiFi networks. However the thought of operating with an Apple Watch by itself is not very attractive as things stand. Practical concerns for use of standalone Apple Watch The very design of the device means that most people would still want to have their iPhone handy. Reading short text messages might be OK, but trying to read long work emails is a chore because of the small screen size. If you really wanted to you could scroll endlessly to read the message, but replying is also quite trying. Dictation may work OK, but it’s difficult to edit. Likewise the option of scribbling messages one letter at a time on the screen isn’t very practical. Displays and input methods will have to come along leaps and bounds before the Apple Watch can operate as your only computer. The introduction of cellular networking will make no difference in that regard. Tweaks and improvements necessary in multiple areas While it seems likely that the Apple Watch will get cellular connectivity at some point in the future, it looks unlikely to be included on the Apple Watch 2. There are plenty of other things that Apple needs to worry about rather than adding cellular connectivity. There are plenty of other rumors surrounding the Apple Watch, and the most consistent hardware rumor is the addition of GPS. This could be likely given the many fitness applications of the wearable, and GPS would let you go running without your phone while still plotting your route. One potential issue is that the majority of Apple’s GPS-enabled devices use Assisted GPS, which uses cell tower information to assist with location tracking. GPS sometimes takes half a minute to find your location, which is why you see the big dot when you open Maps. It’s also worth noting that GPS uses a lot of power as well, so whether this would be a wise move remains to be seen. While consumers may be hungry for more features, it looks like Apple is also aiming to provide a better user experience, better performance, longer battery life and maybe a thinner design from the Apple Watch 2. Another possible improvement could be better waterproofing. It seems likely that the second generation Apple Watch will be about making improvements to the first, rather than making any massive changes to its features. Both the iPad 2 and iPhone 3S provide a clue as to how Apple works. Why add cellular networking when there are improvements to be made across the board? It seems like a distraction at this stage.

(AAPL)’s Apple Watch 2 Has Experts Scratching Their Heads August 28, 2016 By Mvusi Ngubane Leave a Comment Filed Under: Consumer Discretionary, News, Technology The next generation of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s popular wrist piece, the Apple Watch, is expected to launch sometime this fall. This is according to a number of news sources and comments from those close to the tech company’s supply chain. The Apple Watch 2 is rumored to be making its debut as soon as mid-September, with some experts predicting it to be unveiled alongside the iPhone 7. Sources suggest the new device will boast a new appearance, be less dependent on the iPhone, and crammed with a number of new, distinct and useful features.   To see a list of high yielding CDs go here.   Apple Watch S Sources haven’t settled on what the new wrist piece will be called yet. While earlier reports refer to that gadget as the Apple Watch 2, more recent news suggests that the next edition Apple Watch could be an S upgrade. The rumor is backed by experts like Neil Cybart, who is a trusted reporter of the consumer tech entity’s ventures. Cybart is adamant that, instead of jumping to whole new product, “Apple is systematically going through the Apple Watch business to fix friction points that developed over the first year. All of this is being done to position the device for improved adoption and a valuation much greater than $10 billion.”   To see a list of high yielding CDs go here.   Cellular capabilities? Macrumors.com claims the next edition Watch will come equipped with cellular capabilities. Its use should allow the device to handle video calls, according to the site. This particular piece of talk is getting less coverage, however, as authority site like Bloomberg report that Apple is having a difficult time eliminating the feature’s drawbacks. For most devices, the display is the most demanding of battery life. It is followed closely by cellular capabilities and camera usage. Allowing the Apple Watch 2 to make calls might significantly kill the timepiece’s battery life. Video calls at that would require a camera as well, meaning apple would have to usher in massive enhancement the Watch’s battery tech in order to keep the device alive all day. “[S]ources inside Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have revealed the company is having trouble with battery life due to the power drain from cellular connectivity,” reports PC Advisor. Built in camera? In terms of the rumored camera, more reports suggest it will not feature on the device either. Earlier online talks spoke of a dual camera display but tech experts were quick to shut the idea down. A camera on the wrist-piece would require use up a lot of power. “[T] he interior will remain the same as the as the current model,” reports …. He claims the product will however have a speedier processor and a greater resistance to water. Waterproofing Apple Inc. is noticeably adding a new durability element to its upcoming devices. Outlets have insisted that both the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 are getting enhanced waterproofing. Both will be instilled with IP68 water resistance, which means the two products can be submerged in water for a round 30 minutes. A round Apple Watch Those who anticipate the next Watch from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to be a round device instead could be disappointed as well. There is little to support the rumor beyond fan site renderings and speculation. The concept isn’t at all far-fetched. Only giving in to a round design would make the Apple Watch look much like its leading rivals. Top smartwatch makers like Samsung and Huawei produce highly appealing wearable but stick to conventional watch appearances. More recent outlets insist that the Apple probably won’t do the same. The square-ish look of the Apple Watch is among the product’s distinguishing features. Current steals on the original Apple Watch If none of these upgrades sound great to you but you’d still like to own an Apple Watch, now might be a great time to pick up an original at a bargain price. Best Buy has them available at under $200. An upgraded iOS is coming soon which might add some cool bells and whistles to the “old” hardware. The next Watch from Apple Inc. could be a rather mild upgrade, though online outlets tend to oversell expert comments. The more likely upgrades include some screen tech enhancement, a software upgrade and an independent GPS functions. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock is a must-watch. Here's why. Dividend Stocks,News https://www.incomeinvestors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/iStock_17538584_SMALL-150x150.jpg Apple Stock (AAPL): Apple Inc. is 1 Dividend Stock to Own Forever By Jing Pan, B.Sc, MA | August 28, 2016 Here’s What You Can Expect from Apple Inc. Triple-digit capital gains are always exciting, but that’s not what Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is about these days. In the past 12 months, Apple stock’s performance has not been that great. But note that the company is no longer a tech startup that’s going to change the world, because it has already accomplished that. Instead, today’s Apple stock could be a great fit for an income portfolio. Dividends used to be an important factor when making investment decisions, and it was not just for income investors. I mean, what’s the point of being the shareholder of a company that doesn’t plan to return some of its earnings to investors? With the hype in the Internet sector, many companies are carrying triple-digit price-to-earnings multiples. It’s true that some of them have great potential, but higher valuations are often associated with higher volatility. As an income investor, is that really the place you want to put your money in? Of course, Apple was once a tech startup too, and for years it lived under the shadow of software giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and hardware device makers such as Dell Inc. However, ever since the launch of the first “iPhone” in 2006, Apple has completely changed the industry landscape. In Apple’s most recent fiscal quarter, which ended June 25, iPhone sales brought in over $24.0 billion of revenue. The company’s total revenue was a whopping $42.4 billion for the quarter. (Source: “Apple Inc. Q3 Unaudited Summary Data,” Apple Inc., July 26, 2016.) While many analysts are looking at the year-over-year changes of those numbers, I would like to point out that for income investors, the best could be yet to come. AAPL Stock: More Dividends to Come? You see, Apple is a profitable company, with Apple stock having delivered earnings of $1.42 per share in the most recent quarter. Solid earnings could translate into more dividends in the future. Apple stock investors are already getting quarterly dividends. Based on Apple’s stock price today and its current quarterly payout, the company has an annual dividend yield of 2.12%. Note that with a quarterly dividend rate of $0.57 per share, Apple is only paying out 40% of its earnings. For a mature company, that payout ratio is quite low. Among the established companies in the electronics equipment industry, some of them pay more than 70% of their earnings as dividends to investors. AAPL stock bears would argue that the company’s earnings will fall further. However, keep in mind that the last quarter was a slow quarter for Apple because people were anticipating the launch of the “iPhone 7” in September, and yet the company still sold more than 40 million iPhones. When the company reveals its latest flagship model this fall, expect this number to be much higher. Moreover, the company has a booming services segment. With “Apple Pay,” “AppleCare,” Internet services, and licensing, Apple’s services revenue reached a June quarter record of $6.0 billion. In the past 12 months, the segment’s revenue has grown $4.0 billion year-over-year to $23.1 billion. The company expects its services segment to become the size of a Fortune 100 company next year. What this means is that Apple still has earnings potential. But just to be safe, let’s assume that Apple’s quarterly earnings stay at $1.42 per share (which could be an underestimate, because the June quarter is typically a slow quarter for the company). If the company decides to boost its payout ratio to, say, 70%, Apple stock investors can expect a quarterly dividend rate of $0.994 per share, which translates to nearly $4.00 of dividends per share annually. At today’s price, that increases Apple’s annual dividend yield to 3.7%. The Bottom Line on AAPL Stock At the end of the day, don’t forget that dividends are not the only channel through which Apple stock returns value to investors. The company is also buying back its shares aggressively. By the end of June, Apple had completed almost $177 billion of its $250.0 billion capital return program. With a solid business and over $200 billion in cash, Apple stock should be near the top of the watch list for any income investor.

Header Right Microsoft Android Apple Games Contact Us You are here: Home / Apple / iPhone 7 Facing Supply Shortage As Production Ramps Up Before Launch iPhone 7 Facing Supply Shortage As Production Ramps Up Before Launch Aug 28, 2016 By Aditya A relatively new report coming out of the Apple’s iPhone 7 supply chain is indicating that because of some faulty components the company is facing a supply shortage. An industry source who is familiar with the issue gave the statement that, “If Apple sticks to its launch schedule from last year, there may not be enough supply at the beginning, as some suppliers are still trying to fix low yield rates of their components”. This kind of news is a usual for Apple as it is the same thing every year, stemming from Apple’s annual late summer production ramp up ahead of the September iPhone reveal. Apple is said to be staying close to its launch schedule from last year, which could lead to low supply “during the first round of the rollout,” resulting in low yield rates, higher costs for manufacturers, and subsequently less volume to deliver to customers. Yuanta Investment Consulting analyst Jeff Pu believes total iPhone 7 builds to be 10 million less than that of the iPhone 6s last year. Pu cut his forecasts for iPhone production to 114 million from 120 million, including both new and old models, in the July-December period, due to defects in the waterproof speaker and dual-camera module, which have yet to be resolved. “We estimate total iPhone 7 builds to be 74 (million) in 2H16F, compared to 84 (million) for iPhone 6s in 2H15. Together with pricing pressure, we expect most Apple food chain suppliers to see (year-on-year) revenue decline for the rest of the year,” Pu wrote in a note dated Aug. 23. Although it’s true that the iPhone 7 will be a modest update on the iPhone 6s, like every model before it, the 2016 iPhone is expected to see a heavy influx of pre-orders the day it goes live on Apple’s website, currently rumored for September 9. Users will then have to wait a few weeks to get their hands on the smartphone, with a launch either onSeptember 16 or September 23.

According to sources in Korea where Apple is currently holding discussions with manufacturers the new iPhone 8, will have an OLED display as well as brand-new circuit boards. Among the companies vying to supply Apple is LG and Samsung. Currently Apple is already sourcing components from these two Korean powerhouses, the company has briefed suppliers that they looking for capacity to supply 200 million new iPhones in 2017. One major component manufacturer told at the Korean Herald “We are currently pushing to supply our new products for an OLED iPhone. It seems that a decision will be made during the fourth quarter 2016.” It is expected that the new Apple OLED iPhone will be released in September of next year. Analyst claim that display industries that are centred on LCD will rapidly change to industries that are centred on OLED. They said that the fact that Apple is choosing OLED display indicates that it is trying to newly establish a supply networks that are different from current supply network for LCD. Opportunities that did not exist before are now available for components and materials manufacturers several analysts have said It is expected that Apple will also use OLED display for its other products such as iPads and MacBook’s. According to Korean sources Apple is currently developing 4.8-inch and 5.5-inch OLED displays.  These sizes are almost identical to sizes of current iPhones (6S and 6S Plus). However, it is not sure whether or not Apple will release both sizes. Some insiders predict that Apple will first apply OLED displays to premium models. It’s also been claimed that the new Apple OLED iPhones are going to be ‘dual-edge’ similar to the new Samsung Note 7.

(AAPL)? August 28, 2016 By Mvusi Ngubane Leave a Comment Filed Under: Consumer Discretionary, News, Technology Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is just weeks away from unveiling the iPhone 7, according to online reports about the device. The U.S. tech major has made no announcements just yet, but leaks, comments from experts and fan renderings have all given the public a good idea about the general features of the upcoming smartphone. Fans expect a very mild upgrade to come along this year. With Apple products beginning to feel stale to many, Analysts suspect Apple is holding back a revolutionary upgrade for next year’s edition of its flagship device. It could be the catalyst Apple needs to re-ignite the product line. The iPhone 8 is commanding a considerable amount of news coverage. Experts close to the company’s supply chain have already said a lot about the gadget. It even outdoes the iPhone 7 in a few news circles, despite the product being more than a year away from release. Reports describe an new face lift, amazing screen tech and a revival of the glass-encased design. iPhone 8 rendering by iPhoneconcepts.com Iris Scanner It is reported that the iPhone 8 will feature an iris scanner as well as facial recognition.This is according to KGI Securities — a leading analyst firm and trusted reporter of Apple Inc.’s ventures. Not much has been said about how these two qualities will be put to use. However, fans of the iPhone can probably expect them to form part of the iPhone 8’s security features. Always playing catch-up to its chief rival Samsung, the latest of the Galaxy Note series, the Galaxy Note 7, comes equipped with a iris scanning feature. It is a step up from traditional fingerprint readers and offered better protection without making access to the device a laborious task.   To see a list of high yielding CDs go here.   OLED Screen Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be letting go of LCD in favor of OLED displays. This will make the iPhone 8 more resistant to screen damage, bringing in a new durability element to the iPhone along with better displays. OLED screens are lot more flexible than LCD and normal LED.  The screen tech also offers better color and more vivid displays. Beyond that, the display tech consumes less power. OLED allows for faster responses as well. No Apple iPhone 7S The traditional titling that Apple uses for its iPhone upgrades is expected to take a bit of a skip next year. Fans of the company likely expect Apple to drop an iPhone 7S in 2017. This won’t be the case according to macrumors.com. Considering the features and significance of next year’s gadget, it is thought that Apple might skip the traditional S upgrade and move straight to iPhone 8. “So there’s a good chance that Apple may decide to skip directly to the next full number, naming the 2017 iPhone the iPhone 8.” 2017 will mark a decade of iPhone production and only a device fitting of such title will do. Bearing this, an S upgrade might be too calm a release for what will be the Cupertino giant’s 10th anniversary iPhone. The name iPhone 8 has not be confirmed by the company, but experts believe it to be the most “logical” choice considering the weight of the 2017 iPhone. Glass body iPhone 8 It is perhaps the largest piece of talk about the iPhone 8. Reports suggest that the 2017 product will have a glass chassis. This has not been by Apple since the iPhone 4S. The company is said to be innovating on the design this time around, making it slimmer and more durable in the process. The most obvious drawback is that glass breaks easier and is heavier than tradition aluminium. Ming-Chi Kuo, however, an analyst at KGI Securities, assures the public that this wouldn’t pose much of an issue. Innovations like Gorrila Glass are already used on handsets and are sturdier than ever. Coupled with the lightweight display tech of OLED, and Apple can offer a glossier, more durable iPhone, all without significantly changing the overall weight of the device. Allen Horng, the CEO of Catcher Technology, affirmed the rumor. Horng’s company is a known supplier of Apple Inc.’s iPhone components. According to Macrumors,: “[A]t least one 2017 iPhone model will include a glass backing, but Apple might pair one glass-bodied model an aluminum-bodied model.” The iPhone 8 should boast a faster A11 chip, increased storage, wireless charging, waterproofing and a continuation of Apple Inc.’s audio jack-less feature. The gadget will be launched in September 2017. For now, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) more immediate iPhone 7 holds much of the world’s focus.

By now, we know so much about the upcoming devices that it would be very hard to be surprised when they do come out. What we know so far from the rumors is that the iPhone 7 will be very similar in design to the previous iPhone 6 model but with a few tweaks. It will also be powered by a better processor and sport more efficient cameras. Surprisingly, the headphone jack has been removed from the device. The latest leak on the subject suggests that the ‘7 and 7 Plus ’ might not be appropriate names for the upcoming devices and that they might instead be very different from the customary names that Apple usually gives to its new models. Many believe that Apple will stay true to its naming habits, while others believe that something might change because there are many rumors regarding the anniversary release of the next gen of iPhones in 2017 that state that the particular models will undergo significant redesigning thus making them a very different type of iPhone. With a very different name or number in the name… and that it’s very possible that the September 2016 models will be connected to them naming-wise, rather than being connected to the 2015 iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. At the same time, some believe that the upcoming September iPhones will not have the number 7 in their name, but will rather be upgraded versions of the last gen iPhones 6 and 6 Plus. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are rumored to be scheduled for launch on the 7th of September and to hit the stores on the 16th of September 2016 which is a little less than three weeks from now.

Frank Ocean earns his first No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart with the arrival of Blonde. The set, which was released on Aug. 20, bows atop the list with 276,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending Aug. 25, according to Nielsen Music. Blonde logs the third-largest debut of 2016, behind only the arrivals of Drake's Views and Beyonce's Lemonade. The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption, which includes traditional album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). The new Sept. 10-dated chart (where Blonde bows at No. 1) will be posted in full to Billboard's websites on Tuesday, Aug. 30. Of Blonde's start of 276,000 units, 232,000 were in traditional album sales, while the rest were SEA (44,000 units). Only two albums started bigger than Blonde in 2016: Drake's Views (1.04 million units earned in its debut frame) and Beyonce's Lemonade (653,000). Blonde also logs the third-biggest sales start -- behind, again, just Views (852,000 copies sold in its first week) and Lemonade (485,000). Blonde was available exclusively to stream via the Apple Music service and for sale through the iTunes Store (but only as a full album -- none of its tracks were sold a la carte). The songs on the Blonde album generated 65.4 million streams during the week. It was the second-most streamed album on the chart, behind only Drake's Views, with 67.5 million streams. Blonde arrived two days after Ocean released the long-form video Endless (which many have referred to as a visual album). It is available exclusive to stream via Apple Music. Both releases are Ocean's first full-length offerings since his debut album, Channel Orange, which came out in 2012. The set debuted and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, and sold 131,000 copies in its first week. It was released on July 10, 2012, initially exclusively through iTunes, and a week before its advertised street date of July 17. The bulk of Channel Orange's first-week sales were digital, though there were some on physical CD, as brick-and-mortar retailers began selling the title mid-week following iTunes' exclusive launch. Blonde is the third independently distributed No. 1 album in 2016. It follows Blink-182's California and The Lumineers' Cleopatra. California was released on Blink-182's own Viking Wizard Eyes LLC, licensed to BMG and distributed by Alternative Distribution Alliance (ADA). Cleopatra was released on Dualtone Records, which is also distributed by ADA. Blonde is different from both albums in that it was released by Ocean himself directly to Apple and iTunes -- bypassing a traditional distribution company. The last set to reach No. 1 in the same manner was Garth Brooks' 2013 box set, Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences. The hefty box (six CDs and two DVDs) was issued through Brooks' Pearl Records and sold exclusively through Walmart stores. It debuted at No. 2 with 164,000 sold, and rose to No. 1 the following week -- for one frame -- selling 146,000. Before Brooks, Pearl Jam's Backspacer also hit No. 1 (in 2009) without a traditional distributor. The set, which bowed with 189,000 sold, was released on the band's Monkeywrench label, and initially sold exclusively through Target, iTunes, Pearl Jam's website and independent retailers. Slightly less than two years earlier, Eagles flew in at No. 1 with its self-released Long Road Out of Eden, exclusively sold through Walmart. It debuted with 711,000 copies sold on the Nov. 17, 2007-dated chart. Back on the new Billboard 200 chart, Drake's Views holds at No. 2 with 77,000 units (up 9 percent) and the Suicide Squad soundtrack falls from No. 1 to No. 3 with 76,000 units (down 18 percent). Tory Lanez arrives at No. 4 with his debut studio album, I Told You, earning 52,000 units (32,000 in pure album sales). The album follows a pair of top 10-charting singles for Lanez on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where he has reached No. 10 with "Say It" and No. 9 (so far) with the still-building "Luv." Both cuts are available on the new album, which also starts at No. 2 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Lindsey Stirling claims her second top 10 album, as her new Brave Enough launches at No. 5 with 49,000 units (45,000 in traditional album sales). It follows the violinist's 2014 effort, Shatter Me, which debuted and peaked at No. 2 with 56,000 copies sold in its first week. The new effort also leads the Classical Albums, Classical Crossover Albums and Top Dance/Electronic Albums charts -- her third No. 1 on all three lists. The classical-meets-EDM artist previously led all three charts with Shatter Me and her self-titled debut. Twenty One Pilots' Blurryface dips 5-6 on the Billboard 200 (33,000 units; down 19 percent), Adele's 25 rises one rung to No. 7 (28,000 units; down 1 percent), Rihanna's Anti climbs 9-8 (just over 27,000 units; down 2 percent) and DJ Khaled's Major Key slips 6-9 (27,000 units; down 19 percent). The original Broadway cast recording of Hamilton closes out the top 10, as it ascends 11-10 with 23,000 units (down 3 percent).

Business Cybersecurity Detection Disasters Government Infrastructure Public Safety Public health Regional Sci-Tech Surveillance Terrorism Transportation Water iOS vulnerabilityIsraeli tech company’s spyware turns UAE activist’s iPhone into a self-tracking device Published 29 August 2016 Share | Two University of Toronto researchers have uncovered an iPhone-based attack on Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent United Arab Emirates human rights defender. The attack employed spyware produced by NSO Group — an Israeli technology company founded by former members of Unit 8200, the Israeli military’s electronic surveillance branch – which is sold to government for the purpose of spying on their citizens. Two University of Toronto researchers from Munk School of Global Affairs Citizen Lab have uncovered an iPhone-based attack on Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent United Arab Emirates human rights defender. Bill Marczakand John Scott-Railton, with the collaboration of Lookout Security, discovered the attack, which used Zero Day exploits against Apple’s iOS operating system. Citizen Lab shared the preliminary findings with Lookout Security for verification and further analysis and undertook an immediate responsible disclosure of the zero days to Apple Inc.  The report, The Million Dollar Dissident: NSO Group’s iPhone Zero-Days used against a UAE Human Rights Defender, was published last Thursday in conjunction with Apple’s release of iOS 9.3.5, which patches the vulnerabilities. Lookout also published a technical analysis. Ahmed Mansoor is an internationally recognized human rights defender, and a 2015 laureate of the Martin Ennals Award (sometimes referred to as a “Nobel prize for human rights”), based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). On 10 and 11 August, he received SMS text messages on his iPhone promising “secrets” about detainees tortured in UAE jails if he clicked on an included link. U Toronto says that instead of clicking, Mansoor sent the messages to Marczak and Scott-Railton who recognized the links as belonging to NSO Group, an Israel-based “cyber war” company that sells government-exclusive “lawful intercept” spyware. San Francisco-based venture capital firm Francisco Partners Management is a major investor in NSO Group. Forbes reports that NSO Group was founded by former members of Unit 8200, the Israeli military’s electronic surveillance branch. The ensuing investigation, a collaboration between researchers from Citizen Lab and Lookout Security, determined that the links led to a chain of zero-day exploits (“zero-days”), which the researchers call the Trident, which would have remotely jailbroken Mansoor’s stock iPhone 6 and installed sophisticated spyware. Once infected, Mansoor’s phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements.

The construction began in 2005 when the Conservatory realized that it needed a larger building to accommodate the growing Jazz studies program, with the idea of adhering to the LEED standards. The building is still in the process of receiving certification. Designed by the architectural firm of Westlake Reed Leskosky of Cleveland, the Kohl building cost $24 million to construct, is three stories tall,  37,000 square feet, and opened in May of 2010. According to Jonathan Kurtz of Westlake Reed Lekosky in a press release, meeting LEED certification requirements was interesting because of the unique requirements of a music building. The Kohl building houses a large collection of Steinway pianos and other instruments, all of which need to be maintained at the right humidity levels. Sustainable features include geothermal heating and cooling with radiant panels, energy-efficient systems and lighting, a green roof system and storm water run-off collection and filtration. Sustainably harvested materials were used throughout the construction. The project was designed to achieve energy performance greater than 40 percent higher than the ASHRAE 90.1 baseline. Another important feature that was unique to the Kohl building was the tight integration of acoustic, energy, comfort and air quality considerations, and a geothermal radiant system, which reduces the need for duct work in the walls, floors and ceilings that compromise acoustics. Not only is the building environmentally friendly, it also has a unique visual appeal. The entire exterior of the building is covered in aluminum, as Jonathan Kurtz, of Westlake Reed Leskosky explained in a press release. “From the beginning, we planned to clad the exterior in aluminum,” said Kurtz. “It was a natural choice as the city of Oberlin sits above one of the largest deposits of bauxite ore in the country. And it was here, in 1886, that Charles Martin Hall, an Oberlin alumni and one of the founders of Alcoa, developed the cost-efficient process for obtaining aluminum from aluminum oxide that brought aluminum into widespread use.” Working with the design firm Riverside Group of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, the architects employed a finish developed by Alcoa that causes the buildings surface to appear to change colors as the light changes. This is further accentuated by the use of Brazilian Ipé hardwood, harvested from a sustainable forest, that will naturally weather to a silver color that creates a unique visual harmony with the aluminum. The design of the building took into account and reflects the function of the building as a music conservatory, with windows of different sizes that align with the windows of the Yamaski Conservatory Buildings, located across from the Kohl Building, that create a rhythm of different views. The location of the rooms, with practice and rehearsal rooms on the lower levels and faculty offices on the upper level, were also designed with the idea of corresponding to a piece of music. According to the Westlake Reed Leskosky design brief, “The vertical progression of spaces to the third story lounge and offices correlates to the movement from acoustic sensitivity to the visual openness of the landscape, culminating in the roof garden.” Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the Kohl Building was already LEED certified. It is still going through the certification process. SOURCES: Oberlin College, Alcoa Press Release, LEED The search engine that really hits the spot. Information World Review April 10, 2007 | Winder, Davey Byline: Davey Winder the search engine that really hits the spot Measured in terms of click-through numbers, Google dominates search in the UK, according to market research company NetRatings, with a 68% share. Yahoo trails in far behind in second place with 9.1%, followed by Ask (7.8%), Microsoft (5.8%), AOL (4.1%) and Orange (1.8%). In an endeavour to find out which is best, IWR put the UK’s six most popular web search engines head to head in the labs. Speed of search, size of database, total number of hits returned — these are nothing but eye-candy in the world of serious web search. Who cares if a search generates 21 million hits? No-one is ever going to sort through that lot. All that really matters in search are the first few pages an engine finds. The awful truth is that the vast majority of people will never venture further than the first page of results. Usually, the list contains 10 hits by default, although that number can rise considerably once the sponsored hits have been added top and tail. But whether the number of first-page results is 10 or 50, the crucial thing is that your relevancy ranking has done its stuff and moved the site you want to find near to the top — and that is what we have looked for in these tests. We counted the number of relevant sites returned within the first 10 non-sponsored results for each of the 10 tests and simply added up the scores for a final relevancy percentage. This figure enabled us to come to a meaningful and very real-world conclusion as to who should be crowned king of web search. The terms we searched for were deliberately chosen to put pressure on specific aspects of web search engines. They were as follows: n “Apple Pie” –“Apple Computers” tests simple Boolean filtering, including within sponsored results n (“Microsoft Office Online” OR “MS Office Online”) NEAR (Outlook –“Outlook Express”) tests complex Boolean constructs n Plumbers in New Cross tests localisation functionality n Raleigh tests ambiguous term refinement — we are interested in bicycles and nothing else n What time is it in Bangalore? tests question interpretation n iPAQ hw6900 tests product information location ability n 08700 100 222 tests number handling; we were looking for links directly to the BBC as this is the complaints desk number n 22/11/1963 tests date format handling; we wanted to find details of the JFK assassination n pas de bourre tests foreign and niche handling (it’s a ballet term) n Information World Review tests ability to interpret keyword phrase grouping, ignoring common words to find the phrase without the use of quote marks AOL Relevancy score 64% Although AOL is probably not on the top of your list of trusted information research sources, it is powered by Google and the fifth most popular search engine in the UK. We were disappointed with the fairly limited Advanced Search options that let you search within title/URL/text/links, specify language and document format, and filter by date, but only on a rudimentary three months, six months or year basis. By default, Safesearch adult filtering is switched on, and there is no way to change the number of hits shown per page from the default 10. Sponsored links are topped and tailed to the results, but not obviously so because the word “sponsored” is greyed out and on the far right of the screen, well away from the results themselves. We liked the FullView feature which integrates image, video, audio and shopping search results — or an overview of them at least — when a search triggers relevant hits. The FullView sidebar is informative and easy to navigate, but, along with a Smartbox keyword suggestion tool and the ability to rewind through your recent search history, only available if you use the US service and strangely absent from the UK portal. Interestingly, our apple pie search produced no sponsored links, while the Microsoft query produced none for Outlook Express, unlike some of the other engines on test. The plumbers in New Cross search unfortunately had a hit at the top of the list which simply read “We have no plumbers in New Cross,” which was about as helpful as the second hit listing plumbers in Brent Cross. The Raleigh test was always going to be a tough one — after all, how could the search engine know we were interested in bikes when we hadn’t actually said so? We thought the Smartbox keyword suggestion tool — which gives possible refinements in a dropdown list as you type your keyword — might help, but it didn’t mention bicycles at all. What time is it in Bangalore? This straightforward question found four answers in the first four hits, after which things fell apart, with results pertaining to part-time jobs in India and publications such as the Times of India and Time Asia magazine. But the product search for the iPAQ hw6900 was spectacularly impressive. Not only were all 10 hits information about the device in question rather than links to shops, but the FullView function came alive to display related items for sale — albeit at just one US-based store. Pros Multimedia search integration with FullView, Smartbox keyword suggestion, search history browsing Cons All the pros not available in the UK version, poor customisation, limited advanced functionality Ask www.ask.co.uk Relevancy score 41% Ask, formerly Ask Jeeves and also responsible for the popular MyWay service, is powered by Teoma, which it owns. It uses a proprietary ExpertRank link popularity algorithm that analyses links in context in a subject-specific manner (so that a page about football, say, is ranked higher if other pages about football link to it). We liked some of the little touches such as the discreet binoculars icon next to many search results, which, when hovered over, pops up a preview thumbnail of that site. But the sponsored results display is disappointingly very similar to AOL, with the forced hits almost blending in with the real ones. Ask fares better when it comes to site customisation. It lets you specify the number of results shown (to a maximum of 100) and choose to open results in a new window, although that’s about it. Advanced Search also mirrors AOL, albeit with finer date filtering granularity. The adult filter is switched off by default — an odd decision we thought. But Ask has always wanted to be judged on its ability to find what you are looking for, without fuss, so how did it perform? Well, the apple pie search returned not a single apple pie recipe or direct reference outside of the sponsored hits on the first page. The location-based plumber search found only two relevant hits among the “none found in SE14” and pubs, hospitals and builders merchants listed. Although the Raleigh search had the same end result, the official Raleigh Bicycles site was listed first and the Narrow Your Search refinement tool had links for bikes, cycles, mountain bikes and even the much loved Chopper. web site microsoft office online Considering Ask has always been a plain English, ask-a-question-get-an-answer-driven service, it was a surprise to find our one direct question — “What time is it in Bangalore?” — returning only one correct link. The saving grace was that the answer was also given as a “The time in Bangalore isa[bar]” statement at the top of the page, along with a box for checking the time in other locations. The reviewer’s wife used to be a professional ballet dancer, so she supplied an obscure technical term in French: pas de bourre. Ask returned six hits, four of which were in English. And our JFK date search revealed that 22/11/1963 equals 0.0010188487 but little else, although a “What happened on 22/11/1963” refinement link produced all the JFK information any conspiracy theorist could want. While the relevancy rating for Ask is low, its search refinement tools work well and often generate a single answer that meets your needs towards the top of the list. Pros Excellent search refinement tools Cons Intrusive sponsored hits, poor results relevancy overall, no adult filtering by default Google www.google.co.uk Relevancy score 70% Far and away the market leader for search both nationally and globally, Google also has the biggest database (20 billion pages or more), although the precise size is down to guesswork since the company stopped sharing such details with the press some years ago. The market dominance and ensuing advertising clout has sent the financial value of the company soaring, enabling it to invest heavily in new areas of search, which shows in the sheer variety of niche search services on offer. However, we were concentrating purely on web search for this test, which is where Google’s legendary PageRank algorithm comes to the fore, using a combination of links and authority to sort relevancy. Customisation is good, from the number of hits per page to a three-step adult filter set to moderate by default that removes explicit images but not text. When it comes to language settings, Google rules supreme. It can change the interface language itself and restrict searches by language or country of origin. There’s a free onsite text translation service and native Googles in myriad locations. Sponsored links are easier to spot than some, being in a shaded area heading the results, as well as in a separate sidebar. In our tests we were expecting Google to perform well, but just how well was the big question. The simple apple Boolean construct generated nine hits with just the one, for a band called Hot Apple Pie, to spoil things. The more complex nested search for Microsoft Office Online also did remarkably well with nine hits. Unsurprisingly, our plumber search suffered the same “not in New Cross” fate as the Google-powered AOL, but performed slightly better with three hits for Raleigh bicycles. The refinement box appeared with this test, but, unlike Ask, was restricted to stuff in and around Raleigh in North Carolina. The right time in Bangalore was displayed at the top of the page, as well as five relevant hits, and a decent eight for that BBC complaints number. There were only six for the JFK date, though, which was disappointing, and no easy Ask-like refinement to come to the rescue — the similar Pages link is somewhat hit and miss. The iPAQ product search threw up the Froogle box to take us to shopping comparisons if we wanted. We didn’t but were given eight relevant sites to ponder anyway. The final Information World Review search was impressive in not only generating a full 10 relevant hits, but expanding the first to include links to our blog, features category and so on. Google turned in a good — if slightly inconsistent in places — performance and just manages to pip Yahoo to the winning post with a relevancy rating of 70%. Pros Database size, PageRank algorithm, niche search offerings Cons Disappointing localisation search Microsoft www.live.com Relevancy score 52% The successor to the popular but rather crowded and portal-driven MSN Search, Microsoft Windows Live Search has gone for the polar opposite of its predecessor and adopted an even less cluttered approach than Google, if such a thing is possible. Look beneath the minimalist exterior and you discover equally minimalist options. You are restricted to just changing your default language until you perform your first search, when the Options button opens up a much wider choice of customisation. As well as offering a good choice of number of hits returned (a maximum of 50) and language options, there are useful settings such as limiting the number of results (from one to three) from the same site that are grouped and displayed. Adult filtering is via SafeSearch and defaults as Google does. But it is when you hit the Advanced search link that Windows Live Search really comes into its own. The link pops up a box that brings truly easy-to-use refinement to search, including a set of innovative results ranking sliders that let you quickly alter the ranking weighting between static and recently updated sites, popular and less popular sites, and exact and approximate match with the search term. Each slider has a 100-point scale, and defaults to 50 for each weighting category. Sponsored search display is similar to Google and fairly unobtrusive. The inclusion of data from regional newspapers brings a local feel to news searches, and the large home-grown database powering the entire search is pleasingly effective. Unfortunately, Microsoft got off to a very bad start with our simple Boolean test, returning just a single relevant apple pie result among the teddy bear shops and marketing companies. The complex Boolean construct did surprisingly well considering that the Near operator was treated as a search term — more luck than judgement we suspect. Luck, however, was missing from the equation with our localisation search for plumbers. It turned up only two in New Cross — the same number as in Wales. It was a much better performance all round with the Raleigh search. It returned six bicycle-related links as well as a news search box containing rather too much information about shooting in Raleigh, North Carolina. Unfortunately, there was no nice “The time in Bangalore isa[bar]” response at the top of the page when we asked for one. In fact, a Bangalore escort agency placed higher than the first of the three correct responses. see here microsoft office online Our JFK date search prompted the usual maths lesson at the top of the page, but only two relevant results topped and tailed the list, and there was no obvious way to refine the search. All of which leaves us rather underwhelmed. If this is the best Microsoft can do, then Google and Yahoo have little to worry about. Pros Clean interface, innovative weighting controls Cons Poor results, lack of search refinement Orange Relevancy score 28% Orange has a huge problem with the Overture network-driven sponsored links in its results. Despite these having an easy-to-miss, very pale grey “sponsored” tag, the same cannot be said of the results themselves, with sponsored links dominating the first page of most searches. The trouble is that Orange doesn’t show you the sponsored links and then the default 12 “real” results; instead, the sponsored links are included in the default 12. Thus, the search for apple pie but not Apple Computers threw up six sponsored links, all for the computer company, with just six “real” results, and only three of those were relevant. Nor is there any control over the number of hits displayed, which just compounds the problem. When it comes to configuration options, Orange allows search term highlighting, which is most welcome, although we would have preferred full adult filtering rather than the default “display consent warning before displaying content” default. And speaking of odd defaults, PDF, PowerPoint and Excel files are excluded from searches unless you specify otherwise. The Advanced Search page is very similar to the Options page, with language, country, file format and the most basic of matching choice (all, any or exact). Complex Boolean searching is not something that appeals to Orange. Our test returned only one relevant hit, although thankfully it also successfully confused the sponsored links engine, so we saw none of those at all. There was precious little sign of plumbers in New Cross either, with the first hit confusingly offering “All you need to know about Banbury” and others including a no doubt helpful in the right circumstances “EMERGENCY LOCKSMITH. EMERGENCY LOCKSMITH. EMERGENCY LOCKSMITH” but no New Cross plumbers at all. The Raleigh search did at least stimulate the sidebar into action with further links for shopping, eBay and Thomson Local results (where was this when we needed the plumbers?) Of the eight non-sponsored links, four were bang on target. Our quest for the time in Bangalore flummoxed Orange, generating zero results. Phone numbers fared little better: just four results including one duplicate — the only duplicate for any of the search engines on test. Similarly, although JFK came second in the list when we looked for 22/11/1963, the only other reference was for another date and pointed to the Warren Commission findings. We were not too hopeful for our technical French ballet term by this point, and Orange didn’t surprise, throwing up no directly relevant hits at all. Even the seven hits for IWR couldn’t save Orange from what were, frankly, appalling results. The engine’s Search Made Simple motto seems sadly inappropriate. Pros Search highlighting Cons Overbearing sponsored hits, very poor results, lack of configurability Yahoo Relevancy score 68% Yahoo started life as a directory of websites and has always had more than a touch of the portal about it, rather than being a serious search engine in its own right. In 2004 it reverted to using its own search engine database to power its results, with full support for Boolean searching and the use of wildcard words in phrases among the features, driving good search performance. Like Google, Yahoo has introduced a number of niche searches as well as an onsite language translation service in Babel Fish. Sponsored results are flagged by a combination of a shaded portion topping and tailing the main results and a dedicated side panel. Unlike Google, Yahoo switches off SafeSearch adult filtering off by default, despite the preferences saying it is on — you need to sign in to your Yahoo account to lock the settings on which it would appear. One unique and very appealing feature is the ability to include Factiva, LexisNexis and other databases within your search if you have a valid subscription. Yahoo is at its most flexible and advanced when it comes to configuring the services we tested, as exemplified by the Shortcuts feature, which lets you search directly for time, weather, measurements, currency exchange rates and so on. But the proof of this particular pudding is in the searching, and if Yahoo is to mount a serious challenge to Google it will need to better it in our rigorous testing procedure. The simple Boolean apple pie test was passed with flying colours and eight relevant hits, the complex construct doing equally as well. Localisation proved something of a success as well, with Yahoo popping up a Local Results entry atop the page showing three plumbers within a mile of New Cross together with a map link. We say “something” of a success because the actual hits revealed only one local plumber, although the combined hit rate of four matches Google. The time in Bangalore was displayed via a Yahoo shortcut link prominently at the head of the page, followed by five relevant hits. Our iPAQ product search turned up nine relevant information links with just a solitary shopping link to spoil things, although we were pleasantly surprised by the total lack of any advertising pushing us towards shopping comparison engines, which was a pleasant relief. Yahoo has no problem handling numbers. The phone query pointed us towards the BBC in seven of the 10 results, and the 22/11/1963 format test produced six dead Kennedys. Things went a little haywire with the French ballet terminology; despite an impressive seven relevant hits, only three were in English. The magazine search with nine hits was no surprise, but Yahoo’s failure to beat Google overall did given that Yahoo felt like the more consistent search tool of the two. n Pros Flexibility, database subscription option, full Boolean support Cons Not quite as accurate as Google Winder, Davey Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) More Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Tags: Alcoa, Aluminium, Kohl Building, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, LEED certification, leed gold, Oberlin College, Oberlin Conservatory of Music About the Author Matt Smith Related Posts LEED Rated Buildings May Still Be Energy Hogs → Artas Designs Makes Furniture From Reclaimed Materials → 12 World Class Sustainable Building Designs W/Infographic → LEED Dynamic Plaque Provides Real-Time LEED Ratings → Anonymous . I’m a mechanical engineer working closely with a high end architectural office. I have always been skeptical at best about geothermal for homes. Over the past year, I have been introduced to some solid concepts a procedures for geothermal hvac technology, but I was still not ready to commit to the technology…primarily because it is so unregulated. When the architectural firm I work with came to me to design the mechanical for a large custom home, I scoffed at the prospect of geothermal hvac. The owner gave me a copy of this book (Geothermal HVAC) and asked me to skim it. This book is like a breath of fresh air in a vast wasteland…it addresses the real issues without presuming to have to teach the technical aspects, which in my opinion is the demise of any new technology, trying to teach the common do-it-you-selfer (such as I am often called) how to design and install something that should be left to a highly trained professional. Cutting to the bottom line, I’ve followed the guidelines in the book, and I am busier in this depressed economy than I’ve been in the last 15 years (I have currently more than 20 projects going valued in the millions).

Spotify has been retaliating against musicians who introduce new material exclusively on rival Apple Music by making their songs harder to find, according to people familiar with the strategy. Artists who have given Apple exclusive access to new music have been told they won’t be able to get their tracks on featured playlists once the songs become available on Spotify, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing the steps. Those artists have also found their songs buried in the search rankings of Spotify, the world’s largest music-streaming service, the people said. Spotify has been using such practices for about a year, one of the people said, though others said the efforts have escalated over the past few months. Artists who have given exclusives to Tidal, the streaming service run by Jay Z, have also been retaliated against, the person said, declining to identify specific musicians. Apple’s music service has emerged as the largest challenger to Spotify over the past year, signing up more than 15 million subscribers since its debut last June, the company said two months ago. Exclusive deals for new music from artists such as Drake, Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean are central to Apple’s strategy. Spotify has more than 30 million subscribers globally. Apple Music also has ways to promote artists, such as highlighting their songs in its Top Tracks section, giving it ways to play favorites with musicians. The dustup over exclusives comes at a critical time for Spotify, which is in the midst of renegotiating licensing contracts with the world’s biggest record labels. The company is aiming to hold an initial public offering by the end of next year, but needs more favorable long-term agreements with the labels to attract a higher valuation from investors, according to a person familiar with the plans. The company isn’t profitable despite generating more than $2 billion in revenue, in part because it has to give 55 percent of the money to labels and an additional cut to publishers. It’s not clear whether major artists like Drake and Ocean have been affected by Spotify’s measures, and their representatives didn’t respond to questions. In any case, artists of their stature need less help from Spotify to draw attention to their music, emerging acts rely on the service to find new listeners. The company has threatened to use its retaliatory practices on lesser-known artists who introduce music on a Beats One show hosted by DJ Zane Lowe, an architect of Apple’s radio service, the people said. One representative of a singer-songwriter said the client canceled plans to debut a song on Lowe’s show because of concern that the artist would lose promotion from Spotify. The agent asked not to be identified, and that the artist not be named, to avoid damaging relationships with the music-streaming companies. Lowe, a former BBC radio host, has introduced new tracks from his first day on the air with Beats One, and his show has become an important platform to debut songs worldwide. Apple and Spotify have been feuding since before Apple Music’s debut, and competition between the two ratcheted up again in the last several weeks after Apple proposed changing songwriting royalties in a way that would increase costs for competitors like Spotify by putting its music in a different category that requires a higher rate. Spotify has also accused Apple of blocking a new version of its iPhone app, the latest volley in an ongoing dispute over Apple’s cut of sales from its app store. Apple denied blocking Spotify’s app, saying its rival hadn’t met its terms of service. Led by former record executive Jimmy Iovine, Apple Music has kept its strategy flexible to appeal to what an artist wants. In the case of Frank Ocean and Drake, the company paid for exclusives. With Adele and Beyonce, it agreed to keep the music off its streaming service and initially only make it available for a paid download. The company also has been appealing to artists and industry executives by limiting its streaming service to paying subscribers and not having a free advertising-supported version like Spotify. Spotify has decried exclusive deals as harmful to musicians, fans and the growing business of music streaming. However, it has sought to make exclusive deals with some artists, such as rock band the 1975, but refused to limit the release to the company’s paid service only, as labels and musicians have sought, two of the people said. Spotify has said a robust free service is needed to attract new users who can eventually become subscribers. Record labels are still pushing Spotify to let artists release music for paying subscribers only, and have yet to sign new long-term deals with the service as a result. Yet Apple’s ability to attract those big exclusives may also be in jeopardy. In an internal memo this week, Lucian Grainge, chief executive officer of Vivendi’s Universal Music Group, directed the heads of his company’s labels to stop giving any music services long-term exclusives, according to two people familiar with the matter. Universal has sold Apple many of its biggest exclusives, including Drake.

Picture: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File AFPAFP Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend FRANK Ocean’s long-awaited album Blonde opened at number one on the Australian, US and UK charts this week, in one of the year’s biggest debuts after the artist thumbed his nose at his label. The genre-merging hip-hop star’s album sold 276,000 copies in the US or the equivalent in downloads and streaming in the week through Thursday, tracking service Nielsen Music said. The figure was the third highest for an album in its first week this year, although it was significantly below Drake’s Views and Beyonce’s Lemonade. Like Drake and Beyonce, Ocean signed an exclusive arrangement, in his case with tech giant Apple, which made Blonde available exclusively on its Apple Music streaming service or for purchase on iTunes. Blonde came out just a day after a ‘visual album’ titled Endless — Frank’s last obligation to his record company.Source:Supplied But Ocean self-released the album on his own label, which he called Boys Don’t Cry, despite a contract with Def Jam, a unit of the world’s largest music conglomerate Universal. Ocean had won wide acclaim for his 2012 debut album Channel Orange, leading to an intense wait for his follow-up album. After the four-year hiatus, Ocean on August 19 unveiled an album — not Blonde, which came out just one day later, but a more ambient work entitled Endless that accompanied a film on Apple Music. In the fine print, Endless was on Def Jam, meaning he fulfilled his two-record obligation through a work he described as secondary to Blonde, essentially outfoxing the world’s biggest music label group. Dealing directly with Apple for the release of Blonde also meant that Ocean was able to renegotiate the cut he got from his music sales. Ocean’s Def Jam deal saw him get 14% of the profits with album sales, while his new Apple deal will reportedly earn him 70% of album sales. Ocean will make a lot more money from Blonde than if he’d stayed on Def Jam — and the record company will get nothing. Ocean’s two album releases come after a prolonged four-year wait. Picture: AFP PHOTOSource:AFP The move reportedly infuriated Universal chief Lucian Grainge. He responded by ordering all Universal labels to end streaming exclusives, according to the Music Business Worldwide blog and other music publications. Apple Music and hip-hop mogul Jay Z’s Tidal service have relied on exclusives in hopes of winning customers from streaming leader Spotify, whose model has been to aim at wide and open access rather than original content. Ocean performs in a unique blend of rap and R&B falsetto, with introspective lyricism known for its subtlety. Blonde features cameos or collaborations with a range of influential artists from Beyonce to Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood. Unusual in the often-macho world of hip-hop, Ocean has songs of relationships with other men and he has increasingly been seen as a gay rights icon.

The latest report shows that, after a whole decade of problems, Apple is still not doing enough to recognize and prevent exploitation. By Jack Schofield for Jack's Blog | August 28, 2016 -- 21:23 GMT (14:23 PDT) | Topic: Apple Image: China Labor Watch China Labor Watch has skewered Apple over worker exploitation in the manufacture of iPhones in China (PDF). This is not the first time that Apple been has attacked for working practices at some of its suppliers, following a furore about suicides and riots at a Foxconn plant manufacturing Apple products in 2010. Some abuses were exposed in a damning New York Times investigation, and by a BBC Panorama documentary filmed using undercover workers. Media coverage led to pay rises and improved working conditions at Foxconn. Apple responded by moving some manufacturing to Pegatron, which offered Apple lower prices based on lower wages. It's not as though Apple really needs to screw its Chinese workers, since the company has more than $200 billion in cash. According to China Labor Watch, in 2105, Apple made twice as much profit in China ($13.4 billion) as it paid its 1.6 million Chinese workers ($6.2 billion). Further, China Labor Watch reckons that the total annual basic wages of 50,000 Pegatron workers was around $193 million US dollars in 2015. This compares with Tim Cook's $378 million pay package on taking the top job at Apple, and the $73 million deal given to Angela Ahrendts when she joined from Burberry. In researching Pegatron, China Labor Watch collected more than 2,000 pay slips of production line and maintenance workers. Almost all were earning the legal minimum wage, which was $304 per month before April 2016, and rose to $330 in May. This is not enough to live on in the Shanghai area, so workers depend heavily on overtime. In an investigation in February, China Labor Watch found that 71.1 percent of Pegatron's production line employees were working more than 60 hours of overtime and 64 percent of them worked more than 90 hours of overtime in that month. This violates Apple's guidelines, and appears to be illegal. Worse, although Shanghai's municipal government raised the minimum wage from $304 to $330, and Pegatron bumped that up to $350, Pegatron's workers ended up worse off. This was because Pegatron reduced bonus payments, and stopped paying workers' social insurance payments in full. This resulted in "a $110 decrease in real wage, despite the wage raise. For this reason, many workers felt they were cheated," says China Labor Watch. In 2015, the average wage of Shanghai workers was $895. Pegatron workers who did 80 hours of overtime got $672, and those who did 20 hours of overtime got $490, according to China Labor Watch. In 2016, the totals fell to $628 and $407. A worker who did no overtime would net about $213, after deductions. China Labor Watch claims that 42.3 percent of Pegatron workers' basic wages were below Shanghai's legal minimum wage, and Pegatron had to add an average of $19 to make up the difference. China Labor Watch also accuses Pegatron of breaking the law in its treatment of interns. The government says they cannot be asked to work overtime, but on average, Pegatron's interns worked more overtime than full-time employees. Interns are not workers, they are students, often aged 17-18. They are not supposed to be working on production lines that have nothing to do with their studies. They're not volunteering either: they are little more than slave labour. This should not be news to Apple, which must know that Foxconn formerly used a lot of interns. Apple's big-bang approach to marketing requires large numbers of workers to meet peak demand, and ideally these workers should be easy to dispose of afterwards. Foxconn explained in 2012 that it was hard to hire 20 percent more workers all at once. If you had a million workers, you needed 200,000 extra. Bussing interns in from vocational secondary schools was a quick way to solve that problem, and this approach was facilitated by the Chinese government and its education system. Apple apologists will, of course, protest that "they all do it". However, there are other considerations. First, Apple's marketing practices put massive amounts of strain on Chinese workers, who are put under intense pressure to make vast quantities of new iPhones for Apple's high-profile launches. The volumes are much larger than for other smartphone suppliers, who generally offer much wider ranges of products, creating far less stress. Second, China Labor Watch's executive director Li Qiang points out that: "In 2015, Apple alone claimed more than 90 percent of the smartphone industry's aggregate profits, while a majority of other firms were operating at a loss." It would be ridiculous to expect rival smartphone suppliers to treat workers better than Apple's subcontractors when Apple is making huge profits and they're fighting for survival. If Tim Cook looked in his heart instead of at Apple's growing cash mountain, he would know that Apple could lead by example in giving his Chinese workers a better deal. A living wage for a 60-hour week would be a start. Apple, as the world's richest corporation, can hardly pretend to be a force for good when most of the people making its products at Pegatron are putting in more than 80 hours of overtime per month to make enough to live on. That vocation school students are often unwillingly, and illegally, working similar hours is a disgrace. Tim Cook has said: "We care about every worker in our worldwide supply chain." This just sounds sanctimonious because the exploitation of workers making Apple products goes back at least a decade. How many decades does Apple need before it finally takes its problems seriously?

Photo Credit: Brad Penner advertisement | advertise on newsday HIGHLIGHTS Third-year star receiver embraces mentoring role with young players Odell Beckham taking rookie Sterling Shepard under his wing When Odell Beckham Jr. takes a young cornerback to school, he really takes them to school. At least that’s been the case with rookie Eli Apple in training camp. After every route they run against each other, the vast majority of which Beckham wins, they get together and dissect exactly what happened and where Apple can improve. “He has taught me how to read routes better and he will tell me things from a receiver perspective, like what receivers look for and little things like that,” Apple said. “He’s really been on me about it and just telling me to trust my talent and get my head around. Little things like that we’ve been talking about all the time, so he has been helping me out a lot actually.” Latest Giants stories Best: Giants depending on defense — as usual McAdoo not concerned about brutal cold in Green Bay Real NYPD honors Giants’ ‘New York Pass Defense’ Six recent Giants imports make All-Pro team Robbie Gould has familiarity with Lambeau Field As Beckham enters only his third NFL season, he is taking on a new role for the Giants. Not only is he a superstar receiver, but a mentor. A teacher. A professor whose lessons are heard on both sides of the line of scrimmage. Outside of Eli Manning, there may not be another player on the roster who is looked up to as much as Beckham is. He’s not wasting that status. “I just love the feeling of being able to help,” Beckham said Wednesday. “Sometimes guys will come to me with questions, not all the time, but they’ll come to me with questions and I’ll give them the best advice that I would give myself. In doing that, I hope that they can just take it and use it.” Bob GlauberGlauber: Latest injury raises doubts about Cruz Even when the Giants are on the field Friday night for their preseason opener against the Dolphins, Beckham said he wants to continue that. He said his primary job will be to prepare himself, “and then secondly is to be there and help a younger guy. Some of the mistakes I may have made, to not allow anybody else to make that mistake. Just coaching up people and making sure we’re all working together.” advertisement | advertise on newsday One of Beckham’s closest protégés has been Sterling Shepard, the rookie receiver who may wind up being the starter opposite Beckham in the regular season. The two are often seen chatting and going over plays during practices, and the discussions continue once they leave the field. “He’s going to be a special player,” Beckham said. “He’s going to be a big-time player.” Shepard isn’t picking up only on what Beckham says. He’s also been watching how Beckham and Manning work together after two full seasons as teammates. “That’s the way it’s supposed to be,” Shepard said. “There are things that go along with that that Odell has had to gain his trust and I am still trying to pick those things up, so that is what the quarterback-receiver relationship is supposed to be like.” GiantsGiants 5: The rise of Emmett Cleary And what the veteran-rookie relationship is supposed to be like as well, even when the veteran is a 23-year-old, as Beckham is. Giants videos Beckham, who has had the most productive first two seasons of any receiver in NFL history, wants his teammates to be better. He knows that’s the only way he can get what he really wants: a championship. So if that takes imparting some of his wisdom whenever he can to whomever he can, he’ll do it. Just some, but not all. Beckham does keep a few secrets. “I’m getting used to his moves a little more,” Apple said, “but he will always pull something out that you just never expected . . . It’s crazy.”    Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards. Please read our guidelines and connect your Facebook account to comment.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      The following is an excerpt from "7 Stocks the Smart Money Loves… or Hates." It’s that time again. 45 days after the end of each quarter, large institutional money managers are required to disclose the stocks that they bought or sold during the quarter. While this is an annoying to the money managers (it’s a little like playing poker with your cards face up for the rest of the table to see), it’s great for the rest of us. We can peek over the shoulders of some of the greatest investors in history. Now, I have to give the usual caveats. The 13-F reports provided to the SEC are a snapshot in time. There is no guarantee that the manager still owns the stock by the time we read the report. We also have no information about short positions or futures positions. So in reading the raw reports, we have no way of knowing if a manager is truly bullish on a particular stock or if that stock is simply a piece of larger hedge or pair trade. But if you’re familiar with the trading styles of the managers you follow, you can generally have a pretty good idea of what their intentions are with a stock. So with no more ado, here are five high-profile stocks the masters of the universe are buying… or selling. I’ll start with iPhone maker Apple (APPL), which has become something of a punching bag for hedge fund titans. As Apple has struggled to grow in recent years, several big money investors have lost patience and moved on. Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn sold 1.3 million shares last quarter, reducing his total by nearly 17%. Apple remains his largest single holding, however, at 12% of his portfolio. Steve Cohen, Leon Cooperman and Jim Chanos also reduced their positions in Apple. But interestingly, one very high-profile investor – Mr. Warren Buffett himself – made a large Apple purchase. Buffett raised his stake in Apple by more than 50%. Apple still remains a small position for Berkshire Hathaway at about 1% of the portfolio. But Buffett clearly likes what he sees, and his stake is growing. I, for one, agree with Buffett here. Apple’s slow growth is mostly a result of impossible-to-top comps due to the unprecedented success of the iPhone 6. But as Apple’s sales cycle gets back to normal, you should see very steady growth in the years ahead. And as I wrote recently, yes, Apple’s cash hoard really is a sight to behold.  Charles Lewis Sizemore, CFA, is chief investment officer of the investment firm Sizemore Capital Management and the author of the Sizemore Insights blog.

Photo: Jeremy M. Lange/The New York Times It may not qualify as a lightning-bolt eureka moment, but Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with GE scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight—but to what end? That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But GE couldn’t make use of it. “We had to be more capable in software,” Immelt said he decided. Maybe GE—a maker of power turbines, jet engines, locomotives and medical-imaging equipment—needed to think of its competitors as Amazon and IBM. Back then, GE was returning to its heavy-industry roots and navigating the global financial crisis, shedding much of its bloated finance arm, GE Capital. That winnowing went on for years as billions of dollars in assets were sold, passing a milestone this summer when GE Capital was removed from the US government’s short list of financial institutions deemed “too big to fail”. But in 2011, GE also quietly opened a software centre in San Ramon, California, 38km east of San Francisco, across the bay. Today, one of San Ramon’s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale—a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to GE’s drive to become what Immelt says will be a “top 10 software company” by 2020. Silicon Valley veterans are sceptical. “GE is trying to do this the way a big company does, by throwing thousands of people and billions of dollars at it,” said Thomas Siebel, a technology entrepreneur who is now chief executive of C3 IoT, a start-up that has done work for GE. “But they are not software people.” The San Ramon complex, home to GE Digital, now employs 1,400 people. The buildings are designed to suit the free-range working ways of software developers: open-plan floors, bench seating, whiteboards, couches for impromptu meetings, balconies overlooking the grounds and kitchen areas with snacks. Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet, the scope of the challenge is magnified at GE, a 124-year-old company and the US’s largest manufacturer, with more than 300,000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and hurry-up habits of Silicon Valley to GE’s world of industrial manufacturing. GE’s success or failure over the next decade, Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it “probably the most important thing I have worked on in my career”. Apparently, there is no Plan B. “It’s this or bust,” he said. The march of digital technology—mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software—into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of “the Internet of things” or “the industrial Internet”. It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines. It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and healthcare. By 2020, the industrial Internet market will reach $225 billion, GE executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts. So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyses the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down. The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, GE estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving GE a chance to sell its customers not machines but “business outcomes”, like fuel savings. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain. New competition Yet, all of this exposes GE to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft, also have their eye on the industrial Internet market, as do a bevy of start-ups. There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn’t changed much in generations. “The real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,” said Karim Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “GE has no choice but to try to do that itself.” Recently, GE has lured software engineers and data scientists from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Early on, though, it struggled simply to hire. Last year, it began running self-deprecating television ads, featuring young hires, aimed at closing the company’s image gap of industrial giant but digital midget. (Applications at GE Digital jumped eightfold, the company says.) Until this year, Darren Haas hadn’t thought about GE, certainly not working there. To him, GE meant little more than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. “I had no idea,” Haas said. But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of data-centre software. Less than two years ago, Kodesh joined GE, and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital. That someone of Kodesh’s calibre was a GE convert got Haas’ attention. Then, Haas started grasping the role that GE equipment plays across the economy—in transportation, in hospitals—“a whole world”, he said. “I found that really, really compelling.” The other thing Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined GE from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the voice-based digital assistant start-up Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud. At GE Digital, Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology—machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing—to the industrial arena. “I have got my work cut out for me,” he said. Haas is working on the centrepiece of GE’s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors GE’s software ambitions. Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by GE to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software centre, started expanding Predix to other GE industrial businesses. But that soon felt too small. The issue was “outside disrupters”, Ruh said, citing the online lodging start-up Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that “bring greater productivity—but don’t own the assets they sell”. GE, Ruh notes, is the ultimate big-asset company. The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their Internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, GE reimagined Predix as a cloud-based operating system for industrial applications. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. “Those companies are going to encroach on the territory,” Kodesh said. “Are we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?” The basic idea is that GE and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and fine-tune the operation of equipment like oil-field rigs and wind-farm turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines. GE has some built-in advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world’s electricity is generated on GE equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on GE machinery. GE is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the electric-utility, aviation and healthcare industries. GE also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software. When he joined in 2011, Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a heavy-industry company would be easy. At the time, he told Immelt that would be “a 10-year journey”, he said. “We are in the middle of that journey.” Part of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. “If GE is truly going to be a digital-industrial company, we can’t be separate here,” Ruh said of his software division. Digital “tools and habits” need to be embedded “in how people do their jobs”, he said. Digital metamorphosis In its factory in Greenville, South Carolina, GE produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work. The three-storey building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of GE’s new gas turbines. It looks like the business end of a rocketship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 430 tonnes. It fires up at nearly 1,593.333 degree Celsius, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500,000 households. The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that GE hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology. John Lammas, 56, the vice-president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with GE for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company’s jet engine and power turbine divisions. “I’m an old mechanical guy,” he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings. In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to GE manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part. This prototype-and-blueprint routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use 3D computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically. This goes a step beyond computer-aided design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what GE calls a “digital thread”. This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner. Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. “Jobs are combining in this digital world,” Lammas said. Greenville’s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with data-generating sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 450kg of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350,000 a year. “We can see things we never did before,” Krause said. Overall, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530,000 hours over three years, GE estimates. Not all the start-up ideas that GE is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with “minimum viable products”, particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator. Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry. “As an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,” said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. “It’s uncomfortable. But it’s been incredibly liberating.” The old ways, said Lammas had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. “Overcoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,” he said. ©2016/THE NEW YORK TIMES Steve Lohr Topics: GEJeffrey Immeltsoftware servicesoperating systemGE factories More From Livemint READ MORE Gunman opens fire at Lauderdale airport in Florida, five killed OnePlus founders Pete Lau, Carl Pei say focus of sales to remain online Calcutta high court judge says federal agency should probe Narada News sting First Published: Mon, Aug 29 2016. 01 09 AM IST Editor's Picks GDP growth to slow to 7.1% in FY17: Govt Om Puri, actor who redefined realism in Indian cinema, dies at 66 Vibrant Gujarat: Marketing gimmick or investment driver?

The next 5 years for Apple? - podcast Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY Saturday, 27-Aug-16 13:51:57 PDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest LOS ANGELES - The Tim Cook era at Apple turned 5 this week, with higher profits, a stronger stock price, but fewer cool new products. Which got us wondering - what will the Apple CEO’s next 5 years be like? On this week’s extended weekend #TalkingTech podcast, we dived in to make predictions about the next five years for Apple--will we ever see an iPhone size monster hit again from the company? Is it on the downward spiral, or can cool come back to Cupertino? “Look at any company in decline,” said Matt Krantz, our USA TODAY markets columnist, who tracks Apple’s performance on Wall Street. “They will continue to milk the cash cow, (the iPhone)...they will try new products that won’t be as popular.” Our other panelists--Bryan Lalezarian, the CEO of e-commerce site MeUndies and Mark Brinkeroff, the head of community of mobile classified app 5miles agreed that Apple has a once in a lifetime product, the iPhone, that probably won’t be surpassed. Click the link above to listen to the complete show, or go below for audio highlights. Also on the show: --Brinkeroff tells why he ditched his iPad for a Microsoft Surface computer, and how he feels about going back to Windows. --Targeting millennials on Snapchat: Lalezarian tells how he sold 5 million pieces of MeUndies underwear online, and has a profitable company by reaching out to young consumers, on apps like Snapchat. --A safer classified experience: Brinkeroff, the head of community for 5Miles, a classified app that is taking on Craigslist, talks about how they’ve picked up 10 million users by offering a more local, friendly and safe experience. And in case you missed it, here's a fun podcast from earlier in the week, our chat with Dark Sky co-founder Adam Grossman about the app that can tell you when, where and for how long the rain will be coming.

The battery is allegedly for the 42mm model, which currently has a 246 mAh battery, suggesting the next-generation 42mm model could have a 35.7% larger battery. The photo does not provide any clues about potential battery life improvements coming to the smaller 38mm model, which is currently equipped with a 205 mAh battery. The veracity of the photo cannot be confirmed, as is often the case, but KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said an Apple Watch 2 with a higher capacity battery will launch later this year. The larger battery should unsurprisingly lead to longer battery life for the Apple Watch, which is currently rated for up to 18 hours of mixed usage and up to 72 hours in Power Reserve mode on a single charge. The much-rumored Apple Watch 2 is expected to be released in late 2016 with a faster TSMC-built processor, GPS, barometer, superior waterproofing, and a higher capacity battery -- but no cellular. Both 38mm and 42mm screen sizes will be retained with thinner display technology adopted. The device could launch in September alongside the iPhone 7 and spec-bumped Apple Watch 1 models.

Rating: 12 Votes marvz 19 weeks ago Charging it everyday isn't impressive. It's a chour. But if I can do two full days with active use - then that's worth considering. What's the big difference? It probably leads to forgetting to charge your Apple Watch every second night instead of making it a habit every night. And also I don't think that many people are wearing their watches while sleeping.. (only use case would be sleep tracking but therefore you will probably need a battery life of about 5-7 days to make it really useful). Rating: 10 Votes matjamca 19 weeks ago I might get one this time round. Rating: 10 Votes OneMike 19 weeks ago If you workout for any length of time, the watch battery life sucks. First thing in the morning I do is hit the gym. Usually at about 60% battery before 7AM. Granted I let it charge while I get ready for work when possible. Improved battery life will be welcomed though. Rating: 8 Votes Schwyz 19 weeks ago Can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually wish thinness was improved over battery in the watch. Rating: 8 Votes Schwyz 19 weeks ago If only this was an iPhone rumor... I'd go running for a 35% increase. Rating: 7 Votes Traverse 19 weeks ago I've actually been very impressed with my watch's battery. The watch IS something I would like to see thinness improved on over battery, ironically. It's the only Apple product that I feel this way about. I get home after wearing it for 12 hours with casual use and notifications all day as well as 45 minute workouts and I still have between 45% and 50%. Some days I have as much as 65% left. However, I anticipate Watch OS 3 with its new always active 10 apps to negatively impact battery life. Rating: 7 Votes ethanwa79 19 weeks ago I may have to wait a decade or so, but I will NOT buy an Apple Watch of any kind unless it's thinner, can be completely independent (meaning GPS+Cell+WiFi+Bluetooth+NFC), and have week-long battery life. Until then, it's simply not a practical enough item for me to buy.

The European Commission is expected to declare this week that deals stretching back 25 years between Apple and the Irish state gave the company an unfair advantage. In what is by far the biggest case of its kind, Apple could be ordered to pay back billions, although the sum is expected to be significantly lower than the $19bn (£14.5bn) that has been suggested. Apple and the Irish government are both expected to signal soon after the decision that it will be appealed. Tim Cook, the company’s chief executive, said recently that Apple will fight the ruling if the company feels it has not had “a fair hearing”, while Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, has said the government will appeal any negative finding. Tim Cook has said he will appeal an unfair ruling Credit: Jane Mingay The commission has been investigating two agreements between Apple and Ireland made in 1991 and 2007 that allow the company to route its international sales through the country to a subsidiary which is not resident in Ireland for tax purposes. The company has built up an offshore cash pile of $215bn, with its arrangements in Ireland allowing it to pay an estimated 2pc or less on profits. Apple argues that, rather than pay corporation taxes abroad, it should do so when it chooses to repatriate the funds to the US, since this is where its products are developed. “People really aren’t arguing that Apple should pay more taxes. They’re arguing about who they should be paid to,” Mr Cook said earlier this month. The European Commission said two years ago it had taken the preliminary view that Apple’s arrangements in Ireland give it an unfair advantage. The Apple case is the biggest of a number of European Commission competition investigations into alleged sweetheart deals allowing US companies to pay reduced tax rates. The commission has already ruled that the Netherlands gave Starbucks illegal state aid, a decision that is being appealed in the European courts. Last week, the US Treasury issued an unprecedented attack on EU investigations into American companies, accusing the commission of trying to become a “supranational tax authority” and warning of a “chilling effect” on US investment in Europe.

Amazon’s Alexa can order a cookbook and Apple’s Siri can set an oven timer for the cake, while Google’s Home silences the smoke alarm and Microsoft’s Cortana texts party guests to bring a dessert, all via voice commands. It’s impressive right up until the virtual assistants start responding with a familiar chorus along the lines of: “I’m sorry, I didn’t get that.” Bloomberg John Ellenby, visionary who helped create early laptop, dies at 75 John Ellenby, a British-born computer engineer who played a critical role in paving the way for the laptop computer, died on Aug. 17 in San Francisco. He was 75. His son Thomas confirmed the death but said the cause had not been determined.

The NY Times Augmenting the FPS: How well does Tobii track your gaze in a video game? During Ars' review playthrough of the latest adventure in the Deus Ex series, I spied a curious option tucked into its Windows menus: "Tobii eye-tracking." None of Square Enix's press materials mentioned such a thing, which seemed strange for a series that revolves around human augmentation and sci-fi upgrades. Eye-tracking in an FPS? Sounds like some futuristic stealth-spy stuff! Ars Technica Solving network congestion There are few things more frustrating than trying to use your phone on a crowded network. With phone usage growing faster than wireless spectrum, we’re all now fighting over smaller and smaller bits of bandwidth. Spectrum crunch is such a big problem that the White House is getting involved, recently announcing both a $400 million research initiative and a $4 million global competition devoted to the issue. MIT New microchip demonstrates efficiency and scalable design Princeton University researchers have developed a new computer chip that promises to boost the performance of data centers that lie at the core of numerous online services such as email and social media. The chip -- called "Piton" after the metal spikes driven by rock climbers into mountainsides to aid in their ascent — was presented Aug. 23 at Hot Chips, a symposium on high-performance chips held in Cupertino, California. Princeton Amazon's bet on Twitch was ahead of its time In 2015, Twitch viewers watched more than 459,000 years' worth of live streaming videos that mostly featured people playing video games. That amounts to 5,800 average American lifetimes spent on social interactions around games. Outsiders, including many members of the press, struggled to understand how watching gamers game could be entertaining. So when Amazon snapped up the live-streaming site Twitch two years ago, the reaction was not all positive. Backchannel The guy with the lowest possible rank in Overwatch It's possible to hit rank zero in Overwatch’s competitive mode. Dale "Bacontotem" Brown knows. He's done it. There's a caveat, though: it takes a hell of a lot of work. Overwatch's first competitive season's skill rating system graded people on wins/losses and their personal performance. Each player received a number somewhere between 1 and 100. Most players ended up between 40-50, the middle of the pack. Of course, nobody was content with their ranking. Kotaku Why China won't own next-generation manufacturing After three decades of dramatic growth, China’s manufacturing engine has largely stalled. With rising salaries, labor unrest, environmental devastation and intellectual property theft, China is no longer an attractive place for Western companies to move their manufacturing. Technology has also eliminated the labor cost advantage, so companies are looking for ways to bring their high-value manufacturing back to the United States and Europe. The Washington Post The iBrain is here Three years earlier, Apple had been the first major tech company to integrate a smart assistant into its operating system. Siri was the company’s adaptation of a standalone app it had purchased, along with the team that created it, in 2010. Initial reviews were ecstatic, but over the next few months and years, users became impatient with its shortcomings. All too often, it erroneously interpreted commands. Tweaks wouldn't fix it. Backchannel Here's the tech NBC built to stream the Olympics -- now can it replace TV? For NBC, this year’s Olympic Games coverage was more than just a series of household rating points; it was a moment of truth in a fast-changing media world. To say the network won silver in prime-time television ratings would be kind: no matter which article you read, it points out that ratings were down by double digits at different points throughout the games. To say the network took home the gold in streaming video would also be an overstatement...

OMG Digital, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 8 Shares SHARE TWEET EMAIL By: Nana Yaw Adomako | 4 Month(s) ago Atom popularly known for his hit single “Ye Wo Krom” was in the news days ago for saying that Apple paid him over $20,000 for using his song at Worldwide Developers Conference somewhere in June 2016. According to reports, the musician told Sammy Flex on Pluzz FM that he made his lawyer contact Apple after he saw on social media networks that they’ve used his song at their event without his consent. Atom said his lawyer took up the issue and eventually they got a settlement from apple in the figures between $20,000 and $50,000. The settlement he said was for using the song without contacting him first and the process took about 45 days. It looks like Atom lied about Apple paying the huge sums of money. According to Mel Kwasi Davis, boss of Events Republic, Atom deceived Ghanaians. Speaking on Happy FM, he said Atom was approached before the song was played at the event. “Bozoma Saint John came to Ghana for a vacation and was sampling some Ghanaian songs. She wanted to take some of our music to the world. It’s my cousin who is a silent partner of Events Republic who is related to Bozoma. It was Gideon, Paa John and others who help her pick a couple of songs. Later she asked for Atom’s number and so she personally handled those negotiations. Even Atom and his team didn’t know how to charge so Apple gave him an offer. Even people whose names were mentioned on that stage were compensated. This was on June 15th and only for Atom to come on radio to say Apple used his song and he demanded for compensation. Bozoma’s cousin called me and asked what was happening because of the reports he heard.” After Y3wo Krom was played on that stage, the song became the number one most downloaded song in West Africa. The plan was to pave way for Ghanaians to be on some Apple sponsored events around the world. As I sit here, I can’t say if Apple will like to deal with us anymore.” Efforts to reach the musician react to this accusation proved futile. 0 I like this post 8 Shares SHARE TWEET EMAIL Comments Related Stories 10 Repeated New Year Resolutions By Ghanaians That Bore Us To Death Now 10 Reasons Why Shatta Wale Was The Biggest Ghanaian Celebrity In 2016 32 Classic Hollywood Movies That Ghanaians From The 80’s Loved To The Max The 14 Times In 2016 Okyeame Kwame’s Family Was Cuter Than Yours So, Someone Threw An Egg At Mzbel While Performing In Belgium 21 Of Our Favorite 2016 Christmas Pictures From Ghanaian Celebrities 11 Super Cute Ghanaian Celebrity Babies Of 2016 Here Are All The 107 Songs Shatta Wale Released In 2016 Latest Stories 17 Ghanaians Share With Us The Most Important Things They Learned In 2016 By Ofori-Mensah on January 6th 2017 Lifestyle    6 27 Awkward Moments In Life That Makes Us Feel Guilty By Kwaku Darko on January 6th 2017 Lifestyle    2 Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings Looks Gorgeous AF In This Black Dress By Ofori-Mensah on January 6th 2017 Fashion    4 Here Are All The Winners From The GloCAF Awards That Honoured Africa's Best Footballers By Kwame Boakye on January 6th 2017 News 33 Ghanaians Who Find Ex-President Rawlings Snubbing Oko Vanderpuije Really Funny AF By Kwame Boakye on January 6th 2017 Entertainment    3 6 Ghanaians Who Stood Up For Ghana In 2016 By Kwaku Darko on January 5th 2017 Lifestyle    5 15 Things Ghanaians Need To Leave In 2016 By Kwaku Darko on January 5th 2017 Lifestyle    2 14 Priceless Moments Of President Mahama And Daughter Farida That Will Melt Your Heart By Ofori-Mensah on January 5th 2017 Lifestyle    35 3 Ghanaian Celebrities Who Were Honoured With Key to the City Awards In 2016 You Didn't Know By Quaci Kyei on January 5th 2017 News You've Never Seen This Old Photo Of President Mahama And Family Before By Ofori-Mensah on January 5th 2017 News    13

However, that was not the last update for iOS 9.3. Just before the public release of its next major iPhone operating system, iOS 10, which is expected in September, Apple has pushed out another version of iOS 9.3, the iOS 9.3.5. According to Apple’s release note, iOS 9.3.5 “provides an important security update for iPhone or iPad”. Although Apple has rolled out iOS 9.3.5 when iOS 10 is coming in another few days, the rollout is quite important and recommended for all users. The significance of this release is it fixes three security vulnerabilities, which were discovered by Israel-based digital arms dealers, NSO Group. iOS 9.3.5 is available for users of iPhone 4s and later, iPad 2 and later, iPod touch 5th generation and later. To download and install the update manually, head over to Settings>> General>> Software update. Click here to know about other methods to install iOS update. Apple fixed the issue almost 10 days after receiving a tip from two researchers, namely Bill Marczak and John Scott Railton, at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, and Lookout, a San Francisco mobile security company. As the security content shows, Apple has given credit to both Citizen Lab and Lookout for reporting the issue. Below is a document describing the security content of iOS 9.3.5. iOS 9.3.5 Kernel Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPad 2 and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later Impact: An application may be able to disclose kernel memory Description: A validation issue was addressed through improved input sanitisation. CVE-2016-4655: Citizen Lab and Lookout Kernel Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPad 2 and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later Impact: An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges Description: A memory corruption issue was addressed through improved memory handling. CVE-2016-4656: Citizen Lab and Lookout WebKit Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPad 2 and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: A memory corruption issue was addressed through improved memory handling. CVE-2016-4657: Citizen Lab and Lookout According to a New York Times report, the NSO Group’s software was able to read text messages, emails, track calls and contacts. The software, aimed at spying on dissidents and journalists, could even record sounds, collect passwords and trace location of iPhone users. Apple releases iOS 9.3.5 for supported iPhone, iPad and iPod touch modelsIBTimes UK While executives of the NSO Group have been claiming their spyware worked like a “ghost”, the issue actually emerged on 10 August when Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the UAE, began receiving suspicious text messages. The messages reportedly contained information about alleged torture of UAE citizens. Mansoor then passed on the messages to researchers at Citizen Lab, which then brought in Lookout to help examine the code. Citizen Lab and Lookout discovered the spyware was based on three previous iOS vulnerabilities called zero days. Zero days flaws are basically used by hackers, brokers, spy agencies and law enforcement agencies to get access to devices unofficially. Apple’s iOS 9.3.5 update patches the exploits by the NSO Group, but it is unclear whether it addresses the vulnerabilities used by the FBI, which earlier this year announced that it had paid hackers who found a method to crack an iPhoneused by the shooters in San Bernardino. According to the researchers, the NSO Group had designed its tools to impersonate Red Cross, Facebook, Federal Express, CNN, Al Jazeera, Google and Pokémon. – IBTimes Related Posts Twitter raises direct message limit to 10,000 characters MUMBAI, India -  Micro-blogging platform Twitter today said it has increased the Direct Message (DM) limit to 10,000 characters from the existing 140, enabling the users to send longer private ...

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Joke of the Week: Apple is going to Copy Samsung's Edge Smartphone Design | Main | Microsoft Keeps Embarrassing themselves Comparing a Surface Tablet to a MacBook » August 28, 2016 Microsoft Invents an All-New Digital Pen for Artists to better Compete against Apple Pencil   The original iPad Pro launched in 2015 and with it the introduced Apple Pencil which is a deadly accurate stylus that Apple describes as a precision input device which makes drawing and sketching feel remarkably fluid and natural. The touch subsystem of the Multi-Touch display in iPad Pro had been redesigned to work with Apple Pencil to dramatically reduce latency and deliver incredible accuracy for activities like fine art illustration and detailed 3D design. Advanced sensors in Apple Pencil measure both pressure and tilt for a fast and fluid drawing experience." It was much better than Microsoft's Surface pen and now Microsoft wants to up their game.   Earlier this month the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office published a Microsoft patent application that revealed their work on a future Surface tablet that will work with an all-new digital pen-brush that will provide users/artists with the ability to deform the pen-brush head to deliver varying stroke thickness and special effects. The newly designed deformable pen-brush will work with a future Surface tablet that will support a new infrared sensing system to deliver higher pen accuracy. Microsoft's deformable pen-brush is likely to work with a future version of their Fresh Paint app.   Without a doubt the war to attract artists to either the iPad Pro or Surface tablet is heating up and both Windows and iOS will be pushing the envelope with new pen (and Pencil) and tablet features to win them over. A little creative competition between platforms is certainly good news for artists.   This fall both Apple and Microsoft will be updating their respective tablets and so it'll be interesting to see what these tech titans will be bringing to the table this time around.   Apple's iPad Pro catapulted to being the number one pro tablet in short order leaving the Surface tablets in the dust. In Q2 2016 IDC reported that Apple was number one, Samsung number two while Microsoft was nowhere to be found.   For more on this detailed Patently Mobile report, click here.     Microsoft's patent FIG. 1 noted above illustrates a computing device 100 (such as a future Surface Tablet) that may be configured to present an exemplary user interface #102 associated with an electronic painting application (like Microsoft's Fresh Paint) that will be able to take advantage of an all-new digital pen-brush for artists.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.       Posted by Jack Purcher on August 28, 2016 at 12:52 PM in 6.

Home Latest News World Politics Business Technology Arts & Culture Health Videos Blogs Apple Fixes Security Flaw After UAE Dissident’s iPhone Targeted AAA January 7, 2017 Subscribe Home Latest News World Politics Business Technology Arts & Culture Health Videos Blogs Apple Fixes Security Flaw After UAE Dissident’s iPhone Targeted Reuters August 28, 2016, 4 months ago NewsTechnology 0 Apple Inc issued a patch on Thursday to fix a dangerous security flaw in iPhones and iPads after researchers discovered that a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident's phone had been targeted with a previously unknown method of hacking By Joseph Menn SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 28 – Apple Inc issued a patch on Thursday to fix a dangerous security flaw in iPhones and iPads after researchers discovered that a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident’s phone had been targeted with a previously unknown method of hacking. The thwarted attack on the human rights activist, Ahmed Mansoor, used a text message that invited him to click on a web link. Instead of clicking, he forwarded the message to researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. The hack is the first known case of software that can remotely take over a fully up-to-date iPhone 6. Experts at Citizen Lab worked with security company Lookout and determined that the link would have installed a program taking advantage of a three flaws that Apple and others were not aware of. The researchers disclosed their findings on Thursday. “Once infected, Mansoor’s phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements,” Citizen Lab wrote in a report released on Thursday. The researchers said they had alerted Apple a week and a half ago, and the company developed a fix and distributed it as an automatic update to iPhone 6 owners. Apple spokesman Fred Sainz confirmed that the company had issued the patch after being contacted by researchers. The Citizen Lab team attributed the attack software to a private seller of monitoring systems, NSO Group, an Israeli company that makes software for governments which can secretly target mobile phones and gather information. Tools such as that used in this case, a remote exploit for a current iPhone, cost as much as $1 million. NSO Chief Executive Shalev Hulio referred questions to spokesman Zamir Dahbash, who said the company “cannot confirm the specific cases” covered in the Citizen Lab and Lookout reports. Dahbash said NSO sells within export laws to government agencies, which then operate the software. “The agreements signed with the company’s customers require that the company’s products only be used in a lawful manner,” he added. “Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes.” Dahbash did not answer follow-up questions, including whether the exposure of the tools use against Mansoor in UAE and a Mexican journalist would end any sales to those countries. NSO has kept a low profile in the security world, despite its 2014 sale of a majority stake for $120 million to California private equity firm Francisco Partners. That company’s chief executive, Dipanjan Deb, did not return a call on Thursday. In November 2015, Reuters reported that NSO had begun calling itself “Q” and was looking for a buyer for close to $1 billion. Sarah McKune, senior legal adviser to Citizen Lab, said Israel tries to follow the strictures of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which puts controls on the international sale of nuclear and chemical weapons technology and more recently cyber intrusion tools. NSO may have had to apply for an export license, she added, saying that raised questions about “what consideration was given to the human rights record of UAE.” The Israeli embassy in Washington did not respond to an email seeking comment. NSO marketing material says that it also has capabilities for Android and BlackBerry devices. No version of the software has been exposed, indicating it remains effective. Citizen Lab did not directly accuse UAE of carrying out the attack on Mansoor with NSO gear called Pegasus, but it said other NSO attacks on critics of the regime were connected to the government. It also said a Mexican journalist and a minority party politician in Kenya had been targeted with NSO software and that domain names set up for other attacks referred to entities in Uzbekistan, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and other nations, suggesting that other targets lived in those nations. A call to the UAE embassy in Washington was not immediately returned. The market for “lawful intercept,” or government hacking tools, has come under increased scrutiny with revelations about authoritarian customers and noncriminal victims. Two popular vendors, Hacking Team of Italy and Gamma Group of the United Kingdom, have had their wares exposed by researchers or hackers. Mansoor had previously been targeted with software from both of those companies, according to Citizen Lab. “I can’t think of a more compelling case of serial misuse of lawful intercept malware than the targeting of Mansoor,” said one of the Citizen Lab researchers, John Scott-Railton.

However, there will be no major rethinking on its design, but we may see so with the iPhone 8. Several credible sources and various leaks points the iPhone 7 will closely resemble iPhone 6 and 6s. So, those enthusiasts who are waiting for the reshaping of the phones are suggested to wait for Apple’s 2017 iPhone. It will be an incredibly intriguing device. One of the latest reports related to the iPhone design change Bloomberg writes the iPhone 8 may not come with a mechanical home button. The report writes, “Apple is already at work on a major redesign of the iPhone for 2017… [One] that focuses more heavily on the display by removing the Home button, according to a person familiar with the matter.” Bloomberg didn’t cite any reliable source, but indicates toward previous sources claiming the home button will be integrated into the display. It will be rested atop of a series of touch-sensitive sensors and with a press it will vibrate. The report adds vibration will offer illusion and sensation to users gesturing it can be depressed when completely stationary. The idea may be far-fetched, but same has been implemented on the trackpads of MacBooks. Share This! Tags: apple iphone 8 Loading...

Some consider it blasphemy, while others doubt it’s possible — but it can be done. What’s a ‘Home’ button anyway? When you really consider the interaction you have with the Home button, it comes down to this: a firm press. Get the latest CES 2017 news TNW is at CES 2017! Get the low-down on the latest and most insane tech being showcased in Las Vegas. Feed me tech You’re essentially pressing down firmly on a piece of hardware in the iPhone that has limited purpose — it either gets you back to the home screen or wakes your phone. It’s actually that simple, too. Why would Apple do this? According to the most recent reports, Apple wants to make a larger screen that eliminates some bezel while keeping the same overall footprint. Bigger screens are better, at least to a point. And if Apple can squeeze in an extra 0.2-inches, that’s a good thing. Home button hardware is also consumptive. Internally, iPhones have very limited space, so ditching the mechanism for a Home button would leave more room for… whatever Apple decides should go there (a bigger battery, maybe?). But what about Touch ID? The Home button was widely considered pretty bland until Touch ID came along and gave it purpose. Their fates were intertwined, at least until now. Sonavation has pioneered a way to slip fingerprint sensors beneath the surface of a touchscreen. At the time it was announced, I wrote it could mean the end to your Home button. Turns out I might have called Apple’s shot (no wonder it won’t return my calls). If it can be done to scale, Sonavation’s technology would eliminate the need for Touch ID hardware on your phone. Even if sensors were positioned in the same area as Touch ID is now, the hardware can go away. So how would it work? Let’s re-visit our Home button idea again: it’s just a firm press. Apple recently introduced 3D Touch for iPhones, which offers the same thing as the Home button, only more contextual and without the need for dedicated hardware. I use 3D Touch most often on Twitter; a slightly firm press opens up a preview of a link, while a touch harder opens the article or video up full-screen. Apple would only need to bring 3D Touch to non-critical areas of the screen to make this non-Home button iPhone a reality. Those sensors on the bezel of your phone could do the exact same thing as the Home button already does while you’re in an app. And the haptic feedback engine would be able to provide tactile feedback for you so you know the harder press registered. Such a technology would also allow Apple to code in things like palm rejection; if you happen to mash a Home button, it probably sends you back to the home screen. I’ve hit it more than once while trying to capture a photo or video, ruining the moment. Developers needn’t worry, either On the code level, nothing really changes. Touch ID is still an API, and the Home button can’t be accessed anyway. Apple’s possible change means very little to third-party developers; it’s all on the mothership to make things work. I’d assume Apple would house both the faux-Home button and Touch ID sensors in the lower bezel, possible across the entire bottom bar. Again, nothing changes; 3D Touch still applies to the screen proper, and all APIs are accessible. If there is a change, I’d expect Apple to make the ‘home’ function more extensible. A firm press may open up a menu, much like we see with app icons. From there, a quick hold might just navigate you to the home screen, while a longer press could offer to send you to recently used apps, settings or a menu of your favorite apps. It may also open up Siri. Excited yet? It’s a lofty goal for 2017, but many think Apple will go all-out for the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. As odd as it sounds, I can’t think of a better way to turn a corner than by eliminating dedicated hardware. The Home button and Touch ID hardware have carried us a long way, but if Apple says its time for them to go… I’ll be looking forward to what’s next.

Don’t buy cases (okay, maybe one or two if you’re sure about the iPhone 7). Or accessories. Definitely don’t buy cables. Get the latest CES 2017 news TNW is at CES 2017! Get the low-down on the latest and most insane tech being showcased in Las Vegas. Feed me tech Why? USB-C. With the MacBook, Apple started its slow changeover to USB-C. There’s even a USB-C to Lightning cable, which I once posited (correctly, it seems) was a harbinger of things to come. The new MacBook Pros, which are long overdue, are also rumored to go the USB-C route. If that’s accurate, and we’d have to believe it is, it changes quite a bit for the average consumer. At that point, Apple is basically turning its entire ecosystem over to USB-C and Lightning. It’s awesome — I’m excited. But I still caution everyone not to buy anything Apple-related yet. Apple switching to USB-C probably affects everything Accessory makers have also been slowly migrating to USB-C connectivity. Aukey, which makes great battery packs and other accessories (the best around, in my view), has been switching to USB-C for some time, marketing their stuff to Android device owners. But that means nothing to iPhone and iPad users; Apple’s own USB-C to Lightning cable is seen as a niche product for MacBook owners, but it’s really the future. Once Apple goes all-in on USB-C with new portable computer hardware, expect it to also change its chargers and such to USB-C — again, just like the MacBook. The incoming iPhones will probably utilize USB-C to Lightning connectivity for chargers, too. From there, we should expect peripheral manufacturers to ease away (or run) from the ‘standard’ USB connection. This applies to every one of us. Even if you don’t think you’ll be upgrading your phone for a year or so, buying peripherals or cables is a short-term bet that just won’t pay off; don’t do it unless it’s critical. That’s not to say everything will stop working once USB-C is the standard, but finding quality USB stuff will be harder. Just save a few bucks and bide your time Apple is expected to announce new iPhones on September 7, and have them in stores a week or so later. If you’re planning to upgrade, sit tight on accessorizing — especially when it comes to wired earbuds. This is especially true if you’re also planning to buy a new MacBook Pro. Unless you want to tote around a bunch of cables with disparate connection points, just chill out for a bit. In six months’ time, everything you want will be USB-C. Excited as we may be for what’s next, remember that Apple sets the tone, and some companies need a bit of time  — but once Apple makes a change, they usually scramble to catch up.

I didn’t speak the language and had never been to Asia. Starting the next day I would have the services of a local translator, but for that first night, I was on my own. Normally I use Google services for everything, but those are blocked in China. I opened my iPhone, connected to an international Mifi, and tapped the Uber app. The interface alerted me that I would be switching to the Chinese version, controlled now by Uber’s rival-turned-business-partner Didi. The black screen turned a deep shade of red, and just like that, I hailed a cab. My chat app also provided instantaneous translation I used Apple Maps to locate the apartment we had reserved through Airbnb. Then I found the same spot on the map in Uber, which automatically translated the location into Chinese. I showed that to the driver, and off we went. When I arrived at the apartment building I was met by our hostess. She spoke only a few words of English (better than my Chinese), but not enough for us to really converse. Luckily we both had WeChat. The app opens up with a solitary figure standing on the moon, staring down at Earth from afar: a fitting image for a traveler in another world. My landlord would type something to me on WeChat and I would tap it, translating her characters to English. She did the same with my Western alphabet. A little notice popped up under the translation: "✓ Microsoft Translator." You can do almost anything with a WeChat account The next morning I woke up at the crack of dawn, my body exhausted but still on New York time. I used Apple Maps to locate a nearby Starbucks. I walked over, but the shop didn’t open for another half an hour. Luckily there was a McDonald's next door, bustling with dozens of Chinese customers. It occurred to me that retail franchises are in many ways like apps. They are built on a very specific code, so that anyone can easily plug and play. The merchant gets all the rules for opening up shop and servicing customers. The consumer knows exactly what buttons to press to get their order. The kiosk inside the McDonald's let me order in English, and the Veriphone terminal there accepted Apple Pay. Twelve hours into my trip I had navigated through the city, taken a taxi, ordered a meal, and not spoken a word to anyone. Later on I discovered a translation app from Baidu that felt like magic. I could scan text and have it translated, speak a sentence and get an audio file of it Chinese, or even take a picture of any object — a cup, key, or umbrella — and the app would use image recognition to understand what the object was and provide me with the corresponding Chinese word. It felt like we were just a few years from having a true Star Trek-style universal translator. I was traveling the world, but still not leaving my smartphone screen If I had been smart enough to register my WeChat account through Hong Kong, either by flying into that airport or using a VPN when creating my account, I could have loaded my bank account and credit card into the service. From there, an enormous array of possibilities open up for navigating the world by app. WeChat, created by Tencent, seemed to be far and away the dominant service in Shenzhen. Every vendor, including supermarkets, restaurants, taxi cabs, and even small fruit stands on the street, accepted payment through WeChat. You opened up a QR code, the merchant scanned it with their phone, and money magically exchanged hands. WeChat would also let me buy a railway or movie ticket, book a hotel room, pay a utility or phone bill, even make an appointment at a doctor, and many other little exchanges that in the past would have required me to struggle through a bilingual interaction or lean on a translator. With a working WeChat wallet, it seemed possible to navigate the entire country through a QR code. There is a dark side to the ease of apps But there's a dark side to a single app that serves as the key to all things. When I went to purchase a local SIM card for my phone at China Telecom, it would only accept payment by WeChat, not card or cash. Our translator speculated that this was part of the government’s effort to carefully track the flow of information. They had recently eliminated the ability to buy prepaid burner-type packages, and customers can't start an account with cash. And while my smartphone unlocked some things for me, I missed out on dozens of interactions with actual people. It’s comforting to be in a cab ride home and whip out your phone to play a round of your favorite mobile game, but it comes at the expense of the memories you might make with your limited stay on the other side of the globe. Apps allow me to adventure further That’s the glass half-empty version. A more optimistic take is that eliminating the little struggles allows me to make more of my trip, to push further than I would if I was bogged-down on everyday transactions. I made plans one evening to meet up with a cousin who recently began working for a startup in Shenzhen. The Chinese SIM card I bought ended up malfunctioning in my Western smartphone, and so I had to fall back on my MiFi, WeChat, and Apple Maps to locate my cousin that night. Even with his fluent Chinese we had a hard time catching a cab during rush hour, so I called us an Uber instead. The time I saved with my smartphone that night extended our adventure. He took me into Baishizou, a neighborhood separate from the modern city, controlled by a council of elders instead of the municipal government. It’s the last vestige of the rural fishing village that was Shenzhen 30 years ago, before it became megalopolis of 20 million people packed into high-rise towers. Still in touch with the wider world Wandering down a dim back alley, we had to duck our heads under the low-hanging bundles of exposed power lines that snaked in and out of windows. Through an open door we saw a group of migrant laborers squatting around a poker game. A cloud of cigarette smoke drifted toward the ceiling, pooling above the bunk beds where men were sleeping three deep and six high. We ate at MuWu, a restaurant founded by Barack Obama’s half brother, a Kenyan man who married a Taiwanese woman and started a chain of Chinese-style barbecue joints. As we settled in for a six-course meal, I checked in on Foursquare, creating a digital diary of my trip I’ll treasure. Because I had synced my Foursquare with Twitter and Facebook before I left, my Foursquare activity snuck past the Great Firewall, broadcasting my experience around the world.

Close share panel Image caption Colin Hehir said his son's artwork, seen behind him, was stored on the laptop A father has called on MPs to help force computer giant Apple to unlock his murdered son's laptop. Morgan Hehir, 20, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, was stabbed with a steak knife in the street on 31 October last year. Three men were jailed in June. His father Colin said last month that Apple told him he must obtain a court order to access his son's artwork. He said he wants Parliament to discuss Apple's terms and conditions. "I do want to push this to Parliament because I believe the terms and conditions are unfair," he said. Image copyright Warwickshire Police Image caption Morgan Hehir was an artist and a musician Mr Hehir said he had been contacted by other bereaved families who have encountered the same problem, not just with Apple. "If we have probate, you should be allowed access. Simple as that." He said his son was a painter and a musician, who stored his work on the laptop, which he wanted to see. He described his son as a "contributor to the community" and said he and the family would not have been able to cope following the killing had it not been for the help of friends within that community. A music and arts festival, organised by friends and family, was held in Nuneaton on Saturday in Morgan's memory. Apple has said that due to the absence of permission for third party access to the account, "it is impossible to be certain what access the user would have wanted and we do not consider it is appropriate that Apple make the decision". It advised the family to obtain a court order, adding that the company recognised the "extremely difficult" situation.

X Seen & Heard: Spend Apple tax windfall on health, says Minister Zenith exit linked to row over access to insurance industry database Sun, Aug 28, 2016, 18:38 Eoin Burke-Kennedy Minister of State for Training and Skills John Halligan: “If Apple owes taxes to the State they should pay them and that’s it.” Photographer: Dara Mac Dónaill         The unwanted tax bonanza that may flow to Ireland from a ruling against Apple in Brussels should be used to fixed the health service and build houses, Minister of State for Training and Skills John Halligan has told the Sunday Independent. The Independent Alliance Minister of State said no company should able “to hold the country to ransom” and “if Apple owes taxes to the State they should pay them and that’s it”. Minister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath echoed Mr Halligan’s view. The European Commission’s ruling on whether Ireland’s tax deal with breached state-aid rules is expected this week. Brussels is widely expected to find that illegal state aid was given to Apple. Zenith exit linked to fraud data access A dispute over access to a new industry database was partly responsible for Zenith Insurance’s decision to exit the Irish motor cover market, according to the Sunday Times. The Gibraltar-based insurer is to stop offering car coverage here from February, citing soaring claims costs in a loss-making market. Zenith has sought membership of Insurance Ireland, the umbrella group for the industry, but could not reach agreement about access to a database containnig information about drivers’ penalty points and no-claims bonuses. The database was established to identify fraudulent and incorrect information. Among other issues, Zenith is believed to have baulked at the cost it would have to pay to use the database, which was developed jointly by rival insurance firms, the paper said. Vulture funds turn up heat on SMEs According to the Sunday Business Post, the rate at which vulture funds are moving in to seize or sell assets held by small businesses has doubled this year. An analysis of enforcement orders by the newspaper indicates that a handful of funds were behind 20 per cent of the total in the last eight months of 2015. However, that rate jumped to 43 per cent in the first eight months of 2016. ADVERTISEMENT The paper cites an expert who says US private-equity firms are likely to accelerate their enforcement activity even more in the coming months as they look to cash out of the Irish market in the shortest time possible. Billionaire snaps up Ex-Quinlan French Riviera bolthole Kazakhstan’s richest man, not Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen’s comic alter ego) but Bulat Utemuratov has emerged as the €65 million buyer of a lavish French Riviera house once owned by Dublin financier Derek Quinlan. Quinlan sold the Cap Ferrat mansion, known as Villa La Carriere, in 2011 to a French limited company, according to a story in the Sunday Business Post. The paper noted that funds from the sale went to Barclays Bank, which was repaid in full by Quinlan. Utemuratov, a former economics teacher, made his fortune from mining, banking, property and private equity. He is a friend and adviser to Kazakhstan’s long-time president Nursultan Nazarbaev.       Topics: Derek Quinlan Eoin Burke Kennedy Finian Mcgrath John Halligan Nursultan Nazarbaev Sacha Baron Cohen Aston Villa F.C.

Spotify hasn’t really been focusing on exclusives which is why the strategy appears to be working for its rivals. A report has been published which suggests that Spotify is punishing artists who provide exclusives to Apple Music and Tidal by burying their music in its search results. Spotify has responded to the accusations. The report in Bloomberg quoted anonymous sources as saying that Spotify is burying music from artists that are providing exclusives to rivals. Spotify says that this accusation is “unequivocally false.” It wouldn’t make sense for Spotify to bury music from the likes of Drake and Kanye West – both of them have exclusively released new music on Apple Music and Tidal before bringing to Spotify – but its subscribers certainly wouldn’t like if they were not able to find the music they want to listen, particularly when they are paying the company for a premium subscription. Spotify hasn’t responded to another claim made in other reports including one from the New York Times that it’s not going out of its way to promote new releases from artists that are providing exclusives to its rivals. Now that seems plausible given that Spotify would want to signal to artists that they shouldn’t be giving exclusive releases to one particular streaming service against incentives like marketing support, cash, and perhaps even equity. Whether or not artists will listen is an entirely different matter. Filed in General. Read more about apple music, Spotify and tidal.

Lauren DucaAug 28, 2016 1:31PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestGetty Images A new Business Insider interview with a man called only "Brad" reveals the fascinating life of an Apple intern, making about $7000 per month, and being forced to keep their jobs totally secret. According to Brad, Apple interns earn $38 per hour, which averages out to $6,700 per month. They also get bonuses for working more than 40 hours a week, and double pay for working more than 60. Oh, and there's free housing in the Bay Area, but if you don't feel like bunking with an Apple-intern roommate, the company will shell out $1000 for Rent. Seriously. Perhaps the one caveat is that you can't really brag about any of it. "They want to be able to release a product that everyone's happy about but no one knew about before," Brad said. "You can't tell anyone anything about your job," he said. "You can't tell people outside of your family what you're working on." "Everything is totally locked down," he added. "There's no taking pictures on campus; it's super crazy." Head over to Business Insider for more details, and then check out our top ten tips from past Teen Vogue interns, a position which is not quite held to the same level of secrecy.

The Government are now scrambling to find ways to lessen the impact from a European Commission investigation into an alleged Apple sweetheart tax deal as they try to halt the EC imposing a €1 billion fine on the State. A critical Brussels judgement on Ireland’s tax deal with Apple is expected in the coming days and Apple could be forced to hand over up to €19billion in back taxes. With the Government preparing for an unfavourable ruling ministers are now trying to ensure the fine is kept in the ‘low hundreds of millions’ the Sunday Business Post has revealed. The Government has said it did not give any preferential treatment to Apple and it is claimed the Government will use the European courts to appeal the ruling made by EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. Last month Finance Minister Michael Noonan met Ms Vestager to insist that no sweetheart Apple deal was done. It has been claimed the investigation will damage Ireland’s reputation just three years after the country was described as a tax haven when Apple were permitted to pay no tax on profits of €66million. The State is insisting, despite the European Commission investigation, that Apple and the Revenue Commissioners did not have a special deal in place. Ireland’s corporation tax stance will also be defended and it will be argued that a so-called “double Irish” programme which enabled multinationals to feed tax free money through the country has been abolished. Meanwhile, Independent Alliance Junior Minister John Halligan has said Ireland should not be held to ransom by Apple and any taxes owed by the company should be used to repair the health service and build houses. The Waterford native acknowledged that multinational companies bring jobs to the country but he said any taxes owed by Apple should be paid to the State. “If Apple owes taxes to the State, they should pay them and that’s it,” he said. “Everyone should pay their taxes, full stop”. Fine Gael senior figures are said to be worried by the EU judgement, which they believe could tarnish Ireland’s international reputation, according to reports. The Brussels allegations surrounding Ireland and Apple claim that Ireland and apple struck a 1990s deal, which allowed the company to bring thousands of jobs to the country in exchange for a favourable tax deal. The EU Commission has alleged the agreement was in breach of international rules and that equated to the State granting the company illegal State aid. The American company has strenuously denied any suggestions that it reached an improper deal with the Irish Government over taxes.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple Watch 2 could offer a few hours of additional run time via a stronger 334 mAh battery By Christian Zibreg, Aug 28, 2016 Tweet 20 Comments Prolific leakster @The_Malignant today republished a pair of claimed images of a purported battery pack believed to have been designed for a 42mm second-generation Apple Watch. Originally posted by an unnamed source on the Chinese social network Weibo, the tiny battery shows an increased capacity of 334 mAh. By comparison, the original Apple Watch is outfitted with a 245 mAh battery (42mm version) so it’s entirely conceivable that the Apple Watch 2 could offer a few hours of additional battery life—assuming the leaked photo is genuine. As mentioned, the original Apple Watch draws power from its battery pack rated at 0.94 Wh and 246 mAh. The claimed Apple Watch 2 battery seen top of post is rated 1.28Wh and 334 mAh. That works out to a capacity increase of a little more than 35 percent, potentially giving the Apple Watch 2 a few hours of additional battery life. There are other factors at play here. The Wall Street Journal recently claimed that the second-generation Apple Watch would feature embedded cellular connectivity, but a report from Bloomberg poured cold water on that rumor, saying battery concerns and other technological limitations prompted Apple engineers to delay a cellular-enabled edition of the wearable gadget. “Apple executives expressed concern that the cellular models may not be ready for release this year and that the feature may be pushed back to a later generation,” said Bloomberg’s sources. Apple Watch battery photo courtesy iFixit. The Apple Watch 2 is also believed to ship with a built-in GPS module. Now, we know from past experience that GPS is a battery hog so it’s plausible that a more powerful battery may not actually result in a longer run time for the second-generation Apple Watch. The Apple Watch’s ‘S2’ processor is said to be fabricated on TSMC’s 16-nanometer process technology versus the 28-nanometer, Samsung-built ‘S1’ found in the original model. That’s good news because TSMC’s technology should yield a smaller, faster chip that consumes less power than its predecessor. Other rumored features of the Apple Watch 2 include a thinner, lighter display assembly (though screen resolution apparently won’t change), better waterproofing enabling it to track swimming, a built-in FaceTime camera and more. Various supply chain sources have indicated that the device should release in September or October. Source: The Malignant via WatchGeneration.fr (Google Translate) Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Apple Watch 2’s larger battery shouldn’t make the device any thicker Apple Watch 2’s thinner screen & larger battery allegedly caught on video Battery concerns reportedly delay cellular-enabled Apple Watch 2 DigiTimes: TSMC to build 16nm Apple Watch 2 chip Related Topics Apple, Apple Watch, Apple Watch 2, Battery, Leaks, News, Rumors John Wickham Of all Apple’s products, the Watch is not one that has battery life issues. If they’re including a stronger battery, they’re definitely adding some new power-hungry capability. pnh Until it can go 3-5 days like a Fitbit and be able to be worn at night to track sleep instead of charge, it has battery issues. Rowan09 The Fitbit doesn’t do nearly as much so it’s not a good comparison. Battery issues is not really an issue as stated, of course battery life can always be better. askep3 +1 askep3 Nah, fitbits useless for all the non fitness features. For most people I think the Apple Watch is primarily a notification, fashion, and app device, instead of a fitness device. Why buy a $350+ device when you can get one for less than half for fitness. BUT I completely agree with you on the sleep tracking, it can already charge pretty quickly, so after you wake up you can put it on the charger, but sleep tracking would be great. Otherwise I don’t see why everyone is hating on the battery life and demanding 3-5 days, ofc it would be great, but charging it alongside your phone doesn’t seem like such a problem. mrgerbik pebble is a better comparison and yes people, it has battery issues eXoguti097 GPS, maybe. Those who won’t use GPS will see the biggest battery improvements. askep3 Yeah, if I get one I’m gonna turn of the gps right away, I’ll have My phone with me all the time, don’t need gps to waste battery. I hope they just make a cheaper one without the gps but with everything else, cuz it’s useless for a lot of people Lit GPS is not useless at all. It was what people demanded because without it, you can’t use the watch alone. askep3 As I already said, I, and most other users of the watch will have their phone with them when using it, for the small amount of people who use it without their phone, maybe for fitness, the gps would be useful, but otherwise I don’t think there’s any other reason to have a gps. I’m pretty sure when it’s with the phone it turns of one of the gps to save battery. And how can you not use the watch without gps, the current one doesn’t have one DD™ Looking forward to this watch. I’m in this time around. askep3 Same, so many of my friends just got one, cuz of the sales, but in just like why get the new one that’s prob coming out in like 3 weeks Martynet Doesn’t really matter cos I charge my apple watch every night. And when I go to bed, I still have around 55% battery left. One time I forgot to charge them and managed to go through 2 days 🙂 Leslie B Yup. Same here. Besides, isn’t that Apple design genius, Jony Ive, concerned about ruining the user experience with a better battery like he is with the iPhone? Maybe Apple could invent a case or strap with a big ugly bulge on it like the iPhone case. Martynet And of course, if there is a GPS and cellular, bigger battery makes sense. Mike M. Powell The watch already has an unbelieve battery span like others said, increasing it means they adding something crazy like gps. Should use this battery tech on the iPhones doe .-. mrgerbik ‘unbelievable battery span’ – rofl unbelievably short Mike M. Powell Well idk whats wrong with urs bro Jamessmooth That’s a little disappointing, as I was hoping for more than a day. I have the Apple Watch, and I can’t live without it so I’ll most likely upgrade. My friends and family have FitBits, and three of them have had to return for a replacement within a year of purchase because it broke, so that’s not an option. Tommy Gumbs I am a Professor and I travel the world. I love my Apple watch. I have only ever had it die on me a few times. I usually get almost 2 days out of my watch, but can depend. Never more than 2 day’s though. I will def get the second version when it is released, but I don’t see that happening in September.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Apple’s free app of the week: Lifeline: Whiteout Daily Deals: $50 off Nest thermostat, $90 off iPhone SE, and more iOS 10 adoption rate now at 76% The W3 Stand turns your Apple Watch into a vintage Macintosh Report: next iPhone to feature Tap to Wake and fast charging   The latest jailbreak news NoTodayView disables the Spotlight widget page on the Home and Lock screens AntennaGIFDL lets you download GIFs from the Antenna Reddit client app CasualAlarm uses random songs from your music library for alarm sounds Hide or show your Home screen dock on demand with ShyDock Let’s Talk Jailbreak 157: All about the iOS 10 jailbreak and Prometheus iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

There are rumors that the company will launch the next gen iPhone in three variants–iPhone 7, 7 Plus and Pro. Although some reports claim that Apple has cancelled the Pro model, latest reports claim that the company will launch it along with the other two variants. Recently, London-based customisation company Goldgenie, has launched pre-orders for a Gold iPhone 7 Collection in Dubai. This modified Gold edition is available in eight variants including the Pro model. The image posted on the Goldgenie website shows a gold plated iPhone 7 Pro with dual-camera and Smart Connectors. The 24K gold plated smartphone will cost ?2,597, around $3,500. The so-called Smart Connector is clearly visible on the back of the device. This trio magnetic connector will be used for wireless charging, data transfer and connecting accessories. Interested customers can book this premium device on Goldgenie and have to pay half of its price in advance. iPhone 7 Pro 24K Gold:Image Goldgenie The modified device is identical to the rumored iPhone 7 Pro. The device will be available with 64 and 128GB onboard storage. Goldgenie is offering free Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic and Lightning to USB Cable with the premium device. This is a confirmation of the lightning port in the upcoming iPhone 7. However, the image does not show the second speaker grill. The device will be fitted with a 5.5-inch display. Although the customisation company hasn’t confirmed other specs in details, rumors have it that the device will be powered by the Apple A10 chipset with 3GB of RAM. The device will roll out with pre-installed iOS 10 that is currently in beta testing mode. Apple will most probably launch the device along with its latest OS for mobile devices. iPhone 7 with dual-camera Photo courtesy of Mydrivers Apple could upgrade the battery component in the upcoming smartphone. The device will be fitted with 1,960mAh battery as compared to the 1,715mAh cell in the iPhone 6. Moreover, the new processor will also improve the battery life. The new handset is expected to feature touch sensitive home button. Apple has a patent for this technology and can finally introduce it in its upcoming smartphone.

Oh sure, there are daily stressors that come with the territory, but so does a lopsided compensation package. Apple CEO Tim Cook knows this better than most. As part of a predetermined plan, Cook last week sold a chunk of Apple shares worth $36 million. Sure beats working overtime for a few extra bucks, doesn't it? Normally when a high ranking official cashes in on company shares worth tens of millions of dollars, questions are raised about the health of the firm. That's especially true when it's the top dog shedding company stock. In this case, the timing of Cook's sell-off came just weeks after Apple reported positive quarterly results. Share of Apple have risen 11 percent since the announcement on July 26, hitting a high of nearly $108 per share on Friday. Prior to its upbeat quarter, Apple shares had been trending below $100 for several months, hitting a low around $90 in mid-May. The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) isn't likely to bat an eye over the sale because this was a predetermined sale as part of what's called rule 10b5-1. "Rule 10b5-1 is established by the SEC to allow insiders of publicly traded corporations to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own. Rule 10b5-1 allows major holders to sell a predetermined number of shares at a predetermined time. Many corporate executives use 10b5-1 plans to avoid accusations of insider trading," Investopedia explains. Had the share price of Apple dropped for any reason, Cook still would have sold 334,000 shares last week, he just would have made less. Fortunately for Cook, Apple shares have been on an upswing in recent weeks, and he benefited from it. Cook's been at the helm of Apple for five years now. His fifth anniversary as CEO allowed him to convert 1.26 million restricted stock units he'd been previously awarded to common shares worth in the neighborhood of $135 million. While some may question whether or not Cook is deserving of such a lucrative payday, his performance since taking over the leadership role from Steve Jobs has been pretty good. Revenue is almost twice as high as it was five years, and he's more than doubled Apple's profit.

Best Buy will exclusively offer the smartphones online and in its retail stores.  ( Samsung ) Advertisement Samsung announced it would release a Pink Gold color option for the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge back in April. The company has announced the brightly colored smartphones are now available from Best Buy. When Apple unveiled the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, it also introduced a new color option for its flagship smartphone duo. Rose Gold quickly became the most in-demand color choice when the smartphones went on sale. Part of its appeal was instantly recognizable, as it was only available as a choice for Apple's latest iPhone, allowing users to quietly brag they had the latest and greatest. This wasn't a new play from Apple, as it made the same move with the Gold iPhone 5s in 2013 and it's expected to repeat adding a new color when it launches the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in a Space Black color choice that will be exclusive to the next-generation iPhones. Samsung has also put focus on adding new color options. Its just released Galaxy Note 7, which is available in a new Blue Coral color, is currently sold out and new customers face up to a 3-week wait for the phablet. Samsung followed in Apple's Rose Gold footsteps when it announced the Pink Gold Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge in April but the color choice has not been available to customers in the United States, until now. If you've been holding out purchasing a Samsung Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge because you desired the Pink Gold hue, the company has announced that Best Buy will be the exclusive seller of the color option. Best Buy is now offering the Pink Gold Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge with 32 GB of internal storage. The retailer is only selling AT&T, Verizon and Sprint variants of both smartphones, sorry T-Mobile customers. The Samsung Galaxy S7 features a 5.1-inch 2560 x 1440 Quad HD display, while the Galaxy S7 edge packs in a 5.5-inch dual curved edge screen with the same resolution. The handsets include the same specs: Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal storage and microSD expansion slot. The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge boast 12-megapixel rear cameras and a 5-megapixel front-facing snapper. The handsets feature a premium glass and metal design with wireless charging built in and its cases are also waterproof and dust resistant. The Galaxy S7 includes a 3,000 mAh battery, while the S7 edge packs in a larger 3,600 mAh battery.

McIntyre August 28, 2016 9:08 am EST Print Email Tweet As analysts, Wall Street and consumers struggle to guess the features and price of the new Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), a few press outlets believe they have captured the features of the iPhone 8. Because of Apple’s dilemmas of constant advances in technology from Samsung and other Android based phone-makers, Apple cannot wait another year or more to introduce an iPhone 8, no matter how revolutionary the product may be. Apple’s shares have been rocked by mediocre earnings. Sales in China, which Apple’s management claims are essential to its success according to its management, have faltered. By some estimates, its market share in the world’s most populous nation has fallen to fifth place. The iPhone 7 is supposed to help Apple sell 70 million units during the holiday season. Anything shy of that likely would collapse Apple shares. There is a chance that Apple’s recovery gamble will be pushed out in time until it releases its iPhone 8. The following are some forecasts of sales, and descriptions of features. BRG writes: Apple of course isn’t getting rid of the iPhone’s tried and true home button for no good reason. Reports of an embedded home button dovetail nicely with previous claims that the iPhone 8 will feature an edge to edge display. What’s more, there are also rumblings that Apple with the iPhone 8 will introduce a third iPhone model with a curved OLED display. At this point, though, it remains unclear if every iPhone 8 model will be graced with an edgeless display or if it will be a feature reserved solely for what will presumably be a Pro model. According to MacRumors: 2017 will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone and Apple has something major planned to celebrate the occasion. We’re more than a year away from the launch of the iPhone 8, but because of Apple’s ambitious plans for the device, there are already an abundance of rumors hinting at the impressive features coming in the 2017 iPhone. Rumors suggest it’s going to be a radical redesign, with an edge-to-edge display that does away with the top and bottom bezels where features like the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and the front-facing camera are housed. Instead, Touch ID and the camera may be built directly into the display, meaning there will be no Home button. Jony Ive has wanted to introduce an iPhone that looks like a single sheet of glass for several years, and 2017 may be the year that it’s possible. Ive is Apple’s long-time design chief and an old “partner” with Steve Jobs. No matter how compelling the iPhone 8 rumors are, if the smartphone is over a year away, buyers may leave for products from Samsung. Apple is unlikely to get them back.

Photo: Getty Anthony Colangelo Twitter: @anthcolangelo Share Tweet Share Reddit Pin EmailComment Days after Apple urged iPhone and iPad users to update their iOS software following a spyware attack, rumours are firming of a September 7 launch date for the iPhone 7. The tech giant is expected to hold its annual September gala event on the 7th, where the newest iPhone will be revealed, Forbes reported. Apple has been notoriously secretive about the specifications of the new phone, but for the best part of 18 months small details have been trickling out about the handset. Two of the biggest changes that tech insiders expect to see on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are a larger camera (dual lens on the 7 Plus), and the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack. Related Coverage Apple iPhone hack raises fears about mysterious cyber weapon company How to save big bucks on your phone plan The Forbes report claimed that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus would be available to pre-order on September 9. Tech release date expert Evan Blass said he was “very confident” the new phone would be available from retailers across the world on September 12. Other reports said that date would be September 23. On Friday (AEST), Apple showed it was doing everything it could to ward off cyber attacks, when a phone in the United Arab Emirates was breached by a sophisticated cyber weapon made by a private Israeli firm. iPhone 6 vs rumoured iPhone 7 What to expect? The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will look quite similar to its predecessor at a glance. Changes are expected however. The grey antenna strip which sits across the middle of the phone will go around its edges on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 camera will have a much larger diameter and the 7 Plus will have a dual lens. It has been rumoured that this means the 7 Plus would have an optical zoom camera, but this was unconfirmed. The iPhone 7, on top of the iPhone 6, has no 3.5mm headphone jack. Photo: Weibo Photos of handsets thought to be of the new phones also had no 3.5mm headphone jacks. Instead the charging port would double as a headphone jack. The iPhone 7 would most likely have better battery life, but it was unknown if this would apply to the 7 Plus. Purportedly leaked photos also showed no mute button on either of the handsets. This means that users cannot toggle between silent and loud modes from the button on the edge of the handset. There will be no 16GB version of the iPhone 7, tech reporter Joanna Stern from the Wall Street Journal confirmed. The dual camera on the iPhone 7 Plus. Photo: Weibo Alleged pricing specs leaked on Weibo suggested Apple would move to 32GB, 64GB, and 256GB storage options for the iPhone 7 and 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB for iPhone 7 Plus. Apple may also scrap the push-in home button in favour of a home button which uses “Force Touch” technology, according to a Cowen and Company analysis. Tech website Pocket Lint also claimed that Apple would unveil its new iOS 10 software, Macbook Pro and iPad Pro at the September 7 event. There was also speculation about whether there would be more Apple mobiles other than the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but detail of this could not be confirmed.

According to Forbes, you will be able to preorder the iPhone on September 9 and the phone will be released officially on Friday, September 16, 2016, according to credible phone leaker Evan Blass. Taiwan celeb Jimmy Lin spotted with unreleased iPhone 7 Plus https://t.co/qSiwizvNvw pic.twitter.com/9sVyU3hXZa — AsiaOne (@sphasiaone) August 24, 2016 So, here is what you can expect in about two weeks when Tim Cook presents the iPhone 7. There will be two models – the iPhone 7 Plus and the 4.7-inch model. There are no reports of a radical design change, and the phone will look similar to the previous model. The price range is likely to replicate the iPhone 6, with the Plus model being more expensive. The iPhone 7 will have a bigger camera, and the Plus model will have the dual camera, which is considered the future of smartphones. So, why two cameras? It will produce much better low light images and optical zoom, which won’t become blurred like the previous models. The dual-camera technology will be the closest thing to a DSLR (Digital single-lens reflex camera). The headphone jack is going away, and this is considered the most radical reported change to the iPhone 7. Rather than the traditional headphones, you will likely have to use the iPhone’s Lightning charging port. As with other iPhones, the smartphone will likely come with the new Lighting port earbuds or maybe headphones, but it is unlikely. There are also reports about Apple manufacturing wireless earbuds, which may accompany the iPhone 7. The great and powerful Woz speaks up for headphones jacks… https://t.co/hgkgBlKbyY — Norse Tech Bar (@nkutechbar) August 24, 2016 The decision has already proven to be controversial with Apple legend and co-founder Steve Wozniak slamming the decision. According to CNN, Wozniak said the following during an interview with the Australian National Review. “If it’s missing the 3.5-millimeter earphone jack, that’s going to tick off a lot of people,” Wozniak said of the iPhone 7. The decision to forgo the headphone jack is due to the thinness of the new iPhone. Woz also questions the quality of sound produced via Bluetooth. “I would not use Bluetooth… I don’t like wireless. I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music.” Wozniak’s warning may be coming too late with the iPhone release date just about two weeks away. The home button is expected to be removed and replaced with pressure technology, according to Bloomberg Technology. “…a re-engineered home button that responds to pressure with a vibrating sensation rather than a true physical click and the removal of the devices’ headphone jack, said the people, who didn’t want to be identified discussing unannounced features. Apple declined to comment.” Some reports also suggest the iPhone 7 may have a name change. Some insiders expect Apple to drop the numbers as with the iPad. However, this is yet to be confirmed. iOS 10 is going to get a big update. You should expect 3D Touch notifications, with new lock and home screen features. Slide to unlock is expected to be replaced with an option to press home to open the home page. Siri technology will be open to third party developers to improve its function and learning capabilities. The control center will have a better layout and will be easier to navigate as Apple is working on removing the clutter. Apple Maps will be updated and will fix many issues, according to TechRadar. “iOS 10 fixes my biggest complaint about Apple Maps — its inability to scroll ahead on a route. Right now, Maps annoyingly springs you back to your current location whenever you try to look anywhere else. You’ll be free to pan and zoom around the map with the new Apple Maps update and the navigation software is also dynamically zooming in and out of long stretches and complex interchanges.” Are you looking forward to the iPhone 7 or will you wait for the next edition?

The report also added that Apple is already working on a major redesign for the iPhone in 2017. The previous sources indicated that the mechanical home button in the iPhone 8 will be integrated with the display above other touch-sensitive sensors that vibrate when pressed, Bloomberg reported. The upcoming iPhone 8 vibration will give its users the illusion that the button can be depressed even though it is completely stationary. The same vibrating scheme was used by Apple on the track pads of its MacBooks. Apple has since replaced its original iPhone prototypes from 2006 with its curved displa. However, they decided to completely abandon the design because of the prohibitive cost and design constraints. The iPhone 8 may be what Apple was initially hoping to come up with, which is an OLED iPhone model before accelerating their product roadmap to offset a predicted stall in iPhone sales. The iPhone 8 is said to replace the home button with a spectacular edge to edge display with a curved OLED display. The iPhone 2017 model, on the other hand, will be an all-new form factor completely getting rid of the chin and forehead of its phone. In the main face of the device, a Touch ID sensor in the display will be integrated, as well as an improved front-facing camera, speaker and all sensors behind the display, John Gruber shared with Daring Fireball reported.  For now it remains unclear whether all iPhone 8 models will come out with this display or only the Pro model will. The iPhone 8, or whatever it will be called in 2017, is going to come as a major revamp. The iPhone 7, on the other hand, which will be released next month is rumored to look like its predecessor.

Stewart, UniversityHerald Reporter iPhone 8 Rumors, Specs: iPhone 8 Comes In Three Variants, Largest 5.8-inch; Apple To Continue LED Display? iPhone 8 Predecessor iPhone 6 Sales In Germany (Photo : Sean Gallup/Getty Images) iPhone 7 is rumored to carry the same design as its predecessor, iPhone 6s. However, with regard to iPhone 8, a complete design is expected as Apple is suspected to switch to OLED display technology. In addition, it is suggested that Apple's 2017 iPhone line will be released in three sizes. Apple is reportedly going to release a premium curved screen at 5.5 inches or larger with a screen bent on two sides, Nikkei reported. The said iPhone is believed to be a rival to Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. The largest iPhone edition is expected to be the only device that will carry an OLED screen. The other two models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens, on the other hand, are suggested to carry LCD displays similar to the current iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Apple is reportedly planning to continue selling iPhones with LCD displays along with OLED because the company believes that it may be difficult to secure enough panels for the more than 200 million iPhones that are being shipped globally every year. Meanwhile, KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo's who has been known to be a reliable analyst, believes that Apple's premium iPhone 8 will sport a 5.8-inch screen display, iDigitalTimes reported. He also added that Apple will be releasing an iPhone with a glass casing and wireless charging technology. The body of the iPhone, according to Kuo, will be made with metal sides like the iPhone 4's. In the past, Kuo already claimed that Apple's shift to OLED will not happen until at least 2019. However, he has changed his statement and believes that Apple is going to launch an iPhone with OLED display in 2017. iPhone 8's OLED display is expected to extend over the edges of the device which would stretch the screen over the existing volume, ringer and power buttons. Apple reportedly calls these virtual buttons in a patent describing the technology.

In fact, Apple will only be making major changes under the hood, with the outside appearance of the two phones remaining unchanged, apart from a missing 3.5mm headphone jack port and redesigned antenna lines. Even before the entire details of the iPhone 7 are confirmed, rumors and leaks about the iPhone 8 that is set for a release a year from now are already up and running. According to incoming reports, Cupertino has plans to completely get rid of the iconic Home button that has featured on its entire smartphone lineup, with the incoming iPhone 7 set to improve this button even further by including 3D Touch capabilities, at least according to other rumors. This planned move by Apple with respect to the iPhone 8 match perfectly with the reports that the iPhone maker has plans to ditch its Retina Display LCD panels in favor of OLED panels supplied by Samsung. It gets even more interesting given that this move is not just aimed at delivering users with deeper blacks and brighter whites, but also to venture into the curved screen technology. As it is, the iPhone 8 will come in with a curved edge-to-edge display unit, something that could closely resemble the current line of Galaxy Edge handsets as well as the recently introduced Galaxy Note 7. The iPhone 8 will be marking Apple’s 10th year in the smartphone market, hence the need for radical changes. However, don’t get your hopes too high since this report does not come from Apple itself. In fact, the source also notes that the curved edge-to-edge display unit could be another option added to the standard iPhone 8, but both handsets should come with the Home button some integrated into the display. Given the edge-to-edge display nature of the iPhone 8, the phone’s display will also house things like the front-facing snapper as well as speakers and other sensors. This should be an interesting phone indeed. Will you buy the upcoming iPhone 7 or wait for the iPhone 8?

Analysts do not think so. August 28, 2016 Cristina Lee Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is rumored to renew its push on social media by launching an app geared towards connecting people. But is the effort a little too late for the Cupertino tech giant? Dan Olds, an OrionX analyst says yes, Apple is too far out of the social circle to make an impact on the business. “Apple would have to come up with a very solid social app in order to compete with what’s available today,” said Olds. “Even with Apple’s very large installed base of users, I think it would be very difficult for Apple to compete head-on with Facebook, Twitter or Google. I’m not sure people want to add yet another social network to manage and maintain. The market seems fairly well satisfied right now.” The most widely used social media platforms right now are Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR), Instagram, and SnapChat, it would take a lot for Apple to penetrate the market, much get sway people to make the switch. “Apple would have to come up with something extraordinary in order to grab enough users to make it worth their while,” said Olds. Rumors that Apple is working on a social app – which many believe is a SnapChat rip off – followed a Bloomberg report that the company is working on a new video editing and sharing app for iOS. The app reportedly allows users to share videos on various social media platforms. It could be a standalone feature or incorporated into the iPhone camera. Apple is also rumored to roll out major updates to its messaging app in a bid to compete against Facebook’s Messenger. Although the OrionX analyst believes that Apple’s foray into social media won’t be as successful, some say it makes sense for the company to try entering the market once again. After all, billions of users are tuning in to various social media platforms and Apple is missing out on a potentially profitable venture. “Apple is behind in social media,” said Jeff Kagan, an independent industry analyst. “This does not mean they will ever be a significant player in social media, but I’m sure that’s a target they would like to achieve. If they can marry a successful social media app with their technology, it will help them grow further and faster.” Meanwhile, Judith Hurwitz, an analyst with Hurwitz & Associates said it could be easier for Apple to buy its way into social media instead of starting from the ground up. “It would be interesting to see if Apple will buy a company like Twitter,” she told Computerworld in an email. “Starting from scratch may be difficult.” Hurwitz also noted that Apple is better off focusing on photo-based social media app that would tie into the use of the iPhone’s camera. Meanwhile, Olds said that Apple should focus on playing nice with other social media platforms instead of building one from scratch. “I think Apple has decided that they need to have a social media presence, but I’m not sure that they’ll develop their own vehicle with their devices,” said Olds. “I think it’s more likely that they’ll imbue their devices with Apple-only features that make the existing social networks easier to use, or provide a richer user experience.” AAPL Previous article Next article Related Articles Business Apple (AAPL): That’s a Hell of a Loss November 18, 2012 Bruce Krasting Stocks Apple & Google Lead The Tech Wreck June 11, 2012 Nicholas Santiago Stocks Apple (AAPL) Behaving Badly October 2, 2012 Global Macro Monitor Be the first to comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

According to Forbes, you will be able to preorder the iPhone on September 9 and the phone will be released officially on Friday, September 16, 2016, according to credible phone leaker Evan Blass. Taiwan celeb Jimmy Lin spotted with unreleased iPhone 7 Plus https://t.co/qSiwizvNvw pic.twitter.com/9sVyU3hXZa — AsiaOne (@sphasiaone) August 24, 2016 So, here is what you can expect in about two weeks when Tim Cook presents the iPhone 7. There will be two models – the iPhone 7 Plus and the 4.7-inch model. There are no reports of a radical design change, and the phone will look similar to the previous model. The price range is likely to replicate the iPhone 6, with the Plus model being more expensive. The iPhone 7 will have a bigger camera, and the Plus model will have the dual camera, which is considered the future of smartphones. So, why two cameras? It will produce much better low light images and optical zoom, which won’t become blurred like the previous models. The dual-camera technology will be the closest thing to a DSLR (Digital single-lens reflex camera). The headphone jack is going away, and this is considered the most radical reported change to the iPhone 7. Rather than the traditional headphones, you will likely have to use the iPhone’s Lightning charging port. As with other iPhones, the smartphone will likely come with the new Lighting port earbuds or maybe headphones, but it is unlikely. There are also reports about Apple manufacturing wireless earbuds, which may accompany the iPhone 7. The great and powerful Woz speaks up for headphones jacks… https://t.co/hgkgBlKbyY — Norse Tech Bar (@nkutechbar) August 24, 2016 The decision has already proven to be controversial with Apple legend and co-founder Steve Wozniak slamming the decision. According to CNN, Wozniak said the following during an interview with the Australian National Review. “If it’s missing the 3.5-millimeter earphone jack, that’s going to tick off a lot of people,” Wozniak said of the iPhone 7. The decision to forgo the headphone jack is due to the thinness of the new iPhone. Woz also questions the quality of sound produced via Bluetooth. “I would not use Bluetooth… I don’t like wireless. I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music.” Wozniak’s warning may be coming too late with the iPhone release date just about two weeks away. The home button is expected to be removed and replaced with pressure technology, according to Bloomberg Technology. “…a re-engineered home button that responds to pressure with a vibrating sensation rather than a true physical click and the removal of the devices’ headphone jack, said the people, who didn’t want to be identified discussing unannounced features. Apple declined to comment.” Some reports also suggest the iPhone 7 may have a name change. Some insiders expect Apple to drop the numbers as with the iPad. However, this is yet to be confirmed. iOS 10 is going to get a big update. You should expect 3D Touch notifications, with new lock and home screen features. Slide to unlock is expected to be replaced with an option to press home to open the home page. Siri technology will be open to third party developers to improve its function and learning capabilities. The control center will have a better layout and will be easier to navigate as Apple is working on removing the clutter. Apple Maps will be updated and will fix many issues, according to TechRadar. “iOS 10 fixes my biggest complaint about Apple Maps — its inability to scroll ahead on a route. Right now, Maps annoyingly springs you back to your current location whenever you try to look anywhere else. You’ll be free to pan and zoom around the map with the new Apple Maps update and the navigation software is also dynamically zooming in and out of long stretches and complex interchanges.” Are you looking forward to the iPhone 7 or will you wait for the next edition?

Nelson04/11/2016 While the Apple Pencil is one of the best styluses you can buy for any device, it doesn’t work well with every single app out there. We’ve put together some of the best Apple Pencil apps for iPad Pro so you don’t need to waste time searching. Advertisement It took Apple long enough, but the company finally put out an iPad that uses a stylus; their first attempt, the Apple Pencil, is winning praise from almost everyone that uses it. If you’re not an artist, however, is the Apple Pencil really a worthwhile purchase? We wondered the same thing, so we spent some time looking for apps that work really well with the Apple Pencil – keeping an eye out for those titles that don’t require you to be a skilled artist just to get some use out of them (don’t worry, we looked for our favorite art-related apps, too). It might surprise you to learn that the Pencil’s performance isn’t uniform across the App Store; there are some apps that work really well, and some apps with noticeably worse performance. In those apps that have been updated to explicitly support the Pencil, you’ll find that lag – already quite low for a digital stylus – is further reduced, with better support for Pencil features like tilt sensors. Best Apple Pencil Apps: Notes Price: Free | Pre-installed Advertisement Notes? The app that comes with your iPad Pro? Yes, the very same. Unsurprisingly, Apple knows its hardware best, and as a result, Notes is one of the best supported Pencil apps that exists on the iPad Pro. It’s the best example of how realistic the Pencil can feel, with nearly imperceptible lag as you drag the stylus over the iPad’s display. Advertisement It’s worthwhile for more than just its Pencil support, however, as Apple put a lot of work into updating the Notes app. You can use it to type a note, just like always, but you can also use it to sketch with a Pencil or finger, insert pictures, video, and web pages, and generally keep track of your life. It’s like a less powerful version of Evernote, but more compelling thanks to its easy-to-use iCloud integration. Best Apple Pencil Apps: Astropad Price: $20 | Buy Apple Pencil support isn’t what makes Astropad so incredible, but it’s definitely the key to unlocking the app’s potential. If you’ve got a Mac, you’ll need to install Astropad on both your MacBook as well as your iPad Pro, and pair the two either over Wi-Fi or buy plugging in your Lightning cable. What do you get for your troubles? Astropad takes your Mac’s desktop and displays it on your iPad Pro, letting you interact with OS X apps like they ran natively. Advertisement What that means is you can use your Pencil to manipulate OS X apps like Photoshop or Illustrator, without having to go through the rigamarole of moving files between computer and tablet. Thanks to some fancy proprietary software, Astropad promises to deliver a smooth experience despite the remote nature, targeting a 60 frames per second interface. Best Apple Pencil Apps: Notability Price: $4 | Buy Notability is one of our favorite note-taking apps. It offers a number of really powerful features, like the ability to record a presentation while taking notes, then play back the lecture along with your written notes. If you’re an educator, the app supports sending out and turning in assignments, too. One of the things that makes Notability an easy recommendation is the way the developers continue updating it with more features. Advertisement That means that despite the newness of the Apple Pencil and iPad Pros, Notability supports both, and offers a great Pencil experience, to boot. Palm detection lets you rest your hand and arm on the iPad Pro while you write, without marking up your notes. With apps available for the iPhone and Mac as well, you can use iCloud, Dropbox or Box to keep your content synced. Best Apple Pencil Apps: PDF Expert 5 Price: $10 | Buy Our favorite PDF app for the iPhone and iPad is Readdle’s excellent PDF Expert 5 (all of their software is quite good, actually, and there’s usually a bundle discount in the App Store if you buy a collection) – so when they added Apple Pencil support, it became another easy recommendation. PDF documents load quickly and easily, with the iPad Pros’ blazing performance making even big, complex PDFs easy to navigate. Advertisement You can annotate the PDF with a number of tools, including both pen and highlighter support, in any color. The Pencil makes it easy to write on top of the PDF just like you would with a pen and printout. Plus, it makes signing PDFs easier than ever, with your signature actually looking like your normal signature. As you might expect, it integrates with all the cloud services you need, and even lets you wirelessly send documents to your iPad, straight from your computer. Best Apple Pencil Apps: Pigment Price: Free, but with several in-app purchases | Buy Over the past couple of years, coloring books have seen a resurgence, with a new focus, surprisingly, for the young adult and adult markets. The App Store is no exception; there are a bunch of coloring apps available for both the iPhone and iPad. Most of them aren’t great, offering something that’s less like coloring on a page and more like tap-to-color functionality. Pigment, on the other hand, works exactly like you’d expect a coloring book to work; the Apple Pencil makes it extremely fun to use, since it feels just like you’re using an old colored pencil. A plus to going to a digital coloring book means that you get to use highlighters, pens, pencils – whatever you like – to do your coloring with. There are a few designs included with your free download, all of which are stunning and complex, but there are many, many more available with in-app purchases or recurring subscriptions. Best Apple Pencil Apps: uMake Price: Free, but requires a $5 or $15 monthly sub | Buy uMake is one of those apps that you never really thought was possible on a mobile-first device like the iPad, and it turns out that not only is it possible on the iPad, but it’s actually an extremely compelling experience. At its core, uMake lets you generate 3D models with just a few preliminary sketches. The app and associated process is probably more appropriate for prototyping designs rather than doing it in uMake from start to finish. You can export designs as 2D representations / flat PNG files, but the app supports exporting the various curves and shapes so that you can refine your work in a more robust 3D editing program on the computer.  If you’re worried about getting up to speed with a new 3D app – on the iPad of all things – uMake comes with a number of tutorials that show you how various features work. Best Apple Pencil Apps: Paper Price: Currently free | Buy Paper has been one of our favorite iPad apps ever since it premiered on iOS, and the version that they’ve engineered for the iPad Pro continues to be an excellent experience. While skilled artists will be able to use Paper to generate some pretty impressive works, it’s a good app for the rest of us, too. Paper’s algorithms can let anyone make attractive sketches, and new versions of the app make it great for planning and flow charting, as well. You can start from scratch with a blank workspace, or you can import a picture to write or sketch over top. Fifty-three has built its own social network within Paper, where you can follow the work of friends and artists, or you you can share your results on Facebook and Twitter (or export directly into a PowerPoint presentations, which is a super fun way to build your slideshows. Did we miss an app that pairs perfectly with the Apple Pencil? Let us know in the comments, and we’ll take a look. Keep coming back for updates as we find new and better experience with both the Apple Pencil and the iPad Pro.     2 Responses 04/11/2016 Loretta Reply here new jobs..!!!Super and Easiest 0nl!nee Home opportunity for all. make 87 Dollars per hour and Make 2512 Dollars per month.All you just Need an Internet Connection and aComputer To Make Some Extra cash.

The reason is reportedly due to "faulty components."  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in a few weeks. A new report claims the smartphones could be in short supply at launch because of "faulty components." It seems like every year that Apple launches a new iPhone, there are reported issues with the build of the device and a news item that claims the smartphone will be in short supply, inciting panic for those who want the handset on the day it's officially released. Apple faced "Antennagate" when it released the iPhone 4 in 2010, as customers reported diminished cellular signal when holding the device. In 2014, the term "Bendgate" became synonymous with the company's first 5.5-inch phablet, the iPhone 6 Plus, with reports of the handset bending while inside pockets. Then there are issues that hit the new iPhones long before they are officially released. In the days leading up to the launch of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2014, multiple reports claimed delays and supply shortages stemming from the new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens. With only a few weeks before Apple unveils the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, a new report is predicting supply shortages of the new iPhones at launch. The shortages are said to be due to problems with faulty components. "If Apple sticks to its launch schedule from last year, there may not be enough supply at the beginning, as some suppliers are still trying to fix low yield rates of their components," said an industry source. This new claim was also reiterated by Yuanta Investment analyst Jeff Pu, who provided more specific reasons for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus supply constraints. Pu reportedly reduced his predictions for the July to December production of both old and new iPhone models from 120 million to 114 million because of unresolved flaws in the dual-camera module and the waterproof speaker. "We estimate total iPhone 7 builds to be 74 (million) in 2H16F, compared to 84 (million) for iPhone 6s in 2H15. Together with pricing pressure, we expect most Apple food chain suppliers to see (year-on-year) revenue decline for the rest of the year," said Pu. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are expected to feature a design similar to that of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The handsets will drop the standard 3.5mm headphone port and ship with redesigned EarPods that will plug into the smartphone's Lightning port. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will receive upgrades in the camera department, with the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 gaining OIS (optical image stabilization) and the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus featuring a new dual-lens rear camera.

One of the key characteristics of complex systems, such as the world’s energy and transport sectors, is that when they change it tends not to be a linear process. They flip from one state to another in a way strongly analogous to a phase change in material science. We have written about this before, for instance here and here. A second important characteristic of this type of economic phase change is that when one major sector flips, the results rip through the whole economy and can have impacts on the societal scale. We are seeing this effect in the electricity system right now. The rapid uptake of renewable generation in the power system, unstoppable now because of cost reductions in wind and solar, has not simply rendered a certain proportion of conventional generation uneconomic. It has fundamentally changed the way power markets work, making new investment in other sources all but impossible; it has changed the control paradigm for the grid from base-load-and-peak to forecast-and-balance; it has altered flows of investment throughout the power system and its technology providers; it is forcing through an accelerated digitisation of all electrical equipment. It is even changing the way buildings are designed, the training needed by the construction trades, and the way infrastructure is financed. We’ve seen this effect before, and not just in the distant past. When the first cell phones appeared, the assumption was that they would be used like normal phones, but on the move. But as their costs came down, their uses rose and they demanded the digitization of the analogue phone network – just as renewable energy is doing now to the power network. Three decades on, cell phones have pushed fixed phones to the fringes; even more importantly, however, they have driven profound changes in sector after sector of the wider economy – the type of holidays we take and how we book them, the mix of shops on high streets and in malls, the way we move around our cities. Mobile phones have eaten entire industries (cameras, alarm clocks, maps) and are set to do the same to others (newspapers, cash handling, music systems). No sector is immune, right down to furniture design, the size of pockets sewn into garments, even how many single diners a restaurant needs to plan for each night. Over the past few years we at Bloomberg New Energy Finance have been devoting more and more of our attention to the transportation sector. Just as in 2004 we felt the energy industry and its mainstream analysts had failed to understand the scale, imminence and implications of the renewable energy revolution, so in 2010 we started to feel the same about electric vehicles. One of the Magnificent Seven long-term trends I highlighted at our Summit that year was “The Transformation of Transportation”, which I illustrated with pictures of what electric vehicles looked like up to that point – British milk floats, the Sinclair C5 (look it up!), various tiny and weird-looking cars like the G-Wiz – followed by pictures of the electric cars of the future, which looked like, well, normal cars. This year, BNEF was the first mainstream energy research firm to publish a comprehensive forecast showing electric vehicles penetrating deep into the car market. The central scenario of our Global EV Sales Outlook to 2040, published in February, was that 35 percent of new sales would be electric by 2040, and perhaps as high as 47 percent under certain conditions (higher oil prices, more widespread use of car-sharing). If anything, since publishing that forecast, we are tending to think EV penetration will be faster, not slower, despite persistently low oil prices. In the first half of this year, worldwide EV sales were 285,000, up 57 percent on 2015. The reason for our bullishness on electric vehicles is not just the fact that battery costs are dropping at the sort of rates we have seen in the solar industry, down 65 percent in the past five years. It is also that electric vehicles out-compete internal combustion cars in lots of important dimensions: they drive more smoothly yet accelerate better, they can be charged at home or at the office, they require much less maintenance, they help solve air quality problems, they improve the energy autonomy of oil-importing countries. Sure, they have limited range and take a while to charge, but this is, in practice, irrelevant for the vast majority of use cases. Up to 40 percent of the cars in the U.S. are second vehicles; can anyone think of a good reason to buy a diesel or petrol second car in 15 years? Another powerful driver for the uptake of electric vehicles is that they are a vastly superior platform for autonomous driving, infotainment, connected vehicle and transport-as-a-service technologies, which are starting to transform the safety and experience of the travelling public. Put simply, our transport system is digitizing, just as the phone system digitized, just as the energy system is digitizing, and this will yield dramatic benefits in terms of asset utilization (in other words cost), flexibility, service levels and cleanliness. And it simply makes no sense to have an inherently analogue power unit – vibrating, volatile-liquid-consuming, hot-polluting-exhaust-producing – at the heart of a fully digital, sensor-pervaded, solid-state-electronics-controlled system. The coming shift to electric, digitally-connected vehicles will have dramatic implications for the car industry. Much media attention focuses on Tesla Motors, the new entrant that parked EVs so firmly on the auto industry’s lawn. Tesla’s ability to maintain its early lead will be dependent on continued access to cheap capital, particularly over the next three years as it deals with scaling up production of its first mass-market model and at the same time faces rigorous scrutiny of its self-driving technology. It is perhaps just as well, as Bloomberg’s Liam Denning explains here, that its investor cheerleaders don’t seem to care how much money it is losing, or by how much it misses its production targets. But that will change over time, which is why, seen the through the lens of investor confidence, the acquisition of SolarCity looks like an unnecessary risk. While Tesla basks in attention, there has been far too little robust scrutiny of incumbent auto companies’ electric vehicle strategies. There is plenty of ooing and aahing over concept cars, electric model launches and press releases about ambitious plans; but which car companies are really committed to electric vehicles and which ones are going through the motions? Which ones are betting on battery-only vehicles and which ones on plug-in hybrids? Which ones are still waiting for hydrogen fuel cells to descend from on high, on a beam of light? You wouldn’t know by reading the mainstream business press. Instead we get endless coverage of potential new entrants into the car business. Dyson makes a fine vacuum cleaner and has world-beating knowledge of batteries and motors, but is that really going to be enough to beat GM, Ford and Toyota? Really? Faraday Future previews an electric Batmobile and the world’s press goes into hyperbole-drive. And then there’s Apple. In Abu Dhabi, I stay on Al Maryah Island, reclaimed from the sea in 2007; Apple Maps still shows it as a network of roads in the middle of the sea. If Apple can’t show my hotel car park, does anyone seriously think it can sell me a self-driving car? Even Google, while it appears to have established a very strong position in the machine-learning technologies that will underpin autonomous vehicle features, is unlikely to find that is enough to give it leadership of the car industry of the future. More likely, to understand the future of the car over the next decade, you need to watch the mainstream car companies – the big U.S., European, Japanese, Indian and Chinese names. The most important news this year is not which executive left Google, or joined Apple; it may not even be the launch of Tesla’s Model 3, it may instead be the $15 billion settlement of Volkswagen’s ‘Dieselgate’ lawsuits, which included a $2 billion commitment to promoting zero-emission vehicles in the U.S. This was just part of $11.2 billion VW intends to spend over the next decade on electric vehicles – a commitment that the company expects to result in up to 25 percent of its unit sales being electric by 2025. Put that in context: that would be 2.5 million vehicles a year in less than a decade – a cool 43 times Tesla’s 58,000 unit sales last year. *                             *                             * For all the seismic shifts electric vehicles will bring to the car industry, as with mobile phones and cheap renewable energy, as with all transformations in major economic sectors, some of the biggest impacts may be felt in other parts of the economy.  Here are some of the sectors that could be hit by the resulting tsunami: Auto supply chain Car companies are the keystone species in an ecosystem of technology and service providers, all of which are going to see extreme disruption from the shift to electric and digital vehicles. The highest-profile beneficiaries are likely to be battery providers like Panasonic, LG Chem and Samsung, but there will be many others providing everything from software and sensors to asset tracking and cyber-protection, not to mention those who provide autonomous driving technology. As markets for internal combustion engines wither, there will be losers throughout their enormous supply chain, among manufacturers of gearboxes, fuel management assemblies, exhaust systems and catalysts, and the entire associated component supply industry. In 1904, there were 61,306 people employed making wagons and carriages in the U.S. By 1921, the figure was 8,025. The chemicals industry will be profoundly impacted. Demand for battery chemicals – in particular lithium for the foreseeable future – will soar, as will demand for rare earth metals, which are needed in so many motors and other modern electrical components. The use of steel in electric vehicles will decline, as manufacturers strive to reduce weight to counteract the inevitable heaviness of the batteries, while the use of resins, composite materials and aerogels will increase. Dealer networks It is not just manufacturing and commodities that will be hit. Expect to see numbers of car dealerships and repair shops decimated in coming decades. Electric vehicles have dramatically fewer maintenance needs, as a result of having fewer moving parts – just a few sealed electric motors, steering and suspension assemblies. Hard data are sparse at this early stage in the industry, but it would seem reasonable to expect the main battery to last for at least 70,000 miles, and longer in future. Most system tweaks can be done remotely via software updates, rather than at the hands of a mechanic, and the annual service will be mainly about rotating the tires, replacing the occasional brake pad, and filling the windscreen wiper fluid. At the same time, driver support software – collision avoidance, lane maintenance, platooning, tiredness alerts, driverless parking and so on – will dramatically reduce the number of accidents. While fully driverless vehicles, which might have a dramatic effect on the worldwide number of driving jobs, look like being some way away, the reduction of maintenance and repair work is happening now and will be picking up speed. As for car retailing, with the economics of dealerships undermined by the near-elimination of maintenance and repair work, the rationale for the classic suburban car dealership is broken. Expect to see more showrooms in convenient locations (i.e. city centers and transport hubs), and out-of-town second-hand car markets. Electricity system In our central New Energy Outlook forecast, published in June, we estimated that EVs will add 2,701 terawatt-hours, or 8 percent, to global annual electricity demand by 2040 – and more in the event of even more rapid uptake. This is welcome news indeed for utilities, supporting demand for their product at a time when energy-efficient devices will be having a strong opposite effect. But it’s not just about raw power demand: a large installed base of EVs means a huge potential increase in demand-response capacity – electric vehicles can be charged when the power price is low, when solar and wind energy are generating strongly, and they can (assuming the appropriate regulatory and commercial arrangements are in place) discharge back into the grid when the network is short of generation. This creates new opportunities for utilities – or others – to offer new ancillary services. In addition, while the benefits to the grid of second-hand electric vehicle batteries have yet to materialize, they could be substantial. Once a battery’s performance has degraded by around 30 percent, it could become available for stationary storage. Upcoming research by BNEF’s advanced transportation team will suggest that by 2018 these second-life batteries could cost as little as $49 per usable kilowatt-hour to repurpose, compared to the current new stationary battery price today of around $300 per kilowatt-hour. If so, they will further support the economics of both renewable energy and electric vehicles, accelerating the uptake of both. Then of course there are the off-grid markets, where any improvement in battery technology driven by electric vehicles could have profound benefits, perhaps seeing the demise of the trusty diesel generator, to be replaced by a clean, silent, low-maintenance mini- or micro-grid. Oil companies and oil exporters The flip-side of additional electricity demand from electric vehicles is of course reduced oil demand versus the 100 percent liquid-fuel-based fleet. In our central NEO scenario, there is a reduction of 13 million barrels of oil per day by 2040. Of course, there are other moving parts when it comes to absolute levels of gasoline demand, including the impact of GDP growth on car ownership in emerging markets, further improvements in the efficiency of internal combustion engines, modal shifts in transportation, and penetration of compressed natural gas, biofuels and other alternative transport fuels. But what is clear is that a rapid shift to electric vehicles, on the scale we are expecting, would be bearish for oil demand. Last month, Wood Mackenzie reported that upstream investment in the oil industry between 2015 and 2020 was slashed by over $1 trillion in the aftermath of the 2014 oil price crash. The orthodox view – certainly held by Ali Al Naimi, Saudi oil minister at the time his country decided to open the taps – is that the oil price must inevitably soar again in due course, as demand growth absorbs excess capacity and new supply fails to materialize. A rapid uptake of electric vehicles, such as the one we envisage, makes this a whole lot less likely. The very fact that there is now a scalable technology competitive with internal combustion vehicles means there is a cap on long-term oil prices – currently around $80 per barrel but dropping fast. Never mind “lower for longer”, oil prices could well be “lower forever”. That would drive a lot more downsizing and consolidation among international oil companies and oilfield service providers, as well as deep pain and the need for economic restructuring among oil-exporting nations. Venezuela is unlikely to be the last oil-producing state to require international rescue. Road and charging infrastructure Of course the uptake of electric vehicles will have to be accompanied by the roll-out of charging infrastructure. Think of the growth of ISPs during the crazy years of the internet revolution. Much commentator attention is focused currently on on-street charging, but the fact is the average EV owner will expect to be able to charge his or her car at home or on-street, at the office, at the shopping mall and on any major road during longer trips. That’s a lot of charging stations that need building. The construction industry will be one of the big beneficiaries, as will power equipment and associated software providers. In the first instance, there will be a great deal of work digging up roads and pavements to install charging points and the associated cabling at homes, car parks and retail outlets. Over the medium and long term, building codes will be amended to require designs to provide for charging points in garages or outside homes, and there will be retrofitting work to some of the existing stock. As for our highways and motorways, the tried and tested gasoline-age infrastructure has filling stations dotted around the outskirts of towns, at fairly regular intervals of 10-20 miles on trunk roads and every 20-30 miles on motorways/freeways service stations. All of this is up for grabs. It is too early to tell what the ultimate morphology will be: early on, many potential electric vehicle buyers may hang back unless they see massive numbers of charging stations on motorways; later, the numbers will be driven by real levels of demand, as they are for petrol and diesel filling stations. In the end, many electric vehicle drivers will likely try to avoid using charging stations on main roads and motorways for reasons of time and cost. Those that have to – perhaps because they are undertaking longer trips – will have to spend longer doing so, creating new retail and food service opportunities. Meanwhile, urban petrol stations will continue their long trend of thinning out as electric vehicles eat into their demand. Cities There is an endless literature on how the advent of the car shaped the modern city, driving the creation of suburbs. The shift to electrification and digitization of transportation won’t undo that trend – indeed driverless vehicles would probably make possible longer commutes as drivers could productively use commuting time. Nevertheless, the shift to electric transportation is going to have a significant impact on our physical environment. Most obvious will be the build-out of charging points. City after city has been ripping out traditional parking meters, now they have to start installing on-street charging stations. Perhaps more strikingly, charging stations will be ubiquitous in car parks, whether municipal and multi-storey ones, those belonging to employers, or those outside supermarkets, shopping malls and hotels and restaurants. Since many potential EV owners don’t own their own garages or driveways, retailers will lead the charge, as they realise free charging is a great way of securing regular, captive customers. The electrification of urban transportation will have unexpected consequences. Many formerly fashionable boulevards in older cities are currently blighted by fast traffic, road noise and air pollution. At the same time, the digitization of bus services might reduce their concentration on a small number of heavily-trafficked bus routes. Could electric vehicles and digital transportation inadvertently reclaim our high streets and unlock vast real estate value? Other transportation sectors The electrification of transportation will not be restricted to the car market. In fact, there are already 200 million electric bikes in China alone, and their use is spreading worldwide. Improved battery, motor and power control technology will challenge the dominance of small fossil-fuel engines in every light sector: motor boats, lawnmowers, snowmobiles, mopeds and motor cycles. As battery costs drop, electrification will spread into heavier vehicles too. Delivery vans are a natural early market, as they drive relatively small distances, and there is a high premium to be earned through eliminating noise and air pollution. Electric ferries are starting to appear, and Tesla, Mercedes and others are working hard to produce reference designs for heavy-duty trucks. Last month, two Swiss adventurers, Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg, completed the first ever round-the-world flight by a solar aircraft, Solar Impulse II. In 2009, when I first heard Piccard speak about the challenge, he was asked whether we would ever see solar-powered passenger planes, and his answer was a flat “No”. The project was designed as an extreme engineering challenge and a communications vehicle. Yet this year, after completing the circumnavigation, he said: “I’m sure that within 10 years, we’ll see electric airplanes transporting 50 passengers on short- to medium-haul flights.” That is as good an analogy as any for the speed with which electrification technology is progressing, and the range of applications in which it might ultimately find a use. Ministries of finance The final area that will be transformed if we are right about the scale and speed of transformation in transportation, is the world’s finance ministries. While it is obvious that anything that reduces oil demand would be seen as a negative by the finance ministers of oil-producing nations, the fact is that, even in consuming nations, the shift to electric and connected vehicles poses considerable headaches. First, particularly in Europe, petrol and diesel are heavily taxed, providing up to 7 percent of government receipts. Reduce their demand, and perhaps price, and government income is reduced. While there is an economic stimulus, there is the question of where replacement government income is to be found. Second, at the same time, as described above, there are likely to be reductions in the number of people employed in maintaining, repairing, and eventually driving vehicles. While there might be an economic pay-off eventually as these people are freed up to fill other roles in the workforce, there is a real question as to whether they can acquire relevant skills.  Expect the debate about guaranteed income to grow in volume if the transportation sector starts to shed millions of jobs worldwide even as economies grow. Finally, clean energy and transportation technologies, almost by definition, require much more up-front investment, and much less on-going spending. Thus any major shift in their direction will require the creation of new pools of long-term capital, and have impacts at the macro-economic level on productivity and interest rates. *                             *                             * If it is hard to predict when phase change in complex systems begins, it is even harder to predict where it ends. No list of potential impacts of the Transformation of Transportation can be complete.  However, one thing is for sure: if our predictions for the uptake of electric vehicles are anything like correct, there is no part of the global economy which will not, in some way, be affected.   Michael Liebreich is chairman of the advisory board for Bloomberg New Energy Finance, and a board member of Transport for London.

New, 80 comments The primary weapon in the streaming music wars could change the music industry in a big way by Micah Singleton@MicahSingleton Aug 28, 2016, 10:00am EDT share tweet Linkedin Paras Griffin/Getty Images Beyoncé. Drake. Kanye West. Future. Rihanna. Frank Ocean. That's just a sampling of some of the artists who have released albums in 2016 exclusively to either Apple Music or Tidal. The streaming service's desire to grow their user base through exclusive content deals has been a boon for a talented group of artists who can once again get great value for their creations. These artists are now making money directly off music like it's 1999. Apple Music and Tidal have both grown in notoriety and increased subscriber totals as a result of these deals. Both have also shelled out production costs for music videos and live shows. The artists are making more money and the music labels are paying out less overhead. But everyone isn't happy. Streaming services could turn into de facto labels Spotify, the service both Apple and Tidal are chasing, is against exclusives and has reportedly been making artists who release exclusive projects on competing services more difficult to find in search. Universal Music Group has banned exclusives on the heels of Frank Ocean ditching the label to release Blonde exclusively through Apple Music, all the while fears that streaming services could turn into de facto labels as their ubiquity and clout continue to grow. And then there's the fans. While you could buy every one of those exclusive albums besides The Life of Pablo, everyone knows in 2016 people don't buy albums like they used to. Most people who use streaming services have Spotify — which just passed 39 million subscribers and has over 100 million total users — and that leaves a large chunk of fans out of the loop, at least for the first two weeks or so after a major album is released. But then again, not everyone cares about having new music first, and exclusives are a way for artists to get paid for their content in a piracy age, without charging fans more money.

Mansoor was recently targeted by spyware that can hack into Apple's iPhone handset. AP photo CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — Apple issued a security update to prevent attacks by rare, highly expensive spyware that exploits flaws in the mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads, after security researchers said it was used to target a Middle Eastern dissident's phone. In a statement to USA TODAY Thursday, Apple said it immediately fixed the vulnerability upon learning of it. It advises customers to download the latest version of its iOS, version 9.3.5, for security protection. The Associated Press first reported on the patch. The espionage software was discovered because it had been targeted at Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent United Arab Emirates dissident. Mansoor received a text message on his iPhone 6 that invited him to click on a web link. He had been the victim of spyware in the past and so forwarded the message to researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. Researchers there worked with San Francisco-based mobile security firm Lookout. In a blog post Thursday on its website, Lookout researchers said they found a “sophisticated, targeted, and persistent mobile attack on iOS using three zero-day vulnerabilities we call ‘Trident.’” The flaw lets the hacker break into an iOS device and spy on information gleaned from the victims' apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, FaceTime, Gmail and Calendar, the post said. "As security breaches go, this is fairly serious, considering how fast Apple addressed it," says Andrew Blaich, a staff researcher at Lookout. Citizen Lab traced the link to NSO Group, which it calls a “cyberwar” company in Israel that sells a spyware product called Pegasus, said John Scott-Railton, one of the Citizen Lab report's authors. NSO would not comment on whether it had sold the software. “NSO’s mission is to help make the world a safer place, by providing authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime,” said Zamir Dahbash, NSO spokesman, in a statement to USA TODAY. The company only sells its software to authorized governmental agencies and requires customers to sign an agreement that its products will only be used in a lawful manner, specifically “the prevention and investigation of crimes,” he said. NSO Group is reportedly owned by an American venture capital firm, Francisco Partners Management, according to Citizen Lab. A call to FPM was not immediately returned. COSTLY GEAR The cost of such sophisticated spyware is very high. A set of similar digital tools recently sold for $1 million, Citizen Lab's Scott-Railton and his co-author, Bill Marczak, wrote in an online report posted Thursday. The Internet watchdog group discovered the security hole a few weeks ago and immediately notified Apple, Lookout's Blaich said.

She wasn’t happy with the way Siri pronounces her name, and the Apple CEO obliged, letting her know that it’ll all be fixed come September 30th. Naturally, all tech blogs speculated that we’re going to get a new version of iOS on that date, likely the first iOS 10 release, though it would be a little late compared to Apple’s usual iOS rollout. But this isn’t about that at all. No, we’re just going to take a look at Streisand explaining the entire thing to Jimmy Fallon. DON’T MISS: Solid source says he knows exactly when Apple will release the iPhone 7 The singer appeared on The Tonight Show, where she explained how she ended up working with a variety of actors for her newest album, titled Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway. While telling Fallon about some of the actors who worked with her on the project, she remembered how even Melissa McCarthy would not pronounce her name right. She would say Streizand instead of Streisand. "I've got to do something about this. I mean 50 years already, don't you know how to say my name right?" she said. So she went directly to Tim Cook after seeing that even Siri mispronounces her name.

The discovery of the Pegasus spyware on an iPhone came as a shock to the cyber security world. The software was created by the Israeli company NSO as a way to spy on Apple, Android and Blackberry smartphone users. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 117.91 +1.30 +1.11% This cyber weapon is “by far the most sophisticated ever detected” on a mobile device, Gert-Jan Schenk, Europe and Middle East vice-president of Lookout – a company that analysed the virus – told FRANCE 24. He explained what is so unique about Pegasus. FRANCE 24: What makes Pegasus different from other mobile spyware? Gert-Jan Schenk: We’ve never seen spyware this sophisticated before. The user can’t detect the software on their smartphone, even after it has been contaminated. Plus, no data encryption can effectively protect against [Pegasus]. And its developers discovered three different security flaws that Apple didn’t know about. If Pegasus can override data encryption, does that mean it is able to follow conversations on WhatsApp and Telegram? You have to understand how Pegasus works. This spyware installs itself in the kernel of the phone – in other words at the heart of the operating system – which allows it to intercept conversations even before any encryption happens. It’s as if a spy could see what the user is typing on their keyboard. So basically the encryption of an app like WhatsApp or Telegram is useless against Pegasus. Could this program be used to fight terrorist groups like the Islamic State (IS), some of whose members use Telegram? Intelligence services can in effect use it for that purpose. It’s an unmatched tool for learning as much as possible about anyone since except for your spouse or partner, no one knows more about you than your phone. Since regulation of cyber-weapons sales is very loose, NSO can decide to sell Pegasus to whomever they see fit. The company says that it will only sell the software to “authorised entities”, but they are the ones who decide what fits into that category. They could mean a repressive government or a state-run corporate espionage service. That regulatory vagueness is very dangerous when we’re talking about a digital weapon as dangerous as this. But didn’t Apple issue a security update that should fix the problem? First of all, the same software exists for Android and Blackberry, and we can assume that it is just as powerful. Second, Apple’s update only guarantees that Pegasus can no longer be installed on iPhones. But the spyware will continue to exist on smartphones that have already been contaminated, without the owners even noticing. We’ll have to find out if the Apple update is effective against cyber spies who want to gain access to iPhones remotely.

Lefsetz Letter Archives Subscribe to the Lefsetz Letter The Twisted Sister Movie More Frank Ocean Virtual Reality How To You’re gonna want to be sitting down. Daniel Glass wanted to know if I’d seen the “New York Times” VR video of the retaking of Fallujah. Alas, I’d thrown the viewer out when it came with the paper way back when. Didn’t know I was doing that, but realized it after the fact, when the “Times” kept advertising its content and I couldn’t see it. I don’t know whether virtual reality is the future or the next Google Glass. I do know all the techies are talking about it and most people are left out. So, I want to give you a primer, a little help. You need a viewer. I assume you’ve got a smartphone, Apple or Android, doesn’t matter. So, go to knoxlabs.com Not to Amazon, it’s actually more expensive there. Click on “Products” on the top line. You want the Knox V2 on the resulting page. Buy it, it’s only ten bucks, they’ll charge you another $2.65 for shipping, but that’s a bargain, to get in the door, to see what’s going on. Everything has a hurdle. And those who’ve jumped it care not a whit about those left behind. If anything, they ridicule them. Most people still don’t seem to know that you can synch streaming tracks for offline use. Every day I get e-mail from people decrying data charges and complaining about lack of coverage, they want their music 24/7, and you can have it, assuming you pay the $10 a month, just synch it to your handset and as long as you have juice, you can listen. But this is about VR. I didn’t dip my toe. I was turned off by the hype. I followed the stories, about Oculus Rift first and foremost, raising money on Kickstarter and then selling to Facebook, but I could sit on the sideline just fine. Reminds me of the first computer era, back at the turn of the decade, from the seventies to the eighties, when the Apple II was infiltrating law firms and I was still using pen and paper, believing the IBM Selectric with memory was good enough. But when I started my newsletter and loaded up on Apple equipment I was stunned, I entered a whole new world with tons of functionality. But that was back when there were still manuals, instructions. I follow orders, I’ll take the time to read. VR comes with no instructions. Which is why I’m helping you out here. So, you’ve got your smartphone. And you’ve ordered your viewer. Do this, please. So we’re all on the same page, so we can talk intelligently, it’s less than the cost of a movie, and the unboxing and first experiences are worth the price of admission. So, it’ll take you a week to get your Knox viewer. And when it comes, you’ll be excited and flummoxed. Be VERY careful opening the box. Because this thing IS cardboard and you can ruin it quite easily. But after you unbox it you’ll be too scared to make your next move, which is why I point you to this YouTube video, “Hands-On with Google Knox V2 – Google I/O 2015 – I AM CARDBOARD 2.0” This will teach you how to extract the viewer from its case, which is intuitive, yet it’s in its sleeve so tight you’re afraid you’ll break something removing it. And then… You’re at the mercy of the instructions on the viewer itself, which are poorly done and might as well be in Greek, despite being pictures. Bottom line? Fold the flaps back towards the lenses and then secure them with the Velcro tabs. I wish I could be more explicit, if you’re confused I’m sure there’s a video for it. And then… You need content. The Knox viewer comes with a little pamphlet and implores you to download an app. DON’T DO THIS FIRST! I did, and was mightily confused. So then I went searching on the “New York Times.” I discovered you’ve got to download a virtual reality app, search on “NYT VR” and download it. But don’t do this first either! No, what you want to do first is download the Google Cardboard app, even if you’re using an iPhone, it’s platform independent. So now, after you’ve downloaded Google Cardboard…launch it and click for the demo. If this is the future, Google owns it, because at least they give a few instructions, like where to put your phone in the viewer and how to close the cardboard to hold it in place. (Just to be clear, you put your phone into the viewer on the backside of the lens holes, close the cardboard flap and secure the Velcro tab to hold the phone in place, or you can do this with your hands for easy, ongoing accessibility, which you’ll need.) Now, for you oldsters out there… You’re gonna need your reading glasses to download and launch the apps, but you’re not gonna use them when looking into the viewer. Got that? Oh crap, I can’t get back to where I started, and I’m trying to tell you how to do it! Bottom line, first I saw birds and… There was a white dot and I couldn’t figure out what to do with it. Turns out the Knox cardboard box has a button, on the upper right side, you push down to select, this is everything, try it! And then, to go to different VR movies in the Google app you turn the cardboard box sideways and click on what you want. Now this is getting too complicated, but it’s somewhat intuitive, I know you can do it and… I didn’t do it this way. I started off with the Knox-approved app and couldn’t make anything work. And then I went to the “New York Times,” and I knew enough to know that you turn your head to see multiple views and I wanted to see behind me and got up and promptly lost my balance, which is not good, I’m still recovering from shoulder surgery. So, like I said up top, you’re gonna want to be sitting down. And you’re gonna want to use the Google app first, because when you fly like a bird…IT’S VERY COOL! So then I jumped back to the “Times” and the movies kept stalling. I’ve got a speedy connection, but it turns out you’re best off downloading movies in the “Times” app. And the “Times” app is not quite as intuitive as the Google one. You download it, launch it, click on a movie and employ the option to download it and then you’re confronted with two choices, two pictures, one for “GOOGLE CARDBOARD” and one for “SMARTPHONE,” choose “GOOGLE CARDBOARD,” that’s the one that works with the Knox viewer. Otherwise, you can just watch the movie on your phone and pan…but it’s not the same thing. So now I’m thinking I’ve overloaded you, confused you, you’re throwing your hands up like you don’t care. But you do. And you will get the hang of this. You’ve just got to take the plunge. So, once again, go to knoxlabs.com and buy a viewer, it’s easy, go for it. And then, when it arrives and you’ve unboxed the viewer and installed the apps you’re 90% there, you’re on your way home, it’s only then you’ll have to fumble a bit, but by this time you’ll be excited, you’ll see stuff through the viewer, you’ll be part of the new paradigm, on your own adventure into the future. Oh, one more thing! Use headphones. Preferably Bluetooth ones, but any old wired ones will do, even the pods that came with your phone. It’s not necessary, but it’s a much better experience. P.S. Once you’re up and running you can go to the App Store and search on “Paul McCartney” and download the app to watch his VR movie, along with one about Jack White. However, it worked at first for me and now the content won’t download. I just checked the speed in the house and it was 100 Mbps down, so who knows what’s going on, maybe it’ll work for you, but it’s glitches like this that hold new technologies back, we need an AOL for VR, then again, do we really need VR? I’m still not sure… By: bob | 2016/08/28 | Technology | Trackback | Comments [RSS 2.0] Comments are closed The Lefsetz Letter is powered by WordPress, Jeffry Weicher Productions & equiX.

GET IN TOUCH       Ghana News Ghana News, Ghana Politics, Ghana Sports, Ghana Business           Home 2016 Election Results Business Politics Sport Showbiz Odd But True Opinion Relationship Lifestyle Infographics TV ‘First Apple computer’ sells for $815,000 Sunday 28th August , 2016 11:43 am A prototype Apple 1, a holy-grail item in electronics memorabilia, has been sold for $815,000 (£618,000). Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built just 200 of the computers in 1976. The model auctioned this week contains tell-tale signs that it is a prototype, probably made prior to its manufacturing run. One computer historian says it is “one of the first, if not the first ever” Apple computer. This “celebration edition” Apple 1 was expected to make $1m, but auctioneer Charitybuzz told the BBC that the final bid was $815,000. That means it is not the highest-grossing Apple 1 computer – that distinction belongs to a rare working version that sold for $905,000 at a Bonhams auction in New York in October 2014. A spokeswoman for Charitybuzz said that “about 80 bidders” had been watching the item. She denied reports that there had been a last-minute $1.2m bid, apparently made too late to be accepted. Ten percent of the proceeds will go to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, based in New York, Charitybuzz said. The winning bidders, Glenn and Shannon Dellimore, said they want to take the computer into schools and universities to help inspire young people. Mr Dellimore told the BBC: “It is incredible to think that this was most likely the very first Apple 1, the unicorn or holy grail of computers, the original very first prototype.” ‘Manually soldered’ No more than 70 Apple 1 computers are believed to still be in existence. The machine – initially named “Apple Computer 1” – first went on sale in July 1976, and was discontinued in October of the following year when the company turned its attention to building the Apple 2. The “celebration edition” is different from the other Apple 1s because it was manually soldered on to a blank PC board, meaning it was not part of the only two production runs of the device. Mr Wozniak was quoted by Charitybuzz as saying: “Only a few Apple 1s, on blank (not green) PC boards, may have been manually soldered, although I’m not sure of it. “We arranged the wave soldering with the company that made the PC boards. But we may not have wanted to wave solder a run (of maybe 10 or more board) until we manually soldered one or two to debug them.” Apple historian Corey Cohen, who assessed the machine, said in a promotional video that the celebration edition is “one of the first, if not the first, Apple computers because this appears to be one of the sample boards”. According to a timestamp on the PC board, it was made in the summer of 1976. – Source: BBC Delali Adogla-Bessa More on citifmonline.com CES 2017: Razer gaming laptop has not one but three screens January 6, 2017 Facebook Live attack: Four held in Chicago, US January 5, 2017 Apple sued over fatal ‘FaceTime crash’ January 4, 2017 Fake WhatsApp documents being used to trick people into downloading viruses January 3, 2017 Samsung Electronics to reveal Galaxy Note 7 probe results this month January 3, 2017 China Twitter boss leaves after seven months January 2, 2017 General News Mike Oquaye’s inaugural address as Speaker in 7th Parliament [Full text] January 7, 2017 Rawlings, Vanderpuije patch up after ‘public drama’ [Photos] January 7, 2017 Live updates: Inauguration of 7th parliament January 7, 2017 Mike Oquaye sworn-in as speaker of Ghana’s 7th parliament [Photos] January 7, 2017 Asanteman announces arrangements for late Queenmother’s funeral January 6, 2017 Advertisement Recent Posts Mike Oquaye’s inaugural address as Speaker in 7th Parliament [Full text] Rawlings, Vanderpuije patch up after ‘public drama’ [Photos] Live updates: Inauguration of 7th parliament Mike Oquaye sworn-in as speaker of Ghana’s 7th parliament [Photos] TOR faces threats from Dangote’s refinery if … – MD NPP sympathisers storm Ashaiman Assembly to stop ‘last minute’ contract Asanteman announces arrangements for late Queenmother’s funeral Ho market women angry over market stall allocations Deepening financial sector requires greater access to private pools of equity capital 7 key taxes NPP plans to cut [Infographic] Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2017 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.

The first-team offense -- again -- was shut down and shut out. It may not be a reason to panic, but it also didn't provide many reasons for optimism. On first glance, without film review, here’s who was up and who was down. Rookie cornerback Eli Apple didn't allow any receptions to the Jets on Saturday night. Vincent Carchietta/USA TODAY Sports UP CB Eli Apple: The first-round pick has, believe it or not, exceeded expectations this summer. Apple (leg/knee) returned from injury Saturday after missing last week’s game and had an impressive all-around performance, even if it didn’t come against Jets standout wide receiver Brandon Marshall. Apple had three passes thrown in his direction. All three fell incomplete as he blanketed his receiver. It’s becoming clear that the Giants need to find ways to get Apple on the field with regularity. DT Damon Harrison: The former Jet had seven tackles in two-plus quarters against his former team. He also had a sack and a forced fumble. Harrison was constantly pushing the pocket all evening against a Jets offensive line which he knows well. This is why the Giants signed Harrison this offseason. He was a difference-maker in the middle of their defensive line, and the only points the Giants’ first-team defense allowed was off a turnover deep in its own territory. The Giants have to like what they’ve seen from Harrison this summer. WR Tavarres King: The Giants scored two offensive touchdowns. Both came on passes from backup quarterback Ryan Nassib to King. It again put King in the spotlight. He’s the only Giants wide receiver to shine this preseason. And it comes after a strong spring and summer put him in serious contention for a roster spot. He even had the Giants' longest run of the night, a 20-yard end-around in the second half. DOWN Offensive Line: For the second straight week, its struggles were the team's most glaring problem. Quarterback Eli Manning took too many hits and the Giants were unable to run the ball against the Jets. They finished with 39 yards on 20 carries. The line’s ineffectiveness has killed any chance of success for the first-team offense the past two weeks. It has to improve drastically if this team is to end its four-year playoff drought. TE Ryan Malleck: The undrafted rookie had his opportunity to make a positive impression with the first team. It didn’t work out well. Desperately in need of an effective blocking tight end (especially with Will Johnson and Matt LaCosse sidelined by injury), Malleck was given some first-team reps, but was driven deep into the backfield by Jets defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson on one play. That’s not the kind of tape that will help him earn a roster spot. Facebook Twitter Facebook Messenger Pinterest Email comment Sponsored Headlines Comments

Artists who have given Apple exclusive access to new music have been told they won’t be able to get their tracks on featured playlists once the songs become available on Spotify, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing the steps. Those artists have also found their songs buried in the search rankings of Spotify, the world’s largest music-streaming service, the people said. Spotify said it doesn’t alter search rankings. Streaming calls the tune, becoming top earner in US music business for first time Spotify has been using such practices for about a year, one of the people said, though others said the efforts have escalated over the past few months. Artists who have given exclusives to Tidal, the streaming service run by Jay Z, have also been retaliated against, the person said, declining to identify specific musicians. Apple’s music service has emerged as the largest challenger to Spotify over the past year, signing up more than 15 million subscribers since its debut last June, the company said two months ago. Exclusive deals for new music from artists such as Drake, Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean are central to Apple’s strategy. Spotify has more than 30 million subscribers globally. Apple Music also has ways to promote artists, such as highlighting their songs in its Top Tracks section, giving it ways to play favourites with musicians. Apple Music cautiously embraced by record industry as regulators pursue antitrust probe The dustup over exclusives comes at a critical time for Spotify, which is in the midst of renegotiating licensing contracts with the world’s biggest record labels. The company is aiming to hold an initial public offering by the end of next year, but needs more favourable long-term agreements with the labels to attract a higher valuation from investors, according to a person familiar with the plans. The company isn’t profitable despite generating more than $2 billion in revenue, in part because it has to give 55 per cent of the money to labels and an additional cut to publishers. It’s not clear whether major artists like Drake and Ocean have been affected by Spotify’s measures, and their representatives didn’t respond to questions. In any case, artists of their stature need less help from Spotify to draw attention to their music, emerging acts rely on the service to find new listeners. The company has threatened to use its retaliatory practices on lesser-known artists who introduce music on a Beats One show hosted by DJ Zane Lowe, an architect of Apple’s radio service, the people said. ‘Call it Apple tax’: why iPhone users often overpay for music streaming and other apps One representative of a singer-songwriter said the client cancelled plans to debut a song on Lowe’s show because of concern that the artist would lose promotion from Spotify. The agent asked not to be identified, and that the artist not be named, to avoid damaging relationships with the music-streaming companies. Lowe, a former BBC radio host, has introduced new tracks from his first day on the air with Beats One, and his show has become an important platform to debut songs worldwide. Apple and Spotify have been feuding since before Apple Music’s debut, and competition between the two ratcheted up again in the last several weeks after Apple proposed changing songwriting royalties in a way that would increase costs for competitors like Spotify by putting its music in a different category that requires a higher rate. Spotify has also accused Apple of blocking a new version of its iPhone app, the latest volley in an ongoing dispute over Apple’s cut of sales from its app store. Apple denied blocking Spotify’s app, saying its rival hadn’t met its terms of service. Led by former record executive Jimmy Iovine, Apple Music has kept its strategy flexible to appeal to what an artist wants. In the case of Frank Ocean and Drake, the company paid for exclusives. With Adele and Beyonce, it agreed to keep the music off its streaming service and initially only make it available for a paid download. The company also has been appealing to artists and industry executives by limiting its streaming service to paying subscribers and not having a free advertising-supported version like Spotify. Artists vs Apple: Taylor Swift’s win over tech giant reveals rifts in music industry Spotify has decried exclusive deals as harmful to musicians, fans and the growing business of music streaming. However, it has sought to make exclusive deals with some artists, such as rock band the 1975, but refused to limit the release to the company’s paid service only, as labels and musicians have sought, two of the people said. Spotify has said a robust free service is needed to attract new users who can eventually become subscribers.  Record labels are still pushing Spotify to let artists release music for paying subscribers only, and have yet to sign new long-term deals with the service as a result. Yet Apple’s ability to attract those big exclusives may also be in jeopardy. In an internal memo last week, Lucian Grainge, chief executive officer of Vivendi SA’s Universal Music Group, directed the heads of his company’s labels to stop giving any music services long-term exclusives, according to two people familiar with the matter. Universal has sold Apple many of its biggest exclusives, including Drake.

Artist's 46-year-old loo paper to be studied 7:25 AM Monday Aug 29, 2016 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Science Billy Apple's decades-old lavatory paper is now part of a scientific study at Auckland University. Photo / Otago Daily Times One of the most shocking exhibitions in the history of British art - featuring tissues soiled by Billy Apple ­­- is now the focus of a new Kiwi scientific study. When the artist unveiled his work Body Activities ­- consisting of tissues and cotton buds stained with excrement and other bodily fluids - at London's Serpentine Gallery in 1974, authorities immediately ordered it be taken down. But he kept all the original tissues and more than 45 years later, researchers have found a new purpose for them, in the latest intriguing collaboration between the 80-year-old and top New Zealand scientists. "Billy has provided us with fecal samples that are 46 years apart, and by looking at the bacteria from these, we can understand how Billy's gut bacteria have changed," said Dr Justin O'Sullivan, of the Auckland University-based Liggins Institute. "These types of samples are extremely rare." In the study, being led by PhD student Thilini Jayasinghe, the team is using a method called "16S amplicon sequencing" which effectively takes copies and sequences regions of the bacterial DNA. These are then used to search a database and identify the bacteria. "It has a lot of similarity to the toll gate on the northern express way - cars pass through, number plates are photographed, and then the numbers used to identify the individual cars from the database." Continued below.

"This project provides us with a new avenue through which we can expose a different audience to the scientific advances that are changing our understanding of ourselves - as walking, talking ecosystems. "More studies like this will help us understand how bacteria change us and contribute to non-communicable diseases." Apple was amused at the renewed interest in the work. "Who the hell keeps their tissues for 46 years unless it's an art work?" he told the Herald. "But for them, it's a pretty special project, and I'm just thrilled to be able to work with them." Apple has a long history of collaborating with scientists and bridging the worlds of research and art. In 1970, he collaborated on an installation, Laser Beam Wall, with renowned physicist and white light laser pioneer Dr Stanley Shapiro. Four decades later, at the instigation of Dr Craig Hilton, Otago University-based New Zealand Genomics Ltd sequenced Apple's entire genome. Some of his personal genetic information is detailed in a diagram and printed onto canvas which the artist likens to a new type of self-portrait. In 2008, in another project with Hilton, dubbed "The Immortalisation Of Billy Apple®", cells were taken from his blood and scientifically altered using a virus so that they would keep regenerating forever. The cell lines - formally named after Billy Apple® - are now held at University of Auckland's School of Biological Sciences and the American Type Culture Collection, Virginia, a biological culture repository that aids studies in areas such as cancer research. "It's a curious thing for an artist - I'm in a collection in a cell bank, it's just like one of my works being in the Tate Britain collection: it's incredible. "The body may go but the cells will live on." Works by Apple, who is represented by Auckland's Starkwhite, will also be showcased as part of Queenstown Research Week - this year staged in Nelson - this week. The diagram of his genome will be presented in a talk to researchers, while the exhibition Cell Culture runs at Nelson's Suter Gallery until Sunday. About Billy • Born Barrie Bates in Auckland, changed his name to Billy Apple in 1962 and became a registered trademark in 2007. • Moved to New York in 1964 and spent the 1960s and 1970s heavily involved in the pop art movement. His work is now held in museums and galleries around the world. • Has had his entire genome sequenced and donated a cell line, formally named after him, to research. - NZ Herald Read more by Jamie Morton Email Jamie Morton Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Charges over Kerikeri ute crash The driver of a ute that crashed into three lamp posts and rolled in Northland yesterday… Hawke's Bay Today Tourists' envy at best job around Gannet Beach Adventures managing director Kim Lindsay says the company is seeing a hike… Bay of Plenty Times Book shop closure end of an era The boom in charity fundraising book sales has killed off the last book exchange on the… Our Features' Top Stories Driven Steady start for new Mustang drift car New Mustang prepped for opening D1NZ drift hit out at Manfeild...

What’s worse is when foreign authorities change the rules that attracted the money in the first place, and tax those holdings for themselves. In effect, the European Commission is threatening to do just that. Apple and other US companies could soon be hit with retrospective demands for tax running into the billions of dollars. This week the Barack Obama administration objected, accusing the commission of, among other things, exceeding its authority and violating the norms of international tax policy. Neither side is entirely in the wrong. Mainly, though, the squabble underlines a larger point that should have been obvious already. Taxing multinationals fairly and efficiently requires both an entirely new approach in the US and much closer cooperation among governments. The Apple case began as an internal European Union dispute. The commission is investigating whether Ireland’s tax treatment of the company’s earnings amounts to illegal state aid. It suspects Apple of using “transfer pricing” to shift profits to Ireland, and Ireland of helping the company do this by means of tendentious tax opinions. Ireland’s main corporate tax rate is already low, at 12.5 percent — the US’ is 35 percent, give or take — and these maneuvers are said to have cut the rate paid by Apple to almost nothing. If the commission rules that this amounts to an illegal subsidy, Apple may have to pay billions in back taxes. The commission is right to make sure member states’ tax policies conform to Europe’s single-market rules. Far more debatable is the remedy the commission proposes when it finds the rules have been broken. In a case of illegal state aid, the principal offender is the government, not the company that benefited. If Apple and the other companies followed the EU’s national tax rules in good faith, a hefty retroactive tax bill would be unjust. It would also defeat the purposes of certainty and clarity in tax administration. The US Treasury objects to the retrospective remedy on those very grounds — but its real grievance is that the profits at risk of incurring back taxes would in due course probably have been repatriated to the US, allowing the US to tax them excessively. With the US tax code in its current state, the administration is hardly in a position to lecture other governments on the subject of clarity and certainty in tax policy. The charge that the commission is violating international tax norms is especially rich, considering the US is almost unique in taxing its companies on their worldwide income and its citizens regardless of where in the world they live and work. By far the best remedy for the US complaint would be to fix the US tax system. For corporate taxes, that means two things: Apply a lower, internationally competitive rate to a simpler and broader base. And switch to a “territorial system” — as is used almost everywhere else — which taxes profits according to where they’re earned, not where the company resides. These reforms wouldn’t eliminate international tax avoidance, but they would reduce it, both directly and by making it easier for governments to cooperate effectively to that end. The alternative is to feud and strike postures — a lot easier than comprehensive tax reform, admittedly, but much less productive.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     2017 IPhone Will Not Feature Legendary Home Button Posted: Aug 28 2016, 1:08am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple   mobipicker   The article published on Bloomberg about the FeliCa mobile payments making their way to iPhones in Japan in the future contained a lot of hints about the outlook of the future iPhone as a whole. Don't Miss: Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 These hints are about what to expect from Apple in 2017 in regards to its iPhone range. iPhone will celebrate its 10 years anniversary next year and to mark the momentous occasion people are expecting Apple to come up with some major changes in the iPhone which are all expected to be for the better. One if these changes hints at a complete redesign of the front of the iPhone. It is rumored that the iPhone released in 2017 will ditch the home button and will instead have a complete touch screen system in store. Bloomberg had the following to say on the matter “Apple is already at work on a major redesign of the iPhone for 2017 that focuses more heavily on the display by removing the Home button, according to a person familiar with the matte. …”. The rumor about an all touch iPhone has been going out for quite a while and was often mentioned amidst the discussions on the upcoming iPhone 7, scheduled to release this fall. One other part of the redesign is the glass casing for the iPhone which has been under development and experimentation by Foxconn for more than a year. Apple will surly have to figure out how to incorporate the TouchID sensor within the glass touch display. The 3D touch home key which we have been hearing about for quite a while has already been incorporated within the new iPhone 7. This could be the first piece of the puzzle for the technology required to make Apple’s 2017 plans come true.

The light becomes warmer and the air becomes cooler. Days shorten and the leaves begin to shrivel on the trees before their inevitable fall over the next few months. Summer draws to an end and autumn begins – the season that bears my favourite fruits. From apples to muscat and fragolina grapes, and of course figs along with their leaves, the flavours at this time of year are simultaneously common and complex. Let’s begin with the apple. We all know apples well, or we think we do. Their ability to store well and grow easily in this climate have made them a fruit bowl fixture. I challenge you to walk past the sadly bagged-up apples at the supermarket and seek out some of the truly interesting varieties that can be found at farmer’s markets and smaller shops. I tried one last year called a Chegworth Beauty, and I always love the Discovery apple – one of the first of the season to appear. For a tarte tatin, which falls somewhere between a pie and a tart, you are looking for a decent-sized apple with a firm texture and plenty of acidity. The large pieces of apple in this tart should keep their natural shape once baked for almost an hour, but still be soft and tender so that a spoon can easily pass through them. A good cook should never be afraid to slightly burn the caramel either. A dark caramel adds welcome bitterness to your baking. If you savour another challenge, make your own puff pastry. Here I have one for my rough puff, which is relatively quick to make. I have to admit, I usually have a block of ready-made in my freezer, but the real thing tastes so much better. Apple tarte tatin with pink peppercorns (main picture) Serves 6-8 3 tbsp butter 135g caster sugar 10-12 large apples peeled, cored and quartered ¼ tsp pink peppercorns, roughly ground 500g puff pastry, rolled into a 26cm circle and chilled For the sauce 200g sugar 2 tbsp water 100ml apple juice 25g unsalted butter, cut into 1cm pieces Salt and brandy or calvados, to taste (optional) Creme fraiche, to serve 1 Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Have ready an ice-water bath large enough for a 25cm cast iron frying pan or copper tatin mould. Caramelise 2 tbsp butter and 6 tbsp of sugar over a high heat, swirling the pan now and then. Once the sugar has dissolved, use a wooden spoon or balloon whisk to bring it all together. Do not worry if it splits or crystallises, as it will dissolve again during the baking process. You want a deep, dark caramel. Remove from the heat and immediately put the pan on the ice water to stop the caramel from colouring any further. 2 Arrange the apples, bearing in mind they will be upside down when done, so make them look pretty. I place the curved side down into the caramel, cored-side up. Place a second layer of apples on top, cored-side down, and press gently with your hands coaxing them to fit together like a puzzle. 3 Sprinkle the ground peppercorns over the top. Cover with the disc of rolled, chilled pastry, tucking the edges in between the apples and the pan. Melt the remaining 1 tbsp butter and brush the pastry with it. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tbsp sugar, then pierce several times with a knife to allow steam to escape during baking. Claire Ptak’s sweet plum recipes | Baking Read more 4 Bake the tarte tatin for 45-55 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp and golden, the sugar has started to caramelise on top, and the apple beneath is starting to bubble up at the edges. 5 Meanwhile, make the sauce. Add the sugar and water to a heavy-based pan and cook over a medium heat until dissolved, swirling the pan gently, without stirring. Once dissolved, raise the heat to high and caramelise. Have your apple juice ready. Once the caramel is a dark amber colour, remove from the heat immediately and stop the cooking by carefully pouring in the apple juice and whisking. Drop in the butter, and whisk until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Add a little salt or 1 tbsp apple brandy, if you like. 6 Remove from the oven and allow the tart to sit undisturbed for 10 minutes. Have ready a large plate that will completely cover the top of the tarte tatin. Using extreme caution, place the plate over the pan and, using an oven glove or tea towel wrapped around the outside, quickly flip the pan over and turn the tart out on to the plate in one smooth motion, being cautious of any hot liquid or steam that might escape. 7 Serve with a dollop of creme fraiche and the apple caramel sauce poured over the top. Rough puff pastry Makes around 1kg 500g butter 190ml ice cold water 1 tsp lemon juice 280g plain flour 100g bread flour ½ tsp fine sea salt 1 Cut the butter into 2cm cubes and arrange them on a baking sheet. Freeze. Add the lemon juice to the water and keep in the fridge. 2 In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine both flours with the salt. Add the chilled butter on a low speed and mix to knock off the corners of the cubes. 3 With the mixer running, drizzle in the water and lemon juice mixture until it just comes together as a raggedy dough. 4 Lay a piece of parchment on your work surface, and turn the dough out on to it. Shape the dough into a block. Roll to 38 x 25cm. Fold in thirds, like a letter, make an impression with your thumb on the top, cover loosely with clingfilm and chill for 20 minutes. Repeat 4 more times (5 in total), resting for 20 minutes in between each roll and fold. 5 After the fifth turn, divide the dough into two blocks. Use right away or freeze until needed.

By Shruthi PK Posted on August 28, 2016 1 Share Share Tweet Share Share Email The Apple Watch 2 launch is likely to happen very soon. This, because the existing models have received a price cut. Check out the details here. Now, you can have the Apple Watch Sport 38-mm for $199 from Best Buy. While the Apple Watch Sport 42-mm is priced at $299. The wearable gadget sports a space grey anodized aluminum case, Ion-X glass, retina display with Force Touch, composite back and digital crown. It has also packed wonderful sensors like the heart rate sensor and the accelerometer. Other features are gyroscope, ambient light sensor and speaker and microphone. The Apple watch is also equipped with Wi-Fi (802.11b/g/n 2.4GHz). It is also splash and water resistant but not waterproof. This means that the user can wear the Apple Watch while exercising and while washing hands but the gadget should not be submerged. The discounted Apple watch also comes with a one year warranty. Apple Watch 2 Features: What We Know So Far? According to ValueWalk, the Apple Watch 2 will utilize a ?One Glass Solution? display (OGS) instead of a Glass/Glass (G/G) display. So, the brand can eliminate one glass layer from the display which was used in the original Apple Watch. Those layers of glass will be replaced by a thinner material. It will create a lot of space. Apple’s decision will also reduce the weight of the gadget. Apple Watch 2 will be powered by the S2 processor, which is manufactured by TSMC. The Apple Watch 2 is not likely to pack smart bands. The previous band had awesome health sensors in it. It was one of the best features of the Apple Watch Original. ?One great example is [when] I went to a meeting and said I?m going to put sensors in the watch but I?m going to put them down here (he points to the underside of the Apple Watch band he?s wearing) because I can get a more accurate reading on the bottom of the wrist than I can get on the top of the wrist. They (the Industrial Design group) said very quickly that ?that?s not the design trend; that?s not the fashion trend. We want to have interchangeable bands so we don?t want to have any sensors in the band,? Apple employee Bob Messerschmidt said. He was one of the designers of Apple Watch Original?s heart rate sensor. Keep visiting TheBitBag for more updates.

Skip to content Search for: Search Kopitiam Bot News · Lifestyle · Tech · Singapore Home Current Affairs Technology Startups Money Matters Lifestyle Contact Us About Technology Hands on: Parallels Desktop 12 now comes with backup options Date: 2016-08-28Author: kopitiambot (Source: www.techgoondu.com) Parallels Desktop, which lets Mac users run Windows programs alongside their Apple variants, isn’t new to those who want the best of both worlds. The new version, launched in Singapore last week, brings a number of new features to folks who might be thinking of multi-tasking between Mac and Windows programs. Parallels Desktop 12 now gives you incremental backups on your Windows environment via Acronis, a well-known online backup service for Windows users. Not only is this useful for those who aren’t sure how to go about this, the new add-on also works in the background, so it frees up more time to work on your Mac. The offer is free for 500GB of backup for a year. The Acronis True Image service costs S$59.99 a year, if bought separately. New tool is the Parallels toolbox. Here, you’d find various shortcut to get into your common tasks. I am particularly impressed with their the video shortcut tools. I can download straight from video websites such as YouTube, convert them to another format or even record the screen. That’s helpful if you want to do a training video with your Mac. If I want to show how to troubleshoot something on the machine or provide photo post-editing instructions to students, this would be helpful. Another useful shortcut is the Screenshot tool. It takes a screenshot of the active window and not just the whole screen itself so I don’t need to crop the image. The usual Parallels Desktop advantages will also wow those who are new to the virtualisation software, which essentially lets you run one operating system – usually Windows – over the Mac OS. Sure, you can get software for the Mac, say, a version of Microsoft Office, but many customised corporate applications from the workplace won’t have similar Mac versions. Of course, you can also run boot up to Windows separately, using Apple’s Bootcamp, but that means having to choose either Windows or Mac OS. What if I want to copy something from one Windows program to a Mac program? You can’t. In comparison, Parallels Desktop is much easier to install. The app just works like any other app within the Mac environment. If you want a Windows OS, you just have to fire up Parallels Desktop and it feels as though you are working on a PC. You can also easily have a desktop shortcut of a Windows App on the Mac desktop and have it activated directly on the Mac Desktop. Another added plus – Parallels Desktop allows Windows Office Ink to be used with a Mac-based stylus system. You might worry that the computer reaction speed can be an issue since the Mac has to translate all the machine and software code from Mac to Windows and vice-versa. The worry seems quite unfounded based on what I saw during a demonstration last week. I didn’t detect any significant lag, at least on a modern Mac. That said, pushing the Mac to play demanding PC-based games might be another story. I didn’t try this out last week, so I can’t say for sure if you can play smoothly. If that is your main goal, I’d suggest downloading a trial copy of Parallels Desktop 12, and firing up your games to see if things run fine. Good news is that Parallels Desktop 12 now comes with optimised support for Overwatch, one of the most popular online games today. It also supports the Xbox app on Windows 10, which lets you stream and play Xbox games on your Mac. You can buy Parallels Desktop 12 as a standalone app for S$108 or pay a subscription cost of US$99 (S$135) each year for the Pro and Business editions. The Parallels toolbox can also be purchased as a standalone app at US$9.99 (S$13.50).

Gadget Gestures Lets Gesture about Gadgets Saturday, January 7, 2017 Log in News Tablets SmartPhones Laptops Cameras Games Apps/Softwares iPad/iPhone Why iPhone 7 could be the best phone on the market August 27, 2016 By Mary Duncan Leave a Comment Follow Why iPhone 7 could be the best phone on the market If you didn’t know by now, iPhone 7 will be released next month and it seems it will be better than the devices Apple had. The new iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will have new features in the attempt of getting more people to use these devices. Even though there will always be people for and against Apple, this new device might be a good one if the company pays attention to what its consumers want. There were rumours on the Internet about this new phone and we can’t wait to find out which of them are true. One of the biggest changes iPhone 7 could have is the lack of a headphone jack. This way, the new device will be slimmer and more water-resistant. Another rumor, published by MacRumors, says that Apple might have some problems with the supply shortages as there are more interested people in this phone than they would expect. It is possible that the new iPhone will have a feature that allows us to pay for public transit just by using our phones. We do not know for sure if the device that will be launched in September will have this feature. Apple wants to build a chip into iPhones from Japan so users will have just to wave their phone in front a payment terminal. It will process the transaction in less than one second and this could be really helpful in big cities such as Tokio or New York. Another important thing is that iPhone 7 will be the last phone made by Apple with a Home button. They want to make their devices thinner and this is why the button might be gone in 2017. In its place it could be a Touch ID sensor, that will let you make contactless payments. The new iPhone could have better security features too and Apple promised it would be thinner, faster and you will be impressed by it. MacWorld also said that the iPhone 7 Plus will have a five and half inch screen and also dual-camera lens. We just have to wait a little time and we will find out if this new device is what we expected. We are sure there will be a lot of buyers in America and Europe. However, there are countries, such as China, where Apple has more to prove before it will become popular.

The discovery of the Pegasus spyware on an iPhone came as a shock to the cyber security world. The software was created by the Israeli company NSO as a way to spy on Apple, Android and Blackberry smartphone users. This cyber weapon is “by far the most sophisticated ever detected” on a mobile device, Gert-Jan Schenk, Europe and Middle East vice-president of Lookout – a company that analysed the virus – told FRANCE 24. He explained what is so unique about Pegasus. FRANCE 24: What makes Pegasus different from other mobile spyware? Gert-Jan Schenk: We’ve never seen spyware this sophisticated before. The user can’t detect the software on their smartphone, even after it has been contaminated. Plus, no data encryption can effectively protect against [Pegasus]. And its developers discovered three different security flaws that Apple didn’t know about. If Pegasus can override data encryption, does that mean it is able to follow conversations on WhatsApp and Telegram? You have to understand how Pegasus works. This spyware installs itself in the kernel of the phone – in other words at the heart of the operating system – which allows it to intercept conversations even before any encryption happens. It’s as if a spy could see what the user is typing on their keyboard. So basically the encryption of an app like WhatsApp or Telegram is useless against Pegasus. Could this program be used to fight terrorist groups like the Islamic State (IS), some of whose members use Telegram? Intelligence services can in effect use it for that purpose. It’s an unmatched tool for learning as much as possible about anyone since except for your spouse or partner, no one knows more about you than your phone. Since regulation of cyber-weapons sales is very loose, NSO can decide to sell Pegasus to whomever they see fit. The company says that it will only sell the software to “authorised entities”, but they are the ones who decide what fits into that category. They could mean a repressive government or a state-run corporate espionage service. That regulatory vagueness is very dangerous when we’re talking about a digital weapon as dangerous as this. But didn’t Apple issue a security update that should fix the problem? First of all, the same software exists for Android and Blackberry, and we can assume that it is just as powerful. Second, Apple’s update only guarantees that Pegasus can no longer be installed on iPhones. But the spyware will continue to exist on smartphones that have already been contaminated, without the owners even noticing. We’ll have to find out if the Apple update is effective against cyber spies who want to gain access to iPhones remotely.

This feature lessens the impact on your natural sleep patterns. Apple’s similar feature is called Night Shift, and I wrote about that in A Quick Look at iOS 9.3. But Windows PC users have had this kind of functionality for years courtesy of a free third-party utility called f.lux. The theory behind Night Mode and those other similar solutions is that using bright screens at night impacts our natural sleep patterns, which rely, caveman-like, on the sun’s schedule. That is, by introducing bright light at a time that would otherwise be dark, we’re fooling our bodies into thinking it’s day, making it harder to go to sleep and then obtain high-quality sleep. I also find the harsh light of digital devices to cause eye strain, and I’ve observed many times while reading on a phone or tablet at night that the simple act of squeezing my eyes shut is actually a bit painful. Night Mode was included in the pre-release versions of Android 7.0 Nougat, but Google for some reason has hid the feature in the final release. (Curiously, I still see Night Mode in Quick Settings on my Nexus 6P, but it’s notwhere to be found on the Nexus 9.) But anyone with Android 7.0 Nougat can enable it with the Night Mode Enabler app, which is available for free in the Google Play Store. To configure Night Mode, open the app and select Enable Night Mode. System UI Tuner settings will appear. Here, you can configure various settings related to Night Mode, such as whether it is enabled automatically when dark. You’ll notice a warm, orange-like tint to the screen when Night Mode is enabled. And hopefully you’ll sleep better too. 🙂 You can also manually enable Night Mode in the Quick Settings area in the notification shade. If you don’t see it there, choose EDIT to add it to the visible choices.   Tagged with Android N Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

May Tap Intel Corporation for Future A-Series Chip Manufacturing Nikkei, citing comments from an industry analyst, reports that Intel could manufacture Apple's custom-designed A-series processors by 2018 or 2019. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 27, 2016 at 7:05PM Image source: Getty.  Just a few days ago, I penned a column speculating on whether smartphone giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would tap microprocessor specialist Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for the manufacture of iPhone-bound applications processors at some point in the future. According to a report from Nikkei, citing comments from Gartner analyst Samuel Wang, Intel has "begun to engage with Apple" for such foundry work. The analyst also believes that Intel "is likely to gain orders from Apple" by either 2018 or 2019. The foundry jackpot Until now, most of the contract chip manufacturing deals that Intel has made public have been ones with seemingly limited volume and revenue potential to Intel. However, winning a significant portion of Apple's A-series chip business would bring meaningful revenue to the company. It would also allow Intel to control an even greater portion of the industrywide unit volumes on cutting-edge chip manufacturing technology. If we assume that Apple pays around $22 per A-series processor (this is the estimate put out there by IHS Technology ), then at around 200 million units shipped per year, the revenue opportunity for the manufacture of these processors works out to roughly $4.4 billion per year. If Intel can get this deal done (something that, frankly, I'd have to see to believe), grabbing a piece of that pie would be a positive for the company and its stockholders. A potential positive for Apple Readers may remember a recent report from DIGITIMES claiming that Apple is trying to squeeze its suppliers for iPhone 7 component orders. That same report said that Apple wasn't going to try to squeeze Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) "simply because it is difficult for Apple to find alternative sources to replace TSMC." If Intel can become a credible second source to TSMC for A-series contract chip manufacturing, then Apple may be able to get better pricing on these chips. That better pricing could allow Apple to either expand its gross profit margins per device (even a few dollars saved across hundreds of millions of units adds up to a non-trivial amount of incremental gross profit) or it could allow Apple the freedom to pack even more features and functionality into its chips at roughly the same manufacturing cost. A potential negative for TSMC If Intel does, in fact, wind up winning some A-series processor orders from Apple, this would be a negative for TSMC. I wouldn't expect Intel to become the primary source for A-series chips in the event that Apple actually uses Intel, but going from 100% allocation to TSMC (as is widely expected for the upcoming A10 and the follow-on A11 chips) to, say, 60%-70% allocation would hurt year-over-year revenue comparisons. Additionally, with Intel in the mix, TSMC might have to price more aggressively, which would drive down average selling prices and, potentially, gross profit margins on the chips that Apple does buy from TSMC. That being said, I would be very careful about predicting gloom and doom for TSMC. The company's execution over the last several years has been nothing short of excellent, and I expect that the chip manufacturer will continue to very aggressively push technology development in a bid to try to keep all of Apple's orders (as well as orders from other top mobile customers) flowing through its factories.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The new Galaxy S6 and its double curved-screen variant the Galaxy S6 Edge, released on Sunday on the sidelines of an annual trade show here, outlines Samsung’s latest strategy for finding its footing: take on Apple’s iPhone head on, while bringing even more of the manufacturing process under its control. The new phone will be available globally starting April 10. In the US, Samsung said it would be offered by all the major carriers, including Verizon Wireless, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. The stakes are high for Samsung, which saw its previous flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S5, fall flat with consumers. In the one year since that launch, the smartphone market has become more challenging for the South Korean tech giant. On the high end, Apple’s enlarged iPhones drove record sales and challenged Samsung’s dominance of premium large-screen smartphones. On the low end, Chinese and Indian players released a raft of sleek handsets priced at a fraction of comparable Samsung smartphones. To reverse the damage, Samsung is releasing a new device that directly rebuts many of the criticisms that dogged its predecessor. In contrast to the mostly plastic Galaxy S5, the S6 will come encased in a slim frame made of reinforced glass and aircraft-grade aluminum. Samsung also matched Apple’s mobile payment service with one of its own, dubbed Samsung Pay, and designed it to work with the magnetic-stripe machines that are found at nine out of 10 cash registers in the US. To address complaints that Samsung phones were bogged down with little-used software, the company removed many of its apps and streamlined the user interface. Unlike Apple, Samsung also appears to be pinning more of its software and services hopes on partners such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft, all of which will get prominent placement on Galaxy S6 devices as Samsung pulls many of its own apps. Perhaps most important for Samsung’s attempts to reverse its sliding profit is what is inside the device: application processors developed entirely in-house rather than chips from Qualcomm, giving Samsung more control over almost all the components in its handset. The new smartphone is the product of a period of soul-searching after a stretch of dominance that began in 2012 with the launch of the Galaxy S III. At one point in 2013, Samsung outsold Apple by nearly three times, while using its scale and marketing muscle to sideline other rivals selling smartphones powered by Google’s Android operating system. Company executives now acknowledge that they grew complacent by the release of the Galaxy S5 last year, which they framed at the time as a “back to basics” smartphone that deliberately eschewed gimmickry in favour of a focus on improving everyday functions. It landed with a thud. The warehouses of unsold smartphones weighed on Samsung’s bottom line, dragging full-year operating profit down 32% last year from a year earlier. Late last year, Samsung ousted its mobile marketing and research and development chiefs and released a series of mid-range smartphones to directly take on low-end challengers in China and India. For the new flagship phone, Samsung executives code-named the development process “Project Zero”, part of a broader bid to go “back to the drawing board”, in the words of Young-hee Lee, Samsung’s head of mobile marketing. “We’re learning from our missteps,” Ms Lee said in an interview. The company reconfigured its production process to be able to crank out high volumes of curved-screen smartphone displays and aluminum cases, and laid the foundation for new features like the mobile payment system through its acquisition in February of LoopPay, a US start-up. Executives also tried to rein in unrealistic sales expectations that weighed on company earnings. “There was a lot of learning from last year,” Ms Lee said. This year, she said, “we should worry about being out of stock, not overstock”. The curved variant would retail for about $100 more than the Galaxy S6, and would be “in the same price bracket” as the Galaxy S5, Ms Lee said. The Galaxy S5 sold in the US for about $200 with a two-year contract. Apart from the curved screen, the S6 and S6 Edge will otherwise be virtually identical, and both will be in mass production. The S6 has a 5.1-inch display and higher resolution screen than the iPhone 6, which has a 4.7-inch display. The S6 has a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera, which is twice what Apple offers, and the phone supports wireless charging technologies. The biggest shift for Samsung may be the least obvious to most consumers. By using its own 64-bit Exynos processors to displace the Qualcomm processors that were long a mainstay of Samsung’s premium smartphones, Samsung will pocket more profit from each device that it sells. The chips, manufactured on a 14-nanometre chip process technology that is a step ahead of its rivals, will translate into better performance and battery life, analysts say. Compared with the S5, Samsung is offering more built-in storage, a higher-resolution display and a 5 megapixel front-facing camera on its newest model. The S6 also has a touch-activated fingerprint scanner, a switch from a swipe-activated scanner on the S5 that users complained did not always work well.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Faster Apple Watch 1 Models Said to Launch Alongside Apple Watch 2 Later This Year Faster Apple Watch 1 Models Said to Launch Alongside Apple Watch 2 Later This Year Monday, 8 August 2016 In addition to predicting an all-new Apple Watch 2 with a GPS, barometer, larger battery, and more, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo 2016 today claimed that upgraded first-generation Apple Watch models with faster TSMC-built processors and superior waterproofing will likely launch in the second half of 2016. Kuo said the upgraded Apple Watch 1 models will not have a GPS, barometer, or other larger additions reserved for the Apple Watch 2, nor will the waterproofing improvements be as significant, suggesting only an incremental refresh of internal hardware. The watches are said to retain a similar form factor. The well-connected analyst expects another Apple Watch price cut once the new models are launched, but he did not specify whether the reduction will apply to existing first-generation models, upgraded first-generation models, Apple Watch 2 models, or some combination of the three lineups. Apple lowered the starting price of the Apple Watch Sport to $299 in March 2016, a savings of $50 compared to the device's initial $349 launch price in April 2015. Apple has been pushing iPhone and Apple Watch sales together, so updated models of each device launching in tandem would be appropriate. The tentatively named iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are rumored to launch on September 16, with pre-orders possibly starting a week earlier on September 9, so all-new Apple Watch 2 and upgraded Apple Watch 1 models could debut around those dates.Related Roundups: Apple Watch, watchOS 2, watchOS 3 Buyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Caution) Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Bloomberg Technology - on August 18, 2016< > Embed Apple Said to Hit Snag Cutting Apple Watch, iPhone Ties 01:58 Aug. 18 -- Apple Inc. has reportedly hit roadblocks in making the Apple Watch less dependent on the iPhone ahead of an expected announcement of new models this fall.

PC-Tablet News Rumors Updates Smartphones Apps Wearables Gaming Accessories Editorials Apple iPhone 7 rumors: Next iPhone to have dual SIM support, no 3.5mm headphone jack By James Miller - August 27, 2016 With the WWDC 2016 over and Apple having released iOS 10, all we’ve got to do is wait for the company to bring us their latest iPhone 7. New information by a Chinese mobile repair store ‘Rock Fix’ suggests that a few aspects of the phone will be different despite the wide-spread rumors of consumers’ expectations. The images were reported by Engadget and tell us what we can probably expect from the upcoming iPhone 7. iPhone 7 Design There have been news that the iPhone 7 will not have the 3.5mm headphone jack. Apple too ascertained that they would be ditching the traditional headphone jack to support audio playback through their lightning port. Rock Fix’s images also say that the new iPhone will offer dual-SIM capabilities. The first iPhone to do so, you may be able to use two SIM-cards on an iPhone after all this time. As rumored earlier too, the iPhone 7 will come with wireless charging capabilities so you are likely to see a SmartConnector at the back of the device. The phone will sport antennas towards the top of the phone on either side, probably to accommodate the change of modem chip on the GSM models. iPhone 7 Specifications The images reported by Engadget say that there will indeed be a dual-camera on one of the variants of the iPhone 7. So far the phone is expected to be released in three variants: iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Premium. You will see the dual-camera set-up on the larger phone, but we don’t know if it’s going to be both the Plus and Premium that will get it. Rumors say the iPhone 7 Premium will come along with 3GB RAM in order to support the dual-camera set-up smoothly. A SanDisk memory chip that reads 256GB is also featured among the photographs telling us that the iPhone 7 will ditch the entry-level 16GB storage variant and will run with 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB of storage options. Another report draws light on the fact that some of the iPhone 7 models will come with Intel’s modem chips over Qualcomm’s solutions. The new 4.7-inch variants of the iPhone 7 will be made by a new vendor Pegatron, while the larger variants will continue to be manufactured by Foxconn.

However, there are already many rumors regarding the release date, but we think that there are two potential dates when this will most likely happen. According to a report from a trustworthy source, Apple will unveil its iPhone 7 device on September 7, 2016. However, before that, we remind you that Evan Blass, a well-known leaker, has tweeted that pre-orders for this device will start on September 9, 2016 and the in-store launch will happen on September 16, 2016. However, according to new a leak from AT&T retail staff, September 23 2016 might actually be the launch date of the iPhone 7. We can say that September 16 and September 23 sound ok for the release date of this new device, as Apple is expected to bring the new smartphone on the first or second Friday following the first day of pre-orders. We remind you that Blass has tweeted a few days ago, saying that he believes that iPhone 7 will be released on September 16, 2016. Blass said back then that he is quite confident about this date. He also quoted his previews tweet, where he stated that the iPhone 7 will be available in stores on September 16, 2016. When it comes to mobile leaks, Evan Blass has proved in the past that he has some pretty good informers. In other words, instead of believing some unverified AT&T leaks, we prefer to trust Blass’ leaks. However, let’s not forget that Apple hasn’t said anything about the release date of iPhone 7, so there’s nothing 100% sure. When do you think that Apple will release the iPhone 7? Have you saved any money to buy the next generation iPhone or are you going to buy it with a contract?

We have two fresh leaks for you: a famous Taiwanese pop star, Jimmy Lin, was photographed with what looks like the iPhone 7 Plus and popular tipster Evan Blass has categorically confirmed that the retail release date of the next iPhones will be on September 16. Blass stated that he is very confident about this date. Please note that Apple hasn’t sent out press invites yet for the event and therefore we still cannot confirm what the actual launch date (or release date) will be. FWIW, I'm very confident in this date. https://t.co/iaA7rZHpCa — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 23, 2016 If you are from Taiwan, you know Jimmy Lin. He is a popular ex-pop star and now works as an actor. But, the one thing he is known more for is the fact that he has been photographed with Apple iPhones in the past even before they were launched. In 2012, Lin was photographed with the Apple iPhone 5, which he then shared, via a popular Chinese social media equivalent of Twitter called Weibo. He had also leaked the iPhone 5c in 2013. Fast forward to 2014 and once again Lin was captured showcasing the iPhone 6 alongside the iPhone 5s. In fact, he was also seen with the iPhone 6 in the same year on a desk while he was repairing the shattered screen of his iPhone 5s. Interestingly, all the phones that he has leaked in the past look like the actual devices that Apple eventually launched, and therefore Lin’s leaks hold some sort of credibility. Taiwanese celebrity Jimmy Lin spotted w/ an #iPhone7Plus but is #iPhone7 going to be boring? https://t.co/vBxHxNu5nY pic.twitter.com/c00WGLsIKC — Michael Sherlock (@therevivedone) August 23, 2016 Now, the iPhone 7 Plus that he is allegedly holding in the newest photograph has the dual-camera setup, which actually corroborates all the leaks surrounding the new camera setup. Unfortunately, the angle of the photo is such that it doesn’t show if the phone includes the headphone jack or not — it is widely rumored that Apple is planning to remove the headphone jack in favor of the lightning port for audio. Well, we will have to wait until the launch date to find out if Lin was actually holding the iPhone 7 Plus and if Evan Blass’ September 16 release date is legitimate. Taiwanese actor Jimmy Lin snapped posing with the unannounced Apple iPhone 7 Plus with dual camera setup https://t.co/vY1wQgDiBG — BGR India (@BGRIndia) August 22, 2016 In other iPhone news. Recently, Steve Wozniak, Apple’s co-founder, stated that he was concerned about the iPhone 7 without a headphone jack. Talking to the Australian Financial Review he said the following. “If it’s missing the 3.5mm earphone jack, that’s going to tick off a lot of people. I would not use Bluetooth. I don’t like wireless. If there’s a Bluetooth 2 that has higher bandwidth and better quality, that sounds like real music, I would use it. I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music. I have earphones with custom ear implants, they fit in so comfortably, I can sleep on them and everything. And they only come out with one kind of jack, so I’ll have to go through an adaptor. If there’s a Bluetooth 2 that has higher bandwidth and better quality, that sounds like real music, I would use it. But we’ll see. Apple is good at moving towards the future, and I like to follow that.” [Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for NAMM]Another news story that actually caused a bit of concern among the Apple fans is the fact that iFixit recently found out that there is a potential touchscreen problem that is plaguing iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users. “The iPhone screen stops responding to touch over time because of flexing circuitry and failing solder. The phones have two chips connected to a logic board that controls the display. Experts believe that the solder holding these chips becomes brittle and breaks under the constant pressure of screen pressing.” [Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Twitter China Chief Quits After Eight Months Now Read This: Android Nougat Updates For Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, HTC 10, & Nexus 6 Share 8 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Ershad Kaleebullah Tags: apple iphone 7, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus January 5, 2017 Kristen Stewart Slots Girlfriend Time Between Movies: ‘Twilight’ Star Works Rapidly Through Robert Pattinson, St. Vincent, And Alicia Cargile January 5, 2017 Serena Williams Compares Getting Engaged To Alexis Ohanian And Tacos On Instagram, ‘Frustrated’ With Tennis But Not At Husband-To-Be Comments LATEST HEADLINES Marvel’s Thor: Ragnarok Synopsis Confirms Thor v.

BERLIN, GERMANY - SEPTEMBER 19: A shopper ltries out the new Apple iPhone 6 at the Apple Store on the first day of sales of the new phone in Germany on September 19, 2014 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo: Sean Gallup/Getty Images) Fans of the Cupertino-company cannot wait for the iPhone 7 that is about to be unveiled in a couple of weeks. However, other news outlets say that the new Apple variant may have a shortage problem in time of its release in September. Supply Problems for iPhone 7 in its Release Business Insider reports that fans of the iPhone 7 cannot automatically buy the new smartphone in its launch due to a shortage problem with Apple latest flagship phone. Reasons for this is that Apple's suppliers are having trouble with making the components for the dual lens and the waterproof system that will be added to the iPhone 7. Also, if Apple followed its release date with the previous variants last year, the iPhone 7 might have a low supply in the beginning of the launch as some suppliers are trying to fix the low yield rates of their components. Meanwhile, Apple also has a dropped in sales for the past two quarters of this year. The company has experienced a major dropped in the demand with the upcoming iPhone 7 it's because of the lack of new features in the new models. The report further explained that Apple's placemen orders in the US are very conservative and the company's panel orders for the iPhone 7 are dropping around 20% in year-over-year. Which leaves one major suppliers such as Japan Display hungry for more orders. iPhone 7 Release Date The confirmed release of the iPhone 7 has just been announced all over the web with a Twitter post from Evan Blass, a well-known tipster for Apple variants. The tipster is confident that the Apple flagship will release on September 16. Pre-orders of the iPhone 7 online are expected to start on September 9. September 7 is still the big day that fans of the iPhone 7 will not miss out as the new variant will be presented to the public. For more iPhone 7 news and update stay tuned to Gamenguide!

By Christopher Morris on August 27, 2016 12:00 pm in Technology ShareTweetPostFlip The iPhone 7 will be released in September, always the most significant event of any smartphone calendar year. But many Apple fans already have their eyes trained firmly on the iPhone 8 successor, with many of the more revolutionary features that Apple is currently working on expected to emerge in this 2017 release. So what can we expect from these two major smartphone contenders? Here ValueWalk outlines all of the latest information emerging on the next two iPhone generations. iPhone 7 by Jimmy Benson, Flickr iPhone 7 Apple is expected to make several alterations to the iPhone 7 compared to previous releases when it is released next month. Perhaps the most notable physical change will be the elimination of the headphone jack; a notable external aspect of the iPhone range since its inception. Apple will instead produce a wireless music system for the iPhone 7, with the intention of enabling more design flexibility for the company. Dual-camera It is widely believed that Apple will include a dual-camera setup in at least one model of the iPhone 7 range. There is still some debate over precisely which smartphone versions will feature this revolutionary technology, but it is almost certain to make its debut this year. This new innovation in the iPhone range will enable superior photography to take place in darker conditions; a perennial bugbear of smartphone cameras. Curved screen There have been some suggestions that the iPhone 7 generation will feature a curved screen, following the inordinate success of this technology in Samsung products. It is likely that this would be offered as an alternative to a flatscreen iPhone 7. 16GB phased out It is believed that Apple will phase out the 16GB version of the iPhone range, with the level of storage required by contemporary smartphones simply far more than this paltry amount. Instead, the entry-level version of the iPhone 7 is likely to be a 32GB model. Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of global marketing, recently opened up on this subject, outlining Apple’s ethos for storage in the future. “The belief is more and more as we use iCloud services for documents and our photos and videos and music, that perhaps the most price-conscious customers are able to live in an environment where they don’t need gobs of local storage because these services are lightening the load.” iOS 10 The iPhone 7 will come complete with the latest iOS 10 version of Apple’s hugely successful operating system, with power-saving features and new smart home functionality expected to be central to its armory of features. Home button Some reports have suggested that Apple could remove the Home button from the exterior of the iPhone 7 unit, although this suggestion has died down significantly in recent weeks. It is still expected that at some point we will see the conventional Home button replaced, with Apple either opting for a more sophisticated and a flexible version of this external feature, or possibly relying on 3D Touch to deliver functionality relating to the traditional Home button. Battery Apple will increase the battery size in the iPhone 7 range, having been criticized for delivering devices with insufficient battery life previously. Leaked images have supported this idea, while murmurings from close to the Apple headquarters have suggested that the corporation will announce new power-saving features in its forthcoming operating system. Colors It is suggested that Apple will offer consumers more variety by producing iPhone 7 variants in “Space Black” and “Deep Blue”. This would mirror the efforts that the corporation has made with the Apple Watch series to provide as much flexibility and customization as possible. Image Source: ConceptsiPhone, YouTube iPhone 8 Apple is likely to release an iPhone 8 in 2017, partly to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the iPhone itself. The first iPhone was released back into 2007, with Apple having established the smartphone as an absolutely iconic brand ever since. Thus, we can expect many new features for this very special release. Home button Firstly, it is believed that Apple could finally eliminate the Home button when the iPhone 8 hits the market. This has been rumored for many years without coming to fruition. But whispers from close to the Apple supply chain suggest that the corporation believes that this feature of the iPhone range is becoming a little dated, and thus we can expect to see it shaken up significantly next year. Biometrics It is expected that the iPhone 8 will feature advanced biometrics, which would likely be centered around iris scanning and facial recognition. In line with this, a patent filed by Apple in April described a way of storing biometric data when an unauthorised user is detected, with the possibility of identifying thieves. There are even suggestions that the iPhone 8 will be able to employ machine learning in order to implement this feature effectively. Three models There is still some debate over the number of iPhone models which will emerge in September, but the consensus of opinion among analysts is that there will definitely be three mainstream iPhone versions by the time the iPhone 8 is release. The third will be a curved screen variant, possibly with the Pro moniker which has been so hotly tipped in the media. OLED Apple will also embrace OLED next year, with Samsung expected to provide this technology for the iPhone 8. This will be a double-edged sword for its Korean rival, on the one hand providing an attractive contract, but on the other ensuring that Apple catches up with the Galaxy range in terms of screen technology. Glass design Major Apple personnel have envisaged an iPhone built around a glass-based exterior for some time, and this could very well emerge with the iPhone 8. Murmurings from Apple supplier Catcher Technology have pointed to the suggestion that the iPhone 8 will utilize a fully glass body, something which hasn’t featured in the iPhone range since the release of the iPhone 4S. Edge-to-edge display Apple could also implement an edge-to-edge display with the iPhone 8, ensuring that that the corporation could eliminate the top and bottom bezels to create an even sleeker and more compact unit. It is unlikely that Apple will increase the size of the display in the iPhone 8, so this feature would be utilized in order to make the smartphone more convenient for consumers. A patent filed back in March 2015 outlined Apple technology which would help deliver this vision. “The man-machine interface device comprises an electronic display apparatus that is capable of presenting graphic text, images, icons, and other data typically shown on a screen, while further including a transparent finger touch sensor region that is seated above the display apparatus.” Headphone jack If Apple does not remove the headphone jack when the iPhone 7 is released, one can be absolutely certain that the switch to wireless music will occur with the iPhone 8 generation. Specs Finally, we can expect some knockouts specs when the iPhone 8 is released, with the switch to full HD resolution in the smartphone likely.

While the Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) is only limited to iPhone 6S Plus last year, now in 2016, both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are said to feature OIS. The base variant of iPhone 7 will be coming with 16GB while iPhone 7 Plus might start with 32GB of built-in storage. The Apple A10 powered iPhones will also skip the 3.5mm audio port and might come with lightning port EarPods. According to a Weibo post, few specifications of the 2017 iPhones are now confirmed. Apple will be launching iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 7 SE smartphones in 2017. As rumoured earlier, the devices will be powered by Apple A11 chipset which is said to be built on 10nm architecture. Both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will be first smartphones from Apple to feature AMOLED display. Though the company is said to include AMOLED display in 2016 iPhones, it is later postponed for next year due to low production volume. OPPO, the second largest Chinese smartphone manufacturer, has recently launched the non-AMOLED variant of the much popular OPPO R9 due to the lack of higher production volume.   The iPhone 8 will sport 5-inch display while the iPhone 8 Plus will come with a 5.5-inch display. The third device, iPhone 7 SE will sport a 4.7-inch display. Unlike the iPhone 6S or the upcoming iPhone 7; the iPhone 7 SE will be the most expensive entry-level variant. It still comes with TFT display unlike the iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus. Since there is a long time for the actual launch, we expect to see further changes while coming to the final products.

Whether or not they will fit the upcoming devices will be known only after they are launched. Image Source: Spigen Is Spigen taking a big risk? Spigen has extended the existing designs for the iPhone 6 family of devices as the new designs. The company is repeating its “slim armor” line and several other designs as well that feature kickstands or are capable of serving as wallet replacements, notes Apple Insider. Spigen has revealed 15 cases for the iPhone 7 Plus costing between $15 and $40, while there are 18 variants available in the same price range for the Phone 7, most of which offer a range of color options. Spigen says it will start shipping the cases in October. It is expected that the next iPhone will be slightly thinner than the iPhone 6, probably due to the removal of the analog headphone jack. A dual-lens camera design is featured in the larger 5.5-inch Plus variant that Spigen shows in case promotional materials. Releasing cases ahead of launch: a growing trend The trend of introducing iPhone cases ahead of launch based on leaked schematics and other rumors has been growing. This is because it is very lucrative to have cases on the first day of new devices are available. In 2011, based on leaked 3D models of the iPhone 5, case maker Hard Candy ordered $50,000 worth of steel moldings. All of them proved inaccurate when the company released the iPhone 4s. However, the company made a similar gamble with the iPod touch in 2010, which helped it cut manufacturing times dramatically and make the cases available in stores within a week of the product announcement, noted Apple Insider. Two other case manufacturers — Incase and Speck — have clarified that before starting the manufacturing process, they develop rough ideas. They claim not to use leaked specifications. They will begin manufacturing after Apple officially reveals both devices. According to Apple Insider, in 2011, Incase CEO Steve Gatto said, “It’s much more important to get it right than to get it there first.” Hopefully someday Apple will have its own cases available on day one. Preorders for iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Pro too You can even preorder the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Pro. Goldgenie, a company that picks up iPhones to decorate them with it gold for wealthy buyers, has announced plans for the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Pro. In the process, it unintentionally hinted at what the devices could look like, even before Apple officially reveals them, notes a Gizmodo. From the images revealed by Goldgenie it seems there won’t be any major changes to the design and that the phones will be very similar to the iPhone 6s line. However, there was one thing missing – the ugly antenna bands. Also the images lacked the 3.5mm headphone jack, which is in line with rumors, noted Gizmodo. Another change seen is in the camera, which seems to be much larger on the 7 and 7 Plus. The image also shows that the rumored iPhone 7 Pro features dual-cameras on the rear, again, just like the rumors. In a press release, Goldgenie says it has “been allocated a limited number of devices on the day Apple make [sic] the iPhone 7 available.” The site has listed the phones as waterproof, and if this is true, customers have reasons to be glad. However, what Goldgenie has to say about the devices’ specifications has to be taken with a grain of salt. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that the iPhone 7 will include new technology called FeliCa. This is a wireless standard used in Japan for making payments in mass-transit systems. This technology will enable Japanese users to store virtual pay-as-you-go passes for buses and trains on their iPhones, notes the report. Whether these claims are true or not will be known only when Apple officially unveils the devices, probably next month. It is largely believed that the company will reveal the new iPhones on September 7.

Home Technology Science Politics Business Health Entertainment Sports Release Date of Apple iPhone 7 will be Sept 16 but with the likelihood of Supply Shortage 4 months ago by Munawar Gul A new report said that Apple is on its way to introduce iPhone 7 & 7 Plus on September 6, while the actual release date is confirmed as 16th or third Friday of the month. Yet the heavy demands after the launch will rarely be met by the initial shipments of next iPhone. Similarly, for the last four months, Apple has traditionally registered record sales for the new iPhone models. But as per a Nikkei report, the tech giant seems to be much careful about 2016, due to which it reduced receiving new orders. It’s also reported that a major supplier confirmed the U.S. company’s placement of orders will be very conservative this year. Consequently, early buyers will likely to face supply shortage. It was also pointed by the same report that despite the small numbers of new iPhones shipment suppliers have to combat the production issues such as the unknown reasons for low output of components to be used for the device. According to Nikkei report, “If Apple sticks to its launch schedule from last year, there may not be enough supply at the beginning, as some suppliers are still trying to fix low yield rates of their components”. The reported also added that the likelihood of low volume shipments is quite obvious in the next iPhone launch to come. According to analysts’ angle, Apple could have been instigated by shrinking revenues delivered by the tech titan’s iPhone business, due to which it is blamed for the decision to adjust downward the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus production numbers. However, sales numbers of Apple’s iPhone declined in the last two quarters this year and the similar trend will continue until the end of September. Similarly, production of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is expected to be lowered for the push of 2016 iPhone or the availability of only 74 million units will be made, up to the close of 2016. But, when it comes to contrast, the tech giant flooded the market with 84 million units of the duo of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus that were almost insufficient, Nikkei said. Apple remains firm on the next iPhone prospect that the device will double up on the storage configurations with fresh color options to be added to the menu. In addition, it is reported that buyers will have the range of iPhone that will be served in Deep Blue and Space Black flavours, on top of the familiar Champagne Gold, Rose Gold and Silver White with editions of 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB, while the inside power will be combo of A10 processing chip and iOS 10. According to Forbes, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus release date will probably happen in the third week of September following the pre-orders that will start on the 9th, pricing at $649 for the regular-size unlock version and $749 for the supersized build.

While we wait for the next iteration of Apple’s high-end smartphone, new rumors and leaks have already been giving us a better idea of what to expect from the device. New Android smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the HTC 10 are certainly going to provide some serious competition, and when one factors in the upcoming release of Android 7.0 Nougat, it becomes obvious that the iPhone 7 is going to have to pack a serious technological punch. iPhone 7 by Jimmy Benson, Flickr New iPhones: It’s that time of the year again If there has been one constant regarding Apple’s major iPhone launches, it’s that they come around once a year. Given that the iPhone 6S was released in late September of last year, about a year after the iPhone 6 launched, it is pretty much a given that the iPhone 7 will be released this September. Apple has not yet officially announced the date for the release of the iPhone 7, however rumors have emerged that many think are quite accurate. Included in the rumor are tentative dates for the press conference, preorders, and launch date. There are in fact two potential launch dates that are being rumored for the new iPhones, however, a new claim has emerged that may just have solidified the exact day when Apple will release the new iPhones. A report from a “trustworthy source” has recently revealed that Apple plans on officially unveiling the iPhone 7 on September 7th. Most sources up to this point have been suggesting the same date. Before that, Evan Blass, a well-known leaker, tweeted that he believes that Apple will begin preorders for the iPhone 7 on September 9th, with shipping and an in-store launch set for the 16th of September. Now, however, according to a trustworthy source originating from AT&T retail staff has suggested that the actual launch date of the new iPhones will be September 23rd. Releasing on the third or fourth Friday of September Both the 16th and 23rd of September would make sense for a release date. Both dates are Fridays, which has traditionally been when Apple has released new iPhones. Additionally, Apple is always expected to release their new devices on the first or second Friday following the first day of preorders. FWIW, I'm very confident in this date. https://t.co/iaA7rZHpCa — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 23, 2016 In a tweet from a few days ago, Evan Blass stated his belief that September 16th is the official release date for the iPhone 7. “[For what it’s worth,] I’m very confident in this date,” Blass wrote, referring to a previous tweet in which he stated that the smartphone will be released on September 16th. Three new iPhones on the way We now expect Apple to release not two but three brand-new iPhone 7 models this September, whichever date it ends up being, the 16th or the 23rd. Alongside an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 7 Plus, it seems probably that Apple will reveal something called the iPhone 7 Pro – a high-end smartphone with extra features such as a dual-lens camera and smart connector. Nothing has been officially confirmed regarding a release date, but Apple is hosting an event on September 7th in which, hopefully, the majority of questions and doubts regarding the device are answered. Until we know more, stay tuned for updates.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile iPhone 7 Is Facing Supply Issues – Will Apple Extend the Actual Launch Date? By Omar Sohail Posted Aug 27, 2016 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus might be facing supply shortage issues just weeks before their imminent arrival to the smartphone market. While Apple will not be able to extend the official announcement date of the smartphones, it may be forced to extend the actual global release date of both devices till the supply number shows much more agreeable numbers. Faulty Components Are the Core Reason Behind Apple’s iPhone 7 Supply Problems Macrumors reports that an industry source close to the matter has stated the following regarding supply issues: “If Apple sticks to its launch schedule from last year, there may not be enough supply at the beginning, as some suppliers are still trying to fix low yield rates of their components”. As stated earlier, Apple will not be able to extend the data of iPhone 7’s official announcement, and while that’s commendable of the company, it could lead to disastrous results, such as low yield rates, higher costs for manufacturers, and subsequently less volume to deliver to customers. According to Yuanta Investment Consulting analyst Jeff Pu, he is under the impression that total number of iPhone 7 builds will be 10 million less than that of the iPhone 6s which was released last year. Advertisement “We estimate total iPhone 7 builds to be 74 (million) in 2H16F, compared to 84 (million) for iPhone 6s in 2H15. Together with pricing pressure, we expect most Apple food chain suppliers to see (year-on-year) revenue decline for the rest of the year.” Apple’s iPhone 7 is expected to be announced on September 9, with a release date that could be in between the September 16-23 period. The smartphone has been reported to come with better waterproofing capabilities than its predecessor, along with an A10 chipset, slightly bigger battery life and a storage model that will boast capacity as high as 256GB. Let us hope that the launch date of the smartphone is not delayed any further than it needs to be.

It looks as though Apple will give its latest flagship smartphone some updated internal components and a better camera, but the overall design is expected to be largely similar to the existing iPhone 6s. With this in mind some commentators have already started speculating about what major design changes Apple may make with the 2017 iPhone, widely known as the iPhone 8. According to a new report in Bloomberg, the iPhone 8 could mark the moment that Apple gets rid of the physical Home button. Image Source: Screenshot / YouTube iPhone 8 could ship without a physical Home button With a lukewarm reception widely predicted for the iPhone 7, what will the iPhone 8 bring to the table to inspire users? According to the latest rumors the 2017 smartphone will pack in a number of groundbreaking features, such as getting rid of the physical home button. Bloomberg recently ran a report which claims that Apple has already started redesigning the iPhone ahead of its 2017 unveiling. It claims that more focus will be given to the display thanks to the removal of the Home button, citing “a person familiar with the matter.” Bloomberg doesn’t provide any further details, but other sources have previously mentioned the idea that the iPhone 8 Home button might be part of the display itself, be flush with the screen, or sit on top of a number of touch sensitive sensors that vibrate when they feel pressure. This would mean that the vibration gives you the sensation of pressing a button, even though it is actually completely still. If this sounds like the stuff of science fiction, it’s worth remembering that a similar feature already exists on Apple MacBook trackpads. Edge-to-edge display also subject to rumors Such a chance would not be implemented just for the sake of it. The rumors fit with other speculation that the iPhone 8 will have an edge-to-edge display, and the possibility of a third iPhone model with a curved OLED screen has also been mooted. It is not clear whether the new display will be a feature of every iPhone, or a new iPhone 8 Pro range topping device. This May renowned tech observer John Gruber said that he expects the 2017 iPhone to have a new form factor. .”And there have been some rumors, I guess, but what I’m saying is that I’ve heard this independently and it is completely getting rid of the chin and forehead of the phone,” he said. “The entire face will be the display. And the Touch ID sensor will be somehow embedded in the display. The front-facing camera will somehow be embedded in the display. The speaker, everything. All the sensors will somehow be behind the display.” Gruber raised two possibilities. He said he wasn’t sure whether Apple might “shrink the actual thing in your hand to fit the screen sizes we already have or whether they’re going to grow the screens to fit the devices we’re already used to holding… I don’t know.” Various reports point to OLED display Another report in Nikkei earlier this year also claimed that Apple had planned to introduce an OLED iPhone in 2018, before ultimately bringing that date forward to “offset a predicted stall in iPhone sales.” The Wall Street Journal also ran an article which said Apple is making a handset with a single glass sheet on the front, pointing to a lack of Home button. Well-connected Apple analysts KGI have also supported the idea that an all-glass iPhone 8 will appear in 2017. There have been numerous patent filings that suggest that Apple is working on a curved OLED display. If it does appear in 2017, it would not be the first time that Apple has considered the idea. One of the original iPhone prototypes from 2006 had a curved display, but the idea was discarded due to cost and design constraints. iPhone 7 to launch imminently It’s all well and good thinking about what might happen in 12 months, but there are more pressing matters for Apple watchers. The iPhone 7 is expected imminently, with little fanfare about its arrival. Alongside the aforementioned improvements to the camera and some beefed up hardware, there have been plenty of other rumors. One of the most persistent relates to the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack. This would mark a major departure for Apple and herald a new era of listening to music through either the Lightning port or via Bluetooth earbuds. Both of these possibilities have been criticized by fans, who don’t want to buy new accessories or use unwieldy adapters, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The former executive claims that existing Bluetooth technology simply isn’t good enough to listen to high-quality audio, and criticized the potential change.

With the year soon concluding, many are anticipating the release of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus as well as Samsung's Galaxy Note 7. Both product lines have been strong in the smartphone industry, especially with the loaded features and specifications they are expected to bring. Though there has yet to be any official news on how the two new phones will be like, there have been many rumors regarding the specifications of the iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy Note 7. There have also been several leaks hinting at the features included in the new smartphones. For design, both phones are expected to mirror the same type of aesthetics presented in the previous models of their product lines. Reports indicated that Samsung and Apple are not planning to innovate their designs in a major way. Advertisement However, the selling point of the Galaxy Note 7 is said to be its hardware and performance. It was shown that the new smartphone could include a larger camera sensor as well as an improved flash. The device is said to utilize the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, which will boost the performance of the phone. This will include the new Kyro cores, bringing a faster transistor for the device. As for the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple is expected to include a dual camera for the back of the phone. This dual camera feature can bring higher quality photos compared to the previous models of the iPhone. In addition, the new iPhone 7 Plus could include a change in the antenna bands in order to better sync with the new Apple gears expected. The iPhone 7 Plus storage space is said to start at 32 GB, instead of a 16 GB variant. In contrast, Samsung Note 7 could start with 64 GB, as well as having an expandable storage with a Micro SD card. However, there has yet to be any news on when the upcoming smartphones will release to the market.

Screenshot: Cult of Mac By Brandon Shaw I know, you’re tired of hearing, “Frank Ocean’s new album is amazing!!!” Me too. I’m interested less in the album itself, and more in what it means for the future of music. With a pair of Apple Music exclusives, Frank Ocean pulled a fast one on his old record label — and shook up the the entire record industry. It’s the latest indicator that Apple sits at the center of a rapidly evolving music industry, where rules and strategies are changing by the minute. Now everyone from Spotify to Universal Music Group is frantically trying to figure out what to do. A bit of Frank Ocean history Here’s a recap if you aren’t familiar with the back story: Frank Ocean released Channel Orange in 2012 to much acclaim. Everyone went bananas for it. He won all kinds of awards. He also gave a weird and really terrible performance at the Grammys (we’re talking Nick Jonas guitar solo bad). In the four years since his first album (and in the last year in particular), ‘ol Frank has been teasing his next album, supposedly titled Boys Don’t Cry. Teaser release dates came and went, and Frank started to seem a bit like the boy who cried wolf. (Side note: The name of the album should be Boys Don’t Cry Wolf amirite???) What happened last week Frank Ocean’s Endless is a “visual album” — and an Apple Music exclusive. Photo: Frank Ocean Last week, Ocean pulled off something that I’m calling a “Double-Beyoncé” with a hint of a “Classic Prince Two-Step” (more on that in a moment). On Friday, with no prior announcement, Ocean released a 45-minute “visual album” titled Endless as an Apple Music exclusive. It’s basically one giant music video. Endless features 45 minutes of new music that’s part R&B, part hip-hop, part suuuuper chill, and all Frank Ocean. Endless is also part staircase-building tutorial. Not a joke. Photo: Frank Ocean Oh but wait, there’s more. After releasing what many people (just me) are calling, “a much longer, much more relaxed Thriller video,” Ocean released an entirely different album the very next day. Back-to-back releases without any promo ahead of time? Now that’s what I call a Double-Beyoncé! His new “audio album” is called Blonde and is an iTunes and Apple Music exclusive. But here’s the really fascinating thing: While Endless was released under the Def Jam label, Blonde was released independently under Ocean’s own label, coincidentally named Boys Don’t Cry. Why does this matter? Apparently, by releasing the visual album Endless, Ocean fulfilled his contract with Def Jam. What did he do to celebrate? He released an entirely new “actual album” as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive the very next day. Apple Music exclusives matter Apple Music has been making a name for itself, primarily through streaming exclusives. Apple has had a head start on releases by artists like Chance The Rapper, Drake, Adele (and the Stranger Things soundtrack) — and reportedly pays top dollar for the exclusives. Increasingly, services like Apple Music and Tidal are setting themselves apart with these streaming exclusives and becoming more powerful than the labels themselves. Why take a record deal with Def Jam when you can get an exclusive streaming deal with Apple? This isn’t to say that Endless is particularly bad, but a music video won’t climb the Billboard charts, and doesn’t deliver the same profitability of a regular audio album (you know, like the one Ocean had in his back pocket the whole time). A recap of Frank Ocean’s last few years Frank Ocean’s “audio album” is the real deal. Image: Wikipedia/fair use Let’s recap the Frank Ocean story: 2012: Signs to Def Jam. Releases Channel Orange. Everyone loves it. 2013: Chillin. “You guys wanna hear more?” 2014: Chillin. “My new album is coming guys!” 2015: Chillin. “Coming so soon! It’s gonna be amazing!” 2016: Chillin. “I swear! #boysdontcry” Last Friday: “Check out my new visual album! Hey Def Jam, we good?” Last Saturday: “Check out my actual album. Hey Apple Music, sup!” #nochill. This dude basically just sidestepped his existing recording contract by pulling a pretty sneaky move; he technically fulfilled his contract, but then immediately released another album on the side. Now that’s what I call a Classic Prince Two-Step. (In order to get out a of a recording contract, Prince famously changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol, effectively two-stepping around a tricky legal battle). Who wins? And who loses? Here’s a list of winners and losers in this scenario, from most winningest to least. Most winningest: Frank Ocean fans, for getting a double dose of new music after years of teasing. Also winning: Frank Ocean, for being sneaky and releasing his new album independently as an Apple Music exclusive (and presumably making much more money). Still winning: Apple Music, for locking down yet another exclusive. Two, in fact. People will sign up just to stream Blonde and Endless. Losing: Spotify, for being a sore loser and claiming that exclusives are “bad for artists, bad for consumers, and bad for the whole industry.” Please. Biggest loser: Def Jam, for missing out on Ocean’s real album, and instead getting what basically amounts to a really long Home Depot commercial (albeit with a dope soundtrack). What does it all mean? Is Apple Music the new record label? Will artists cut out the middle man and start leaving traditional labels for greener pastures? We’ll have to wait and see. All I know is, Frank Ocean managed to pull off the heist of the year. Oh, by the way, have you heard about Frank Ocean’s new “movie album” coming out? It’s the logical next step.

The Apple Watch 2 will be tasked with building on the progress made by the original device in this product range, which has undoubtedly become the definitive smartwatch. Conversely, Apple was looking for a greater buzz around the original Apple Watch, and undoubtedly has some cracks to paper over if the corporation is to convince consumers that this is an essential purchase. Image Credit: Apple Inc. Apple Watch 2 – Design Firstly, the Apple Watch 2 customer should not necessarily expect a massive redesign of the external features of the smartwatch. Apple will probably be relatively conservative in this department, and deliver an Apple Watch 2 which builds solidly on the already recognizable visage of the original. The possibility of an Apple Watch 2 featuring a circular face seems to be receding. Barometer One of the new features included in the Apple Watch 2 will be a barometer sensor; common functionality in smartphones including the iPhone. This would enable the Apple Watch 2 to measure altitude, and would be primarily utilized in health-tracking functionality. This could be key for Apple, with the company expected to place a greater emphasis on this feature set in the second-generation smartwatch. Several health-related aspects of the original Apple Watch were abandoned due to technical reasons, and it is expected that at least some of these will be implemented in the Apple Watch 2. This will be particularly important for Apple, as the Californian company featured health-tracking heavily in its original marketing push for the Apple Watch. GPS Paired with the barometer will be a GPS system, enabling the Apple Watch 2 to gain access to location data. Again, this will have strong benefits in the health-tracking field, but will also open up the Apple Watch 2 to other features as well. The original Apple Watch was reliant on an attendant iPhone in order to access such data, and thus implementing GPS would be a massive advantage for the second-generation smartwatch. Waterproofing It is also believed that the Apple Watch 2 will benefit from significantly improved waterproofing, meaning that swimming should now be possible while wearing the smartwatch. Again, this will elevate the athletic potential of the smartwatch, but also make the device a more flexible everyday wristwatch for the average consumer. Battery A particular grumble about the original Apple Watch was that the smartwatch lacked a sufficiently powerful battery. Apple will definitely address this with the Apple Watch 2, with a larger cell expected to be included in the wristwatch. Software optimzsations and a new S2 chipset, with power-saving functionality built-in, will also play a role in ensuring that the Apple Watch 2 lasts longer on a single charge. New sensors Blood oxygen level and blood pressure sensors are expected to be included in the Apple Watch 2, as another plank in Apple’s overall health-tracking strategy. The corporation reportedly experienced difficulties in this department with the original Apple Watch, with Apple struggling to achieve adequate and stable readings from such additional sensors. But it is believed that these problems will be solved in time for them to be included in the second Apple Watch release. Slimmer body Apple has a particular fixation with slimming down its devices to the thinnest level possible, and this will definitely be the case with the Apple Watch 2 as well. Leaks from close to the Apple supply chain suggest that the corporation has been working hard to ensure that this second Apple Watch will be sleeker than the original. New display The Apple Watch 2 is rumored to utilize a “One Glass Solution” display (OGS) instead of a Glass / Glass (G/G) display. This technology eliminates one of the layers of glass from the display which were used in the original Apple Watch, replacing them with a thinner material. This will enable Apple to free up space within the internal machinations of the Apple Watch 2, and also enable the Cupertino-based company to make slight reductions in the weight of the device. Processor upgrade The Apple Watch 2 will feature the aforementioned S2 processor, which is manufactured by TSMC. This will enable Apple to deliver shorter loading times, and a more stable general Apple Watch 2 environment. Band choices Expect more strap and face options, as Apple looks to keep this product has customizable as possible. But it is believed that these so-called smart bands, featuring advanced health sensors incorporated, will not be part of the Apple Watch 2. Apple employee Bob Messerschmidt, who helped design the heart rate sensors in the Apple Watch, recently revealed that this is not part of Apple’s thinking. “One great example is [when] I went to a meeting and said I’m going to put sensors in the watch but I’m going to put them down here (he points to the underside of the Apple Watch band he’s wearing) because I can get a more accurate reading on the bottom of the wrist than I can get on the top of the wrist. They (the Industrial Design group) said very quickly that “that’s not the design trend; that’s not the fashion trend. We want to have interchangeable bands so we don’t want to have any sensors in the band.” Network connectivity This was touted as being one of the most important upgrades in the Apple Watch 2. However, it seems likely, based on a Bloomberg reports, that Apple will delay including a 3G / 4G chipset, which would have enabled the Apple Watch 2 to connect to cellular data networks without an attendant iPhone. Apple fans will still have fingers crossed for a surprise in this area, but do not expect network connectivity to be a central part of the second-generation Apple Watch.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Proof in the paint?: Hilltop House graffiti could signal what town plans to salvage Saturday Aug 27, 2016 at 2:31 PM Aug 27, 2016 at 3:48 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Three months after escrow closed on the Hilltop House, town officials toured the historic site that, today, serves the needs of taggers rather than dignitaries and celebrities. The graffiti that riddled the property’s drained swimming pool and patio on Aug. 16 was new. That fact was observable in both the still-wet paint and in the topical nature of a vulgar, two-word stance on Donald Trump scrawled atop the pool’s steps. “The graffiti here today is about three weeks old,” Apple Valley Code Enforcement Manager Jim Andersen said. “We have a contract and work on graffiti removal every two to three months.” And while the crude sketches of Batman and a frowning Superman are eyesores, they point to which sections might already be deemed salvageable despite there being no official plan for the property. Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin told the Daily Press on Friday that Apple Valley wants to retain the significance of the location, but in a way that is safe and accessible for citizens to enjoy; however, retaining Hilltop House’s significance and keeping it safe aren’t exactly goals that share common ground. First constructed in the 1950s, the house once hovered over the town as a lavish nod to possibility for prospective developers and homeowners. In 1965, it was featured in John Myhers’ madcap comedy, “Saturday Night Bath in Apple Valley,” which — five decades later — feels more like a feature-length advertisement for the then-budding town than it does a Mel Brooks-style laugh riot. In the opening credits of that largely forgotten film, Myhers gave special thanks to “Mr. Newt Bass of Apple Valley, California” for allowing the director to film inside the home that just two years later succumbed to fire. “It burned down in 1967,” Andersen said. “It was winter, and there was ice on the road leading up to the house.” That road is deceptively steep, and firefighters couldn’t get their trucks beyond the ice in order to save the house, according to Andersen. After the fire, Hilltop House was rebuilt and utilized as a space for conferences and weddings while ownership changed hands through the years. But now, unlike the pool and patio area situated on the property’s southern end, the house sits in ruin. A portion of the second floor has collapsed, the carport was almost entirely destroyed by another fire and there’s too much graffiti on what’s left of both the interior and exterior walls to bother with removal. In 2012, when the house was owned by the Las Vegas-based 360 Apple West LLC, former Apple Valley Fire Protection District Chief Art Bishop — who was elected to the Town Council less than three months later — hinted at a possible future for the property. Bishop told the Daily Press the area would be ideal for a park with picnic tables and a shaded structure. Even then, though, what’s left of Hilltop House itself wasn’t a factor. "It's rather dangerous and it may have to be razed," Bishop said. "That would be a shame because it's a monument to Apple Valley's history." During the recent tour with town officials, Martin said demolition of the house is one option the town will consider once an ad hoc committee is formed. “We don’t expect that the structure will be rebuilt or retained,” Martin said. “We’re looking more at an observation-deck style destination at the end of a trail.” It’s possible, then, that the patio and pool areas — from which graffiti is removed on a regular basis — might be salvaged for part of the observation deck. Martin added that demolition was an option entertained by the Apple Valley Legacy Trail Foundation, the organization that initially worked toward acquiring the property and raised $580,350 toward that goal last August. LTF committee members Steve Richard and Donald Tatera could not be reached for comment, but Martin said the town will seek input from “the people that kind of laid the foundation for this (purchase) to happen.” Martin previously confirmed that at least one of the grants the LTF received — $160,000 awarded by the California Department of Parks Recreation Land and Water Conservation Fund — helped fund the town’s more than $300,000 purchase of the property. As a result, the town must meet certain requirements laid out by the LWCF grant program, which includes the acquisition resulting in an “outdoor recreational opportunity for the public’s benefit” within three years of the completion of acquisition, according to a previous Daily Press report. Meanwhile, Martin reiterated that nothing is set in stone at this point, adding that the town expects to work with community groups and the Apple Valley Parks & Recreation Commission on a plan for Hilltop House “in the very near future.” “It will all be up for discussion,” she said.

Apple has emerged as a stock buyback powerhouse in recent years, but why does the company choose to reward its shareholders this way? Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Aug 27, 2016 at 3:33PM Image source: Getty Images. As one of the most successful companies in history, investors may understandably wonder whether aging tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can deliver the same juicy returns for which it's so famous. Though still certainly a force in the investing world, today's Apple relies on a more diverse playbook, including share buybacks and dividends to generate returns for its shareholders, rather than relying solely on torrent earnings and profit growth, as it once did. Case in point, Apple has emerged as something of a share buyback and dividend powerhouse since initiating its capital return program in 2012.  Apple's share buyback history Thanks to its truly monumental financial resources -- $159 billion in net cash and investments as of its most recent quarter -- Apple has developed an impressive track record of returning cash to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Here's a quick snapshot of Apple's share repurchase history over the past four fiscal years. Apple Stock Buyback History (ASR & Open Market Purchases) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 FY 2016 Number of shares (in thousands) 336,832 502,284 332,552 187,171 Average repurchase price  $68.13  $89.59  $117.35  $106.85 ASR amounts (in $US millions)  $22,950  $45,000  $39,026  $20,000 Data source: Apple SEC filings.  As of its most recent quarterly report, Apple has utilized roughly $127 billion of the $175 billion the company has earmarked for stock buybacks. That's an absolutely incredible about of capital committed to repurchasing Apple's shares, especially considering the company's entire market capitalization of $573 billion. It demonstrates how Apple can utilize its massive financial resources to continue to create returns for its investors, even if its days of breakneck growth lie behind it. It also bears noting that Apple has allocated a disproportionate amount of its capital return program toward stock buybacks instead of dividends. In fact, Apple has earmarked 68% of the $250 billion in its capital return program specifically to fuel share buybacks. As such, Apple's clear preference toward stock buybacks also suggests they contain some kind of advantage over dividends. Why is that? Why do companies buy back stock? With chapters of corporate finance textbooks dedicated to the subject, breaking down the advantages and drawbacks of stock buybacks, especially when compared to cash dividends, can quickly grow esoteric. I don't want to put you to sleep, here, but it's handy for investors to have a general framework for why companies pursue stock buybacks, so let's quickly review.  At their most basic, buybacks are one of two principle methods through which a company can reward its shareholders with their excess cash flow; the other is dividends. Generally speaking, stock buybacks benefit investors by helping increase a company's stock price. Here, it's helpful to think of company's profits as a pie. Buying back stock reduces the number of shares entitled to a company's profits. It's akin to reducing the number of slices of the pie, making each slice more valuable. As Homer Simpson would say, "Mmmmm. Pie." Additionally, stock buybacks carry an additional tax advantage. Investors who own a stock for more than a year are taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rate when they sell their stock compared to dividends, which are taxed as ordinary income. So as a general rule of thumb, stock buybacks help increase a stock's price and typically result in a lower tax bill when investors sell their shares. Stock repurchases can also be viewed, in theory, as a sign that a company sees its shares as undervalued, though this can prove tenuous in practice. Companies are aware of this exact effect, and some will attempt to use this "signal" to support their stock price. For example, the now-defunct Lehman Brothers famously instituted a stock buyback in late January 2008, ostensibly in an attempt to instill confidence in its rickety stock price. Ten months later, the company no longer existed. To be sure, many companies use buybacks to reward their investors in a rational and ethical manner, but it's important to caveat that some companies use it for more self-serving aims as well. Either way, at a high level, stock buybacks should be thought of as a more tax-efficient way for a company to reward investors than dividends in cases when its shares are undervalued. Companies with low P/E ratios, like Apple, can benefit tremendously from stock buybacks. But it's important to note we're just scratching the surface on this important and somewhat complex topic.

For Great design Better battery Improved keyboard Against Still pricey Screen too low-res Update: iPhone 6 prices have continued to drop, and now that iOS 10 has landed, it could very well be the best choice for you. Sure, it's not nearly as fast or powerful as Apple's new iPhone 7, but our review now reflects how 2014's flagship goes against the iPhone SE. You'll also find helpful guides inserted throughout to point you in the direction of the best accessories for your iPhone 6, whether it's old or brand new. Lastly, some iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users have encountered something that's being referred to as "touch disease". In other words, your phone is becoming unresponsive to touch. Unfortunately, Apple has yet to publicly acknowledge the issue, but you can check out why the issue occurs at the link above. Original review follows below. Why do we have the Apple iPhone 6? Well, back in 2013, despite record sales, the Cupertino brand was heading for a fall. The brand had been trading on the same phone for four years, and something big was needed to keep it current. So with that, the iPhone 6, and its bigger brother, the iPhone 6 Plus, were born to keep Apple at the sharp end of a market that was starting to lust after powerful, big-screen smartphones with clever and premium design. Compare: all the best iPhone 6 deals The iPhone 6 certainly addresses a number of the problems Apple had developed, coming with a much larger screen (although not dramatically increasing the size of the phone) a boosted processor, better camera, improved battery and - crucially - overhauled design. Much of the ground work that went into the iPhone 6S was done here, with the iPhone 6. This is the sixth iPhone I've reviewed, and there's a distinct sense that this one is really rather different. I wrote in 2013 that Apple was becoming more aware that the time when it could define what consumers would buy in the smartphone was ending – and with the 4.7-inch screen, it clearly had to admit defeat in the smaller screen market. There will be some who will miss that 4-inch screen size, maintaining that they don't want a bigger display on their phone – but nearly all of those people won't have spent any appreciable time with a larger device, and I believe that a good portion of you thinking you need a smaller phone will quickly come to appreciate the power a bigger handset brings, without compromising quality. Apple's now appeased those longing for a new 4-inch handheld though, with the launch of the iPhone SE. It sports the specs of the iPhone 6S, uses the body of the now-discontinued iPhone 5S and sports a lower price tag than the iPhone 6, giving the latter some tough new competition. But while the iPhone 6 has answered a lot of the problems I've had with previous iterations of Apple's handsets, there are some issues that still swirled when I handled the phone for the first time – and many of them persist even now that the iPhone 6 has been superseded. Why did Apple decide to not join the masses with a really high-res screen? Why is the iPhone 6 still one of the most expensive phones on the market? Has Apple done enough to improve the quite dire battery life of previous models, especially at a time when many high-end Android phones are easily chugging through a day's worth of hard use without thirsting for a charger's caress? Let's take a quick look at the price – and it's not pretty. iPhone 6 price and release date At launch, you were looking at $649 or £539 for the 16GB version, $750 or £619 for the 64GB option and $850 or £699 for the 128GB model. Compare this to the iPhone 7, which launched in September for the same price, but with an increased baseline of 32GB instead of 16GB. The high-end model is also the same price as the iPhone 6 launched with, but stocks in 256GB - double the amount of storage. You can no longer purchase the iPhone 6 through the Apple Store, but when it was available last, the price had dropped as low as $549 (£459, AU$929) for the 16GB version and $649 (£539, AU$1,079) for the 64GB option, with the 128GB handset having been discontinued with the arrival of the iPhone 6S. We wouldn't be surprised to see that prices have continued to plummet. Even so, it's going for about as much as you'd pay for a brand new Android flagship just a few months after launch, yet the iPhone 6 is no longer the top model in its range. Lastly, you've got the iPhone SE, which has the same features as the newer iPhone 6S for $150 (£100, AU$250) less than the iPhone 6. You'll have to compromise on screen size, but you could get a better phone for less. Design Let's take a look at the first thing most people will wonder about before picking up the iPhone 6: how will it actually feel in the hand? This is a big departure for Apple, marking a time when it's admitted that the industrial, sharp design of the last four iPhone models is a little outdated and needs to up the ergonomics to really compete. Well, with the Apple iPhone 6 we're looking at one of the thinnest and sleekest handsets in the market – still. It's got a strong combination of metal back (which feels exceptionally premium, borrowing bucketloads of design language from the iPad Air) and the way the screen curves into the chassis gives it a slight lozenge feel. One of the thinnest phones in the world The iPhone 6 looks the business, and at 6.9mm thin it's very nice to hold, though phones like the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Moto Z has since edged it out at 6.8mm and 5.1mm thick, respectively. I do still feel that phones that push harder on ergonomics are a better choice though – the HTC One M9 bows out at the back and fits in the palm a little better – but that's quibbling. This iPhone just feels really well made. Apple has always favored a flatter phone than the rest of the market though, and placed on a desk it looks great. It does feel great in the hand too, but as said others impress more if I'm being hyper-critical. There's also the issue of the large plastic strips that flow through the top and bottom of the device. Given metal is a nightmare material to try and get radio signal to penetrate, these are clearly there to offset that. The plastic strips detract and are not flush with the chassis While the plastic does seem to give good signal performance for the most part, it's nothing amazing, and to my eyes they're a little unsightly and ruin the sleek back of the iPhone 6; their presence seems at odds with Apple's design ethos. The other big design change is to the power button, which has now been moved to the right-hand side of the phone. This makes a lot of sense and, given the phone is now a larger device at 138.1 x 67 x 6.9mm, hitting the top of the handset is a much harder task, so moving the button is the right thing to do. Like the rest of the exterior buttons, the power key is raised and easy to hit in both left and right hand modes. It's metallic, and crucially doesn't have the same rattle that I criticized on the iPhone 5S and iPhone SE. The new raised buttons However, that doesn't mean the metallic keys don't have a little wiggle to them. Running your hand up and down the sides idly will result in you noticing a very slight looseness to the power and volume buttons... I'm in danger of being too critical here, but for the price it's not the sort of thing I expect to see. The other important design change here is the camera now protrudes slightly on the rear of the phone. It's good to see that happening, as it shows that Apple isn't willing to compromise on camera quality in order to just whack in a thinner phone. Looking for the best iPhone 6 cases? Check this out The protrusion is a little worrying in that laying the Apple iPhone 6 down flat on a table could see scratches appearing, but the sapphire glass that covers the lens should ensure that's pretty safe. The camera protrudes but you won't notice it day to day The rest of the iPhone 6 is very similar to the iPhone 5S, with the speakers at the bottom flanking the Lightning port. Well, I say speakers: it's just the one speaker, but thanks to the slightly elongated bottom of the phone you won't cover it when holding the phone in landscape orientation. This was irritating when trying to game or watch a movie without headphones on older iPhones – but this upgrade, combined with the lightness of the iPhone 6, means you won't have a similar problem for the most part, as the hands sit lower and free of the speaker generally. Sadly the headphone port still resides at the bottom of the iPhone 6, meaning you'll still probably get your phone out of your pocket the wrong way around when listening to music. The iPhone in Space Gray Going back to the iPhone 6 after a prolonged spell using the iPhone 6S as a daily driver, it's remarkable how much lighter the older phone feels in the hand. You can feel every one of those extra 14 grams, and it's the one area in which the newer iPhone suffers by comparison. Let me make one thing very clear though: the Apple iPhone 6 is another iconic handset in terms of design for Apple. It's not the best looking on the market (I'm still giving that title to the HTC One M9), but it's definitely right up there, and for the price I'd expect nothing less. At launch, the iPhone 6 was available in Space Gray, Silver and Gold, but you might have a hard time finding your preferred color now since Apple no longer sells the phone. Fast forward to today, Apple's iPhone 7 is offered in a few more colors: Jet Black, Black, and Rose Gold - a variant that was introduced alongside the iPhone 6S.

Imperial Valley News Heart of the Matter White House Announces New Commitments to the Equal Pay Pledge Print Email Details Written by White House Category: National News Published: 27 August 2016 Washington, DC - Friday, on Women’s Equality Day, we are announcing new signatories to the White House Equal Pay Pledge. This pledge was launched at the first-ever United State of Women Summit, encouraging companies from across the American economy to take action to advance equal pay. These 29 newly-committed employers bring the total number to more than fifty companies and organizations that collectively employ millions of Americans. The new commitments are from a diverse range of employers, including Apple, CVS, Facebook, Target, and Visa. Equal Pay has been an Administration priority since President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law as his first piece of legislation. Policies that ensure fair pay for all Americans and that help businesses to attract the strongest talent can not only narrow the pay gap, but also boost productivity and benefit our economy. As noted in the President’s Proclamation on Women’s Equality Day, this day commemorates the 1920 certification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, granting women the right to vote. It is also the day that we observe the continued work towards gender equity for all women and girls. View the additional commitments and statements from signatories below, and learn more about President Obama's record on empowering women and girls. By signing the Equal Pay Pledge, these employers are: Acknowledging the critical role businesses must play in reducing the national pay gap. Committing to conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across occupations. Reviewing hiring and promotion processes and procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers. Embedding equal pay efforts into broader enterprise-wide equity initiatives. Pledging to take these steps as well as identify and promote other best practices that will close the national wage gap to ensure fundamental fairness for all workers. Companies and organizations interested in signing are encouraged to take the Equal Pay Pledge here. WHITE HOUSE EQUAL PAY PLEDGE The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first piece of legislation President Obama signed into law. Policies that ensure fair pay for all Americans and that help businesses attract the strongest talent can not only narrow the gender pay gap, but also boost productivity and benefit our economy. Yet, the typical woman working full-time all year in the United States only earns 79 percent of what a typical man working full-time all year earns. While the gap has narrowed slightly over the past few years, there is much more work to be done to ensure fair pay for all. Building on the Administration’s numerous actions to close the national pay gap, the White House challenged businesses to take the Equal Pay Pledge. Several U.S. private sector companies have come together in support of advancing equal pay. We applaud the growing number of countries that have already made significant progress in closing their gender wage gap. Despite passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which requires equal pay for equal work, the gender pay gap in the United States persists. Women working full-time earn only 79 percent of men’s wages, and we are committed to taking action individually and collectively to reduce that national pay gap. We believe that businesses must play a critical role in reducing the national pay gap. Towards that end, we commit to conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across occupations; reviewing hiring and promotion processes and procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers; and embedding equal pay efforts into broader enterprise-wide equity initiatives. We pledge to take these steps as well as identify and promote other best practices that will close the national wage gap to ensure fundamental fairness for all workers. We received a very positive response to the pledge and welcome our new signatories, including the employers below. These signatories put forth their pledges as follows: A.T. Kearney: A.T. Kearney is passionate about and committed to diversity and inclusion.  We provide our employees with equal opportunities to contribute, develop, and succeed irrespective of gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. Diversity enables us to achieve immediate impact and growing advantage – for our clients, our people and the communities in which we work and live. We believe that equal pay to promote diversity and inclusion is a business imperative. Our approach to diversity and inclusion has and will continue to evolve with the changing needs of our business and our people. We offer global programs that create an inclusive environment and culture, ensuring all employees feel comfortable bringing their best selves to work each day. We enable our employees to achieve their personal and professional aspirations. A.T. Kearney is proud to collaborate with the White House and enthusiastically adds our name to the Equal Pay Pledge. Akamai Technologies: Akamai Technologies is pleased to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge. This pledge aligns with the expectations we have of ourselves to lead with a sense of transparency, while embracing diversity and respect for all employees. At Akamai, we seek to ensure every employee can work in an environment where they are valued and able to work at their best. We believe in fair and equitable pay for all our employees, and we are committed to monitoring our pay practices regularly and to making adjustments if necessary to deliver on this pledge. Anheuser-Busch: Anheuser-Busch is proud to sign the Equal Pay Pledge. We value equality throughout all levels of our organization, and believe diversity enriches our workforce. This commitment to inclusivity begins with our mission - to be the best beer company, bringing people together for a better world - and extends to our meritocracy-based compensation practices. At Anheuser-Busch, we believe in equal pay for equal work. We use a rigorous and gender-blind compensation process that was developed and validated by independent experts. We recognize that there is still much work to do to create a truly equal playing field in the workforce. It is our ambition to lead the change and create more opportunities for women in the beer industry. Today, six of our 12 U.S. breweries are led by female head brewmasters, and women now represent the majority (51 percent) of our marketing organization. In support of our workforce and their families, this year we introduced a new parental leave policy that offers 100% paid Parental Bonding leave for all parents, on top of paid Maternity Leave for a birth mother. Apple: Equal work deserves equal pay. This past year, Apple looked at the total compensation for U.S. employees and closed the gaps we found. We’ve achieved pay equity in the United States for similar roles and performance. Women employees at Apple earn one dollar for every dollar male employees earn. We’re now analyzing the salaries, bonuses, and annual stock grants of all our employees worldwide. If a gap exists, we’ll address it. And we’ll continue our work to make sure we maintain pay equity. Chobani: Since day one, diversity and inclusiveness have been at the core of Chobani. We’re proud to stand with other leading businesses to give one voice to a simple, common sense principle: women deserve equal pay for equal work. We were founded with the belief that everyone on our team deserves the same chance to achieve their dreams and live up to their full potential. By joining the White House in taking this important pledge, we’re committing to continuously reviewing our practices to ensure that, as we grow, we never stray from our founding principles – and that our hiring, promotion and compensation practices and procedures stick to our deeply-held belief that women deserve equal opportunity. The Coca-Cola Company: The Coca-Cola Company values and celebrates diversity. This includes a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity that spans our employment practices and development of existing employees. There is overwhelming evidence that achieving equality and empowerment for women has both immediate impacts that benefit them directly and broader ripple effects that are good for society. We have made meaningful strides as a company in our equal opportunity efforts. Still, we recognize there is more we can learn by building upon best practices across the U.S. private sector.  We are pleased, therefore, to join the Equal Pay Pledge and work with the Administration and other partners towards reducing the national gender pay gap. CVS Health: At CVS Health, we are committed to fulfilling our company’s purpose of helping people on their path to better health by living our values, including integrity, accountability, caring, collaboration and innovation. By living our values, we embrace a dedication to paying our colleagues equitably regardless of their gender. We take a purposeful and systematic approach to evaluate compensation to ensure we are accountable to our pay equity commitment. We actively work to seek out, listen to and leverage the voices of our diverse colleagues, customers, clients, and communities. For our company, diversity and innovation go hand in hand and we strive to model best practices to promote and develop diverse talent.  Our CEO serves as the executive sponsor of CVS Health’s Women’s Success Network, one of our largest Colleague Resource Groups.  And we have been recognized as a best practice company by the 20/20 Women on Boards Initiative.  We value the contributions of all of our colleagues and we are proud to join other leading employers in signing this pledge and making a commitment to this important issue. Delta Air Lines: At Delta Air Lines, the very nature of our business is bringing people together. We rely on a worldwide family of Delta Air Lines people 80,000 strong to care for our customers and ensure they get where they’re going promptly and safely, regardless of the origin or destination. Our success is built on diversity, where our differences make us stronger and all people are welcomed, supported and – above all – treated equally. We’re proud to join the White House in signing the Equal Pay Pledge and voicing our commitment to fairness and diversity in the workplace, which is reflective of our long-standing commitment of pay equality among all Delta Air Lines employees. Dropbox: Dropbox is honored to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge and join the other companies who have taken a stand on this issue. Gender equality and equal pay are priorities for us, and they are part of our deep commitment to creating an equitable workplace that includes and supports employees of every background and identity. Our products are used around the globe by millions of people from all cultures and backgrounds, and our team needs to reflect the world we’re building for. At Dropbox we review all of our hiring and HR processes for potential bias, including a gender impact analysis at every compensation and promotion cycle. Additionally, we've built inclusive leadership into our framework for managers, and all of our senior leadership and nearly all of our employees have participated in unconscious bias training. While we are proud of our track record of compensating our employees fairly and equitably — from our most junior team members to our senior leaders — we know there is more work to be done in order to create a world in which both men and women have the same opportunities and choices. Dunkin’ Brands: Dunkin' Brands is committed to gender pay equity, and we are honored to join the White House in the Equal Pay Pledge.  At Dunkin' Brands we regularly review our pay practices to ensure pay equity and strongly believe that a corporate culture in which each person is valued, respected and earns equal pay for equal work, delivers better business results. EY: EY is committed to pay equity and a culture of inclusion. Equity in opportunities, advancement, and compensation is a business imperative, and we work hard to promote fair practices for all of our women and men. EY’s leadership is actively engaged in fostering gender equality at EY and in the marketplace. Facebook: At Facebook we value those who bring varying perspectives, for many reasons including background, community, culture, race, ethnicity - and gender. We call this cognitive diversity, and we want more of it. It propels our mission: to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. Facebook is a longtime supporter of equal pay. We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure pay equity, and have done so for many years. We complete thorough statistical analyses to compare the compensation of men and women performing similar work. As such, we are proud to share that at Facebook, men and women earn the same.  We encourage efforts to establish methods to close the wage gaps around the world. General Motors: General Motors is pleased to sign The White House Equal Pay Pledge. We believe strongly in gender equity, and we are dedicated to having a diverse and welcoming workplace that values the contributions of all employees. We know that a diverse workforce promotes fresh, innovative thinking that translates into both a competitive advantage for GM and winning products for our customers. To this end, among other efforts, GM has employee resource groups, whose mission is to attract, engage, develop and retain a diverse mix of talented employees to positively affect GM’s performance, through networking and professional development opportunities. GM is supporting this pledge because it reflects our shared belief that employees’ gender should not factor into compensation decisions. We believe that fair and equitable pay should be an essential element of any successful business model and are proud to stand with other companies that share this same value. The Hartford: At The Hartford, gender equality is a top business priority.  The Hartford prides itself on its diverse workforce and inclusive culture, and its commitment to equality for ALL employees. The Hartford, recently named as one of twenty-six firms on Bloomberg Financial Services Gender-Equality Index for demonstrating strong commitment to gender equality, is proud to take the next step in signing the White House’s Equal Pay Pledge.   The Hershey Company: At The Hershey Company, diversity and inclusion is a commitment that is embedded in who we are.  It’s about advancing our vision, our culture, and our environment, so everyone can bring a meaningful contribution.  As part of this commitment, we believe that discrimination has no place in our workforce, which is why we have a no-tolerance policy. Our policy is to extend opportunities and terms and conditions of employment to qualified applicants and employees on an equal basis regardless of an individual’s race, color, gender, age, national origin, religion, citizenship status, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, physical or mental disability, protected veteran status, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other categories protected by applicable law.  For wages, this includes equal pay for equal work. Hilton: At Hilton, we are proud of our long history of supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our goal is clear - we strive for an inclusive work environment that allows all of our Team Members to be comfortable bringing their entire selves to work every day.   Simply put, our culture is a reflection of the backgrounds, passions and perspectives of all of our Team Members around the world. To be the most hospitable company in the world, we must also represent the many different cultures, backgrounds and viewpoints of our guests, which includes supporting and empowering women at every level of our organization.  In fact, women make up more than 50 percent of our global workforce. In this regard, we are honored to join the White House in signing the Equal Pay Pledge.  We are committed to advancing our efforts in ensuring equity not only in our pay practices, but also across recruitment, learning and development, benefits, and our overall Team Member value proposition. In doing so, we continue to deliver on our promise of a great environment, great careers and great rewards for all of our Team Members. Supporting women in the workplace is part of who we are. In fact, we provide a wide-range of opportunities for women such as our Women’s Team Member Resource Group, Women’s Executive Networking Program, and Women in Leadership Excellence Program in partnership with the University of Virginia. Most recently, we were honored to be selected by DiversityInc as one of the Top 50 Companies for Diversity, the Human Rights Campaign rated us at 100 percent on their Corporate Equality Index, and Professional Woman’s Magazine named us as a Top Diversity Employer of Women. We were also chosen by the Pax Ellevate Global Women's Index Fund for being one of the highest-rated companies in the world for advancing women leadership. Additionally, we are committed to offering family-focused benefits across our hotels and offices, including our industry-leading maternity leave policy, flexible working environments, 10-day advanced scheduling, paid time off, and educational assistance. IBM: In 1935, IBM founder Thomas J. Watson Sr. said, "Men and women will do the same kind of work for equal pay. They will have the same treatment, the same responsibilities and the same opportunities for advancement." IBM established a broad equal opportunity policy more than a decade before the Civil Rights Act, and we have maintained and continually improved a formal pay analysis and adjustment process for women and minority employees for 40 years. And now, in IBM’s second century as a company, we remain firmly dedicated to providing fair pay based on job responsibilities and performance, which is critical to meeting today’s evolving business and technology challenges. IBM is proud to sign the White House’s Equal Pay pledge as another step in our long history of fostering fairness, diversity and inclusion in the workplace. IKEA US: IKEA is a values-driven company, and our approach to diversity and inclusion is grounded in our values. We believe in people and see each individual as a talent. We treat each other fairly and provide our co-workers with equal opportunities, regardless of their gender identity, age, sexual orientation, physical ability, ethnicity, race, nationality, or any other dimension of their identity. We know that each individual adds value to the team, and we are committed to creating an inclusive work environment that encourages our diverse and competent co-workers to be themselves, to apply their unique perspectives at work, and to assume responsibility for our growth. In addition to being the right thing to do, creating this environment also improves our business results and strengthens our competitiveness. Several years ago, IKEA launched a proactive global effort to increase the diversity of our workforce at all levels. As part of this, we took – and will continue to take – a hard look at all areas of gender equality, including workforce representation, hiring, career development, succession planning, promotion rates, and pay equity. Over the coming years, we will maintain a comprehensive approach to diversity and inclusion across the entire organization, including pay equality. We are proud to take the Equal Pay Pledge to ensure fairness for all our co-workers, and to join the many companies contributing to a better society by leading on this issue. Intel: Signing the Equal Pay Pledge for Intel is a natural extension of our longstanding commitment to paying our employees fairly and equitably at all levels of the organization. We hold ourselves accountable with data by conducting an annual, comprehensive audit of pay in the U.S. to analyze our employees' pay by gender and ethnicity. In 2015 we conducted a comprehensive compensation analysis examining gender pay parity for U.S. employees across job types and levels. The report showed a net result of 100% pay parity, and we're incredibly proud of this result. Our commitment to diversity comes from our conviction that reaching a critical mass of women and underrepresented minorities in our industry brings ample benefits to many. The Libra Group: The Libra Group heartily supports the Equal Pay Pledge. As an employer we are age, sex, orientation, race and religion blind. Yet we are acutely aware that the wage gap is very often a symptom of a broader opportunity gap that may affect some population groups more than others, notably women. So wage parity begins with opportunity parity, which is why so many of our group’s social responsibility programs focus on groups who are experiencing disproportionate lack of educational and career opportunity. In many cases this means providing work experience, or equipping under-served communities with the advice, mentoring, training and support they need to acquire leadership skills or get a new business off the ground. For the fortunate few we are able to break the cycle of disadvantage and give a helping hand – but there is still more to be done. In our experience tomorrow’s leaders emerge from the most unlikely places. Thus we believe that narrowing the pay gap depends on two things: a culture of equal opportunity and equal treatment within the work environment, combined with selective positive action and intervention to lift people out of endemic disadvantage and give them the chance they deserve. LinkedIn: LinkedIn's vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. We are committed to ensuring all of our employees have equal opportunities to succeed and be recognized for their accomplishments. At the core of economic opportunity is equal pay for equal work. We believe it is basic good business to ensure this is true within your own organization, and we regularly review and evaluate our pay practices to ensure our employees are compensated fairly. In addition, our ongoing focus on improving the gender diversity of our employee base continues to have meaningful impact with gains in women's representation in both technical and leadership roles over the last several years. The Women’s Initiative (WIN) within our Global Sales team and the Women in Technology initiative (WIT) within our Engineering and Product organizations have built a framework to successfully hire, retain, develop and advance women. We are committed to continuing to create diverse teams in an inclusive work environment where every person feels they truly belong and are paid fairly. MailChimp: Equal pay is an essential part of MailChimp’s culture of inclusion, and we’re grateful for the opportunity to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge. We conduct annual pay and benefits analyses, in addition to focusing on fair hiring and interviewing practices, generous family leave policies, flexible work schedules, employee-led resource groups, leadership development opportunities for employees at every level, and meaningful corporate citizenship programs. It is unacceptable that women working full-time earn only 79 percent of what men earn, and unacceptable that the gap is even greater for women of color. MailChimp promises to do our part to close that gap. We are committed to empowering all of our employees and helping them succeed both within our organization and out in the world. Microsoft: Microsoft is proud to join others in the effort to drive greater pay equality among men and women, which is a critical component of social progress.  When women are fully engaged in our workforce and communities, society at large benefits from the great ideas and innovation that flourishes.  Our commitment to equal pay gives us the opportunity to attract and hire from a broader talent pool of the best employees, managers and leaders—while gaining important insights into consumers’ needs. In addition to gender pay equality, we are also committed to ensuring that all employees have equal opportunity. MuleSoft: MuleSoft has signed the Equal Pay Pledge as a testament to our continued commitment to creating a great place to work for everyone. MuleSoft has a long-standing commitment to equal opportunity, and we believe people should be paid equally for equal work and experience. We conduct an annual audit of our compensation, which we readily use to influence changes in our policies. Ensuring that we all have the same platform for opportunities, growth, and compensation is core to our ethos and success. We’re committed to providing a workplace where everyone is supported and inspired by the opportunity to build a successful company where we can do what we love and thrive. Nike: Today, we are proud to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge. At Nike, diversity is about acknowledging and valuing our differences and appreciating that everyone brings unique experiences, perspectives and ideas to the team. Investing in our employees to unleash their potential translates into a pipeline of new ideas, methods, and products that drive the future of sport. In keeping with our culture and what we stand for as an organization, we remain committed to equitable pay and rewarding performance across all roles, for all Nike team members. By signing the White House Equal Pay Pledge, we’re adding our voice to a movement that we hope will inspire positive change. Patagonia: Since they founded Patagonia in a small Tin Shed more than 40 years ago, Yvon and Malinda Chouinard have worked hard to build a culture where women and families thrive. Today, Patagonia continues to value and honor our working women with equal pay and opportunity. We believe women shouldn’t have to make the unnecessary choice between family and career and they can grow a career at the same pace as a family. At Patagonia, thanks to onsite child care, nursing moms are a few feet away from their babies versus miles apart. New moms and dads take paid time off to bond with and care for infants and families can eat breakfast and lunch together daily. We have an equal number of women and men at every level of the company, including among executive positions and the boardroom. Women and men are paid equally for comparable work. All of these things amount to a work environment where 100 percent of women return to work from maternity leave, 100 percent of dads take paid time off from work to bond with their new babies, and the business thrives as a result of the working families we support in our business. We also believe that there is so much more to be done to reinforce the true drivers of pay equality – such as paid maternity and paternity leave, quality on-site childcare, and a family-supportive work environment – which allow working moms and dads to continue to grow their family, career and income with equal opportunity. Patagonia commits to continuing to build on the progress we’ve made and supporting working families through every avenue possible as we continue to grow our business in line with the values we were founded on. “Women will never be able to effectively “lean in” without the proper economic, social and community support for the most critical work of all: raising children.” -Rose Marcario – CEO, Patagonia Target: At Target, we believe diversity and inclusivity make teams and Target better. We work to create a diverse and inclusive working environment and cultivate an inclusive guest experience, building a better Target for our team members and guests – and a better society for all. Target is honored to sign the White House Equal Pay Pledge and affirm our commitment to making pay equitable for everyone at Target, including women in the workplace. To achieve our goal of pay equity, we’ve implemented meaningful business practices, including continued leadership training designed, in part, to reduce the likelihood that leaders’ decisions are improperly influenced by bias or stereotyping.  We also use other internal measures, such as a comprehensive annual pay audit process, to ensure compensation is fair and equitable across the organization. Additionally, earlier this year, Target CEO Brian Cornell joined PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi to co-chair the Network of Executive Women’s Future Fund – an industry-wide campaign aimed at achieving 50/50 gender parity in the workforce. We’ve also earned a spot on the list for the Top Companies for Executive Women from the National Association for Female Executives for the past four years. We are proud of our internal initiatives and external partnerships, and we remain committed to improving pay processes and policies that ensure equality and fairness for all. Unilever: At Unilever, we strive to create a bright future and believe business has a critical part to play in closing the national gender gap. As part of our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan - which is our blueprint to grow our business, while decoupling our environmental footprint from our growth and increasing our positive social impact - we have the ambition to empower the lives of five million women by 2020. Unilever is in a strong position to help empower women around the world: over 70% of our consumers are women and they play essential roles in our value chain. Unilever is proud to take the Equal Pay Pledge and confirm our commitment to gender equality. We consider the advancement of women’s economic inclusion a business priority and by promoting the formal and active participation of women in the economy—we aim to transform lives, families, communities and economies and in turn, have the opportunity to grow our markets, brands and business. Over the past six years, Unilever has been in the process of making sure we have gender balance throughout our business. We are currently at 49% gender balance for managers and above in North America and continue to strive to foster an environment where each individual feels uniquely valued and has equal opportunities.  Unilever is committed to creating a working environment that promotes diversity and equal opportunity. We are proud to have developed an inclusive culture and respect the contribution of all employees regardless of gender, age, race, disability or sexual orientation.  Visa: Universal acceptance for everyone, everywhere is not only our brand promise, it’s the foundation of our company culture. Diversity and inclusion is a strategic imperative at Visa, and it requires equal pay for equal work. We regularly review our compensation practices and conduct thorough analyses to ensure pay equity. An inclusive workplace enhances and enriches our environment, successfully drives business results and leads to improved leadership effectiveness and employee engagement. We will continue to take meaningful steps to make progress in this important journey. And we’re proud to sign this pledge as way of affirming our commitment to pay equity for our female employees in the U.S. Prev Next You are here:   Home News National News White House Announces New Commitments to the Equal Pay Pledge Main Menu Imperial Valley News News Latest News Imperial Valley News California News National News Health News Sporting News Living and Lifestyle Career News World News Spanish - Espanol About Us Copyright Infringements Privacy Policy Contact Us Sitemap Web Links Latest News Enjoy yourself; it's later than you think New French law outlaws 'electronic leashes' Lipid metabolism is potential ‘Achilles’ heel’ for cancer stem cells Deputy Secretary of State Blinken To Host Trilateral Meeting With Japanese, South Korean Counterparts Warrant for arrest scam Most Popular News Chicken Noodle Soup product recall Latin American authors reshaping world literature Governor Brown Issues Proclamation Declaring Harvey Milk Day The President and First Lady’s Call to Action on College Opportunity President Obama on the Confirmation of Sarah Saldaña as Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Back to Top © 2017 Imperial Valley News

MacMall Part #: 13696634 Manufacturer Part #: MK0C2AM/A UPC: 888462313674 Platform: Universal Apple Pencil MK0C2AM/A for iPad Pro By now, you've probably heard of how great the iPad Pro is and you know all about its awesome features and so much more. If you already thought that the iPad Pro couldn't get any cooler, then you are wrong because with the Apple Pencil, using the iPad Pro has just become a lot easier and more fun. Precision is everything especially for artists who want their works to be the reflection of their abilities. Create art and so much more on the iPad Pro with precision when you use the iPad Pro Pencil. See for yourself just how effective a tool it really is. The iPad Pencil helps to expand the versatility of the Multi-Touch. It has been designed and engineered to look and feel natural in your hand. So you can create, write, and do so much more with the familiar feel of a pen in your hand. You're probably thinking that the Apple Pencil is just a glorified stylus, but it's not. A lot of engineering went into the making of this pencil, and it features a highly responsive tip that lets any user feel in control of their creations. The secret behind this responsiveness is that the Apple Pencil's latency (the delay between drawing and it appearing on screen) is greatly reduced compared to a regular stylus, giving the user a more enjoyable and natural feel when sketching. Another feature you don't get with a regular stylus is that the iPad Pencil has pressure sensors that can measure the different range of forces. This allows the artist to draw thicker lines just by applying more pressure to the pen. The creativity effects when using the iPad Pro Pencil are limitless and each user can do just about anything they want when they use the iPad Pencil. So what are you waiting for? Get into the future and start using a stylus that is more than a regular stylus. Shop at MacMall today and order your very own Apple Pencil. Also available, Apple iPad Pro Wi-Fi 32GB - Silver. The new Multi-Touch subsystem in iPad Pro gives Apple Pencil striking capabilities alongside pixel-perfect precision Using incredibly sensitive pressure and tilt sensors, Apple Pencil instantly recognizes when you are pressing harder or shifting its angle. So you can vary line weight, create subtle shading, and produce a wide range of artistic effects—just like with a conventional pencil. You may never have seen Apple Pencil before, but you already know how to use it. From the first moment, it does what you expect. And then far more. Whether you’re sketching in the park, painting a watercolor portrait, or drafting a blueprint, Apple Pencil gives you a variety of tools in a single instrument. You hold it, but it doesn’t hold you back. Slip off the magnetic cap of Apple Pencil to reveal a Lightning connector that lets you charge Apple Pencil simply by plugging it into iPad Pro. The connector features a slightly elongated design, so that charging is possible even when iPad Pro is inside its Silicone Case. A full charge gives you 12 hours’ worth of scribbling, sketching, annotating, and editing. And if the battery happens to run out while using Apple Pencil, you can just charge it from your iPad Pro for 15 seconds and get 30 minutes of use.

Was this helpful? Yes|No I placed my order for the Apple Pencil the day that they became available (or, at least, available for to place a pre-order order) from MacMall. Each time that my salesperson contacted me and asked if I wanted to cancel the order for the Pencil, I just said no, that I could wait.<br><br>And so I waited. And it arrived yesterday. And, my, oh, my, is it a thing of beauty. Or, rather I should say, beautiful things can come forth from it.<br><br>For those who can actually draw (not my fortÃ©) the Apple Pencil may be more than just a new tool with a new media for the masses. I can only guess at the possibilities that may be envisioned. But for even retouching schmucks like me I see a new creativity that may emerge... not just a replication of techniques and media (turning a photo into a digital watercolour is getting old hat), but something new. And beautiful. Something never imagined. <br><br>The Apple Pencil, well, looks like a slightly elongated white Pencil. It's heavier. Drop a dot of watercolour on a dampened paper and the colour spreads. Digital canvases with permanent content until you press a button and you've a blank sheet of 'paper.' As they have for decades, Apple hands us the ingredients -----&#62;&#62; now it's up to us to decide how to put it all together. Maybe there's time for me to become an amateur artist after all.<br><br> Written by Clinton, 2016-01-07 MacMall offers next day delivery on select products when you choose them before the stated deadline and use FedEx Standard Overnight, Priority or Saturday delivery.

There's a prize fight punch out between Apple's iPhone for -- and the Samsung Galaxy Nexus on -- Our judges for this fight are senior editor Brian boom boom -- Senior editor Jessica duke it out old port and myself really think all. We'll take all three judges' scores and average is about the nearest tenth each round the final prize by score will be an -- is all -- -- the same system. It's a five round throw down route one is design. The iPhone -- -- retains Apple's iconic design there's no doubt its luxurious phone with its 3.5 inch screen and an all metal and glass body. Now -- might be in the minority that still thinks it's a little blocking the one drop this phone and guess what you're pretty much screen. Now the Samsung Galaxy Nexus brings a four point 65 inch super amoled display that pops with vibrant color and a curved glass design. It's -- to hold but it's also one of the few big screen phones that fits in my pocket nicely. The phone has a textured plastic backing that may not feel as premium but we drop it it has more than a chance to survive. Beauty is in the avenue boulder and -- calling this round a tie at four next round is user interface and control. You might be a little bored with IOS five by now but Apple's nailed it with the easiest pick up and play -- -- on the planet. But even my unborn child continues over time they've added features like -- axis of the camera a customizable notifications drop down and Syria is just one button press away. But there's also the user that wants something sweeter with more control.

The iPhone four S -- one of the best mobile browsers even without flash support and it's -- tight with pinching and zooming. The Retina Display still looks great even -- watching media on it feels a lot smaller compared to Galaxy Nexus. And the iTunes ecosystem still delivers the largest -- media content so you can fine. What -- stand -- feature is this truly amazing eight megapixel camera that embarrasses -- -- more natural colors and sharper images with -- still pictures and 1080. The Galaxy Nexus and it's -- -- screen actually makes navigating web sites easier and multi media content looks plain awesome. There's an instant YouTube feature to upload videos. And the Google play store is now -- legitimate ecosystem with tons of app supporting content that's just slightly behind iTunes. What hurts the most so is that in the year 2012. A top notch -- like this brings a five megapixel camera. Now brings a lot more editing features that we know megapixels don't mean everything. But its camera quality is disappointing and even its cool panorama feature and 1080. The iPhone -- gets a perfect five this round and the Galaxy Nexus gets a four point three. So after averaging four rounds were locked in a dead heat inside the -- That decides it all is call quality -- performance.

Hi-Tech iPhones May Be Able To Capture A Thief’s Photograph And Fingerprint In The Future By Silvia Meyer - August 27, 2016 48 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet 453SHARES ShareTweet Subscribe Apple may be working toward developing an anti-theft technology that will help to protect iPhones. The technology would allow the device to covertly take a photo of a thief, capture their fingerprint, record video and audio as the case may be. The tech giant has filed for a patent application, on Thursday, that describes this proposed system. The patent application states that a trigger condition may cause the capture of biometrics data if the mobile device were to detect unauthorized use. There are some third-party apps that takes photos (automatically) of anyone who tries to unlock an apple device, but they work only on rooted iOS devices. This means that if the tech giant does develop this biometrics-capturing technology, it is possible that many iPhone users will end up with a broad collection of photos while Apple will be storing up biometric data of many innocent people. One of such is the current TouchID fingerprint-technology that requires users to push down their finger many times in a variety of angles to capture the print accurately. How likely will a thief be to inadvertently press down their thumb to the home button more than once? May be Apple will re-define its TouchID so that it will be able to capture fingerprints more effectively. Using the front camera to capture photos, as well as video and audio recordings would be the more likely scenario. One thing that underlines this new development is the notion that Apple devices could turn into secret surveillance tools. From battling with the authorities over unlocking the devices of criminals to declaring that they are not like others that profit from people’s privacy, the tech giant has worked to place itself as a champion for privacy. So could this new development undermine all of that by turning mobile devices into spying tools? 453SHARES ShareTweet Subscribe TAGS iPhones Photograph And Fingerprint SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleUsers Protest WhatsApp’s Move To Share Phone Numbers With Facebook Next articleThe Secret And Powerful Hacking Company Known As NSO Group Silvia Meyer RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Hi-Tech Bentley launches the “most powerful” car Hi-Tech The official release date for the new Samsung Galaxy S8 was revealed Hi-Tech BlackBerry launches new phone LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply * Copy This Password * * Type Or Paste Password Here * 14,189 Spam Comments Blocked so far by Spam Free Wordpress Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

The Apple Watch Sport is the entry-level version of the Apple Watch, but other than materials used it’s pretty much identical to the higher end version. The 38mm version is slightly smaller than the 42mm version but the difference is noticeable once on your wrist so if you have larger wrists it might look a bit small. The Apple Watch Sport is made from aluminium, while the higher end versions are made from stainless steel. In our opinion, the Sport version is just as good as the pricier steel version and you can always pick up nicer third-party bands on Amazon or eBay. Apple is expected to announce the next Apple Watch alongside the iPhone 7, so it’s likely that Best Buy is trying to clear out some inventory before the September unveiling. Nearly nothing is known about what the next Apple Watch will look like or what new features it is going to offer over the current versions. Most of the Apple leaks and rumors that have been hitting the news cycles have been around the iPhone 7. Apple will probably drop pricing on the previous generation of Apple Watch when it releases the new version in September so if you’re in the market for one now, this Best Buy eBay deal is really not bad at all. For $199, a full $100 cheaper than Apple’s price, and free shipping you can’t go too wrong here at all. These watches might drop down another $50 to $149 after the release of the new Apple Watch but they will be in short supply. You also have the option of picking one up used on Swappa or eBay for even cheaper once the new version hits the shelves. Either way, first generation Apple Watch prices should be rather competitive in the next few months.

News Tonight Africa Home Health Mobiles Science Apple CEO Tim Cook sold $36M worth of company stock this week Submitted by Sonwabile Makoni on Sat, 08/27/2016 - 10:12 A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday has revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook has collected $36 million in stock sale. The filing said that Cook – who completed his fifth anniversary as the Apple CEO on Wednesday, August 24 – sold $36 million worth of the Apple stock, close on the heels of lifting the restrictions on 1.26 million shares of stock which he had been previously awarded. According to the SEC filing, more than 656,000 shares have been withheld by Apple to meet tax withholding requirements, while Cook netted approximately $36 million by selling 334,000 shares on the open market this week. The filing has revealed that the Apple shares sold by Cook hit the market on Thursday and Friday, at prices which ranged between a low and high of $106.54 and $107.92 respectively. Meanwhile, as a result of the sale of Apple stock by Cook, 1.31 million shares -- including some earlier Apple stock holdings -- worth nearly $140 million were left with the high-profile Apple executive at closing price on Friday. In the coming years, Cook will also likely collect another 3.5 million shares which are still under restrictions.

Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyberattack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment." Lookout and Citizen Lab worked with Apple on an iOS patch to defend against what was called "Trident" because of its triad of attack methods, the researchers said in a joint blog post. "We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5," Apple said in a released statement. Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organization called NSO Group. It was acquired by the U.S. firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has ever seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. Phishing Scheme After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to Citizen Lab, which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. "The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, install persistent software to gather information," the joint blog post said. "This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they've been compromised."

We’ve seen tons of small MFi keychain chargers and tiny USB battery packs but this is the first time, to my knowledge, that a battery is actually included into a Apple Certified MFi cable. This week, I took the $16 (after code JCRJEWEL) Jackery Jewel for a spin. The idea is pretty simple: Jackery put a 450mAh battery right in the cable.  Now the 450mAh isn’t going to give you a full charge even on an iPhone SE. In fact, in my usage, 25% was a stretch. That’s because the battery, roughly the size and Watt-hour capacity of a AA battery, has about a third the of the iPhone SE and 1/5th the capacity of an iPhone 6S plus. There’s also some inefficiencies of transferring the power. The Jewel isn’t meant to be a full battery replacement however. This is meant to give you an emergency few hour boost when you are away from a plug. We’re talking emergencies here. In real world usage this worked pretty much as expected. It functions as a normal Lightning cable when plugged into a Mac or PC. Data transfer happens like you’d expect and I didn’t notice any lag. If you use your iPhone while plugged in, the battery dangling is a slight inconvenience – I would have probably located the battery closer to the USB A side if I was designing this – but a minor gripe overall. The cable is strong and the joints are at least as strong as Apple’s cables – yes I know Apple has a reputation for fraying cables but if you use them as a baseline, these are certainly stronger. They come with an 18 month warranty which is longer than Apple’s default year warranty. If the Jewel is unplugged and being powered from the battery, it only draws 1A of power and that takes about 25 minutes to drain into the iPhone. However if plugged into a 2.4A USB port it will take the full power and fast charge. IT obviously also charges iPod Touch, iPad and anything else that uses lightning – like Beats speakers and headphones or an Apple TV remote. Also I noted that once plugged back in after running to dead, it took a few seconds for the cable to start charging again. There are definitely some electronic things happening in there. There really isn’t much of a status indicator on the Jewel:  Blue for charged and a blinking red LED for “you are in trouble or almost dead”- if the red light is flashing, the power draw starts dropping to 0 amps. Initially, I thought that the button that you must push to charge using the battery was superfluous but you really want to save that extra battery power for emergencies not just use it right after unplugging the cable. Also, because it is a cable, it is always being charged and ready for that emergancy. I have about 10 USB batteries but I almost always forget to charge them up for emergencies. I wouldn’t recommend something this mAh size for iPads. It will only give you an extra few minutes of usage. However, for $3 less than Apple charges for a Lightning cable, Jackery is selling an Apple certified MFi replacement that includes a working 450mAh battery? Seems like a no brainer. $15.99 (after code JCRJEWEL) We’ll also be giving one of these away as part of our upcoming 9to5Rewards program for someone who retweets or likes the post on Facebook.

By Shruthi PK Posted on August 28, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share Email Apple is all set to release the iPhone 7. However, there will only be a limited supply of Apple?s latest smartphone during the launch. This, because Apple needs more time to manufacture some important components of the iPhone 7. “If Apple sticks to its launch schedule from last year, there may not be enough supply at the beginning, as some suppliers are still trying to fix low yield rates of their components,” a source said. ? The shortage in supply will affect the sales revenue. “We estimate total iPhone 7 builds to be 74 (million) in 2H16F, compared to 84 (million) for iPhone 6s in 2H15. Together with pricing pressure, we expect most Apple food chain suppliers to see (year-on-year) revenue decline for the rest of the year,” Jeff Pu, an analyst at Yuanta Investment Consulting, mentioned in his note, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. The existing iPhone models are also not performing well in the market. iPhone 7 Features: What We Know So Far? Apple is likely to eliminate the home button and install a fingerprint scanner under the screen. According to leaked information, the iPhone 7 is packing a dual camera and Apple is installing a ?7.04Wh battery. There will be no headphone jacks. Instead, buyers will get to use wireless earbuds. The iPhone 7 will be available in five colors ? space black, gold, rose gold, silver and space gray. Apple is reworking on the audio features of the iPhone 7. ?On its patent, the brand has written that it is installing an audio element which can be mounted on or coupled to an intermediate structure having an opening therein to allow audio sound to pass therethrough. According to previous reports, the iPhone 7?s design will be inspired by the ?iPhone 6S. ?Intel is manufacturing chips for the iPhone version which will be used on AT&T Inc.?s U.S. network. IPhones on Verizon Communications Inc.?s network will be sporting a Qualcomm modem. A report had claimed that the iPhone 7 will feature a wonderful technology known as LiFi. LiFi is faster than WiFi. The iPhone 7 32GB variant will have the price tag of $802 whereas the 64GB model is expected to cost $924. The 128GB and 256GB variant will cost $1,045 and $1,197, respectively.

As far back as the 1930s, drivers were listening to AM radio on the first Motorola in-dash units. As the 20th century progressed, so did our in-vehicle technology. We went from AM to FM radio, in-dash record players, cassettes, the 8-track tape, and the compact disc. The iPod came along in 2001, and so did a proliferation of Aux-in jacks for them to connect to. Now we had a thousand songs in our pocket and our car. Of course, like all the other technology before it, the iPod was soon obsolete, replaced by the smartphone. It used to be that turning on the radio was an exciting experience. You never knew what song would be playing, nor when your favorite tune would come on. But this is a worry no longer, thanks to on-demand music streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music. Except for one thing. Our damn iPhones seem to play the same damn song every time we plug them in. It turns out that the iPhone, for whatever reason, decides to play the first song it can find when plugging into a vehicle USB port or connecting via Bluetooth. And it’s always the first song alphabetically. And no matter how good that song is, eventually, after you hear the first few seconds of it over and over and over and over every time you start your car… well, eventually it’s enough to ruin even the most catchy tune. We decided to poll The Verge staff, assemble these various songs (most, unsurprisingly, with titles starting with the letter A) and share a little bit about what they mean to us. Have a look, listen, and let us know what song your iPhone decides to play when you go for a ride. And please, Apple, can we get this fixed in iOS 11? — Jordan Golson "Accidentally Like A Martyr" by Warren Zevon I mostly use streaming services these days, so my iTunes library is almost totally old favorite albums that I listen to when I’m out of service areas or on planes. Zevon, obviously, falls into that category — and I have a ton of him on iTunes because I haven’t figured out how to reasonably integrate all his bootlegs with my streaming services. So the song is, as the kids say, very on-brand. Unfortunately, it’s not top-shelf Zevon, and it’s a hella bummer of a song. If I’m feeling blue, I’ll let it play out, but more often than not, I skip it (by opening Spotify or Tidal), There are only so many times you can hear "The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder." — Liz Lopatto "A Beginning Song" by The Decemberists The song that’s at the top of my iTunes library is "A Beginning Song" off The Decemberists’ latest album, What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World. I’ve had an on-again / off-again relationship with the band since college. I was never a huge fan of their earlier works, but I’ve really liked the direction that they’ve gone in albums like The Crane Wife, The King Is Dead and this one. For me, "A Beginning Song" is the perfect sort of driving song. It’s got a relaxed beat and solid vocals that make it perfect for driving up rural Vermont roads with the windows down. Fortunately, there’s rarely anyone around to hear me singing along. — Andrew Liptak "The A Team" by Ed Sheeran Like Liz, I use another streaming service for my music fix these days, but Apple has managed to muscle its way into my car, which means that when I plug my iPhone into the dashboard mount it still defaults to iTunes. Most of my car rides over the past few years have started off on a rather depressing note with Ed Sheeran’s breakout hit "The A Team." Makes sense; the song literally starts with "A." If I’m in a certain mindset, I’ll listen to it again. It’s a sad song, about a meth-addled prostitute ("Call girl, no phone"); it was reportedly based on Sheeran's experience playing a gig at a homeless shelter. If there’s anything that could be said in defense of the song it’s probably that it’s Sheeran at his purist — long before he did a duet with Taylor Swift or wrote a de facto wedding song. Most days, though, I quickly shuffle the music, and if someone else is in the car and hears "The A Team" I usually feel the need to explain that it’s iTunes that has programmed the mood. — Lauren Goode "About To Die" by Dirty Projectors The other day, my wife and I got into our 2013 Subaru Impreza. As usual, I plugged in my iPhone, but before my wife could shout "No not that song again!" that song started playing… again. The song that always plays every time I plug my phone in, because it is the first track on the only album I have in my iTunes library. Unfailingly, the loopy percussion of "About To Die" by Dirty Projectors hits my car’s speakers before my finger can swipe up my phone’s control panel to pause the track. It’s not a bad song. In fact, it is a very good song. It used to be one of my favorites off the band’s 2012 masterpiece, Swing Lo Magellan. But because it now plays totally unprompted every time I plug my phone into my car, it has become that song: the song that plays itself, the song that never asked to be played. Maybe it’s appropriate. Despite its poppy, off-kilter beat and infectious vocals, the song’s lyrics are very bleak, full of emptiness and panic about imminent death. That’s reflected in my own personal panic that I feel every time the song cues up. I fear the song. I fear death. And while we’re all about to die, maybe we don’t listen to that particular song a gazillion times in a row, thus ruining it forever for certain people, hmmm Apple? — Andrew J. Hawkins "About Face" by Grizzly Bear I only have four albums on Apple Music, and I can’t remember how or why they got there. There are the soundtracks for Once and The Wind Rises, Guillemots Through the Windowpane, and Grizzly Bear’s Veckatimest (the latter of which is responsible for my garage goodbye song). "About Face" is as fine a song as any, I suppose, to start every single trip every single day. Though over the past year of becoming intimately familiar with its first 10 seconds — I only began driving again last May, so I guess you could say my relationship with "About Face" is just beginning to bloom — I’ve realized the song’s true calling: to be a ringtone. The repeated progression of carefully plucked notes interrupted by a distorted gnh-gnh is the perfect balance of pleasing and grating that a ringtone requires. You won’t mind hearing the beginning of "About Face" over and over again, no, not at all, but each double-screech will shout from your smartphone, like Linda Loman letting you know attention must be paid to this call from your parents at 3PM on a Saturday. Frankly, "About Face" is wasted as my autoplay car song, where at best it evokes a semi-smile, and at worst it is ignored as I scramble to open Spotify. — Chris Plante "A$AP Rocky x Purity Ring (Pesobedear)" by the Hood Internet Every once in a while, I click my earbuds to resume a podcast, and instead my iPhone plays the first track in Apple Music: a mashup of A$AP Rocky’s "Peso" with Purity Ring’s "Obedear." I wasn’t previously familiar with "Peso," a hazy ode to the hustle, but "Obedear" I have long loved for its inscrutable creepiness. In the hands of the Hood Internet, whose annual mixtapes are a cherished staple of my gym playlist, the artists make for a potent combination. Rocky’s lyric floats over Purity Ring’s darkly shimmering synths, and a noticeable swagger creeps into my stride. At least until I remember I was trying to listen to a podcast, and pause the track again. — Casey Newton "A-Plus" by Hieroglyphics I usually connect my phone to the car via Bluetooth, which means my radio is pretty good about respecting what’s happening in Spotify, but every now and then I plug into USB to charge, and my car is instantly transported back to 2003. 2003, when any music player plugged into a car was an IPOD rendered in all capital letters. 2003, five years after Del tha Funkee Homosapien and his crew formed Hieroglyphics and put out 3rd Eye Vision. 2003, when loading your IPOD with critically beloved indie rap albums actually implied that you might listen to those records instead of just adding them to your Spotify lists like so much more identity curation on a social platform. 2003, when my friends turned me onto Del and I loaded 3rd Eye Vision on my IPOD and actually listened to it all the time, along with all the other new music I consumed as complete albums instead of biting off singles on Discover Weekly with no relationship to anyone or anything or any art in particular. Goddamn I miss 2003. — Nilay Patel "A/B Machines" by Sleigh Bells Everybody gets in the car with a tiny little ritual: sit down, adjust seat, plug phone, shift, pause, check mirrors, etc. And though it doesn’t happen every time, sometimes CarPlay does decide it’s time to just start playing the first song in Apple Music. And for me, that song is "A/B Machines" from Sleigh Bells’ Treats album. So in at least this one, tiny way, I can claim to have been cool, once. Adjust the mirror a little further, look into your own eyes as the distorted lyrics blast out. Yes, it’s true, you had it once. Maybe you’re faded now, but you can get it back. Shift into gear, drive. Your A machines are on the table. Turn them up. — Dieter Bohn Next Up In Transportation Mercedes will give Tesla's Autopilot its first real competition this year Uber Chopper is a total marketing gimmick that happens to be stupid fun All of the electric, connected, self-driving cars at CES 2017 I rode in Faraday Future’s FF91, the electric car powered by hubris Diesel cars produce more toxic emissions than trucks and buses, EU study says Nissan and BMW bring Microsoft's Cortana assistant to cars Now Trending This is Apple’s click wheel iPhone prototype Microsoft’s Windows 10 design refresh revealed in leaked screenshots How much can police find out from a murderer’s Echo?

Cloud music storage services can help – and there’s a lot out there. Here are some of the best cloud storage solutions for your songs: Don’t worry, they’re all free to use, too!   1. Google Play Out of the major brands, Google Play offers one of the most versatile free cloud storage for music. With Google Play you can upload up to 50,000 songs from your computer to the Play cloud servers – and that includes music from other sources including iTunes. You do this through the Music Manager app that Google offers, which can successfully save your songs, playlists, and ratings. Then you can access that music through Google Play via any Android platform or the Web itself. You can download Google Play for free here   2. iCloud iCloud on its own is a fair free cloud music storage service for moving your music around. You may not be surprised to learn that it is limited to music that you buy from the iTunes Store, but within that framework iCloud is a solid service for transferring songs between your Apple devices (it also works for the newer Windows devices). The automatic syncing functions mean that you don’t have to worry your new music showing up on your iPhone or iPad once you buy it. However, the true music storage service of Apple’s is iTunes Match, which allows you to store music in the Apple cloud from any source and also ties into ad-free iTunes Radio. Unfortunately, there’s no free options here (yet), you’ll have to pay a couple bucks a month to use it. You can learn how to set up iCloud here   3. Amazon Cloud Player Amazon Cloud Player is a somewhat less useful cloud storage option, not because of its lack of features but because the best features are available when you upgrade to Premium, which of course costs money. However, the basic service still allows you more than a couple hundred free uploads worth of free storage, and is dedicated to music with a focus on Amazon Music services. However, there are Cloud Player apps available across the major platforms with plenty of flexible curation options, so you still retain a lot of control…providing you like Amazon services in the first place, of course. You can download Amazon Cloud Player here   4. Synology Audio Station Synology’s cloud storage offering is a little…different. First, the service and its associated programs are definitely free, and they offer unlimited micromanagement of your songs in what is one of the best cloud music storage options available. The downside is that they are only available through a Synology server device, which you already need to have (or at least have access to). But if the conditions are right, you probably won’t find better customization options around after installing the various DiskStation Manager and Audio station programs. There are options to download music for iTunes, etc., but as the tutorials show Synology is typically used in a Windows environment. You can learn more about downloading Synology Audio Station here   5. StreamNation StreamNation is a relatively recent addition the media storage service world, and it has some of the best cloud storage for music around. The app offers one-click imports of music libraries like iTunes, and allows to stream to any other device you want. It can then use music to recommend new songs in the genres that you like or show you what your friends are listening to. The interface also impresses with its flowing, album covered-based design. There are several different plans to choose from, but the free version gives you 20GB of data, not too shabby at all. You can get started with the StreamNation service here   6. My Music Cloud My Music Cloud is a simpler service than many on the list, but that simplicity is part of its charm. Like StreamNation, the service offers one-click importing from iTunes, Dropbox, etc., but there’s much more of a focus on streaming services (plus some capabilities to listen offline). Like Spotify and other apps, My Music Cloud can learn your preferences by seeing what music you play and suggest similar artists or remind you of uploaded songs that you haven’t listened to in a while yet. Storage, however, is a little limited with the free version offering 250 tracks max.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Deals-Deals+ Wearables-Wearables+ There was plenty of excitement in the run-up the Apple Watch, which hit the scene just over a year ago. Initial sales sharply dwindled following a fair amount of early hype, and it remains to be seen whether this product category has a long-term future. Still, Apple is said to be pressing ahead with the second-coming of its wearable, which could be announced alongside the next-gen iPhones in the coming weeks. The impending nature of the new hardware means that the current model is cheaper than ever — down to below the $200 mark through Best Buy. UPDATE: The $199 variant appears to have sold out already. Right now, the basic Apple Watch Sport 38mm edition in Space Gray is down to $199. It's a considerable saving on the original starting price of $349 when the Apple Watch was launched, and $100 less than Cupertino currently charges. Sure, it's not as cheap as certain other wrist computers on the market. But with watchOS 3 set to add bunch of new features to the fold, now's your chance to grab the device itself for under 200 bucks.  Apple Watch 2 will apparently amount to a refresh as opposed to a major overhaul. Previous rumors of an in-built camera seem to have died down, and there will not be cellular support despite some users hoping for such connectivity. Instead, there'll apparently be GPS, improved waterproofing and the customary speed bump. In line with the next-generation iPhone upgrades, the new Apple Watch will look similar if not identical to the current fleet. Aside from the aforementioned Space Gray version, a number of other Apple Watch variants are currently available at for less than you might have seen before. If you have been waiting patiently for an Apple Watch price-drop, you can check out all of the current offers in full at the source.  The Apple Watch in pictures Popular galleries #TheNextGalaxy: Here are 8 rumored features of the Samsung Galaxy S8, S8 edge, and S8 Plus Remember when the Motorola DROID Bionic wowed everyone at CES?

When first announced earlier this summer, the item was expected to reach $1 million or more, but it ended up selling for $815,000, with 10% of the proceeds being donated to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. The reason this Apple-1 model is so unique is because it’s a hand-built pre-production version, which was never to sold to customers. It’s the green PCB board that gives the auctioned model its “Celebration” name. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak noted that when he and Steve Jobs were originally selling the Apple-1 back in 1976, there were only two production runs, and a green PCB board was never used or sold to the public. During the final moments of the auction, the bidding reached as high as $1.2 million. However, at the very last second the last bid was pulled, although it’s unclear why. Had the sale topped the $1 million mark, it would’ve set a new price record for an Apple-1 computer. Aside from the rarity, part of what the item so valuable was the fact that it included a near-complete set of original documentation, including early Apple 1 Basic cassettes, a period correct power supply, original manuals and marketing materials, and Apple 1 ACI Cassette Board schematics. Appraisers noted that they believed the circuit board could even be powered up, but recommended that buyers don’t try so as to protect the condition and history of the computer.

Don’t worry Jimmy Lin has got you covered. The Taiwanese pop star has gotten a reputation for leaking upcoming Apple iPhones before they are officially unveiled. This time Lin appeared in public with the fabled device on hand. According to Forbes, the pop-star has been photographed holding what appears to be an iPhone 7 Plus. Aside from the Apple logo slightly covered by his hands, prominently displayed is the phone’s dual camera set-up. As to be expected the phone holds a striking resemblance to its predecessor. This is in line with the numerous leaks that have been circulating on the web. Also Read: iPhone 7 Preview – Most Boring Apple Smartphone Ever? Unfortunately, all the photo shows us is the phone’s aesthetics and not even all of it. Fortunately, if there’s anything we can expect from Jimmy Lin is that a leak of the phone’s full features will be coming out soon. While each leak has some aspect of self publicity for the ex-teen idol, his track record screams that we trust him. Lin never missed an opportunity to divulge details about the latest iPhone models before Apple even does. This all started back in 2012 when he posed with an iPhone 5 on his Weibo page before the phone was released. He followed it with an iPhone 5C in 2013 and iPhone 6 in 2014. Apple employees in Hong Kong even confirmed the authenticity of Lin’s iPhone 5C. The pop-star apparently took a short break last year, opting not to leak details about the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6 Plus. According to Phone Arena, this could be due to the two phones being almost identical to the iPhone 6. Now he has returned to the scene with Apple’s latest model, which features major changes from its predecessors. This includes a lack of a headphone jack and an increase in storage space. Expect more details about the phone when Apple officially unveils it next month. For now keep an eye on Jimmy Lin and his social media accounts. The next leak regarding the iPhone 7 could be just a few days away. For more iPhone 7 updates, you can subscribe to our newsletter.

Weekly Roundup: Zero-day hacks rock Apple, WhatsApp changes privacy policy Posted Aug 27, 2016 by Anna Escher (@annaescher) 0 SHARES Next Story Understanding debt August, the weekend of months. This week a zero-day hack rocked Apple, WhatsApp announced a major privacy change and Tesla announced a new model that takes Ludicrous Mode to the next level. Would you rather get the Weekly Roundup in your inbox? Same, TBH.  1. Hackers are honing in on mobile devices. The latest example was an Apple zero-day hack targeting activist Ahmed Mansoor that employed not one but three zero-day exploits that were addressed by a patch. The investigation suggested these were the work of a shady cybersecurity company, and the software may have been used for years by governments looking to compromise political targets. So, if you haven’t done so yet, update your iOS devices to 9.3.5. 2. WhatsApp came out with a huge shift in its privacy policy. The Facebook-owned messaging app will now share user data with Facebook for ad targeting. You have a few options: stop using WhatsApp, or take advantage of the partial opt out the app is offering users for a short period of time. Here’s a step by step on how to opt out.  3. Google announced a major change to its search results. The company will start punishing mobile sites that make content less accessible with intrusive ads, by ranking them lower in search results. These are ads that appear right when you open a site, take over the whole page and have the smallest possible button for dismissing them. Good riddance! 4. Can Apple social? Apple may be working on a video recording and editing app that may be similar to Snapchat. There’s no mention of ephemeral content, but reports said the app is supposed to be easy to use with one hand for video recording, and mentioned filters and drawing functionality. 5. Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company’s stock surged after Elon Musk teased an announcement on Twitter, and then revealed a shiny new model. Tesla has a new Model S P100D that is boosting Ludicrous Mode up by 0.1 second 0-60 mph time. 6. Uber was just upstaged by a small MIT spinout. A much lower profile company called NuTonomy launched the world’s first self-driving taxi as its autonomous vehicles hit the roads of Singapore. The three-year-old company had been privately testing self-driving cars in Singapore since April. Uber, what say you? 7. What’s really going on at Hyperloop One – the futuristic transportation system proposing to shoot humans from point A to B at 750 miles-per-hour? (Besides a leadership shake up, lawsuit, countersuit and $80 million in funding.) The company is still in its early stages, but is gathering huge potential to change the transportation industry – if the company can bring itself up to speed. 8. For the first time, astronomers discovered a planet orbiting our sun’s nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri. Proxima b is officially the closest exoplanet to Earth, but what’s important about this is that it’s at the right distance from its sun to support liquid water…and potentially alien life. Welcome to the neighborhood, Proxima b! This artist’s impression shows a view of the surface of the planet Proxima b orbiting the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Solar System. 9. Android Nougat came out of beta. It’s available for Google’s own Nexus devices (the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player), the Pixel C tablet and the General Mobile 4G. The most apparent change is in the notifications system, with a closer look to Google’s Material Design guidelines. 10. Y Combinator held its Summer 2016 Demo Days 1 and 2, consisting of presentations from startups ranging from farming drones, autonomous security guards to next-gen tampons. In-flight VR entertainment and security guard drones were amongst our top pics for the most promising startups from Day 1. Gunshot detectors, sales team analytics and credit reports for immigrants were some of our favorites from Day 2. 11. Harvard Business School students are taught about the art of venture capital. Among one case study the class learned last year was in fact the story of Rothenberg Ventures, founded by a HBS graduate and subject of recent VC downfall.   0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Apple issues update after security flaws laid bare Technology Friday 26 August 2016 - 8:07pm File: Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone 'that subverts even Apple's strong security environment'. Photo: EPA/Shawn Thew SAN FRANCISCO – Owners of Apple mobile gadgets on Friday were being urged to instal a quickly released security update to fix flaws exposed by a sophisticated attack on an Emirati dissident. The California-based iPhone maker released a new version of its mobile operating system, iOS 9.3.5, on Thursday, saying in a post that it doesn't confirm security issues until they are investigated and patched. Researchers at Lookout mobile security firm and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said they uncovered a fierce, three-pronged cyber attack targeting a dissident's iPhone "that subverts even Apple's strong security environment". Lookout and Citizen Lab worked with Apple on an iOS patch to defend against what was called "Trident" due to its triad of attack methods, the researchers said in a joint blog post. Trident is used in spyware referred to as Pegasus, which a Citizen Lab investigation showed was made by an Israel-based organisation called NSO Group. NSO Group was acquired by US firm Francisco Partners Management six years ago, according to Lookout and Citizen. READ: Extensive training essential to combat cyber crime globally Lookout referred to Pegasus as the most sophisticated attack it has seen, sneakily accessing calls, cameras, email, passwords, apps and more on iPhones. The spyware was detected when used against Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been repeatedly targeted using spyware. Phishing scheme After receiving a suspicious text with a link, he reported the matter to the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab which worked in conjunction with San Francisco-based Lookout to research the affair. "The attack sequence, boiled down, is a classic phishing scheme: send text message, open web browser, load page, exploit vulnerabilities, instal persistent software to gather information," the joint blog post said. "This, however, happens invisibly and silently, such that victims do not know they’ve been compromised." Mansoor received text messages on 10 and 11 August promising that secrets about detainees being tortured in UAE jails could be accessed by clicking on an enclosed link, researchers said. Had he fallen for the ruse, the Trident chain of "zero-day exploits" would have broken into his iPhone and installed sophisticated spy software. Mansoor was targeted five years ago with FinFisher spyware and again the following year with Hacking Team spyware, according to Citizen Lab research. "The use of such expensive tools against Mansoor shows the lengths that governments are willing to go to target activists," researchers said. The cyber attack on Mansoor was not linked to a specific government. UAE authorities did not comment on the matter. Lookout and Citizen believe that the spyware has been "in the wild for a significant amount of time". "It is also being used to attack high-value targets for multiple purposes, including high-level corporate espionage on iOS, Android, and Blackberry." Citizen Lab has also found evidence that "state-sponsored actors" used NSO cyber weapons against a Mexican journalist who reported on high-level corruption in that country and on an unknown target in Kenya. The NSO Group tactics included impersonating sites such as the International Committee for the Red Cross; the British government's visa application processing website, and a wide range of news organisations and major technology companies, according to researchers.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Aug 27, 2016 at 10:23AM With broad market indices like the S&P 500 trading roughly 66% above their long-run averages, the search for cheap stocks to buy can seem daunting for the individual investor. However, the search for cheap stocks -- particularly good dividend stocks -- isn't necessarily as challenging as it might initially seem. Case in point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) offers plenty of investment opportunities hiding in plain sight. Let's quickly review the five cheapest stocks in the Dow today. Finding great value stocks can be a laborious process. Image Source: Getty. What are the five cheapest stocks in the Dow? According to data from S&P CapIQ, the five Dow components trading at the lowest valuations -- as defined by their price-to-earnings or P/E ratios -- are megabank JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), insurance stalwart The Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV), credit card company American Express (NYSE:AXP), tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and struggling IT behemoth IBM (NYSE:IBM). Compared to the S&P 500's 25 times P/E ratio, this consortium of cheap stocks trades at multiples roughly 50% below the broad market. Here's a snapshot of each individual company's valuation. Company Name Ticker P/E Ratio JPMorgan Chase & Co. NYSE: JPM 11.2 times The Travelers Companies, Inc. NYSE: TRV 11.3 times American Express Company NYSE: AXP 11.6 times Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL 12.8 times International Business Machines Corporation NYSE: IBM 13 times Data source: S&P CapIQ. Though grossly oversimplified, a host of academic research suggests that investors who buy cheap stocks can outperform the average market performance over the long term. This philosophy comprises the bedrock of "value investing," which was popularized by billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Perhaps it should then come as no surprise that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns major stakes in three of the names appearing in the above chart: American Express, Apple, and IBM. However, not all "cheap" stocks are created equal. Any stock can be cheap or expensive for a whole host of reasons, some positive and others quite negative. As you'll see below, investors looking to buy value stocks always need to delve into the specifics of why each company sports its relative valuation. Digging deeper To further elucidate this point, let's briefly examine a name or two from the list above that are either opportunities to buy cheap or risky investments worth avoiding. As a positive example, Apple's paltry 12.8 times price-to-earnings ratio makes it a legitimate value stock for investors. Though its golden decades of historic growth are long gone, Apple still has plenty going for it today. Its shares today trade at their substantial discount because of what will likely prove a cyclical lull in its iPhone business. Apple will soon launch an updated form factor of its all-important iPhone -- likely next month. In anticipation of this, consumers have predictably held off from purchasing Apple's soon-to-be-outdated iPhone 6 models. True, Apple's iPhone 7 might prove to be a relatively unimpressive Image source: Apple. upgrade over its predecessor. However, given Apple's incredible customer loyalty and brand strength, it seems more likely that a disappointing iPhone 7 will simply shift iPhone purchases one year further out into the future -- when Apple will reportedly debut an impressive 10th anniversary iPhone -- rather than cause a mass exodus toward Android-based rivals like Samsung. Should this play out as described, investors willing to buy while sentiment around Apple remains muted stand to be handsomely rewarded. On the other hand, American Express stands as a counter-example. As the result of a few industrywide trends, AmEx finds itself facing several relatively new competitive pressures. The company lost key card partnerships with Costco and Fidelity, while also facing new pressure in the credit card space from big banks and increased regulations. Its performance has predictably suffered, and its share price has underperformed the broad market by nearly 40% in the past two years. American Express certainly isn't remaining idle in reaction. The company has enacted substantial cost cuts while also investing in new growth initiatives. However, unlike Apple, where a clear roadmap for multiple expansion is evident, American Express' path back to its longtime dominance isn't nearly as clear -- though it is certainly possible. Either way, hopefully this illustrates that investors looking to buy cheap stocks like those above should dig deeper into the particulars of each individual stock before buying.

Spotify doesn't like it when big-name acts take their music to Apple or Tidal first. But it's not punishing them when they do, by making their stuff harder to find in the music service's search results, the company says. That accusation, sourced to anonymous sources in a Bloomberg report out Friday, is "unequivocally false," says a Spotify rep. That makes sense, since it would be bad for Spotify's business if its users had a hard time finding music they wanted from the likes of Drake and Kanye West, who have brought new releases to Apple and Tidal before releasing it on Spotify. Spotify wouldn't comment on other charges, levied by sources in reports from Bloomberg and the New York Times, that Spotify wasn't going to go out of its way to promote releases from acts that went to rivals first. More from Recode: RIP Facebook Trending headlines, favorite punching bag of Media Twitter Spotify says it isn't punishing artists who cut exclusive deals with Apple and Tidal Google X's newest hire suggests it is trying to jump-start its self-driving car business Getty Images Drake performing That would make much more sense, since Spotify will want some way to signal that artists shouldn't engage in exclusives, which Apple and Tidal have secured by giving artists some combination of cash, equity and marketing support. For instance: Frank Ocean's new album "Blonde" debuted exclusively on Apple Music this weekend, and industry sources say it will stay there for another week or two. When that exclusive winds up, Spotify will want to make it available to its 75 million customers instead of giving them a reason to move to Apple, which says it has 15 million subscribers. But it will want to make the case to Ocean and other artists that they would ultimately have done better if they had let Spotify give it a full promotional push from the get-go. "Blonde's" Apple Music release this weekend triggered an internal announcement from Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge, where Grainge said he wanted to stop future exclusives. But even the head of the world's biggest music label won't be able to stop exclusives if Apple and Tidal want to keep paying up for them. That's in part because some superstars on his labels will have the clout to get them, simply because other big stars did. Meanwhile, other stars on different labels have different deals and leverage. Beyonce, for instance, has a deal with Sony but is also a part-owner in Tidal, controlled by her husband Jay Z. She is streaming "Lemonade," her last album, exclusively through Tidal, though she eventually let Apple and other services sell downloads. Frank Ocean's example is the most intriguing, since he released "Blonde" on his own, after finishing up a contract with Universal. That makes him the most recent artist to become famous while signed to a major label, and then try releasing music on their own. Prince did it back in the CD era, and Radiohead tried it nine years ago with "In Rainbows." Tim Mosenfelder | Getty Images Frank Ocean Eventually, though, most artists who have gone out on their own have ended up working with big labels again, at least for some parts of their music-selling operations. Because while it is easy enough to record your own music, promoting it and distributing it have been hassles. And even really famous acts often like getting money before they make something, instead of hoping to make money when it sells. But those examples all come from the pre-streaming era. Now, when streaming dominates, and a handful of platforms dominate streaming, it may be feasible for big acts to record their stuff and hand it to Apple, Tidal and Spotify on their own terms. Which means the big labels will have to work hard — and pay up — to convince big acts to stick with them. —By Peter Kafka, Recode.net.

The US singer and actress revealed she once called the late Apple founder Steve Jobs to request he personally help fix her computer problems. The 74-year-old told Good Morning Britain host Ross King: "I couldn't figure out something on my computer and nobody could figure it out, no IT guy, so I said; 'Can you get Steve Jobs on the phone?'" "Sure enough, I asked him about this problem and he couldn't figure it out. He gave me his IT guy, who also couldn't figure out. That was funny." Renowned for her lavish tour demands after 50 years in the music business, these latest revelations seem to fit with her character. The news comes soon after she confessed to telling Apple's current CEO Tim Cook that the iPhone's inbuilt virtual assistant, Siri, pronounces her name incorrectly. Cook took over as head of Apple in 2011 after Jobs lost his battle with pancreatic cancer. Streisand, perhaps aware of how demanding the anecdotes make her sound, went on to try and assure viewers she was not always so direct. "First of all, I don't want to be rejected, so I have my team, my A&R man, my manager, call their managers. They don't just pick up the phone. I only did that with Steve Jobs," she said. A keen Hillary Clinton supporter, the star recently mocked Donald Trump by singing Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight show, report the Daily Mail. Streisand is promoting her new album Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway, on which she duets with film stars including Anne Hathaway, Daisy Ridley and Hugh Jackman, state The Times. Outside entertainment, the star is known for inadvertently creating the Streisand effect, a term used to describe how the attempted removal of information from the internet can lead to it being publicised more widely, after Streisand tried to have pictures of her Malibu home removed from an estate agent's website.

One is for a figurative version of the trademark while the other represents text-only. We covered Apple's filing of the Apple Pencil figurative trademark last September 2015. Apple announced the iPad Pro along with the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard accessories on September 9, 2015 and was available to order online on November 9, 2015.   When Apple launched the iPad Pro with Apple Pencil they noted that "Apple Pencil for iPad Pro is a precision input device which makes drawing and sketching feel remarkably fluid and natural. The touch subsystem of the Multi-Touch display in iPad Pro has been redesigned to work with Apple Pencil to dramatically reduce latency and deliver incredible accuracy for activities like fine art illustration and detailed 3D design.

However, we aren’t expecting a sea change upgrade this time around. Three weeks ago, a KGI report noted that the new Apple Watch 2 upgrade would include GPS, better waterproofing and improved performance but retain the same design. Another report last week reaffirmed those claims. A launch alongside the iPhone 7 next month seems obvious.  Apple, therefore, is likely in a hurry to clear current inventory (indeed shortages are already being seen) ahead of the launch and that takes the form of a $199 price tag on the base model Apple Watch Sport 38mm Space Gray Aluminum Case… As 9to5Toys notes, a new Apple Watch hit the $199.oo price point last night at Best Buy, marking a new milestone in the pricing. Apple and other retailers almost always price match (but it is easiest to get at online at Best Buy’s ebay storefront) so effectively the price of the Apple Watch now starts at $199 at retail in the US.  Open Box models start at $180 and there are a wide variety of options including 42mm models. The price is $100 off of Apple’s retail price which was reduced by $50 earlier this year from its original $349 base launch price. I would guess that even after the update, the original Apple Watch will still sell for around $200 so if you have been waiting on a $200 Apple Watch, I think it is still a safe time to buy. At $200, Apple Watch competes well with other fitness bands and you get so much more, especially with watchOS 3 waiting in the wings.   Subscribe to our YouTube channel for more hands-on videos and reviews Guides Apple Watch View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Until now. Photo: Bloomberg New York/Paris: Apple has hitched itself to music celebrities to pitch Apple Music, the $10-a-month digital service launched a year ago. There was the very public catering to Taylor Swift. Apple broke out its checkbook for exclusive rights to albums from Frank Ocean and Chance the Rapper. Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails and Dr. Dre are Apple executives now. Apple Music is so beyond cool it’s frozen. But to take Apple Music mainstream, Apple needs to cozy up not only to the hip musicians but also to the dull guys in suits who run the world’s mobile phone companies. They won’t get Tim Cook into hot parties, but the phone companies are crucial to Apple Music’s future. In Europe and other parts of the globe, it has become common for carriers like Vodafone in the UK or Orange in France to pair phone plans with short-term discounted or free subscriptions to Spotify, Deezer or other streaming music services. Paying a monthly subscription is still a fairly novel way to buy music, and free or low-cost trial offers through mobile phone companies have become one of the biggest ways to sell people on the benefits of membership. Such music bundles represented more than one-fifth of global music subscribers in 2015, according to music industry analyst Mark Mulligan. Apple on its own offers three months free of Apple Music, but it hasn’t really struck deals with phone carriers to promote Apple Music. Until now. Apple and BT Group’s EE, the biggest mobile phone carrier in the UK, are teaming up to give EE customers six months of Apple Music free. The deal has the potential to double the subscriber count for Apple Music if EE’s 14 million 4G wireless customers are added to Apple Music’s existing 15 million paying subscribers. Apple from the earliest days of the iPhone has had rocky relationships with mobile carriers. Almost on principle, Apple thought they didn’t care about consumers and Apple did. But right now, Apple really, really believes in the principle that Apple Music should be huge. Steve Jobs and Apple dismissed streaming music until the rise of companies like Spotify and Pandora proved people were happy to listen to music online without paying for iTunes downloads. Apple wants Apple Music to succeed to continue the company’s heritage on the music vanguard and to keep people buying iPhones. The company should strike even more EE-like deals with its friends/antagonists in the mobile phone business to ensure Apple Music catches on. There are always perils of leaning too hard on phone companies to market an app or digital feature. People who receive a free service might not want it or be unwilling to pay for it. Or the phone company will lose interest in the promotions and stop pushing them aggressively. The symbol for this danger is French music subscription service Deezer, which was seriously wounded by a partnership with Orange it used to increase subscribers quickly. When Deezer was trying to go public last year, the company disclosed that 53% of its 6.3 million subscribers were “inactive bundle subscribers”—meaning they had received the service as part of their mobile phone plans but hadn’t actually used it. Those 3.34 million zombie subscribers generated some revenue from Orange’s undisclosed fee to Deezer. But they weren’t paying full price for their subscriptions and they weren’t likely to keep paying their monthly bills for long. Deezer’s experience shows that it isn’t difficult to get people to try streaming music subscriptions. The key is doing the right things to make them stick around once their monthly cost goes from zero to $10 a month. The payoff can be huge. A person familiar with Spotify’s business said it was putting a lot of effort into teaching new subscribers how to use the service and had converted more than 70% of people on telecom offers to paid subscriptions. Apple could avoid Deezer’s zombie problem, but it needs to coddle new subscribers more than it does now. When Shira received a free three-month subscription to Apple Music last year, she received only two emails from Apple—one welcoming her as a new subscriber and another three months later asking her to set her iPhone to automatically charge her credit card once the free subscription ended. She didn’t. Apple has spent a small fortune to make Apple Music appealing with exclusive music deals and payouts to artists. To make Apple Music mainstream, though, it needs span the globe to get its service on as many people’s phones as possible and do much more to make sure they stick around once the free ride ends.

This is despite the fact that he was the sole person behind the invention and building of the Apple 1, the first home computer that used a keyboard and normal TV screen as a display. Steve Jobs was arguably the force behind the creation of Apple, but the technology came from the mind of Wozniak. Wozniak is currently on a speaking tour of Australia and appeared in Perth this week. I had the opportunity to talk to him before the show and ask a few questions. You can see the full interview between David Glance and Steve Wozniak in the video below. Wozniak left Apple in 1985 to finish a degree of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California at Berkeley. He did this under the pseudonym of Rocky Raccoon Clark. After that time, he spent 10 years teaching computing primary school children from Grade 5 – 9. In terms of the disruption of education, Wozniak says that massive online open courses (MOOCs) may be appropriate for the older, more educated, student, but human interaction is always going to be more important at the primary and high school level. In fact, this reflects Wozniak’s personal experience where he talks about the influence of his father on inspiring him into the area of electronics, and the encouragement and inspiration of teachers at his primary school. This contrasts with his relatively bad experiences at high school and university with teachers that were, in some cases, openly antagonistic. Asked about Apple’s new app Swift Playgrounds, aimed at teaching entry level programming in the language Swift, he thinks that there may have been better languages to start with. For Wozniak, one reason for developing computer was to provide everyone with access to computing, along with all the benefits that would come from that, including the ability to program. At Apple’s birth, nobody thought the concept of the home computer – like the one Wozniak had built – had a future. When Wozniak had worked at Hewlett-Packard, the company turned down his idea of developing a personal computer. In Australia, it is debatable whether Apple would have been funded by the current venture capitalist community. At the time Apple received its first investment from Mike Markkulla. It was yet to turn a profit and had only one client. When asked about the prospect of a new company like Apple starting today, Wozniak is more optimistic. He believes there is a huge amount of activity in the startup and innovation areas. He has previously talked enthusiastically about the investment of the Queensland Government of A$405 million in the startup scene. In terms of privacy, Wozniak feels that all technology companies talked about privacy being central to their product strategies but that only Apple actually delivered on this. The culture of privacy existed before CEO Tim Cook at Apple, but Cook has stood behind the importance of privacy when it came to handing over details of people’s devices to the FBI. Wozniak, has not really been following the dispute between the Australian banks and Apple. But he was really enjoying using Apple Pay in Australia. He does say that he wishes that the technology behind the payment system was an open standard but hasn’t thought about the problem deeply. Wozniak says he always wanted to be an engineer. To a large extent, the ascendency of technological companies has elevated the status of the computer and electrical engineer in society. Popular culture is now reflecting this with extremely popular TV series like Halt and Catch Fire, Mr. Robot and the comedy series that Wozniak has actually appeared in, Big Bang Theory. Unlike Elon Musk, Wozniak has never appeared in the Simpsons, even in the show parodying Apple and “Steve Mobs”. Despite all of this, Wozniak feels that “nerds and geeks” will still have a hard time at school, a situation that was the case when he was at school. During our chat, Wozniak expanded on the needs of entrepreneurship. What is critical he says, is the need for business and marketing along with engineering capability. It is not good enough to have an idea that sounds great if nobody wants to buy it. It is the role of the marketing person to do what Apple has done in not only seeing what the public wants, but to persuade them that they actually want the product you are selling, even if they didn’t know it. In many ways, Wozniak is a stereotypical engineer. He is a very nice and largely self-effacing person who just happened to use his passion to create something that was truly great. There is currently an Apple 1 computer that is being auctioned with manuals and tape cassettes. It is expected to sell for US$1 million. This is a far cry from the US$666.66 that this computer sold for in 1976. On the description of the computer, it describes the computer not only as a radical device that would change society so dramatically, but simply as a piece of art. In those terms Wozniak can let his art and its legacy speak for itself.
