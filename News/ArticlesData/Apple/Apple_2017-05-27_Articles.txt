This is in keeping with their strategy of offloading tasks from the CPU in iOS and watchOS devices. And it suggests their purchase of Intrinisity in 2010 is part of a long game.. While Apple was an early entrant to the AI game with Siri, they have been caught and overtaken by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. But the Bloomberg report suggests Apple is developing a new chip called the Apple Neural Engine. It will offload AI tasks from the CPU resulting in fast performance and better power efficiency. New silicon takes time to develop so it's doubtful we'll see the Apple Neural Engine in this year's 10th anniversary iPhone, which is expected to be significantly different to the iPhone 7. But after writing about Apple for over a decade the only thing I know is that predicting Apple's next move is about as easy as picking next week's lotto numbers. But, I'd not be surprised to see the Apple Neural Engine pop up in a new router that integrated with HomeKit before it was added to other computing platforms.

Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next.

Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Privacy & the media Publishers call for rethink of proposed changes to online privacy laws Warning that new regulations will give Google, Apple and Facebook too much control of advertising and personal data Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Mark Sweney @marksweney email Sunday 28 May 2017 19.01 EDT An alliance of news publishers has called on European regulators to rethink proposed changes to online privacy laws, arguing that they will potentially kill their digital businesses and give Google, Apple and Facebook too much control of advertising and personal data. More than two dozen leading publishers – including the Financial Times, Guardian, Le Monde, Spiegel, Telegraph, Daily Mail and Les Echoes – have signed a letter to the European parliament, which is deliberating proposals to tighten up how data is gathered and used by web companies. The publishers argue that new regulations relating to “cookies” – small files that remember users’ digital habits therefore allowing the targeting of relevant ads – could cut off their ability to build digital revenue. Currently, when users visit an individual website or app they are asked if they will consent to a cookietracking them. Under the European commission’s plans, consumers will in the future instead be asked to make a single choice to accept, or reject, cookies from all websites and apps only on one single occasion on their phone or browser. Publishers argue that creating a single “switch” will most likely result in consumers taking the simplest route of opting out of all cookies, leaving them with scant information to support their targeted advertising models. In turn, this would leave the few digital giants used by most consumers to access the web, and those like Facebook that have their own giant data mining capability, in control. “Given that 90% of [digital] usage across Europe is concentrated in the hands of just four companies: Google, Apple, Microsoft and Mozilla, this [proposal]... has the potential to exacerbate the asymmetry of power between individual publishers and these global digital gateways,” the letter says. “The current ePrivacy proposals will result in the data of European digital citizens being concentrated in the hands of a few global companies, as a result of which digital citizens will become less protected. It will give those global companies a tighter grip on the personal data of European digital citizens.” Under the proposals, publishers would be allowed to lobby consumers to go into their settings and unblock individual sites and “white list” them, but news organisations believe that in practice this would prove to be an extremely difficult task. The proposal has been compared to the ad-blocking battle in which publishers ask the increasing number of those who use the software to turn it off, or add their businesses to a white list, explaining how advertising is essential income for many digital news businesses. The proposals are likely to further exacerbate the huge issue publishers already face as Google and Facebook sweep up as much as 90% of all new digital display advertising. “The practice of serving relevant advertising to readers is now an established norm in the advertising industry, and is essential to ensure that publishers can compete with Google and Facebook who already control 20% of total global advertising spend,” the letter says. “If as a result of these proposals news publishers were unable to serve relevant advertising to our readers, this would reduce our ability to compete with the capabilities of dominant digital platforms for digital advertising revenues, ultimately undermining our ability to invest in high quality journalism across Europe,” the letter says. In recent months, Google, which owns YouTube, and Facebook have faced a barrage of criticism for allowing ads to run next to inappropriate content such as extremist videos. The companies have also faced a number of issues that have hurt their previously unquestioned ability to accurately target ads, such as brands being charged for ads viewed by “bots”, computer programmes mimicking an internet user, and Facebook admitting to a number of measurement errors. “The Commission’s ePrivacy proposals will make it more difficult to ensure transparency ... and remove any distinction between publishers who place a high value on trust of their users, and those who do not,” the publishers’ letter says. However, the bad press has so far failed to dent their popularity with advertisers with Google and Facebook enjoying a near duopoly of control of the £11bn UK digital advertising market. Publishers say that they support the overall objective of the draft “ePrivacy” regulation, which they say has the “potential to clean up the digital economy”, but they need to compete on a fair playing field. “Citizens are rightly concerned about the use of their personal data by third-party companies of whom they have never heard, and have no idea about the role that they play in their digital lives online,” the letter says. “[But] the commission’s proposals threaten to prevent news organisations from delivering basic functionality such as the marketing of products and services, the tailoring of news products to the needs and desires of news consumers, and relevant and acceptable advertising.” Topics Privacy & the media Privacy news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media selected crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed weekend video Media › Privacy & the media UK UK politics education media society law scotland back to top become a supporter make a contribution Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us advertise with us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | May 28, 2017 2 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0               At the beginning of June, Apple is going to host its latest Worldwide Developers Conference and going to announce new things. While iOS is going to (probably) take the lion's share of time on stage, the company has also launched new and updated platforms over the years. macOS got revitalized with a name change recently, and now there's watchOS and tvOS to really add to the mix. Basically, Apple has a platform for just about everything now, and developers still play a huge role in making those platforms as popular as they are. WWDC's keynote is always buys, with Apple executives taking the stage as well as other company employees getting some time up there to talk about whatever it is they're bringing to Apple's devices and platforms. This year won't be any different. There haven't been a lot of rumors about what the company is going to bring to the newest versions of its platforms, but there does seem to be a feeling that at least iOS 11 is going to see some big changes. So, obviously, it's about time I ask all of you what you want to see. I'll just get this out of the way: As long as Apple doesn't change Control Center all that much, aside from maybe letting me change the bottom row of quick launch apps (I really don't want the calculator down there anymore), and adding some more 3D Touch options (I am trying to use this feature more often), I will be a happy camper. And while I think it's about time that iOS allowed users to change their default apps, I don't think that's going to happen so I'm not going to get caught up on it too much. It's a strange thing, at least it feels like it, with only a little week left to go before a new version of a major platform is revealed, that I don't really have anything I feel is desperately needed. It does make it a little exciting, though, considering the rumor mill has been pretty quiet on this front, so whatever Apple does announce might actually be a surprise for once. Or maybe the rumors are quiet because there's not much to talk about. That's almost depressing. Anyway, I'm more curious to hear what you might have to say about Apple's mobile operating system. That includes from both sides of the camp: The iOS users out there and the folks who aren't using Apple's platform. For the former group, what do you want to see Apple add to the mobile OS you use every day? What could make iOS 11 the best version of Apple's platform to date in your opinion? And for those of you out there who have stayed away from iOS, or maybe who have used it in the past and switched away, what do you think Apple could bring to iOS that would get you to switch over or come back? Anything at all? Let me know! Apple iOS 11 WWDC WWDC 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference Apple Next ArticleLTE connectivity is a welcomed addition to the Surface Pro Don't forget to VOTE!

Checkerboarding, upscaling, temporal anti-aliasing, dynamic resolution. Let's give credit where it's due: at its best, PlayStation 4 Pro's utilisation of these techniques produces some impressive results for 4K displays - no mean feat considering that the Pro's GPU is relatively underpowered compared to today's mainstream PC graphics hardware. And this led us to wonder - what if those techniques were rolled out in the PC space? Could the cost of admission to the world of 4K gaming drop dramatically if the techniques championed by Sony worked just as effectively for PC gamers? EuroGamer Report: More than half of streaming users are sharing their passwords There’s no denying that the television landscape is changing the days, with cable TV putting up dismal numbers (their worst ever, actually). But as more people migrate to streaming video, the scenery there is changing as well. Nearly 3 out of every 4 (72% exactly) Americans who have cable also have access to at least one streaming service and 8% of cable subscribers plan to eliminate their service in the next year. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re paying for their streaming service. Streaming Observer A year of Google & Apple maps Shortly after I published my Cartography Comparison last June, I noticed Google updating some of the areas we had focused on: Coincidence or not, it was interesting. And it made me wonder what else would change, if we kept watching. Would Google keep adding detail? And would Apple, like Google, also start making changes? So I wrote a script that takes monthly screenshots of Google and Apple Maps.1 And thirteen months later, we now have a year’s worth of images... Justin O'Beirne How Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think Facebook's collection of data makes it one of the most influential organisations in the world. Share Lab wanted to look "under the bonnet" at the tech giant's algorithms and connections to better understand the social structure and power relations within the company. A couple of years ago, Vladan Joler and his brainy friends in Belgrade began investigating the inner workings of one of the world's most powerful corporations. BBC Google's AlphaGo retires on top after humbling world No. 1 The Google-owned computer algorithm AlphaGo is retiring from playing humans in the ancient Chinese game of Go after roundly defeating the world's top player this week, its developer said Saturday. AlphaGo defeated brash 19-year-old world number one Ke Jie of China on Saturday to sweep a three-game series that was closely watched as a measure of how far artificial intelligence (AI) has come. Phys.org How to build your own VPN if you’re (rightfully) wary of commercial options In the wake of this spring's Senate ruling nixing FCC privacy regulations imposed on ISPs, you may be (even more) worried about how your data is used, misused, and abused. There have been a lot of opinions on this topic since, ranging from "the sky is falling" to "move along, citizen, nothing to see here." Ars Technica The 1961 Mobot Mark II had all the moves In the late 1950s, Sandia Laboratory was looking for a way to handle radioactive materials without putting humans in danger. The answer was the Mobot—short for either “remote robot” or “mobile robot”—a remotely operated system designed by Hughes Aircraft Co. in 1959 that offered a unique and effective combination of strength and dexterity. IEEE Spectrum Faster, more nimble drones on the horizon There’s a limit to how fast autonomous vehicles can fly while safely avoiding obstacles. That’s because the cameras used on today’s drones can only process images so fast, frame by individual frame. Beyond roughly 30 miles per hour, a drone is likely to crash simply because its cameras can’t keep up. MIT How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game Steven Yang quit his job at Google in the summer of 2011 to build the products he felt the world needed: a line of reasonably priced accessories that would be better than the ones you could buy from Apple and other big-name brands. These accessories — batteries, cables, chargers — would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times. The Verge Apple is working on a dedicated chip to power AI on devices Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg The history of RPGs Computers and RPGs have always gone hand-in-hand. Even when the best adventurers could hope for visually was a few letters and numbers on a screen, what better way could there be to handle stats, die-rolls and complex calculations? Soon enough, though, computer RPGs were capable of doing much more. PC Gamer Nanogenerators could charge your smartphone Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have been exploring the applications and commercial potential for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) since 2012. These so-called TENGs essentially harvest static electricity from friction.

This smartphone release will mark the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range, and the consumer electronics giant is expected to pull out all of the stops in order to deliver an outstanding unit. Considering the importance of the iPhone 8 to Apple, it is perhaps not surprising that the rumor mill has been grinding even more relentlessly than usual. Of course, there is never any shortage of speculation regarding Apple devices, but the iPhone 8 has attracted so much rumor and counter-rumor that the ultimate outcome of this handset has become somewhat confusing. Image Source: Muhsin M. Belaal Auckburaully / DBS Design (screenshot) iPhone 8 release dates Firstly, there is considerable debate over precisely when we can expect to see the iPhone 8 emerge on the market. The usual release schedule for Apple smartphones has seen the iPhone released in September, although this has only been a precedent over the last few years. Originally, the iPhone was intended for the summer months, with June preferred for its seminal release. But several reports have suggested that the iPhone 8 may not appear in September this year. Most of these have inidcated that it will appear later rather than earlier, while some have even suggested that we may not witness an iPhone 8 release in 2017 whatsoever. Several different morsels of information have been cited in relation to this prediction, but the lack of OLED displays could be a particularly critical factor. Certainly if Apple wishes to stick to its previous policy, this calendar year would witness iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus releases. But most Apple observers believe that the Corporation will release an all-singing, all-dancing iPhone 8 alongside two upgrades in 2017. Nonetheless, the smart money would still be on the iPhone 8 emerging in September, as a company as powerful as Apple would be unlikely to delay a major device release without extremely good reason. Branding confusion There has also been some disagreement over whether or not the next generation iPhone will even be branded as the iPhone 8. It is possible that Apple could acknowledge the tenth anniversary of the iPhone series by naming this smartphone the iPhone X; the X signifying the Roman numeral for 10. Other reports have indicated that Apple will resist the temptation to release a revolutionary iPhone 8, and will instead follow its usual release schedule with two iPhone 7S units. This goes against the grain of many reports on the matter, which generally suggest that we should expect to see an iPhone 8 before the year is out. Design differences The potential design of the iPhone 8 has also led to numerous different interpretations. There is a general consensus that Apple will slim down the bezels included in the iPhone 8, in order to increase the screen real estate. But there are many differing opinions on precisely how the design of this smartphone will ultimately turn out. Many reports have suggested that Apple will produce a curved screen iPhone for the first time when the iPhone 8 is released, but this has not been the case with all leaks. For example, a new leaked video suggests that the next gen iPhone will be very much a flatscreen device, and that Apple will eschew the temptation to follow Samsung in producing curved screen units. There has also been discord over whether Apple will increase the screen size of the iPhone 8 relative to previous releases. Some suggest that the smartphone will be a compact unit, but that it will only feature a 5.5-inch display, identical in size to that of the existing iPhone 7 Plus. But other reports have indicated that the iPhone 8 will feature a 5.8-inch screen that will be the largest ever included in an Apple release. Resolution There is undoubtedly pressure on Apple to increase the resolution included in the iPhone 8, particularly if it intends to increase the display size. Samsung is also rumored to be considering including 4K resolution in the forthcoming Galaxy Note 8, and this would rather leave the iPhone series behind, should the consumer electronics behemoth stick to merely full HD. Thus, some reports have suggested that Apple will deliver quad HD resolution with the iPhone 8, even if it chooses to freeze the screen resolution in both the accompanying iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus releases. But with Apple reluctant to cram excessive specs into these devices unless it deems it to be absolutely necessary, it has been suggested elsewhere that this will simply be a full HD smartphone. It would be disappointing if Apple were not to increase the resolution included in the iPhone 8, but we know from previous device releases that the Cupertino-based company will never follow the trends of the industry blindly. So don’t be surprised if the iPhone 8 does not deliver quad HD resolution. Apple secrecy The confusion over the iPhone 8 is exacerbated by the fact that Apple is particularly secretive when it comes to its device releases. This tends to provoke a climate of speculation, and this has already been rather rampant with the iPhone 8. Additionally, Apple is releasing the iPhone 8 – if indeed it does choose to do so – into an increasingly complex and challenging technology climate. The reality is that smartphones are delivering diminishing returns in terms of functionality, and thus there is now a requirement for the biggest players in the industry to diligently consider what should and should not be included in any particular release. The days of completely blowing away consumers with amazing new features are probably over, at least until virtual reality and augmented reality become mainstream. This means that there will be room for considerable speculation regarding the iPhone 8 in the coming weeks, and the confusion is not likely to lift until Apple finally unveils the device.

Cramer: The Market Is 'All FANG All The Time,' But It Shouldn't Be Maybe the Occupy Wall Street movement was looking to the wrong coast all along. A recent Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC)/Merrill Lynch report titled "Occupy Silicon Valley" shows that tech firms Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) valuations are higher than the GDP of every U.S. city besides Los Angeles and New York, and Apple is quickly gaining on L.A. While these figures do not mean these companies are actually worth more than those cities, it does present a relevant conversation about the sheer size and influence these firms have. Apple and Google essentially operate as their own countries, with massive power; their decisions have huge implications on the market and how citizens operate, communicate and conduct daily lives. Here at Benzinga, we wanted to take it a step further and see how these two tech giants stack up against countries worldwide, comparing Market Cap against GDP. Apple And Google Vs. The World (Figures In Millions) Apple’s market cap is current just north of $796 billion, which would put it as the 17th most valuable country in the world, just ahead of the Netherlands, when compared to current World Bank data on global GDP. Google would rank as the 19th most valuable country in the world, ahead of international finance hub Switzerland, at a $672 billion valuation. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) would rank as the 25th biggest country in the world, just behind Poland, with a $467 billion market cap. While these are not apples-to-apples comparisons, it is the best way to gauge the sheer size the tech industry has amassed in the United States. With the presidency now hosting non-traditional and political amateur Donald Trump in the Oval Office, maybe Tim Cook — with his breadth of experience, financial prowess and general popularity — will capitalize and run for president in 2020.

And if its hefty price tag is any indication of just how special it is, then we’re in for a treat. May 28, 2017 WSP We’re just a few months away from seeing the iPhone 8 for real. Yet rumors and speculations still persist and will probably continue until the official unveiling, most likely in September, if Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stays true to its tradition. While we’re still waiting for its arrival, we’ve rounded up what we know so far (and also what we’d like to believe) about Apple’s upcoming flagship phone. For starters, we can’t help but believe that being its 10th anniversary phone, the iPhone 8 (also being referred to by some analysts as iPhone X) will be as spectacular as what we are expecting (and hoping) it to be. Some of its most anticipated features include virtual fingerprint scanning, facial recognition capability, enhanced water resistance and wireless charging. And by wireless charging, we mean true ‘wireless’ charging, allowing the gadget to be charged within a range of about 20 feet, with no wires needed. On the outside, the iPhone 8 variants — we’re expecting 2 or 3 ranging in size from 4.7 inches to 5.8 inches — will likely have no physical home button (we’re assuming Apple has already solved this problem that threatened to push back production). Instead, its Touch ID (fingerprint sensor) will be directly embedded in the display (if not, it will be placed on the phone’s rear). And this is what will make its bezel-less (meaning borderless) design possible. It might be smaller than the iPhone 7, but i8 will have a bigger display that will take up the entire screen. And it’s going to be an OLED display at that, which means brighter, sharper and clearer everything, plus improved power efficiency too. It’s also going to have either an all-glass build, or a combination of stainless steel and glass, which will make it look as sleek as ever. Reports about the camera’s positioning are still contradicting at this stage, with the most popular rumor suggesting that it will have vertical dual cameras at its rear. What’s (almost) certain, though, is that the camera will be an upgraded version. It really has to be to live up to the hype. Of course, it won’t have a headphone jack, because it’s going to be weird to bring back something that’s already been removed. But at least it looks like Apple is planning to include AirPods as part of the iPhone 8 package. There won’t likely be a 32GB variant. The lowest variant will be 64GB, and RAM will be boosted to 3GB. It will be powered by an Apple A11 chip and will run iOS11. Finally, with its rumored high-end and high-tech specs, it’s not hard to surmise that the iPhone 8 won’t come cheap. Of course, no iPhone really is. But this latest one will be the most expensive ever, with a price tag starting at $1,000. Will its price be worth it? We’ll find out soon enough. In the meantime, check out this video from ConceptsiPhone showing what could turn out to be the iPhone 8’s final design.

This should be considered very much a working title, as there is no guarantee that Apple will immediately switch to iPhone 9 branding following the release of the iPhone 8. Indeed, there is already some debate over whether or not the iPhone 8 will actually be the name for the next-generation Apple handset. Nonetheless, reports from East Asia are already providing an insight into how the next but one generation Apple device may turn out. Korea is becoming an extremely important source of news on the smartphones marketplace in general, particularly as Samsung and LG have become such important players in the industry. hurk / Pixabay iPhone 9 OLED linked And Korean media is reporting that the iPhone 9 will definitely feature the OLED technology that has been so strongly linked with the iPhone 8. This definitely wouldn’t come as a surprise, as it is still anticipated by many sources that OLED screens will debut in the forthcoming iPhone 8. But The Investor publication also predicts that Samsung will be the sole supplier for the OLED panels utilized in the iPhone 9, while the screen size in included in the device will also be increased significantly. The Investor asserts that Apple has already placed an order for 180 million OLED units, which the publication suggests is more than double the 80 million that have been requested for the iPhone 8 generation. The report goes on to indicate that the iPhone 9 will feature two screen sizes, with a 5.28-inch display being accompanied by a 6.46-inch device. This is very specific, and these numbers do seem rather odd, but it nonetheless suggests that Apple is willing to break away from the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens that have been standard in recent years. Industry sources close to both Apple and Samsung are also quoted in the article, suggesting that the two mega-corporations have already signed an NDA on the general conditions and display size. It will be interesting to see what parameters Apple includes in the iPhone 8, and whether three models emerge as expected, as this will give us a real clue as to how the iPhone 9 will turn out. Galaxy S9 leaks Meanwhile, there are also rumors circulating about the next-generation Galaxy S9. Again, it is rather early in the day to speak about this smartphone, but at least the Galaxy S8 is already on the market! Regardless of this, major companies such as Apple and Samsung are always thinking several generations ahead, and it is not at all surprising that the two corporations are already making concrete plans for their next major flagships. Another Korean publication, The Bell, indicates that the Galaxy S9 is already under development. Apparently the codename for this important device is ‘Star’, with the development schedule apparently well ahead of previous years. Samsung has perhaps been emboldened by its more than decent recent market performance, and may already be making plans to deliver a particularly outstanding Galaxy S9 release. It is very early days in the development cycle of the Galaxy S9, considering that the Galaxy S8 has only recently been released. But the report goes on to explain that the Galaxy S9 will follow the release schedule of previous Galaxy S devices, and thus we can expect to see it emerge in March 2018. The Bell also suggests that Samsung will focus on developing the Infinity display in the Galaxy S9, possibly addressing the fingerprint scanner which was considered something of a weakness in the Galaxy S8 generation. Based on the rumors surrounding the Galaxy Note 8, it is possible that the Galaxy S9 will be the first ever 4K resolution smartphone from Samsung, considering that the Galaxy Note range can be defined as phablets. 4K enthusiasm Executives in the Samsung hierarchy have already expressed their enthusiasm regarding 4K technology, describing it as something that will become a staple in the mobile industry. This suggests that the Korean corporation will look to move to 4K resolution sooner rather than later, and this could mean that both the Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S9 benefit from 4K panels, after the Galaxy S8 also received a resolution boost from the previous iteration in the series. 2018 promises to be another key year in the smartphone battle between Apple and Samsung, with the KoreancCorporation effectively answering the tenth anniversary iPhone when the Galaxy S9 is released. It seems that we can expect some outstanding devices from the two major players in the market when the iPhone 9 and Galaxy S9 hit the stores.

The Next Diabetes Breakthrough Could Come From Apple Apple appears to be developing a non-invasive glucose monitoring prototype that works with its Watch. Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) May 28, 2017 at 2:02PM Despite improved health education and medicine, one disease that's actually getting more prevalent, not less prevalent, in America is diabetes. Diabetes is no laughing matter According to data from the American Diabetes Association in 2012, some 29.1 million Americans have diabetes, most of whom have type 2 diabetes, which is the non-genetic form that develops over one's lifetime. About 1.25 million people have type 1 diabetes. What's worse, 1.4 million new diabetes diagnoses are made annually, and around 86 million Americans age 20 and older are considered to have prediabetes. In other words, if they don't change their eating habits and activity level, they're at a higher risk than the general population of developing diabetes. Image source: Getty Images. Though it might be a disease that doesn't conjure the type of fear felt with a cancer diagnosis, it's nonetheless the seventh-leading cause of death in the United States as of 2015. Co-morbidities caused from diabetes (e.g., high blood pressure, kidney disease, strike, and high cholesterol) can make life for those who have this disease quite unpleasant. It can also be painful on the wallet, with direct medical costs of $176 billion and indirect costs of $69 billion from reduced worker productivity as of 2012. As such, it's no surprise that drug developers and medical device manufacturers are putting a lot time, effort, and money into researching ways to resolve America's diabetes epidemic. Thankfully, we've seen a number of major advancements over the past couple of years. The diabetes treatment landscape is rapidly evolving Image source: Johnson & Johnson. One of the greater pharmaceutical advancements we've witnessed in dealing with diabetes is the development of SGLT-2 inhibitors, like Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Invokana, which was the first SGLT-2 inhibitor to hit pharmacy shelves in America back in 2013. Traditional diabetes medications that target type 2 diabetes work in either the pancreas or liver. SGLT-2 inhibitors do their work in the kidneys by suppressing the absorption of glucose and allowing excess sugar to be excreted in the urine in order to control glycemic balance. What's noteworthy about this new method of controlling blood sugar is that SGLT-2 medicines like Invokana also demonstrated lowered systolic blood pressure and weight-loss in clinical studies. It's a welcomed side effect given the nature of co-morbidities associated with diabetes. Later this year, Johnson & Johnson should deliver results from its long-term cardiovascular study on Invokana. Fingers are crossed that it, like SGLT-2 competitor Jardiance from Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim, leads to a clinically significant reduction in the risk of a cardiovascular event and death. The MiniMed 670G. Image source: Medtronic. In terms of medical devices, one of the most exciting advancements in decades was the approval of Medtronic's (NYSE:MDT) MiniMed 670G for type 1 diabetics a full six months ahead of schedule this past September. The MiniMed 670G is the world's very first artificial pancreas. In simpler terms, it's the world's first closed loop system designed to measure blood glucose levels every five minutes and administer insulin on an as-needed basis for the patient. A sensor with a protruding needle is slipped under the skin, while a smartphone-sized insulin pump worn on the abdomen ensures proper administration. The MiniMed 670G should be particularly useful in reducing instances of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, caused by the administration of insulin. Sensors that communicate with the smartphone-sized pump would prevent administration once blood glucose levels hit a certain threshold.    But, there's still much work and research left to be done. Enter Apple, stage left Interestingly enough, a company that appears up to the challenge of fighting diabetes is one we may not realize has any affiliation with the healthcare industry: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The tech giant is best-known for its leading smartphones, as well as tablets and Mac laptops. But CEO Tim Cook has made it clear that he also foresees Apple making waves in healthcare. Last week, CNBC reported that Tim Cook was spotted with a glucose-measuring device that worked with the Apple Watch. This corroborates a report from CNBC in April that Apple had a team in Palo Alto, Calif., already working on a way to measure blood glucose levels continuously, but in a non-invasive way. Considering how unpleasant it can be for diabetics to frequently draw blood to assess their blood sugar, a non-invasive method of measuring blood glucose has always been the ultimate goal. Unfortunately, it's also extremely difficult to attain, as evidenced by the fact that there are no non-invasive blood-glucose monitors on the market at present. Image source: Apple. However, Apple's foray into healthcare doesn't appear to be a one-off event. Aside from Cook's admission that he's been wearing a glucose-measuring device for months and monitoring how food and exercise impacts his sugar levels, Cook also envisions Apple being a regular contributor to the healthcare space. Let's not forget that in June 2014, Apple introduced its Health app for tracking various health and fitness data. Aside from the app allowing consumers to keep a close eye on their health habits, an alternative idea behind the app is that it may one day allow for a seamless link and/or continuous monitoring between you and your doctor. The introduction of the Apple Watch, and Cook's use of what appears to be a glucose-tracking prototype, is further evidence of this possible future link (and of the Internet of Things in action). Before you investors get too excited, understand that healthcare is a nascent sales generator for Apple at this point in time. It's still, first and foremost, a technology and innovation company that's reliant on consumers' desires for the latest in content-based gadgetry. But Apple certainly has the financial capacity and wherewithal to pursue healthcare endeavors that incorporate its devices. Exciting things are happening in the diabetes treatment space, and soon enough Apple could be part of that excitement. Sean Williams has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Analysts say cash brought back could be a piggy bank for company stock repurchases or acquisitions. Problem is, President Trump's economic agenda has been stalled amid White House drama. The proposed changes on "repatriated" cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's (T) CEO, says tax reform can make it through Congress. "A lot of people are getting pessimistic because of a lot of the noise in Washington right now that tax reform may not be achieved," Stephenson said at a JPMorgan tech conference on May 23. "I am still optimistic something can still get done … bundling tax reform with an infrastructure bill would be big. I think it's achievable." Even so, one worry is that the overseas "tax holiday" for tech firms may not turn out as the bonanza it's made out to be. That depends on whether legislation puts conditions on how money could be spent and creates enforcement mechanisms. Rather than see the money go toward company stock buybacks or acquisitions, Trump and Congress could steer money toward job creation and capital spending, says a UBS analyst. "If the (Trump administration) wants to really drive inward investments within the U.S. there might have to be some sort of mandated use of cash, maybe to spend it on (capital expenditures). As yet, we do not know," UBS analyst Geoff Robinson said in a report. There's reason to think Robinson might be on the right track. "There's trillions of dollars offshore. We want to get that back into America," Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, said in a recent interview. "We want the companies to bring the money back and put it back into the economy. We want them to create jobs." Cash-rich tech companies like Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Cisco currently would pay a 35% tax on so-called "repatriated earnings." Rather than take the tax hit, they've kept the money overseas. President Trump has proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings while the Republican-controlled House has proposed a lower 8.5% rate. The overseas tax-break that Congress passed in 2004 was called the American Jobs Creation Act, but didn't do much to stimulate the economy, analysts say. The AJCA taxed repatriated earnings at a 5.25% rate. The top five firms in bringing back cash in 2004 were drug companies Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK), as well as Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and IBM (IBM). According to the IRS, $312 billion was brought back in all. However, only 10% of companies eligible to bring back cash in 2004 did so, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service. Many companies kept cash overseas because of AJCA requirements, he said. The AJCA required companies to reinvest tax savings in worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development and capital projects. According to UBS, however, "Funds in 2004's repatriation may have been earmarked for capital investment but ultimately were spent in large part on share repurchases." UBS says that happened because the AJCA did not include a "tracking mechanism" so the government could audit companies and gauge compliance. The Trump administration could put better enforcement mechanisms in place. S&P 500 companies have more than $2.6 trillion in overseas cash. Some of that may be needed to continue funding foreign operations. The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Oracle (ORCL), Moody's says. While Cisco has stated any cash brought back to the U.S. could be used for reducing debt on its books, analysts have other ideas. If a tax holiday is approved, BMO Capital Markets said in a report that it "expects Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus more on acquisitions, while Apple and smaller companies would likely lean more toward capital return." In the case of Apple and Cisco, some analysts envision enough cash being brought back to fund "transformative" deals. Apple has about $250 billion in cash, growing at about $50 billion a year. About 90% of Apple's cash is overseas. A one-time, 10% repatriation tax would give Apple some $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report. Suva speculated that Apple could buy large companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Walt Disney (DIS) or Electronic Arts (EA). Cisco, meanwhile, could bring back up to $56 billion in cash from overseas, analysts say. In a report, Credit Suisse speculates that enterprise software providers ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK), or computer security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) could be on Cisco's shopping list. Pacific Crest Securities adds Red Hat (RHT) and Nutanix (NTNX) to the list of possible Cisco targets. Intel (INTC) is among semiconductor companies with a cash hoard overseas. Intel could bring back about $12 billion, says BMO Capital Markets. Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also have significant overseas cash. But, BMO Capital does not expect a Trump tax holiday to spur an acquisition spree among chipmakers.

(Submitted by Chris Gertridge) Related Stories Kentville to host Apple Blossom parade after all Apple Blossom rolls on after turning to crowdfunding for donations Chris Gertridge modestly calls his large collection of antique Nova Scotia photos "junk," but deep down he knows a handful of them hold great historical value — especially to the Apple Blossom Festival.  The festival has been held in the Annapolis Valley, usually on the last weekend in May, for the last 85 years.  Gertridge may not have been collecting photos for that long, but he's stumbled across a few photographs that date back to the festival's early days.  A snap shot of the Apple Blossom Festival in 1933. (Submitted by Chris Gertridge) "I joke that maybe I'll open up a museum one day with all my junk in it," he said Saturday. Gertridge, who's lived in the Annapolis Valley his entire life, has been acquiring hundreds of antique photos for nearly 20 years. He said he's found them all over the world — as far away as Australia.  He finds them in yard sales, public library sales, but mostly from eBay. He's uses his own money with the only aim of sharing his discoveries with others online.  An early ad for the festival that highlights some of its events. (Submitted by Chris Gertridge) "Obsession is one way to put it," he said. "I try to limit it to under $20, but I've gone so far as to spend $100 on one piece that I felt I couldn't live without." His collection began with postcard dated 1907, depicting the Gaspereau Valley. Chris Gertridge started his collection after spotting this 1907 postcard, which depicts the Gaspereau Valley and even his current home. (Submitted by Chris Gertridge) "And I noticed on this postcard I could see my family's farm. And I thought, 'My gosh, that's really cool! That's the house I live in right now!'"  Gertridge said he'll continue collecting and sharing the images online as long as he has the space. "I don't see it stopping any time soon," he said.  An apple orchard in bloom, just one of many photos from Chris Gertridge's collection of photographs.

Moser creates $27k Apple Watch lookalike Adam Westlake - May 28, 2017 6 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If you happen to really like the look and design of the Apple Watch, but are also a tired-and-true fan of traditional mechanical watches, then here’s a timepiece that’s just for you. Swiss watchmaker H. Moser has announced a new watch that almost perfectly mimics the look of Apple’s smartwatch, yet it’s 100% mechanical, meaning there’s no display, no touch input, and no health or fitness tracking — no ‘smarts’ of any kind. So, how much would you pay for an Apple Watch-resembling non-smartwatch? Hopefully you said $27,000, because that’s the price H. Moser has come up with for the “Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz” (yes, that’s its real name). At least they only plan to make 20 units in total, making this rarer than the original Apple Watch Edition. At first glance, this really does look exactly like an Apple Watch, and even a devoted Apple fan would have to look closely to notice the differences. Since it’s mechanical, H. Moser’s timepiece has no side button or Digital Crown, instead using a traditional crown for winding purposes. But even the minimally designed face could be mistaken for the now iconic smartwatch’s, despite the fact that there’s no screen to turn on or off. It seems like Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz is intended to be the entire Swiss watch industry’s dig at Apple for superseding them in sales over the last few years. H. Moser’s press release even refers to the design as akin to a “smartwatch which is powered off or in standby.” But here’s the real giveaway: “In this watch, the now iconic model features neither indices nor logo on its dial, proving that true luxury is unmistakable, and immediately identifiable, even without obvious marketing,” says the press release. The only thing this watch is going to be identified as is an Apple Watch, and the only thing unmistakable is that H. Moser must be trying to pull a fast one on us. SOURCE H.

Now that’s some truly impressive trolling. Don't Miss: Verizon may have just made the world’s most pointless thing From the distance, H. Moser’s Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz — yes, that’s a terrible name — looks exactly like an Apple Watch. It’s got the same rectangular shape complete with curved edges that seem to blend right into the metal frame, and a deep black display. However, that’s not a display, and that’s not a smartwatch. Apple Watch fans will also immediately recognize the absence of the Digital Crown and the side button. Also, you shouldn’t be able to see the time on a Watch with the screen turned off. This is just trolling of the highest order. H. Moser even compares the device to “a smartwatch which is powered off or in standby” in its press release, without naming the smartwatch in question. In fact, the press release seems to make a strong case for an Apple lawsuit that would argue H. Moser is simply trying to cash in on the Apple Watch popularity. The Swiss maker might be trolling Apple hard, but the Apple Watch maker is making more money from watch sales than many Swiss companies. “In this watch, the now iconic model features neither indices nor logo on its dial, proving that true luxury is unmistakable, and immediately identifiable, even without obvious marketing,” the press release notes. Yes, you can immediately notice it’s an Apple Watch. “The black dial — stripped not just of any signature, but also of its indices — is strictly minimalist. On this model, there is no interface: the Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz is designed to display the time, something it does beautifully. Seemingly simple, it is anything but,” the press release says. Right. When it’s not trolling Apple, the Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz does four days of life on a power reserve, after which you’ll have to wind it by hand. Aside from the Zzzz model, H. Moser is also selling an equally poorly named Swiss Alp Watch Brrrr that comes with a blue dial. Each model sells for $26,900, and H. Moser will only make 20 units of each.

This includes the LG UltraFine 4K & 5K displays. The discounts were done to help ease customers into the transition to USB-C. Apple’s discounts end at the end of March, which means today, March 31, is the last day customers are able to take advantage of the offers before prices go back up. Today is the last day to purchase the UltraFine displays which are up to 25 percent off, giving customers a deep discount, especially on the 5K display. The 5K display costs $1,299.95 normally but has been discounted down to $974. Non-Apple endorsed USB-C accessories are also discounted, which includes hard drives, cables, adapters, and more. The deal was originally set to expire on December 31, 2016 but was extended until March 31, 2017 after extensive delays on the LG UltraFine 5K Display. Apple could potentially extend the sale again but it’s best to make your USB-C purchases today as it’s unclear if Apple will ever make the sale again.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Wearables Image Source: H. Moser Swiss watchmaker trolls Apple with $27,000 Apple Watch knockoff Chris Smith @chris_writes May 28th, 2017 at 9:00 AM Share Tweet The watch above is an Apple Watch knockoff, created by a famous Swiss watchmaker, has no smart features and sells for almost $27,000. Now that’s some truly impressive trolling. Don't Miss: Verizon may have just made the world’s most pointless thing From the distance, H. Moser’s Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz — yes, that’s a terrible name — looks exactly like an Apple Watch. It’s got the same rectangular shape complete with curved edges that seem to blend right into the metal frame, and a deep black display. However, that’s not a display, and that’s not a smartwatch. Apple Watch fans will also immediately recognize the absence of the Digital Crown and the side button. Also, you shouldn’t be able to see the time on a Watch with the screen turned off. This is just trolling of the highest order. H. Moser even compares the device to “a smartwatch which is powered off or in standby” in its press release, without naming the smartwatch in question. In fact, the press release seems to make a strong case for an Apple lawsuit that would argue H. Moser is simply trying to cash in on the Apple Watch popularity. The Swiss maker might be trolling Apple hard, but the Apple Watch maker is making more money from watch sales than many Swiss companies. Image Source: H. Moser “In this watch, the now iconic model features neither indices nor logo on its dial, proving that true luxury is unmistakable, and immediately identifiable, even without obvious marketing,” the press release notes. Yes, you can immediately notice it’s an Apple Watch. “The black dial — stripped not just of any signature, but also of its indices — is strictly minimalist. On this model, there is no interface: the Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz is designed to display the time, something it does beautifully. Seemingly simple, it is anything but,” the press release says. Right. When it’s not trolling Apple, the Swiss Alp Watch Zzzz does four days of life on a power reserve, after which you’ll have to wind it by hand. Aside from the Zzzz model, H. Moser is also selling an equally poorly named Swiss Alp Watch Brrrr that comes with a blue dial. Each model sells for $26,900, and H. Moser will only make 20 units of each.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Guest The factions of the mobile AR war Tim Merel@DigiCapitalist May 28, 2017 6:00 AM Above: Augmented reality shooter Fatheri.o Mark Zuckerberg’s “We’re making the camera the first augmented reality platform” was the most important step so far toward mass market AR. Where Pokémon Go gave many consumers their first taste of mobile AR, and Google Tango ushered in the race towards high end mobile AR phones, Facebook’s AR Platform now democratizes mobile AR regardless of hardware. Apple launching an AR enabled iPhone this year or next year could combine with Facebook to kick-start the mobile AR market at scale, and also be the final step towards the next great platform war. Consumers will win as usual, but there will be blood (as we detailed in Digi-Capital’s new Mobile Augmented Reality Report). The platform question Hardware and software platforms are so intertwined that it can be hard to tell the difference, and this has played in Apple’s favor for the last decade. But Apple, Samsung and other phone makers have done such a great job with existing hardware, that this may backfire for mobile AR. Facebook’s AR Platform, for example, has shown exactly how the major social and messaging platforms can play the game using nothing more than a standard smartphone camera. So while device manufacturers roll out new hardware to build an installed base for AR phones, established and startup social/messaging platforms could build a mobile AR ecosystem and user base in a fraction of the time at a fraction of the cost. They’ll also be able to leverage this advantage as dedicated AR phones come to market. What is mobile AR anyway? At one end Pokémon Go is what some industry insiders call “the best worst example of AR”, because its ambient mobile AR is pretty basic. Lovely graphics positioned approximately against the real world on your phone screen, using basic computer vision and positional tracking. Nonetheless it’s introduced mass consumers to mobile AR, and they’ve loved playing with it. At the other end of the spectrum is Google Tango, with hardware based immersive mobile AR driven by integrated hardware and software. Without diving into the technical weeds, Tango phones enable accurate motion tracking, area learning and depth perception in a device that looks much like any other smartphone. The difference comes from a motion tracking camera, a depth sensing camera, an infrared projector, computer vision and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping software. So virtual objects superimposed on the real world appear as you would expect them to if they were really there. But Tango’s time is yet to come in terms of consumer awareness and app ecosystem (though Google, Lenovo and Asus are trying). Facebook and Snap’s software-based immersive mobile AR is a serious contender, as it combines the ubiquity of ambient mobile AR with some of the computer vision and SLAM that previously required dedicated hardware. While Google Tango’s sensors enable heavier duty mobile AR apps, that’s not the problem Facebook and Snap are solving. By plugging immersive software based mobile AR into the largest consumer platforms on the planet, they’re democratizing mobile AR for everyone for free. And free is a good price point. This hasn’t escaped the notice of Tencent in China either. Mark Zuckerberg, Evan Spiegel and Pony Ma didn’t get to where they are by being dummies, and so it is with software based mobile AR. The cool kids There’s another factor in the democratization of mobile AR that Pokémon Go highlighted – demographics. Sixty-eight percent of Pokémon Go users are between 13 and 29 years old. Even though that came from a very specific set of circumstances, it is the largest sample set of mobile AR mass adoption to date. For comparison in terms of major consumer platforms: Eighty-eight percent of Americans from 18 to 29 use Facebook (two-thirds of them use Messenger), 76 percent of U.S. teens own an iPhone (81 percent want their next phone to be one),  75 percent of WeChat users are between 20 and 30, and 60 percent of Snapchat users are between 13 and 24. Spot the pattern? Mobile AR will be adopted by the young. Platforms that can scale mobile AR with 13 to 29 year olds will win. Apple of my eye Tim Cook loves AR, but Apple has been characteristically enigmatic about its plans. We wrote back in January that Apple could launch an AR enabled iPhone this year or next year, with Samsung and others following. But until Tim Cook says “one more thing” about mobile AR, we really don’t know for certain. So let’s think this through. For the last two years we’ve said that Apple is the best-placed of all major tech companies to drive AR, with its end-to-end ecosystem of hardware, software, app store, developers and retail. Combined with iMessage and its renewed push with stickers, an iPhone AR looks like a pretty compelling proposition. But Apple has a problem: Apple. Apple’s closed ecosystem is a huge advantage, but it’s also a weakness. Apple could provide the best and most complete experience for mobile AR, but only for folks who’ve bought a new iPhone AR. Apple expects users to replace iPhones every 3 years, which is a major driver of 200 million plus annual sales. But iPhone 7/7 Plus only makes up around two-thirds of the total. Assuming the iPhone AR is a range-topper that stimulates growth (converting Android users, reducing replacement cycles), we’re looking at an installed base of at first tens and then hundreds of millions of iPhone ARs in a few short years. But Facebook Messenger has 1.2 billion MAU, WeChat has 768 million DAU, Instagram has 400M DAU, WhatsApp Status has 175 million DAU, Snapchat has 160 million DAU. This means it could take Apple well over 5 years to deliver the mobile AR reach Facebook and Tencent potentially have today. Marc Andreessen remains right – software is eating the world. Do androids dream of tangoing sheep? Samsung and Huawei are the largest Android phone makers globally (not forgetting Oppo and Vivo in China), and these two companies could drive the hardware based mobile AR market for the larger Android ecosystem. But Samsung’s S8 and Huawei’s P10 aren’t AR enabled phones, having neither Tango nor their own proprietary AR platforms. So as discussed in January, we’re looking at 2018 as the likely inflection point for Android hardware based mobile AR. There is also the Android ecosystem challenge of the separate Google Play dominating outside China, and a fragmented set of changing players ruling app stores in China. In other words, none of the Android hardware players has the dominant end-to-end mobile AR potential of Apple. Who dares wins Sun Tzu’s “victorious warriors win first, then go to war” is a way of thinking about Mark Zuckerberg kicking off the mobile AR platform war at F8. Facebook’s mobile AR Platform wins outside China. Its user base, platforms (Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp Status), developer ecosystem, mobile AR developer tools, mobile market experience and financial muscle guarantee its success. Plus Mark Zuckerberg’s got something to prove, justifying his $3 billion entry into VR/AR in the first place (even if that was for a VR company). It’s a really smart move, and it’s going to pay off. Big time. Tencent likely wins in China. The potential dominance of WeChat mobile AR when launched in China is as exciting as Facebook’s AR Platform outside it. The battle has already kicked off during Chinese New Year with Tencent’s versus Alibaba‘s mobile AR Hongbao (traditional red envelopes filled with cash). But the Alibaba opportunity looks very different, as it will be the AR eCommerce leader in China rather than the mobile AR platform leader. Baidu is also layering its wealth of data on the real world, but it too has a different opportunity to Tencent. Apple could become the dominant and most profitable hardware enabled mobile AR player, scaling from zero to hundreds of millions of iPhone AR users by 2021. This could become the innovation for which Tim Cook is remembered, and potentially lead towards Apple’s long term smartglasses dominance going into the next decade (assuming smartglasses solve their 5 big challenges). Apple has been looking for a catalyst to take it beyond Steve Jobs’ legacy, and this could give it a real chance of becoming a 100 year company. Samsung, Huawei and other phone makers could do very well when they start to sell AR phones, but don’t have Apple’s inherent ecosystem advantages. To do more than maintain the status quo, they might need to invest in or acquire totally new capabilities. Otherwise they could miss out on the profits others will make using their mobile AR phones. Google’s Tango is currently geared to enabling a large open mobile AR ecosystem to drive its core search advertising and Google Play revenues, similarly to its current Android approach. However as with Baidu, the mobile AR opportunity to layer its data on the real world could improve its position. Snap is already in the mobile AR business, even if it doesn’t call it that yet. But with a user base much smaller than Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp Status and a closed platform, Evan Spiegel might think about copying Mark Zuckerberg for a change. No dog in this fight Microsoft still hasn’t announced any play for mobile AR. They’ve got massive assets in mixed reality (HoloLens) and VR (Windows VR), so it depends on whether they see themselves as a consumer or enterprise company long term. Steve Ballmer’s biggest regret is missing out on mobile. Hopefully mobile AR won’t become Satya Nadella’s. Amazon has also stayed quiet on mobile AR, despite reports of experiments with AR stores. If they’re not already working on it, this might be an area where Jeff Bezos could learn from Jack Ma. Know your enemy, know yourself The battle lines for mobile AR have been drawn, and some of the winners were clear before the first shot was fired. While it’s not too late for incumbents and startups in mobile AR, again in the words of Sun Tzu, “I have heard that in war haste can be folly, but have never seen delay that was wise.” Time to saddle up.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Apple said to be working on a dedicated AI chip The company has tested iPhone prototypes powered with the chip. By Sarmistha Acharya May 28, 2017 13:03 BST Apple working on a dedicated AI processorGetty Images/Don Emmert Apple is working on a processor dedicated to AI-related tasks, suggests a new report. Dubbed Apple Neural Engine, the chip would improve the way the devices handle tasks such as facial recognition and speech recognition. A source familiar with Apple's plan told Bloomberg that the AI-enabled processor would help Apple bundle more advanced features into devices like self-driving cars and augmented reality devices. While Apple devices currently handle artificial intelligence processes through the main processor and graphics chip, the new chip would allow Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated chip designed for artificial intelligence processing, improving the battery performance of the device. Apple's AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple products. The company even plans to use the chip on the iPhone and iPad, the source told Bloomberg. Apple has even tested iPhone prototypes with the chip. Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos app, parts of speech recognition and the iPhone's predictive keyboard to the chip, the source added. The company is planning to offer developer access to the chip so that third-party apps can also lessen the tasks related to artificial intelligence. Apple may discuss some developments in AI at its annual developer's conference in June, the same event where the company is expected to introduce iOS 11 and updated Mac laptops with faster chips from Intel. "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI. At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence" said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst.

Yep, it turns out the GIF is a millennial, too. At the same time, 30 makes the GIF ancient in web years, which feels a bit weird, given that the proliferation of animated GIFs is a relatively recent phenomenon. Today, Twitter has a GIF button and even Apple added GIF search to its iOS messaging app. Such mainstream approval would have seemed unthinkable even a decade ago, when GIFs had the cultural cachet of blinking text and embedded MIDI files. But today they’re ubiquitous, and not in some nostalgic sense. Animated GIFs have transcended their obscure 1990s roots to become a key part of day-to-day digital communication. Some, like Orson Welles clapping or Michael Jackson eating popcorn, have become instantly recognizable shorthand. Others, like Sean Spicer disappearing into the bushes—itself a remix of a popular Simpsons GIF—serve up political satire. The GIF does double duty as both expression and as badge of digital literacy. Not bad for an image standard that pre-dates the web itself. giphy.com Today GIFs are synonymous with short, looping, animations. But they got their start as a way of displaying still images. Steve Wilhite started work on the Graphics Interchange Format in early 1986. At the time, he was a programmer for Compuserve, an early online service that let users access chat rooms, forums, and information like stock quotes using dial-up modems. Sandy Trevor, Wilhite’s boss at Compuserve, tells WIRED that he wanted to solve two problems. The first was that Compuserve needed a graphics format that worked on all computers. At the time, the PC market was split between several companies, including Apple, Atari, Commodore, IBM, and Tandy, each with its own way of displaying graphics. Compuserve had used other graphics formats of the era, such as NAPLPS, but Trevor thought they were too complex to implement. So he tasked Wilhite with creating a simple format that would work on any machine. Related Stories Liz Stinson Here’s What Happens When You Turn GIFs Into IRL Art Pieces Brian Barrett Futurama Nerds, Rejoice! Morbotron Will GIF Any Quote For You Julia Greenberg Giphy, the Google of GIFs, Gifts the World With a Keyboard Second, he wanted Wilhite to create technology that could quickly display sharp images over slow connections. “In the eighties, 1200 baud was high speed,” Trevor says. “Lots of people only had 300 baud modems.” The average broadband connection in the US is more than 40,000 times faster than even those blazing fast 1200 baud connections, so Compuserve needed truly tiny files. The web’s other major image format, the JPEG, was under development at the time. But it’s better suited for photographs and other images that contain high amounts of detail and won’t suffer from a small amount of distortion. Compuserve needed to display stock quotes, weather maps, and other graphs—simple images that would suffer from having jagged lines. So Wilhite decided to base the GIF on a lossless compression protocol called Lempel–Ziv–Welch, or LZW. Wilhite finished the first version of the GIF specification on May, 1987, and Compuserve began using the format the next month. This was two years before Sir Tim Berners-Lee announced his World Wide Web project and six years before the Mosiac browser made the web accessible to less technical users. But it was the web that made the GIF what it is today. Under Construction The GIF was perfect for displaying logos, line art, and charts on the web for all the same reasons that Wilhite first developed the format. And because portions of an image could be transparent, meaning an image could blend into the background or be fit together with other images in interesting ways, it enabled web designers to create more complex layouts. But the most important thing about the format was that Wilhite had the foresight to make it extensible, so that other developers could add custom types of information to GIFs. That enabled the team behind the Netscape browser to create the animated GIF standard in 1995. “I didn’t ask Steve to put in as much extensibility as he did, but I’m glad he did,” Trevor says. Soon, “under construction” GIFs adorned practically every site on the web. The “Dancing Baby” becoming one the web’s first true viral video sensations. The dancing 7-Up mascot “Cool Spot” also made a unconscionable number of appearances, making it perhaps the first viral #brand GIF. Giphy.com The file format also became the center of one of the web’s first patent disputes. In 1994, IT giant Unisys claimed to own the LZW protocol that Wilhite used in the GIF specification. The company threatened to sue anyone who made software that could create or read GIFs without paying for a license. Unisys’s LZW-related patents expired in 2006, but the ordeal of dealing with the company left a lasting impression on Trevor, who now works as a consultant helping tech companies avoid running into patent suits. The animated GIF epidemic ended about as quickly as it started. As web design professionalized, those under construction GIFs disappeared. Animators and artists, meanwhile, moved on to more sophisticated media like Flash and later HTML5. But the format survived on web forums and sites like 4chan, Reddit, and Tumblr. Adam Leibsohn, the COO of the GIF search engine Giphy, calls the GIF an “insurgent format.” It enables people to publish moving images in places they weren’t necessarily intended, like someone’s signature on a forum. “The easiest, simplest thing wins,” he says. As people realized they could stick tiny, looping bits of animation into web-based conversations, GIFs became a new form of expression. Clips of people clapping, slamming their heads on a desk, or dancing replaced text, and new, more artistic GIFs emerged as a form of micro-entertainment. The rise of smartphones made this form of visual communication all the more appealing. Giphy.com “We’ve reduced our shorthand to things like ‘lol’ and ‘wtf’, things that aren’t very expressive,” says David McIntosh, CEO of the GIF search service Tenor. “With GIFs you can express a wide range of emotions.” About 90 percent of the service’s search terms are related to feelings, he says. It’s hard to say exactly when the GIF re-entered the mainstream web experience. The Nieman Journalism Lab called the 2012 Summer Olympics a “coming-out party” for the animated GIF. That same year, Oxford Dictionaries named “GIF” the word of the year. By early 2013, GIFs were showing up in museums and marketers wanted in. That year Steve Wilhite was awarded a life-time achievement award at the Webbys, where he stirred up a mini-controversy by telling the world that GIF is pronounced like the peanut butter brand Jif, not like “gift.” At the time, it was easy to see GIFs as a passing fad, a throwback to the 1990s along with the “soft grunge” trend. It seemed like surely something newer like Vine or Snapchat would replace GIFs. But all these years later, Vine is gone and the GIF is still with us. Part of that success owes itself to web obsessives, who have built up an enormous inventory of GIF files to choose from. When you want to express dismay or joy or any other emotion, all you have to do is go to Tumblr, Giphy, or Tenor and you can find a ready-made loop. You can think of it as an expansive visual vocabulary built over the years. And while newer formats might bring more options, Tumblr head of creative strategy David Hayes says that the GIF’s technical limitations are actually its strength, not its weakness. After all, artists have long used constraints to spur creativity. “The GIF has constraints that will continue to challenge people,” he says. “You have to make trade-offs with the file size, the frame rate, and the intensity of color.” Instead of asking what’s next, Hayes says, perhaps we should ask whether the GIF is the end-point for visual language. Let’s give it another 30 years and see what happens. Giphy.com Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. gifs History messaging The Web Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

I need to take steps now before it’s too late. A: Getting virtually extorted is scary, but it’s especially terrifying when your business — along with its financial records and employees’ personal information — is at stake. Many businesses mistakenly assume they’re safe if they have a firewall and use security software. Those are important steps, but they’re not enough to protect your business anymore. If you really want to have peace of mind, you need to take extra precautions. For example, certain people at my company have two computers on their desk. Click here to learn how I set up my business to protect against ransomware. Advertising to specific places Q: My customers live in certain parts of town. How can I place ads online so only they see them? A: Advertising to specific (physical) places is quite possible, and online marketing experts do it all the time. But like all marketing, “geo-targeting” is something you need to put a lot of work into planning, executing and refining. It’s one thing to set up a cheap thumbnail ad on Facebook; it’s quite another to build a customer base through rigorous online advertising. Click here to learn more about geo-fencing. More on this...

Is it okay to buy a used one on Craigslist? A: The short answer is, “Maybe, but probably not.” There’s good news, though. If you’d like to buy a discounted Apple product, try looking for something “refurbished.” Apple does an incredible job of collecting retired devices and bringing them back from the dead. Not all used devices have been through this process, of course. Most used Apple products were just dropped off at a pawnshop so they could be resold. What you’re looking for is a device that is “certified refurbished” by Apple. So where can you find these discounted phones and tablets? Click here to learn more about refurbished Apple devices. Stop Windows from sharing your Wi-Fi Q: I read that Windows shares my Wi-Fi automatically with other people around me. How do I stop this? A: If more people knew about “Wi-Fi Sense,” they’d probably be much more suspicious of Windows 10. After all, what kind of software is designed to automatically bypass your Wi-Fi password? Why would you want any passing stranger to log on to your network without you even knowing it? Wi-Fi Sense was designed to be a convenience, especially for people who routinely host friends and colleagues. You’ll be relieved to know that Wi-Fi Sense doesn’t share your actual password with anyone. But it’s still a liability for a lot of folks, so you should know how to switch it off. Click here to limit the reach of Wi-Fi Sense. Keep your device safe outside Q: With summer almost here, I often have to use my laptop, tablet and phone outdoors. Is this going to ruin them? A: Very perceptive question. You would not believe how many people abuse their devices without even realizing. Phones, tablets and laptops have become so ubiquitous that we often forget that they are electronic machines, sensitive to temperature, humidity, dust and every other aspect of our environment. So yes, using your laptop outdoors might ruin it. Know the limits of its durability. Click here to learn one mistake that will kill your gadget. What questions do you have?

Google is hoping to establish itself as a significant player in the mobile niche, while Samsung must look to recover from the disastrous exploding Galaxy Note 7. While the appearance of the tenth anniversary iPhone 8 will also pose challenges for both developers. Image Credit: Ivo Maric / Concept Creator / YouTube video (screenshot) Galaxy Note 8: Big screen And the latest reports on the Galaxy Note 8 suggest that the phablet will feature a bigger screen than this year’s Galaxy S8. Whispers from close to the Samsung supply chain in East Asia indicate that the consumer electronics giant is ready to fit the next generation mobile with a 6.4-inch infinity display. After the Galaxy S8 included a wraparound display, and with rumors that Apple will include such a screen in the iPhone 8, it is clear that the industry is heading generally in this direction. And it now also seems likely that the front panel of the Galaxy Note 8 will be dominated by significant screen real estate, while the handset may even be more compact than previous releases. As confirmation of this notion, a video posted by Twitter user @mmddj_china seems to reveal the glass-fronted panel from the upcoming Galaxy Note 8. This device is almost completely free of bezels, with extremely narrow bordering above and below the opening for the display. This is an interesting development, as @mmddj_china is a prominent leaker who has been correct in the past on various tech issues. The glass panel included in the video is also an interesting indication of the direction that Samsung may take. And it will be interesting to see how this stacks up against the design of the Apple iPhone 8. Dual-lens camera Recent reports have also suggested that the Galaxy Note 8 will feature a dual-lens rear camera, with the fingerprint scanner in the device being moved and integrated into the display. This will be made possible by the screen-dominated design, while it is also anticipated that both Samsung and Apple will eliminate Home buttons from their devices before the end of the calendar year. Smartphone insider Ming Chi-Kuo has already indicated his belief that the 3x optical zoom camera featuring six element lenses will be the most important new feature in the next-generation Samsung handset, making the photographic capabilities of the Samsung snapper much better than those of the existing iPhone 7 Plus. There have also been suggestions that Samsung will update the user interface included in the Galaxy Note 8 in order to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. Image Credit: Concept Creator / YouTube video (screenshot) Google Pixel 2 details emerge Meanwhile, more details have emerged regarding the second-generation Google smartphone. The Google Pixel 2 can be considered more of a mid-range device, with the screen of the handset significantly smaller than the Galaxy Note range, or even the iPhone 7 Plus. Google evidently believes that the premium smartphone niche is hugely crowded, and thus is aiming for an entirely different market. Geekbench has posted solid details on the Google Pixel 2 cover, with the general consensus of opinion being that the mega-corporation is currently working on three handsets to comprise this range. It is thought that the device tested by Geekbench will be the largest in the series. Specs from the testing process indicate that the Google Pixel 2 will utilize a CPU described as a “Qualcomm @ 1.90 GHz, 1 processor 8 cores”. This points to the Snapdragon 835 that was used previously in the United States model of the Samsung Galaxy S8. 4GB of RAM will also power the device, while the handset in question was running the O generation of Android, which is due for release later this year, widely tipped to be branded as Android Oreo. The device tested by Geekbench also scored 1,804 in single-core testing and 6,248 in multi-core. Google has yet to confirm the existence of the Pixel 2, but reports have indicated that the new smartphone has three internal codenames at the corporation; namely, Muskie, Walleye and Taimen; one of which refers to the expected Pixel XL 2. There is little concrete information on precisely how these models will differ, and only one version of the Google Pixel 2 turned up on Geekbench. But the general consensus is that there will be variance in size and memory in particular. Wraparound display There is some debate over whether or not the Google Pixel 2 will include a wraparound display. This is obviously becoming a popular trend in the industry, but with the Pixel 2 essentially intended to be an affordable device, it is questionable whether Google will be able to include such a display while keeping the price down. And the price tag of the Google Pixel 2 is certainly expected to be affordable, with a possible $650 launch price being linked with the smartphone in the United States. Considering that the iPhone 8 may retail at a price tag in excess of $1,000, this means that many consumers on a budget may be tempted by the Google handset. Camera improvements However, despite the affordable price tag of the Google Pixel 2, it is still anticipated that Google will make significant improvements to this handset. In particular, camera upgrades are expected, with some reports suggesting that the snapper included in this smartphone will be superior to the existing iPhone 7 camera. Google Assistant Meanwhile, Google has also been working on improving its assistant software with the intention of rivalling the existing Siri and Bixby. In future editions, Google Assistant will enable users to analyse the surrounding world with the assistance of the camera included in Google devices. Google refers to this technology as Google Lens, and there are obvious similarities between this new innovation and the Google Glass hardware that proved to be somewhat unsuccessful for the corporation. Thus, for example, Google Lens users can see restaurant ratings by pointing their phones at a storefront, along with many other titbits of information. With this new technology likely to be included in the Google Pixel 2, this promises to be an innovative and intriguing smartphone release.

Here are the pros and cons: CONS 1. Free trial is only 5 days compared to the industry standard of 7 days. 2. PlayStation Vue is more expensive than Sling TV. The cheapest plan PlayStation Vue has is $29.99/month compared to Sling Orange for $20/month or Sling Blue for $25/month. If you’re looking to save money, PlayStation Vue may not be the solution you want. 3. With PlayStation Vue, some channels are not available to watch on mobile phones or tablets even if you pay to subscribe to those channels. You can watch them on your PS3/PS4 or Roku, for example, but some of the channels aren’t accessible when watching PS Vue on your mobile device. According to PlayStation, they say that “Some channels are not available through PlayStation Vue Mobile due to streaming rights, and will be marked as such with a Mobile Restricted badge.” 4. You can’t use PlayStation Vue at your friend or family’s house, or on the road. For some strange season, PlayStation Vue ties your account to your home location. So if you do want to use it outside of your home, you’re unable to do so (there are some workarounds, however). On top of that, if your IP address changes for any reason, expect an array of error messages. 5. If you want to watch PlayStation Vue on your Windows PC or Apple computer, you can’t. There’s no app available for the PC, unlike Sling TV which runs on PCs and Apple computers. You have to watch PS Vue through an approved device such as a PS4, Roku, etc. 6. PlayStation Vue isn’t available on as many devices as fuboTV or Sling TV. You can watch PlayStation Vue only on a PS3 or PS4, or an Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, iPad, iPhone, Android and Roku. In comparison, Sling TV is available on: Windows 7 & higher, Apple computers (Lion 10.7 & higher), Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire tablet (running Android 4.4.2+), Roku, Android TV, ZTE, Channel Master, Apple iOS 8 (& higher) phones & tablets, Android 4.0.3 (and higher) phones & tablets and Xbox One. fuboTV, meanwhile is available on: Windows PC, Mac, Apple iPhone, Apple iPad, Apple TV, Android smartphones, Android tablets, Roku, Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Kindle. 6. PlayStation Vue doesn’t provide access to beIN SPORTS Connect. And without beIN SPORTS Connect, you won’t be able to watch many La Liga, Championship, Serie A, Capital One Cup games, as well as other programming. In comparison, fuboTV provides access to beIN SPORTS Connect. 7. You have to create a PlayStation Network account in order to sign up for a trial to PlayStation Vue. If you already have a PS3 or PS4, then that’s no big deal. But if you don’t have either of those two consoles, you have to register for the PlayStation Network account, and then sign up for the PlayStation Vue trial. With Sling TV and fuboTV, you just sign up for the free trial and you’re in. 8. If you want to sign up for a free 7-day trial to PS Vue on your Roku, you can’t. You have to go to the PlayStation website, sign up for a free PlayStation Network account and then sign up for the trial. It’s a shame you can’t sign up for a free trial directly from the Roku device. 9. When you sign up for a free trial to PlayStation Vue, there’s even more steps. You have to select your sex (male/female), enter your birth date and create a profile name. Why do they need your birthdate to watch streaming? Beats me. 10. The user interface for PlayStation Vue isn’t as good or as easy to use as Sling TV. In particular, Sling TV’s recently improved app for the Roku is much better than PS Vue. PROS 1. PlayStation Vue’s selection of channels available is very comprehensive. For the Elite Slim package, which is $44.99 per month, you get: FOX on demand, NBC on demand, ABC on demand, AMC, American Heroes, Animal Planet, beIN SPORTS, BET, BET Gospel, BET Jams, Boomerang, Bravo, BTN, BTN Alternate, Cartoon Network, Centric, Chiller, Cloo, CMT, CMT Music, CNBC, CNBC World, CNN, Comedy Central, Cooking Channel, Destination America, Discovery Channel, Discovery Family, Discovery Life Channel, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, DIY, E!, EPIX Hits, ESPN, ESPN Deportes, ESPN2, ESPNEWS, ESPNU, Esquire Network, Food Network, FOX Business, FOX College Sports, FOX Deportes, FOX News, FOX Sports regional, Freeform, FS1, FS2, Fusion, FX, FXM, FXX, Golf, HGTV, HI-YAH, HLN, IFC, IMPACT, Investigation Discovery, Logo, Machinima, MGM, MSNBC, MTV, MTV Hits, MTV Live, MTV2, MTVU, Nat Geo Wild, National Geographic Channel, NBCSN, Nick Jr., Nickelodeon, Nicktoons, One World Sports, Outside Television, OWN, Oxygen, Poker Central, POP, Science, SEC Network, Sony Movie Channel, Spike, Sprout, SundanceTV, SyFy, TBS, Teen Nick, TLC, TNT, Travel Channel, truTV, Turner Classic Movies, TV Land, Universal, USA, Velocity, VH1, VH1 Classic, WE tv 2. Unlike Sling TV, you can pause and rewind ESPN programming. 3. PS Vue allows you to stream content in every room of your house at no additional charge. With Sling TV, you’re limited to the number of streams you can run concurrently. 4. PlayStation Vue provides access to NBC Sports App and ESPN3, which opens the door to a lot of soccer programming that isn’t available on NBCSN and the ESPN channels.   PlayStation Vue, while offering NBCSN and the NBC Sports App as well as other soccer networks, is a worthy contender in the soccer streaming space, but isn’t perfect by any means. The quest to find the ultimate streaming service that offers everything you could possibly need continues. PlayStation Vue comes close, but hopefully a more cost-effective and comprehensive service will be available in the near future.

Last but not least, he got engaged during half-time of a MLS game. 25 Comments Velija July 17, 2016 I know its been stated that Sling doesnt sponsor this site, but it really seems like it, considering how much information is skewed towards Sling. Youre first comment about cost, it would cost the more money to get the same amount of channels on Vue and Sling, and im talking about Soccer channels specifically. To get ESPN, NBC, Fox, and beIN on Sling. You need to get Sling Blue (Fox, NBC), Sling Orange (ESPN) and the Sports addon (+ $5 for beIN Sports) totaling $45. Its $40 for both packages, then $5 extra for beIN, and that doesnt include beIN en Espanol. With Vue you can get all of those with the Core Slim (medium package) for $35, and add the Spanish pack for beIN en Espanol for $5. Not to mention the fact that you get the addons for those channels (Apart from beIN Connect, but Sling doesnt offer that either). So Sling really doesnt offer an advantage in terms of watching Football at all. The mobile restriction thing is something but, with access to Fox Sports Go, Watch ESPN, and in particular NBC Sports, you dont need to go through PS Vue to watch the sports, it would just act as your log in. . And with PS Vue, you didnt even mention the DVR options, Sling doesnt have this. Again the whole sponsorship talk comes into play, considering it is mentioned on every other article that Fubo and Sling are great way to watch Football. The fact that this article is missing a lot of key points, and has others simply incorrect, is bothersome. Granted it really doesnt matter which you like, competition is needed, but writing something like this is, which clearly favors one side for reasons that we can only guess at, is not good for anyone. Reply Christopher Harris July 17, 2016 Velija, thanks for your feedback. I completely disagree with your assertion that Sling TV “is mentioned on every other article that Fubo and Sling are great way to watch Football.” That’s completely untrue. Some people will like Vue better, others will prefer Sling TV. Like I said in the article, it all depends what you’re looking for and want. You raise a good point about DVR functionality. That’s one feature I forgot to mention. With Sling Blue and Sling Orange combined with the Best of Spanish TV package (for a total of $45/month), you get all the FOX channels, all the NBC channels, all the ESPN channels as well as beIN SPORTS, beIN SPORTS Espanol and all of the Univision channels. Reply Jose January 8, 2017 You forget PS Vue is compatible with Chromecast and also you can use your PS Vue login with the native channel apps to watch other games. You can use login just like a cable login to access Fox Sports, NBC Live Extra and WatchESPN which solves your out of your home problem and for use in computers. I don’t think you did your research on this subject. Reply JeremyC July 18, 2016 As a former sling tv member that switched to ps vue, you hit it on the head with your response about the service. However the article was focused on soccer, but i agree that the info in the article was misleading because the PsVue Mid level package is much more valuable than the Sling tv’s patch work of packages, and is worth it. I can watch multiple espn streams on several tvs and phones, at the same time. Ive cut my cable bill by more than 80 dollars and get more. Reply Rye Brook July 17, 2016 Thanks so much for the review, good to see the pro’s and cons of each provider. I agree with Velija that competition is a good thing. I’m still over the moon that online only fans will be able to watch the premier league and other soccer/futbol using devices other than the bloated and expensive conventional TV packages with their lamentable customer service. For me the Sling pack is the only way to go because (1) I’ll be watching mostly on my MacBook Pro and (2) there’s times when I won’t be at my home ISP location. I’m really hoping that, for matches I can’t watch live, Sling will not reveal the outcome/score either by blatantly stating it on the launch page or giving obvious clues by having the link tab covered by a photo of the winning team wildly celebrating! Reply Christopher Harris July 17, 2016 Thanks for the kind words Rye. With so many streaming choices, the winner is we soccer fans who now have plenty of options to choose from. Reply Michael Hayes July 17, 2016 This Fall a new Real-time, interactive, live sports game app is launching. How it works is if you are watching a Premier League, or MLS, game, you open the app to that game and interact in real-time, by predicting and calling plays. The app will be a FREE download, and players can watch their favorite sports team, interactive by making predictions, and calling plays, and the player can earn rewards like hats and shirts, electronics like an iPad or TV, Vacations, Tickets to a Big Game, or even a car. Will change the way we play sports as fans. Launching in the Fall with live NFL Football and MLS Soccer then expand to Premier League, NBA Basketball, and other sports. Next year will be able to watch the British Open and predict shots, scores, and winners, in real-time. Reply Mike July 18, 2016 might as well have cable. My cable bill was $100, $50 internet & $50 tv (including a dvr). So whatever solution has to be not just $50 but well lower to make it worthwhile. I only want about 6 or 7 channels (NBC sports, NBC Sports extra channels, Fox Sports 1, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN watch, Bien. So until there’s a solution that’s well cheaper than $50 bucks (i’m thinking $20-$30 at most) cable and a dvr is a better option. $45 bucks ain’t enough. I’d rather pay an extra $5, have a dvr, sleep in on weekends and watch games at reasonable hours. Use my dvr and see champions league games when i get home from work. Plus then i’d simply get an extra 100 channels i rarely watch anyways. Reply Steve N July 18, 2016 It should be mentioned that for all the channels that are mobile restricted so that you can’t access them outside the home — that’s not quite accurate. All the channels offer apps for iOS and Android, and you can log in to those channel apps using your Playstation Vue credentials. I use that all the time to access streaming content outside the home. When at home, I use the PS Vue app itself. Reply joe July 20, 2016 PlayStation Vue is hands down better. Reply joman July 21, 2016 without Question PlayStation Vue is the hands down winner, HD viewing of 75+ channels on the mid tier package, all my Philly Eagles , Flyers, Sixers, Phillies on Comcast channel DVR capability for up to 28 -days, plus they have added Roku Adroid Amazon Fire Tv& stick etc. the new Play station vue app just rolled out an updated firmware making the interface more user friendly. Sony has won this battle so far” Reply rev912 July 21, 2016 Question for Vue users, so I can log in and watch on my PS4 in the living room, Fire TV in bedroom, iPad whereever at home but I can’t login anywhere away from my home network like if I am in a hotel or visiting family? It’s tied to your home network or IP? Reply Kailong July 21, 2016 PlayStation Vue is clearly the better one, hands down….. If Sling really doesn’t sponsor this site, then here’s the key points missing out in this review: 1. Streaming quality: This is all we want. With Sling all I get is constant buffering, freezes and lags. What’s the point of lower price with lower quality? 3. IP/Mobile restriction: It is annoying but actually there is easy workaround. Use the Vue credentials on almost any TV everywhere apps and you are good to go. Mobile restriction is absolutely not a big issue here. I’m pretty sure that no one’s ever opened the horrendous Sling app during the Euro and Wimbledon season because of far superior quality on WatchESPN, which unfortunately is the only TV everywhere app supported. To Sling: if you don’t know how to do streaming, at least let others do the job for you. Reply Frill Artist August 13, 2016 Just change the name of the site to SlingSoccerTalk because we all know you’re shilling for them. You didn’t mention Vue’s DVR and CatchUp features. All you did was use every chance to bash and compare their service to Sling. You also lied. Vue has access to BEIN connect. Reply Christopher Harris August 13, 2016 Frill, PS Vue is one of our sponsors too. Regarding beIN SPORTS Connect, when I tested PS Vue this summer, I didn’t see Vue listed at https://beinsportsconnect.tv/index.html and I don’t think it worked when I tried to log in using Vue credentials. If it does work now, I stand corrected. Reply Monte Reed August 13, 2016 beIN Sports Connect is Included with Playstation VUE. Watching it right now on my phone Reply Ashot August 13, 2016 So what’s the best deal for watching Bein (connect), FS1 & FS2, NBCSN (live extra)? VUE Core $45? With Sling it can be cheaper but without Connects & Live extras…or Sling blue + FuboTV but still without Live Extra $35…still expensive for just watching football. Reply Thony August 28, 2016 Do I have access to BeinConnect with PS Vue Slim + Español Pack? I wonder because just includes Bein Sports in spanish, but I don´t see any mention of beinsports in english… I´m currently looking to change my Sling Orange+Spanish (25$/month) to either: – Sling Blue+Spanish (30$/month) which will include Bein Sports, NCBSN and Fox, but no access to online features of those channels.. – PS Vue Slim + Español (35$/month) which will include Bein Sports, NCBSN, Fox and ESPN. And it grants access to online features of those channels. The one I’m not sure is BeinConnected… and it matters a lot to me because I’m a die hard fan of Juventus (Serie A games are usually live in BeinSport (English))… so this matters a lot to me… I Think I´m going to be on the PS Vue side for this one Reply cmotomn September 23, 2016 Just verified that PlayStation Vue subscribers now have access to beIN Sports Connect! Reply FrillArtist February 1, 2017 PS Vue is now available on PC and Mac. The PS Vue interface on PS4 and PS3 is better than any Sling interface. Reply David February 1, 2017 The PS Vue is on Apple TV now as well. Reply Mike February 1, 2017 I’ve tried SlingTV, Fubo TV, PS Vue and Directv Now, all on Apple TV. PS Vue is the best choice in my opinion. With PS Vue Core package for $34.99, you get BeIn, Fox Sports, FS1, FS2, NBCSN, all ESPN channels, CNBC and USA Network (for when EPL games are broadcasted). Plus, you can use your PS Vue credentials to access the Fox Sports app which gives you Fox Soccer Plus games, all games on ESPN 3 and NBCSN. The DVR feature (keeps 10 or so episodes for daily shows, 28 episodes for weekly shows) and pause/rewind live TV is awesome. Sling TV has a problem with buffering/degradation, etc. El Classico match last Spring on Fubo TV was terrible. PS Vue is the way to go for number of sports/soccer channels at the best price. Reply VJ February 3, 2017 I have tried to activate Vue from outside of the US but can’t seem to do it without a US issued credit card. I do of course have VPN. Can anyone assist me? Reply SCH May 27, 2017 Is fox sports a necessary add on if my husband likes to watch all man city games, but also other soccer games? Reply Christopher Harris May 28, 2017 He’ll need FOX Sports in order to watch Manchester City games in the UEFA Champions League next season. Those games will be on either FS1 or FS2 (FOX Sports 1 or FOX Sports 2).

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Science & Health Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Comparison screenshots showing how much Apple Maps lags behind Google Maps A detailed comparison showing Google Maps' prowess over Apple Maps, has surfaced online in a recent blog post. Vinod Yalburgi   May 28, 2017 15:40 IST Apple Maps vs Google Maps: Which mapping service is better and why Apple Maps has long been playing catch-up with Google Maps as its mapping service has been lagging behind in coverage and other mapping information. The iPhone maker is reportedly making amends to keep up with the competition in recent times, but the latest comparison screenshots published on Justin's blog suggest otherwise. As seen in Justin's comparison review, there have been significant improvements made to Google Maps over the period of last one year as opposed to minor additions to Apple Maps. For instance, you can see the Patricia's Green Park in central San Francisco being compared side-by-side on both Apple and Google Maps. Check out a few of those interesting screenshots below: Comparison screenshot showing how much Apple Maps lags behind Google MapsJustinobierne Quite obviously, you will notice the amazing details like park paths and neighbouring landmarks clearly marked out on the Google Maps, but very sparse details on the Apple Maps. Furthermore, the report adds that the accuracy of information is dubious on Apple Maps, owing to the lack of details. Comparison screenshots showing how much Apple Maps lags behind Google MapsJustinobierne It seems certain business locations are being cycled (added or removed) on a monthly basis on the Apple Maps, while Google Maps will continue displaying all existing landmark locations for a given address without any limitations. The reason for the inflated number of changes being reported on Apple Maps has been attributed to its poor geocoder mechanism. Furthermore, the finer details on Google Maps are coupled with a polished and refined interface, making the points of interest more visible to the user. With the lack of refinements, Apple Maps continues to look outdated and not user-friendly like its Google counterpart.

Michelin to launch second edition of Singapore guide 2017 on June 29 Search News Technology Apple plans to use AI chip in future iPhone models May 28, 2017 17:02 SGT By Mario Manlupig, Jr Reuters Apple is reportedly planning to embed a dedicated artificial intelligence chip in future iPhone models to enable functionalities that only this technology can fulfill. In fact, the firm is now developing the said chip which has been named the Apple Neural Engine. Apple Neural Engine According to a Bloomberg report, the Apple Neural Engine would be used to "improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence—such as facial recognition and speech recognition". This technology is expected to help solve the long-standing issue with battery drain and potentially make the overall smartphone experience better. There have been speculations the Cupertino firm has been testing out this innovation and is looking into releasing the next iPhone models later this year with this chip in tow. However, as common as Apple demeanor, the firm refused to confirm this information. AI developments While there have been no public announcements made by Apple, the missing pieces of the puzzle seem to orchestrate one by one. In the last few years, Apple CEO Tim Cook had mentioned how the company is setting aside a massive amount of time to study augmented reality and artificial intelligence and how to integrate them into their future hardware. In 2016, the firm began publishing its research on artificial intelligence. In January, it entered into the Partnership on AI, a research coalition of Silicon Valley firms whose primary goal is to observe the future of digital innovation and cybernetics. And just in February, it announced its plans to expand its Seattle headquarters wherein much of its AI and machine learning efforts take place. The AI market has grown so fast in the last few years. Pioneers taking the lead like Amazon and Google have stepped ahead of Apple with their Alexa and Assistant devices. Soon after, Apple would be able to pick up and move forward beyond Siri.

Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: The main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centres to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Smart cities to take centre stage at CES 2018 A new era for Nokia Snapchat’s ‘Spectacles’ go on sale in Europe Apple set to expand Siri, taking different route from Amazon’s Alexa (VIDEO) Five powerhouse gaming PCs seen at Computex 2017 A new era for Nokia Will Samsung's new notebooks write a new chapter?

GET IN TOUCH WhatsApp: 0549986996 +233 302 224959, +233 302 226171       Ghana News Ghana News, Ghana Politics, Ghana Sports, Ghana Business           Home Business Politics Sport Showbiz Odd But True Opinion Relationship Lifestyle Infographics Photo Gallery TV Future iPads, iPhones might have a special chip just for processing AI Sunday 28th May , 2017 8:50 am Apple’s reportedly working on a new kind of chip — potentially for future iOS devices — that’ll be used just for processing AI, Bloomberg reports. Bloomberg says the chip’s called the Apple Neural Engine internally, and could be used for “offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip.” By moving AI processing to a dedicated chip, battery life in devices could also see a boost since the main CPU and GPU wouldn’t be crunching as much data and gobbling as much power. The report says Apple plans to integrate the chip into its devices, but it’s unclear when that’ll happen, and if any iOS devices launching this year will have it. Apple’s work on an AI chip shouldn’t surprise anyone who’s paying attention to the competition. Virtually every tech company is working on improving AI processing on mobile devices. Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 chip, which is already in devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8, has a special module dedicated to processing AI tasks. Years ago, Apple started designing its own mobile processors to improve performance and reduce power consumption, and it’s really paid off. Despite having fewer cores, the iPhone 7 still crushes the Galaxy S8 when it comes to sheer performance. iPhones and iPads also come with an Apple-designed “M”-branded motion coprocessor to collect sensor data from the various included sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, etc.). It’s this M chip that helps with tracking health and fitness data. Furthermore, in addition to the main Intel processors in the new MacBook Pros, there’s also a small Apple-made “T1” chip for powering the Touch Bar. Apple’s AirPods also have a custom W1 chip that helps with pairing them to iOS devices. Clearly, Apple loves making custom chips for things. We’re all for it, especially if that means longer battery life. If the future is AI everywhere (and it definitely looks like that’s where things are headed), it’s in Apple’s best interests to control the stack (like it always does) with its own AI chip. – Source: Mashable Apple Ghana News Ipads Iphones Marian Efe Ansah Tagged with: Apple Ghana News Ipads Iphones More on citifmonline.com US now conducts social media background checks before issuing visa June 4, 2017 Tech leaders defy Trump on climate deal June 4, 2017 YouTube clarifies ‘hate speech’ rules June 3, 2017 Google to let publishers charge users for ad-blockers June 3, 2017 Tech leaders defy Trump on climate deal June 2, 2017 Ghana to launch first satellite into space June 2, 2017 General News Faure Gnassingbè is new ECOWAS chair June 4, 2017 Ghanaian church celebrates Chelsea’s Premier League success [Photos] June 4, 2017 Rawlings calls for complete overhaul of NDC June 4, 2017 Galamsey fight: River Pra showing signs of improvement June 4, 2017 Capt.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive New report critical of Husing’s analysis Sunday May 28, 2017 at 12:01 AM May 28, 2017 at 3:45 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — A new report out of the University of California, Riverside (UCR) criticizes Dr. John Husing’s prediction of steep rate increases under town ownership of the water system here. In the report, Dr. Christopher Thornberg — director of UCR’s Center for Economic Forecasting and Development — argued Husing’s “dismal outlook” does not stand up “under scrutiny.” Thornberg, who was paid $25,000 by the town, aligned with Assistant Town Manager Marc Puckett, who recently said water rates could be lowered by 15 percent if the town earned the right in court to buy Liberty for $100 million at an interest rate between 4 and 4.4 percent. Conversely, Husing’s report — funded by Liberty Utilities — concluded the average residential water bill in town would increase between $502 and $620 per year under town ownership. Husing previously called Puckett’s claim “heroic” given what he saw as a Federal Reserve (FED) “clearly on track to raise interest rates.” His analysis found that a $150 million revenue bond would likely come with interest between 5.25 and 7.25 percent, resulting in annual payments between $10 and $12.4 million, respectively. Thornberg disagreed with Husing’s notion that a $150 million bond would not cover the full cost of acquiring Liberty. Further, he viewed Puckett’s range of $80 to $100 million as “almost assuredly ... on the high side.” Citing a modest “pace of appreciation” in the value of Liberty’s system over the next two to three years, Thornberg pegged a potential sale price at roughly $75 million. “Dr. Husing’s dismal outlook for the town’s purchase plan ... is based on his assumption of (a) very high purchase price paradoxically along with considerably higher interest rates than current rates,” Thornberg wrote. “His justification for these higher numbers does not stand up under scrutiny.” Tony Penna — vice president of Liberty Apple Valley — defended Husing’s analysis, stating residents “can trust the carefully researched conclusions by the High Desert’s most respected economist.” “Repaying $150 million in bond debt plus interest will increase water bills by at least $500 annually,” Penna said. “There has never been an eminent domain takeover where promises of lower water bills came true.” In Felton, customers are paying “$500 every year to repay bond debt, plus water rates have increased by 67 percent,” according to Penna. Both reports focus on Measure F, which residents will vote on in a June 6 special election. A “yes” vote would allow the town to borrow up to $150 million to acquire Liberty’s system; a “no” would likely end the town’s takeover bid. “Dr. Husing’s analysis and recommendation that voters should reject Measure F is consistent with the findings of the Apple Valley Blue Ribbon Water Committee,” Penna said, “which concluded that the debt could exceed $200 million.” Thornberg argued that Husing’s $150 to $200 million sale-price range was supported by “an erroneous interpretation” of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corporation’s purchase of Apple Valley Ranchos and two other systems from the Carlyle Group in early 2016. “Total consideration received by Carlyle was for $327 million, but there was an assumption of $77 million in debt by the buyer,” Thornberg wrote. “This implies that the three utilities were purchased for a cash amount of $250 million ... Husing inexplicably adds the $77 million to the $327 million ... to arrive at a highly inflated cash purchase value of $404 million.” He also attacked Husing’s claim of interest rate hikes. “His implication is that an economy with low unemployment will have higher interest rates,” Thornberg wrote. “Unfortunately, this conclusion ... simply isn’t supported by the historic evidence.” The U.S. last reached full employment in 1988, 1998 and 2006, according to Thornberg. “These were periods of time, not unlike today, where unemployment hit bottom and then remained roughly steady until the next recession, in 1990, 2001 and 2008 respectively,” he wrote. “In all three full-employment periods, long term interest rates actually declined rather than (rose) sharply. Dr. Husing’s rationale for higher rates is simply incorrect.” Like Husing, Thornberg acknowledged the FED is “in the midst of steadily raising the Federal Funds rate,” but he argued “any scholar of interest rates understands that the pass-through to long term rates is small.” “In short, this fact also doesn’t support Dr. Husing’s aggressive predictions at all,” Thornberg writes. “It is worth noting that since he released his reports, long term interest rates have actually dipped.” Town officials sought the independent review in response to “outside criticism” like Husing’s, a statement shows. Town spokesperson Kathie Martin told the Daily Press that Thornberg’s report was paid for with approval of Town Manager Frank Robinson. “The town manager has authority to approve expenses up to ($50,000),” Martin said. Meanwhile, Robinson said he was “delighted” to see Puckett “vindicated” by Thornberg’s report. “Given the amount of criticism … against Marc Puckett and the rest of his team,” Robinson said, “I decided it was important to have an independent economist take a look at the numbers.” Read Thornberg’s full report here.

Jun Zhang, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, said in a note to investors that issues with the iPhone 8’s reported rear fingerprint sensor will delay the smartphone’s launch and that materials for its production won’t be available until the holiday 2017 quarter. As a result, Zhang said production orders for the new iPhone 8 will also be smaller than expected. As AppleInsider notes, Rosenblatt has also maintained an aggressively low target of $120 for Apple stock, despite its current price of around $150. Read: Alleged Images Of Apple Smartphone Show Touch ID On Back Of Device, Matte Black Model In the past, Zhang and Rosenblatt's predictions have sometimes been aggressive towards Apple. As AppleInsider pointed out, Zhang previously wrote in 2016 that if the Apple iPhone 7 didn’t have a significant panel upgrade, it would lack a driving feature for sales. The iPhone 7 would go on to fuel stronger year-over-year sales for Apple in the first quarter of 2017. While Apple has kept many details for the iPhone 8 under wraps, various leaks have provided a basic outline for the upcoming smartphone. Apple is expected to pair the iPhone 8 release with an iPhone 7s and 7s Plus refresh. The iPhone 8 is also expected to be a more boutique smartphone model with a possible price point of more than $1,000. The rear of the new iPhone is also expected to include a fingerprint sensor, similarly to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel. The rumored issues with the fingerprint sensor also come alongside similar product delay issues with the iPhone 8. Previously, it was rumored that Apple wanted to include Touch ID — where a user can validate their identity with a fingerprint — directly into the iPhone display. However, Apple reportedly ran into problems during the production process for the feature. At the time, Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri said Apple could potentially choose to either rely entirely on the front-facing camera with facial recognition for user validation. Apple could also move the Touch ID to the phone's backside or delay production on the phone, but still announce it alongside the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Read: Apple iPhone 8's High Price Will Not Dampen Sales, Survey Says For Apple, the company has ample reasons to ensure that the iPhone 8 hits the same heights of past iPhone releases. While the iPhone remains a driving factor in Apple’s current success, the smartphone field will see several high-profile releases this year like the LG G6 and has already seen similar flagship models like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel. Apple likely wants ensure that it gets the iPhone 8 launch right and maintains its current status as a market leader. Related Articles Siri To Get Galaxy S8's Bixby Vision Like Feature?

Over the course of a year, Google quietly turned its map inside-out – transforming it from a road map into a place map. A year ago, the roads were the most prominent part of the map – the thing you noticed first. Now, the places are. And: In our Comparison last year, we found that Apple generally showed a greater variety of places than Google: But look what happens when we resurvey Google a year later: It's quite a difference – and Google's mix is now much closer to Apple's. And: Speaking of Apple... while Google has been making all those changes, what has Apple been up to? After all, Apple announced an "all-new design" for Apple Maps just weeks before Google's Summer redesign. Let's take a look at how Apple looked a year ago, before it released its new design: And now let's see how it looks today: See the difference? I don't either. Last year, in addition to the major redesign, we also got Maps apps, so everything from ride-sharing to reservation making could live in and enhance maps. We also got steady progress for Apple Maps on the web. I expect we'll see some of the next-generation of Maps updates at WWDC 2017 but here's hoping Apple can shed its dependence on TomTom data, accelerate the updates, and start closing that gap. It's not about beating Google at maps either. It's about providing quality maps all Apple's own. Many people simply use whatever's built into the phone or tablet they buy, and for iPhone and iPad, that's Apple Maps. And they deserve as rapid and continuous improvements as possible. Apple's got a great geo team, we just need to see more from them in real time. Maps for iPhone and iPad What's new in the Maps app How to find locations and get directions with Maps How to share location and directions with Maps How to delete your search history and prior destinations in Maps How to use Siri with Maps How to enable and use Maps extensions Best Maps app extensions How to change settings for Maps How to report a problem in Maps How to use Maps with CarPlay Reader comments Apple Maps vs. Google Maps: A year in analysis 27 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating wesee The week that Apple Maps first came out, I got a wedding invitation that stated, "Don't use Google Maps, because it's wrong." I knew where the church was, and sure enough Google was wrong. I tried it in Apple Maps, and it was perfect. Since then I have used Apple Maps only, and have yet to be let down. I travel all over Southern Ontario, and into the US at times. I know people find spots that are wrong, but that can be said for Google too. I'll happily stick with Apple Maps. 0 1 week ago Reply Rene Ritchie No maps really work for me. Google stopped announcing exit numbers for a while, which meant I couldn't use them on the local highways. Just last week I asked both Google and Apple Maps to take me to a local town hall. Apple showed me the wrong town, Google wanted me to go to the U.S. The floods ended here almost two weeks ago and Google still wants to redirect me around them, but wants to take me through roads blocked by construction for almost a month. I get that mapping is hard and up-to-the-minute mapping almost impossible, so generally I try to just get general ideas and not worry the details much. 0 1 week ago Reply Steve Adams The opposite for us when apple started with maps. We went to a hockey tourney with my son, his iPhone shoed the stadium on the opposite side of town and my nokia brought us right to the correct door. 0 1 week ago Reply wvayens I really prefer the look of Apple maps. I use maps more to tell me how to get someplace rather than finding places. And I find the "look" when I'm navigating to be much cleaner and easier to read. 0 1 week ago Reply masaoota I'm totally the opposite - I find Google Maps visually a lot easier to view and follow. This is particularly so in London where they have clear classic icons on the map for underground stations and train stations which are often the main landmarks I navigate by. The Apple Maps representation of these is really poor. 0 1 week ago Reply PoisonMaps I think this is an example of why Google Maps is so much better than Apple Maps for countries outside North America. Apple Maps is very much based on roads, which is probably fine in the U.S, where most people drive everywhere, but doesn’t work elsewhere. As you say, in London people’s knowledge of the layout of the city is generally garnered from the tube map (an iconic design that I am unhealthily fond of), and so Google make sure that the stations are prominent. I don’t know for sure, but Apple don’t seem to have the same global knowledge. They have some great transit functionality, with fantastic levels of detail, but the London tube stations are barely shown on the main map unless you specifically select the Transit option. I assume that Apple Maps are coded by guys in Cupertino so this probably seems a reasonable assumption. However I guess that Google have people in each country giving feedback about what locals expect to be on a map, and that makes their maps so much better to use. Apple really need to up their game with maps, especially outside the US. I am sure that they are great for driving, but what about when walking? Especially when in the countryside, which is where Apple Maps is frankly awful. This was understandable when they first started, but is pretty pathetic 5 years later. Why do they show so few (if any) paths? Surely people in the US like to hike as well? Hopefully Apple will up their game in Maps at WWDC. They have made all sorts of amazing peripheral improvements (3D flyovers, transit, reservations etc) but the basic maps are not much better than they were 5 years ago (at least here in the UK). They still prioritise driving and ignore walking, which is pretty poor for a general purpose app. 0 1 week ago Reply indoctrahol I'll give Apple Maps another go around. The issue I have with it when using just for a little bit was there is a bit too much movement when navigating. It becomes a bit hard to reorientate your sense of direction when this happens too much. Maybe I'm just getting old. 0 1 week ago Reply Vox My only problem with Apple Maps is that it's the only option when it comes to Car Play...can't open Waze or Google Maps in the place I need them most...my car. Usually Apple Maps works well here in Monterrey (Mexico), but when it doesn't, I've got to pull out my phone holder and stick it to the window to be able to use Waze (which is usually the best of the 3 for me here). 0 1 week ago Reply Thoughter Rene, by focusing just on the look of Apple Maps, you are leaving out the huge improvements that Apple continues to roll out. For example, it's just in the past year AM has implemented the hugely beneficial "alternate routes" pop up when accidents occur. Apple Transit is also superior to GM Transit, not in number of regions yet, but in accuracy and user features. (Apple could have turned on every region at once, as Google did, if they simply were satisfied with stock data, but Google was criticized for accuracy, etc., and Apple wanted a very different user experience. Also, it would be good for you with your contacts to do an article on what is around the corner with Apple anticipated to compete its base map this year or early 2018. This will lead to some fantastic developments, such as Sky to ground zoom, again far superior than the GM Streetview which is very dated and clunky to use. 0 1 week ago Reply Thoughter Rene, also it would be great in an article to let folks know how huge mapping is in Apple's future. With the debacle of a roll out, Apple has intentionally been low key in building base map and adding features, but they are adding thousands of employees to mapping, e.g., new center in India, and mapping is integral to the future Apple ecosystem, something most don't realize. 0 1 week ago Reply SkydiverTilt Two YEARS after moving into my house I still have to tell people not to use Apple Maps. It's just awful. Apple reallly needs to allow Google maps integration into the iOS for one click directions. Apple maps isn't even close (and I'm an Apple fan boy), not by **** far. Stays deleted (thank you Apple for at least allowing it to be deleted so as not to accidentally click a link and open up that garbage of an app) 0 1 week ago Reply DannyJJK If you've read the previous comments on here, Apple Maps is certainly not garbage. Yes it's probably inaccurate in your area, but just because it's bad in one area doesn't mean it's bad all round. Google Maps is very inaccurate for me around where I live, by your logic that means Google Maps is just as garbage as well 0 1 week ago Reply stratmansd Google Maps is really better when it comes to overall reference and map information. But when it comes to driving directions, I find Apple Maps and Google Maps are mostly the same. Google maps is good at giving you lane instructions which Apple Maps doesn't do. However, I've had Google either stop giving directions or begin giving me directions in an opposite direction. I haven't had these problems with Apple Maps. Apple Maps is usually reliable when I'm driving and using Car Play. 0 1 week ago Reply AdamHunterATC I am, for the most part, content with Apple Maps. Give me lane guidance and multi-destination routing, and it'll be perfect for me. 0 1 week ago Reply n8ter#AC Most people I know use Google Maps. I haven't driven in like... Years, Lol. So, naturally I only use Maps when told to. In that case, I just use whatever device I have. If I have my Windows Tablet, I will just use that cause it has GPS and Offline Maps. If I'm on my Kindle I'll check on that if I'm tethered. If i'm on my Phone, I will check Apple Maps, cause I don't install redundant apps on my phone (like Google Maps). I've yet to have any of those take me to the wrong place, so I pretty much don't care about these details anymore... 0 1 week ago Reply iDonev Over where I live (Bulgaria) Apple Maps has much more serious problems than your usual "oh, there aren't enough businesses and places of interest" or the "road is closed due to construction work and it's not reflected on the map". The biggest issue Apple Maps has for me is the omission of small roads and pedestrian walkways. As such Apple Maps cannot even give me the fastest route to my location. Google Maps, on the other hand, is much more comprehensive. That said, I still prefer Apple Maps, I just need to duplicate my route search in Google Maps to make sure that I am going where I need to go and that I will get there as quickly as possible. 0 1 week ago Reply Ttrq2001 For a very nice job with the same topic, head over here and check out what this other author has to say! Enjoy. https://www.justinobeirne.com/a-year-of-google-maps-and-apple-maps 0 1 week ago Reply PoisonMaps That's the article that Rene is talking about. 0 1 week ago Reply Ttrq2001 Ah got it. That article is really good! Thx PM! 0 1 week ago Reply PoisonMaps No worries. It is a great article that gives a good insight into the difficulty of creating maps that are used for all sorts of purposes. I think they should give the user more control over what they want to see on the map. Both apps have “transport” modes, and Google have “cycling”, but why not have options for hiking, shopping, tourism, emergencies etc? Although then no-one would buy my app! 0 1 week ago Reply Derrick4Real yes a very good article. And if it's relying on Tom Tom information it explains why for more than a year my like 30 requests for a correction of a business and address went unfixed. They probably could not fix it because it was someone else's information, which i always suspected. That said they did offer a place to offer corrections. So i figured they had some input. 0 1 week ago Reply Steve Adams Oh, for driving, at least, download HERE maps. It's the BEST mapping / navigation for driving . 0 1 week ago Reply Derrick4Real My experience is very much the opposite. Google has always and still does have far more detail, businesses in my area, LA. The addresses and business names are more accurate too. I even told apple several times about errors that didn't get fixed until just last year. Google street view is the killer feature though and i haven't seen an apple offering that compares to that. I do wish google had a feature where i could just have it in 3d driving mode w/o navigating somewhere. And also even when you're driving or navigating it doesn't always show the map in the direction your moving which is annoying. Google also has maps inside many stores here which was actually quite useful as when i was looking for a used record store i peered inside and it was pretty easy to determine that it wasn't a traditional record store but was more of a joint selling overpriced brand new albums you could get at Urban Outfitters and incense. Apple is ok. i use it sometimes. But it really annoyed me when i used it to drive to "Walmart" only to find out it was really a "Sam's Club", a business owned by Walmart but clearly messed up on Apple's maps. Somehow I'm guessing they got the information messed up. Unfortunately the nearest Walmart was like a 25 minute drive away. And i hate Walmart. I didn't want to have to go in the first place. Interestingly, i noticed Yelp had the exact same error along with several other errors Apple's maps had. I theorized that wherever they got their data from it was the same place. 0 1 week ago Reply sangs Verizon Navigator FTW! :D Yes, I'm joking. Why on earth VZN still comes preinstalled on some phones, and is offered for download on others, boggles my mind. Who the **** is gonna pay for that when Google and Apple offer Maps for free? Anyway, I prefer GM to AM, mainly because it tells me what lane to be in, and that's a big one in the NJ/NYC area. Also prefer the look. 0 6 days ago Reply birdman325 I routinely switch between Google and Waze. At least here in Toronto, I find Waze far and away does the best job in routing you around traffic and congested areas. The feature I like best about Google Maps is that as you are driving on a particular route, superimposed on the Map are various "similar ETA" routes, so for example, instead of driving straight up a particular street which may be the "main route", Google Maps will show me "similar ETA" if I turn left. I have tried Apple Maps and while I find it to be generally accurate, I have less confidence in its real time traffic updating. Anyone have any thoughts or experiences with Apple Maps and traffic (in Toronto)? 0 6 days ago Reply SweSubaru Here in Sweden Apple Maps is so far behind Google Maps.For info and POI i use Google Maps.For navigation i use Waze. 0 6 days ago Reply Nick Seamore Still no bicycle choice!

There are three color variations available and they all look sharp. The butterfly clasp locks securely in place, and it's easy to remove multiple links if you find the standard bands just a little loose on your wrist. You'll pay a little more for this band than some of the other alternatives, anywhere from $50 to $90, but that's still a drop in the bucket when you aren't quite ready to buy the real thing. See at Amazon OULUOQI butterfly stainless steel bracelet A warranty can be comforting when you're buying an alternative brand for your Apple Watch, and that's the first way OULUOQI delivers with their band. Their 18 month manufacturer's warranty means that you can get a replacement band if something happens to you gorgeous new band, but it's a comfort you're not likely to need. The well-reviewed band is a favorite for a reason. As alternative brand bands go, OULUOQI is on the more expensive end, with both the 38mm and 42mm watch bands costing about $90. A feature we love about the brand is how some links are removable with a simple release button, so you don't have to fuss with any tiny tools to shrink the band size. Combine that convenience with the spot-on match of Apple's silver and space black colors and you've got a winning watch band! See at Amazon Pomarks Apple Watch Band Wrist Strap Link Bracelet If you're looking for a near-identical dupe to the Apple Watch link band, then we recommend taking a peek at the Apple Watch Band Wrist Strap Link Bracelet from Pomarks. Designed with high quality stainless steel and designed to look like an identical clone of the original link bracelet, the Pomarks Apple Watch Band Wrist Strap Link Bracelet is easy to adjust and secure depending on how big or thin your wrist is. You can pick up this particular Apple Watch accessory for around $30, and if there are any issues, don't worry: all Posmarks products are backed up with a warranty in case anything happens!

When he's not bothering his chihuahuas, Mikah spends entirely too much time and money on HomeKit products. You can follow him on Twitter at @mikahsargent if you're so inclined. Want to start using Apple's HomeKit home automation for iPhone and iPad? Here's everything you need to know! Just getting started with HomeKit or recently purchased your first HomeKit-enabled accessory? Awesome! You've just bought into one of the most secure, most easy-to-use connected home platforms — especially if you're using an iOS device like an iPhone or iPad. Now, while Apple's take on the connected home is designed to be simple and secure, it can still be a little daunting. That's why we've put together this guide: to give you all the information you'll need (and then some!) to set up and use HomeKit-enabled accessories and apps. Don't worry, you'll be controlling your home with Siri and the iOS Home app in no time! How HomeKit works What the heck is HomeKit and how does it work? Fair question. When you buy a connected home accessory that works with Apple HomeKit, you're buying a product that's been tested by Apple for both security and functionality. HomeKit is a framework that connects your home automation products and lets you control them with your voice, via Siri, and your taps, via the Home app for iOS. Here's an example: Say you buy Elgato's Eve Room, a HomeKit-enabled product that monitors a room's air quality, temperature, and humidity. After you perform an initial setup process, Apple's HomeKit framework securely connects the accessory to your iOS devices and lets you access its sensors (air quality, temperature, and humidity) in HomeKit-enabled apps and via Siri. You can learn more about how HomeKit operates here: The science behind HomeKit HomeKit FAQ: Everything you need to know Should you use HomeKit? HomeKit has improved quite a bit since its introduction in 2014; at this point I can absolutely recommend going all-in on a HomeKit-enabled home. Serenity Caldwell's original thoughts on HomeKit After four months with HomeKit, I can say that while I love it, it's definitely not perfect: HomeKit accessories only just started arriving in 2015, and the framework is just two years old. As such, there are still plenty of bugs to be fixed and kinks to work out in the system. Siri doesn't always work; Bluetooth-based accessories can't update without a device nearby to check their status; and Wi-Fi based accessories all require different bridges—which leads to a lot of bridges in your network room. Would I use HomeKit to run my door locks? Not yet—it's still a little too finicky for my taste. But for lights, plugs, and thermostats, the service is great. When HomeKit does work, it's downright magical, and when it doesn't, well... the accessories I mentioned above also all have manual control options. So it doesn't outright break anything; you just go back to living in the status quo switch world of before. Four months in, I have around 85 percent reliability with my HomeKit devices, and I'm only seeing Siri's response rate and connectivity increase as time goes on. Is HomeKit worth it if you're willing to suffer the occasional early adopter bug? Absolutely. Considering that you can pick up a HomeKit-enabled plug for just $30 to start your collection, there's no huge monetary buy-in; Apple's emphasis on the security aspect also elevates the home automation service above fellow competitors like Wink and WeMo. And recent support from longtime home automation players like Philips Hue makes it even easier to drop some cash to play in the HomeKit ecosystem. Ultimately, it'll still be a few years before I think we'll see HomeKit really grab mass attention, but it's a ripe playground for early adoption and experimentation. Scenes let you set up complex actions, triggerable by a phrase to Siri; Triggers offer even more control, letting you set up action- and time-based events so that you have to do as little fiddling with switches and Siri as possible. For me, HomeKit is a blast—even with the occasional bug or two—and I can't wait to see where it's going in the future.

Do you have any 'scenes' set up that have both philips hue lights and lutron switches involved? I have the philips lights and i want to add a string of christmas lights with the lutron plug-in dimmer. If i say "hey siri, set the movie scene" will she change the hue lights and the lutron? Is this something you have tried? I've been reading your posts and it sort of seems like it will work. but i'm a little skeptical yet. Thanks for your help! 0 1 year ago Reply SteveW25561 I can't find the answer to these issues I have with HomeKit: 1. Is there an away mode/scene to simulate someone in the house? I can't find any randomization feature, and Google searches about "HomeKit" and "away" yield results talking about the Apple TV or iPad allowing out-of-home access to HomeKit. 2. How well can Bluetooth low-energy HomeKit devices (as opposed to WiFi connected HomeKit devices) connect and work, especially if you have many that are more than 100 feet away or separated by walls? I see this as a major issue if you want to deploy HomeKit devices more than a small radius away from your Apple TV. 0 6 months ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Speed up app installs and iCloud access on your Apple devices! By Anthony Casella Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 3:00 pm EDT 1 Comment How can I more quickly install apps, get iCloud data, and update all of my Apple devices? Do you have a lot of Apple hardware to maintain? Perhaps you are a small office that manages numerous similar Apple devices? You can speed up the updating of your Macs, the downloading of your apps, and access to your iCloud data while at the same time reducing your internet bandwidth usage by installing the macOS Server Caching Service! What does the Caching service do? In my household, we have (in their various forms): 4 iPads, 4 iPhones, 3 AppleTVs, 3 MacBook Pros, 2 MacBook Airs, 1 MacBook, and 1 iMac. That's a lot of downloading to do for iCloud synchronization and system updates across all of those devices. You may have a metered internet package or you might need to make certain your Apple-related downloads don't use up all of the bandwidth. The Caching service helps by keeping a local network copy of app downloads, system updates, iCloud data, iBooks purchases and the like. Once one iPhone downloads a newly purchased app or goes on to synchronize documents in iCloud, the caching service will automatically save a copy of the file on its hard drive and the rest of your devices can look to the local macOS Server running the caching service to download it rather than downloading it from the internet. This speeds up installation and synchronization on all subsequent devices by many times! Install macOS Server on one of your Macs If you haven't already done so, you'll need to install macOS Server on one of your network Macs. You can follow our detailed guide if you need a little more help, but here is the express version. Launch the App Store application. Search for macOS Server in the search bar at the top right of the app. Click Buy next to macOS Server or if already purchased, you'll be notified that you can download it for free. Click Install. Agree to the User Agreement. How to set up the caching service Launch the Server App Select Caching under the Services listing. Optionally select Edit Permissions to determine which devices on which networks are allowed to connect to your macOS Server. Optionally select Edit Peering Permissions to select from what networks other Caching servers can be used to share data. Leave Cache personal iCloud data enabled to allow for caching of iCloud data to quickly synchronize all of your iCloud-connected devices. Click Change Location if you have a secondary storage device connected to your macOS Server to change the cache location. Click and drag the Slider or type in the Cache Size to set how much of your storage device you want to use for the caching service. Click the OFF/ON button to start the service. Restart all of your Apple devices so that they can detect the caching service running on your network. With that, your devices will automagically start using and storing data and files on your caching server. You can see what type of file and how much space is being used for each type of data populating your server. If ever you need to reset the data in the cache, you need to simply click on Reset on the caching service administration page. Any comments or questions? This is by far one of the most useful and simplest services to set up on your Apple-centric network. It's also one of the most impactful since the bandwidth and time saved can be dramatic across all of your hardware. If you have any questions or comments, leave it below! Reader comments Speed up app installs and iCloud access on your Apple devices! 1 Comment View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating darbmore When does the caching need to be reset? My Server says that the cache is full. Would be convenient if the Server removes old cache dynamically similar to how iOS works with photos and music. 0 1 week ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Tony Bramwell's stories from inside the inner circle of the band who were the biggest in the world in their heyday will recall the days when they toured Devon and played to hysterical fans in cinemas and dance halls. Music and film producer Tony Bramwell grew up in Liverpool with Beatles George, Paul, and John. His life became intertwined with the legendary band, first working for Brian Epstein at N.E.M.S. and then for The Beatles at Apple, heading Apple Films, then later as the CEO of Apple Records. Tony is pictured (far right) at a function at the Post Office Tower in London with Paul McCartney (second from left) He tells his vivid stories of the Beatles' lives on and off stage in his acclaimed book Magical Mystery Tours - My Life With The Beatles. After the band split, he became the United Kingdom's first independent record promoter, representing artists including Bruce Springsteen. He co-ordinated and promoted music for films including Harry Saltzmann's James Bond features, which included Paul McCartney's Live and Let Die. Other films included Chariots of Fire, Dirty Dancing, and Ghost. Tony will be talking about his life in film and music, including producing music videos for The Beatles, Roxy Music, The Cure and discovering the talent of Eva Cassidy. He will be at the English Riviera Film Festival on June 17 at the English Riviera Centre in Torquay.

When getting fish and chips from a takeaway on Heavitree Road, opposite Pyramids, he told the woman behind the counter but she would not believe who they were for. The audience heard just ten songs. But many are now etched into pop music history. The audience at the venue, which sat roughly where Waterstones is now on Exeter High Street, heard performances of All My Loving, From Me to You, Twist and Shout, She Loves You and I Saw Her Standing There. The show featured the Fab Four topping a line up that included the Brook Brothers, The Kestrels and Peter Jay & The Jaywalkers. In all, the Beatles played six gigs in Devon. They also visited the county as part of the filming of the Magical Mystery Tour, staying in Teignmouth and filming at locations including Burgh Island.

(Image Reuters) Apple opened its first Southeast Asia store in Singapore today, drawing hundreds of excited fans to the swanky two-storey site in the city’s upmarket shopping district. Located on the affluent Orchard Road, the new shop –easily distinguished by its iconic glass facade — is expected to be one of the most popular Apple stores in the world according to the US tech giant. Merchandise such as the iPhone and MacBook were strategically placed on display across the spacious first floor, while the upper level acted as a classroom for customers to participate in hands-on sessions. Hundreds of shoppers camped out in anticipation of the launch, while more than a thousand thronged the store soon after the doors opened, an AFP reporter observed. First in the queue was Xiang Jiaxin, a twenty-five-year-old Chinese national working in Macau who had queued for more than 12 hours overnight and planned a holiday to Singapore specially to coincide with the opening. “I am very happy and excited to be part of this. I have participated in the official store openings in Macau, Guangzhou and Nanjing,” he told AFP.

Located on the affluent Orchard Road, the new shop — easily distinguished by its iconic glass facade — is expected to be one of the most popular Apple stores in the world according to the US tech giant. Merchandise such as the iPhone and MacBook were strategically placed on display across the spacious first floor, while the upper level acted as a classroom for customers to participate in hands-on sessions. Hundreds of shoppers camped out in anticipation of the launch, while more than a thousand thronged the store soon after the doors opened, a reporter observed. First in the queue was Xiang Jiaxin, a twenty-five-year-old Chinese national working in Macau who had queued for more than 12 hours overnight and planned a holiday to Singapore specially to coincide with the opening. “I am very happy and excited to be part of this. I have participated in the official store openings in Macau, Guangzhou and Nanjing,” he said. Apple, which has a staggering $256.8 billion cash stockpile, celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. The Silicon Valley legend sprang out of Steve Jobs’ garage to reshape modern life with trend-setting gadgets. Most of its earnings come from the iPhone, which faces increasingly tough competition in a saturated market. The tech behemoth has almost 500 stores globally with more than a million visitors daily. — AFP ← Previous Crisis hit-JBS may reduce Brazil meat supplies China’s COFCO overhauls Brazil business after accounting crisis Next → You May Also Like Maiden workshop on drones set 25/12/2016 Oman Observer Comments Off on Maiden workshop on drones set Dakota oil pipeline to go ahead after Army approval 08/02/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Dakota oil pipeline to go ahead after Army approval Samsung chief Lee arrested as S Korean graft probe deepens 17/02/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Samsung chief Lee arrested as S Korean graft probe deepens Latest News 80 expat doctors to be replaced by Omanis 04/06/2017 Kabeer Yousuf Comments Off on 80 expat doctors to be replaced by Omanis Sultanate’s roads best among 5 in the world 04/06/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Sultanate’s roads best among 5 in the world Salalah gears up for khareef 04/06/2017 Kaushalendra Singh Comments Off on Salalah gears up for khareef London attackers kill seven, May says ‘enough is enough’ 04/06/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on London attackers kill seven, May says ‘enough is enough’ Facebook Twitter Instagram Load More...

BY MTHANDAZO NYONI Walter Chidhakwa The government has, through Apple Bridge Investment – a special purpose vehicle established to facilitate chrome ore exports – set prices at which it buys the mineral from local producers. Locally, chrome prices vary from $40 to $80 per tonne for lumpy chrome, depending on the grade, while chrome concentrates attract $84 a tonne. On the export market, Zimbabwe’s chrome attracts between $80 and $100 per tonne for concentrates. According to a position paper prepared by the Confederation of Zimbabwe Small Scale Chrome Miners (CZSSCM) member, Lindiwe Mpofu, the pricing structure should be aligned with global chrome ore market prices. “The pricing structure is harmful and halting export sales. We are requesting under the mandate that CZSSCM has to harmonise with MMCZ/Apple Bridge that an immediate review be conducted and moving forward, the uniform price must be aligned with global chrome ore market prices,” reads part of the paper. The paper indicates that over the past year and a half, the MMCZ/Apple Bridge arrangement has deterred international buyers due to the pricing being largely out of sync with the market. “Evidence is shown by the shockingly low number of export buyers in Zimbabwe. “This has ultimately led to the under capitalisation of small-scale miners as we are unable to execute consistent sales as the market avoids doing business in Zimbabwe due to extremely high pricing,” it reads in part. “A clear example is the current situation where global chrome prices have greatly fallen since December 2016. Despite the price drop, MMCZ/Apple Bridge continues to hold a uniform price that is far higher than the market price. “Currently, MMCZ has decided to hold prices at levels that far exceed the market prices. This has caused a halt to international trade with Zimbabwe”. For example, Mpofu said 44% chrome was priced at $175 per tonne at the mine while current trade prices of the same grade delivered to China averaged $200 per tonne. This means that a buyer is expected to deliver the chrome to a smelter in China for $25 per tonne. “The expectation by MMCZ/Apple Bridge is that all costs, including margin, are to be placed in the $25 dollar allowance,” she said. “This is not possible. $25 cannot even cover the cost of transport out of Zimbabwe, which averages $60 to $70 per tonne. “One of the causes of the high prices by MMCZ/Apple Bridge is that they have relied on chrome trading spot prices as a guide for Zimbabwe chrome prices.” Mpofu said the spot prices used related to chrome being delivered to China CIF with all costs including distributor margins required to get the chrome to the Chinese port. Mpofu said MMCZ/Apple Bridge pricing does not take into consideration the distribution costs, including margins required to deliver the chrome to Chinese ports. “Based on this pricing structure, it appears that there is an expectation by MMCZ/Apple Bridge to have only end users such as international smelters and manufacturers buy directly from Zimbabwe as they have excluded the distributor’s costs [buying houses and traders] from their price planning,” she said. The chrome client base is buying houses and minerals traders. End users such as smelters and manufacturers buy from buying houses and traders because they are the ones equipped to manage supply, reserves and quality, she said. “The market relies on traders and buying houses to efficiently distribute the supply of chrome globally. “Pricing chrome as though these important distributors of chrome do not exist has halted chrome sales in Zimbabwe. The pricing structure currently does not take into consideration the buyer’s costs or the types of buyers in the global marketplace,” Mpofu wrote. To further stress the importance of buying houses and traders, she said these distributors typically buy from multiple sources ensuring supplies in excess of the 100 000 tonne range. “These are the quantities necessary to ensure international smelters do not shut down and that there is no interruption in the supply of chrome during the manufacturing processes,” she added. “Pricing as though MMCZ/Apple Bridge expects a manufacturer to buy directly from MMCZ/Apple Bridge is not an accurate expectation. Only a distributor can manage the quantities manufacturers and smelters require at the time they require it.” Mpofu said when approached by members of CZSSCM to notify them of the pricing issue, MMCZ/Apple Bridge said they should wait the market out and not to make further pricing corrections. “This means that they are willing to halt chrome sales in Zimbabwe. In other words, they would rather earn zero tax revenue for Zimbabwe and zero sales for the small-scale miner for the next six months to a year, while hoping the prices will rise to 2016 December prices caused by chrome inventory shortages,” she said. “Halting trade by refusing to acknowledge market forces has affected the Zimbabwean small-scale miner,” she said. However, MMCZ deputy manager marketing, Masimba Chandavengerwa said they were not chasing away buyers but the challenge was the volatility of chrome ore prices. “The prices have been falling due to low uptake of chrome in China. It’s not that customers have run away and we are not chasing them away,” Chandavengerwa said, adding that even after they had told customers that they would quote prices on spot basis, they did not take a position. Chandavengerwa said prices have fallen from $160 to between $80 and $100 “and even with those prices, no customer is prepared to take a position”. “We are trying to push but customers are not there. If there is a producer who has got a customer, let him/her come forward with it and we finalise. We are there as their ambassadors. The problem is that we have middlemen who don’t care about production costs and therefore, these are the same people who are making a lot of noise,” he said. Chandavengerwa said for chrome to reach its final export destination, it takes longer and as such, due to volatility of its prices, buyers were afraid to make losses. As a solution, chrome miners recommended that MMCZ and Apple Bridge acknowledge the change in market direction and align prices to the market. During this period, the trade prices delivered to China average $225, therefore, ex-mine prices should be calculated within the range of $65-$85 for market buyers to cover the distribution and margin costs in this downward market and as prices improve, we will revert upward on price along with the market, she said. This action will serve to attract the 300-400 buyers required to re-establish the Zimbabwe chrome market. “To mitigate the current situation, we request that immediate action be taken to save our sector in the current downturn. An emergency meeting must be called to rectify the current pricing structure,” she said. “Buyers and investors are pulling out with immediate effect due to the fact that our pricing excludes the cost of distributing and moving the chrome to the final destination”. She said miners require daily gazetted pricing for chrome products aligned with the world market pricing as this was the standard practice for globally traded commodities. Mpofu said publicly published prices would also enable miners to plan their business according to the market price available. Miners minister Walter Chidakwa recently told the Chamber of Mines annual general meeting and conference that Zimbabwe will rake in $3 billion in minerals exports this year mainly due to the rebound in chrome prices on the international market. Zimbabwe and South Africa hold 70% of the world’s chrome reserves. Mandiwanzira rallies behind Zimdancehall Bona critics can go to hell, says minister No comments yet.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 28, 2017 6:37 pm Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasing becoming important, with players like Google, Amazon and Microsoft pumping millions of dollars. Related News Apple WWDC 2017: Look for signs when Tim Cook takes the stage Apple WWDC 2017: iOS 11 to Siri speaker, everything to be announced Apple WWDC 2017: Refreshed MacBooks, Siri-powered speaker, and more announcements expected Apple might be developing a new custom chipset for artificial intelligence (AI) processing, reports Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The chipset, internally known as Apple Neural Engine, will be used to handle AI-related tasks like speech and facial recognition. The chipset could be incorporated into Apple’s upcoming devices such as iPhone and iPad. Gurman writes Apple’s current devices are equipped to handle artifical intelligence processes with two different chipset: the main processor or microprocessor, and the graphics chipset, or “GPU”. The custom chipset would allow Apple to offload some processing done by the main chipset and by the GPU, allowing the company to improve battery performance on its devices. The report goes on to say that Apple plans to integrate the chip into other devices, and has even tested prototypes of iPhones with the built-in chip. That said, it makes sense for Apple as its competitors in the tech industry are increasing betting on artificial intelligence (AI) for future growth. Google, for instance, has developed its own chipset for machine learning, called “TPUs”, the second-generation version of which was announced at this year’s I/O. Similarly, Qualcomm’s latest flagship processor, Snapdragon 835, has a dedicated module for an artificial intelligence (AI). According to Apple analyst Gene Munster,”Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI. At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Over the past few years, Apple has acquired a number of companies having expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. Most recently, Apple released its first AI research paper, which focused on machine vision technologies. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasing becoming important, with players like Google, Amazon and Microsoft pumping millions of dollars. It is possible that Apple could share more information about the chipset at WWDC , the annual developer conference to take place June5-9 in San Jose, California. Apple will unveil iOS 11, the latest mobile operating system, along with a new version of macOS, its computer operating system More Related News Apple set to expand Siri, taking different route from Amazon’s Alexa Apple expands Swift Playgrounds, its educational coding app to robots, drones For all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple No Comments.

And it made me wonder what else would change, if we kept watching. Would Google keep adding detail? And would Apple, like Google, also start making changes? So I wrote a script that takes monthly screenshots of Google and Apple Maps.1 And thirteen months later, we now have a year’s worth of images. The screenshot comparisons in his post perfectly demonstrate Google's iteration and Apple's relative stagnation. Speaking from personal experience, Google Maps has considerably improved in my area in the past year, while Apple Maps has remained essentially the same. Which isn't to say that Apple Maps is bad – Google simply has an edge over local business information and they're evolving at a faster pace than Apple. To me, Apple Maps looks and feels nicer; Google Maps seems smarter and it has modern features I'd like Apple to add. I wonder what Apple has in store for WWDC and if they should consider separating Maps from their monolithic software release cycle in the summer. (See also: O'Beirne in May and June 2016.)

If rumors are any indication, however, it seems that not only would the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 live up to the hype, it would also enter the market far earlier than expected. The Cupertino-based tech giant’s tablet sales have been in a slump for years now, with interest in slates decreasing as smartphones get larger displays. Apart from this, numerous users of Apple’s iPads have opted to keep their devices for years, which translated to lost sales and revenue for newer models. Things were shaken up a little bit, however, with the introduction of the iPad Pro series, comprised of a 12.9-inch model and a smaller, slightly more advanced 9.7-inch variant that was released early last year. The two iPad Pros were an entirely different breed of tablets, in the way that they are targeted toward the enterprise market and power users. With hefty specs and a couple of advanced accessories, the iPad Pro series has been dubbed by Apple as the next big thing in personal computing. So far, however, the limitations of iOS has limited the iPad Pros’ potential, and both the 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch variants have pretty much become niche devices. iPad Pro 2 & Apple Pencil 2 concept renderings. #Apple #iPad #iPadPro2 #ApplePencil2 #Concept #Rendering pic.twitter.com/2wTJW4GCTN —  iDesigner (@AppleiDesigner) May 9, 2017 If rumors about Apple’s 2017 tablets are any indication, however, it appears that the Cupertino-based tech giant is preparing to pull out all stops to ensure that 2017’s iPad series would be serious competitors in the computing industry. According to speculations, Apple would be doing this by releasing four tablets this year, a budget device, a refresh for the 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch Pros, and a new 10.5-inch device that would incorporate numerous advances never before seen in an Apple tablet, according to a MacWorld report. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro is rumored to be released with a similar form factor as the 9.7-inch iPad variant. For this to happen, Apple would need to decrease the size of the 10.5-inch iPad’s bezels radically. Over the past few months, renders of the upcoming device have emerged with concepts depicting a full-screen iPad. Considering that the feature might be exclusive to the iPhone 8 this year, however, there is a good chance that the 10.5-inch iPad Pro would still feature a classic Home Button, albeit with far smaller bezels as its predecessors. First attempt at a concept for the iPad Pro 2. With same edge to edge design as iPhone 8. Never done this before. What do you think? pic.twitter.com/K7outWaM3s — Tailosive Tech (@tailosivetech) May 7, 2017 One thing that has struck Apple fans is the rumor that the 10.5-inch iPad Pro would be equipped with the most advanced display that the tech giant has ever released for a tablet. According to a PC Advisor report, developers have found references to 120fps displays in Xcode, which has been interpreted widely as Apple fitting the 10.5-inch slate with a screen that has an impressively quick refresh rate. The current 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPad Pros have 60Hz displays, which, while capable enough for conventional applications, still lags at times when using the Apple Pencil to create content. With a 120Hz display, however, even the most taxing graphics applications would be handled by the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 with ease. Of course, the critically acclaimed, yet surprisingly rare True Tone display that is found in the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is expected to be fitted on the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 as well. The feature, which automatically optimizes the display depending on the ambient light, has received nothing but praise from consumers and critics alike. Despite this, however, Apple has yet to release another slate with the advanced feature. Thus, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro might very well be the device that would debut the feature once more. If rumors prove accurate, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 would see a release this coming June, during Apple’s WWDC 2017. While the tech giant has not confirmed the launch, noted Apple analysts such as KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo have stated that the chances of the tech giant revealing the 10.5-inch flagship slate on the developers’ conference are very high. Pricing for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 remains unknown, though speculations are high that the device would start at around $699 for the base 32GB model.

Climate Deal Decision Watch These NSFW Deadpool Bloopers While We Wait For The Sequel How To Abandon iOS And Switch To Android David Nield May 30, 2017, 6:30am ⋅ Filed to:  android apple fieldguide google ios mobile Share Having guided you through the not-all-that-straightforward process of switching from Android to iOS, we're back to tell you how to go in the opposite direction. (Make your mind up will you?) Going from Apple-powered devices to Google's platform is either ridiculously easy or rather taxing, depending on your current setup. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Do you Google? Good news if you're already heavily invested in the Google ecosystem on your iPhone. You can switch to Android in an hour or two and keep your evening free for seeing friends or browsing Netflix. Otherwise, better cancel those evening plans. Those of you who spend all your time in Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Maps for iOS can simply install those apps on your brand new Android device, sign in using your Google account credentials, and pick up where you left off. The same applies for Google Photos and Google Drive. Google Drive can handle contacts and calendars for you. Image: Google Unlike Apple, Google doesn't have a dedicated app to help you defect to its mobile OS, but it does have a website with a lot of the information you're going to need: essentially you're instructed to use Google Drive to copy over contacts, photos, videos and calendar entries, which we'll cover in more detail below. If you're thinking about switching from iOS to Android in the future, or like to swap mobile OSes on a regular basis, then Google's cloud-centric services make the task much easier — so your best off keeping all your data there. By contrast, the only official Apple app you can get on Android at the moment is Apple Music. Messages and emails Extricating yourself from iMessage is perhaps the biggest challenge facing those jumping ship to Android. iMessage doesn't work on Google's platform, and there's no way to export all your message history into a comparable Android app. You're going to have to say goodbye to iMessage, but you can at least ensure a clean break. As soon as you know you're making the move go into your iOS and navigate to Messages in Settings and turn iMessage off, then go to FaceTime in Settings and turn that off too. Apple's full instructions are here. If you have some precious iMessages or plain old SMSes you can't leave behind, you'll need to rely on third-party software and some rather convoluted processes to back it all up. iSMS2droid promises to import messages from an unencrypted backup you made in iTunes on your computer into Android. If you don't need the backup on your phone, then PhoneView (macOS) and CopyTrans (Windows) are two of many tools that will let you browse your old missives to your heart's content. It's goodbye to iMessage. Image: Screenshot As for emails, Apple's system supports IMAP, so you can carry on checking your iCloud emails through Gmail on Android if you're not having a fresh start and giving up your old email address completely. Tap the drop-down arrow on the Gmail app menu, choose Add account, and follow the configuration instructions provided by Apple. It's the same process if you're using any other kind of email app on your new Android device, like Outlook from Microsoft. The only requirement is that it supports the popular IMAP protocol. You have a couple of other options if putting your iCloud account directly into Gmail doesn't appeal. You can have all your Apple iCloud emails automatically forwarded to your new Gmail address, by going into iCloud Mail on the web and setting up forwarding — you can even delete the originals after they're passed on. Alternatively, you can export all your old emails using Mail on a Mac just in case you ever need them again, then close down your Apple account. Contacts and calendars As long as you just want to make a one-way, one-time switch from iOS to Android, then Google Drive for iOS makes the process of moving contacts and calendars over simple enough. Once you've got the app installed on your iOS device, open the menu then tap Settings and Backup. Choose the data you want to transfer across to the equivalent Google accounts, tap Start Backup and you're on your way — everything from iOS and iCloud gets picked up. Make sure you're on wi-fi, and the iPhone is plugged in during the switchover. Also note, that any previous backups you've done will be overwritten. macOS can help make switching calendars easier. Image: Screenshot If you want a two-way sync, which you might if you're using your Android phone with an Apple laptop, then it's a lot more complicated. The best option, really, is to switch to using Google contacts and calendars as much as you can, and then adding your Google account to the relevant apps in macOS (Add Account from the main app menu in both cases). Even then you need to make sure you're always adding events to the Google calendars (or contacts) and not the iCloud ones for them to show up on your phone. If you absolutely must keep both Google and iCloud services running concurrently, and syncing with each other, then you'll need to put your trust in a third-party app for macOS or Android. Photos and videos Since Google Photos came into the world it's actually pretty easy to get all your personal photos and videos moved over to Android, via Google's servers, as long as they're all still on your iPhone: Install Google Photos for iOS, opt to back everything up, and away you go. You can either pay Google for storage and keep everything at full resolution, or accept some resizing (images max out at 16 MP, videos at 1080p), and store as many photos and videos as you like on the web, free of charge. The process is even more straightforward if you use the Google Drive app as we described in the section above, and Google Photos even supports Live Photos these days, using those extra few frames of animation to create a GIF for you. The only negative is that the albums you've created in iOS don't get copied over (everything appears as one long list of pictures), so you need to create them again. Google Photos can transfer images and videos. (Image: Google) All that is easy enough but if you've got photos in iCloud you've moved off your iPhone then you might have a problem or two on your hands. As we explained in our full guide to the topic of switching between Apple Photos and Google Photos, just about the only option open to you is downloading them all from iCloud to a macOS or Windows machine then uploading them again using a Google Photos client. It's a little convoluted but it's manageable, and it's a lot easier than using the export options in iCloud on the web, which are practically non-existent. If you don't have a computer to act as the middleman between iCloud Photo Library and Google Photos then you're stuck — you'll have to borrow a laptop from someone. Music and movies As we now have Apple Music on Android, getting your iTunes music on your Android device is no longer the exercise in frustration it once was. As far as tunes you've actually purchased directly from iTunes, it's probably the best option out there, though you do need to have signed up for an Apple Music subscription to be able to use the app and get at your purchases. Otherwise, it depends on where your music is and how it's stored. Any plain old MP3s you were syncing to your iPhone from iTunes can be uploaded to Google Play Music instead (50,000 of them can be stored for free), or you can use something like DoubleTwist, which is just about the leading choice if you want to keep on using iTunes alongside Android for your music. If you're signed up for Spotify you just need the Android app. Apple Music, now on Android. Image: Screenshot Likewise, if you've been accessing all your movies and TV shows through Netflix, Plex or Google Play Movies & TV then you just need to find and install the relevant app for Android and you're ready to go. All these services let you stream to multiple devices from a single account, so you can carry on using your iOS device if you need to. However, any videos you've purchased from iTunes won't run on Android at all — there's just no app to do it unless Apple ever gets around to making one. Several tools out there will do the job of removing iTunes DRM for you, but since we're getting into murky legal territory with that, we'll leave you to discover them for yourself. If you've invested hundreds of dollars in an iTunes digital library then you can still watch it on macOS, Windows, and the Apple TV, but not Android. Apps and games Generally speaking, all the apps you use on your iPhone are going to be available on Android as well, though there are a few exceptions — like Overcast and Day One. In terms of paid-for apps, you're going to have to pay for them all again, unfortunately, though something like a Spotify subscription buys you access on both Android and iOS. Whether all your data (from documents to saved games) moves over with you is another matter and worth checking up on before you make the switch. If you're in any doubt, get in touch with the developer directly to see what the situation is (you might be out of luck with anything that relies heavily on the iCloud storage system). Some paid-for iOS games, like Alto's Adventure, are free to play on Android. (Image: Noodlecake Studios Inc) We can't give you a guide to everything out there, but think about your productivity, fitness, and banking apps. Assess how much data is stored locally and what's going to happen to it. If you can, keep your old iPhone and new Android phone running alongside each other for a while until you're certain everything's been moved over successfully without too many bumps in the road. You might not believe it if you've read everything that's above, but moving from iOS to Android is actually much easier than it used to be, thanks mainly to an increased focus on cloud services (even, belatedly, from Apple itself). As long as you take your time, and don't live your life inside iMessage, you don't have to feel daunted by the task.

It would constantly hassle and nag me to create a gmail and convert my custom domain google account into an alias. No thanks. All major phone OS support exchange or imap, if you use it for syncing your emails, calendar and contacts it doesn't matter what phone you buy, or if you lose your phone, you will always get them back. Don't get suckered into ANY walled garden whether it be Apple, Google, or even your ISP's email (especially the awful pop3 options). They all exist to keep you as a customer and make moving inconvenient, without offering any real benefit. I have moved from iOS, to Windows Phone, to Android and back to iOS without going through any of the bullcrap in this article, because I set up exchange email/contact/calendar sync from the very beginning on my first smartphone. Now with Windows 10, all the exact same things are synced live. Just make sure your photos are backed up, especially if they're the only place you have 4000 photo's of your children, and you're free of the shackles Apple and Google hope to restrain you.

Not once has android ever asked me to convert my custom domain to a gmail service. Try again. Any gmail account is required to use the app store. Gosh, who would have thought just like Apple. Don't get suckered into ANY walled garden whether it be Apple, Google, or even your ISP's email 100% agreed.

Some devices can benefit quite a bit from root and customisation, particularly those afflicted by bloat or lower end hardware. Some software relies on root to work. The vast majority of users don't need it and probably don't even know what it is. Reply 0 mark_d @mark_d May 29, 2017, 11:48am Why do iPhone users have to root the phones by their owners? Why does iPhone need to be scanned by anti-virus/anti-malware software? Reply 0 carln @carln May 30, 2017, 1:18pm My phone is rooted to be able to do real app backups: particularly for moving Google Authenticator between devices. 99% of the time I don't need it rooted, but on those rare occasions when I need elevated privileges then it's what I need. Most Android phones are not rooted. Most Android devices also don't need to be scanned by anti-virus/anti-malware software, but the much lower level of curation that Google applies to the app store means that it is more likely that malicious apps can reach Google Play than the Apple App Store. Of course, it also means Google doesn't block satirical or political apps seemingly arbitrarily either (see https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/apples-struggle-with-political-app/?_r=0). With the improving permissions models on Android, the impact of malicious apps is somewhat reduced. However, because Android device manufacturers are almost uniformly hopeless at providing updates for any reasonable length of time Android devices are much more likely to be vulnerable. In general, Apple devices are more secure over a long period. I say this as an Android user. Also, don't imagine that there are no malicious apps on the Apple App Store (http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34338362 http://fortune.com/2016/03/16/malware-infect-apple-iphone-ipad/ http://www.computerworld.com/article/2498560/security0/researcher-plants-rogue-app-in-apple-s-app-store.html) so don't get too comfortable on your high-horse, assuming you're not adhered to it. Also, iPhone is no longer the innovation leader in phones that it once was. Reply 0 Irina Guest May 29, 2017, 2:20pm Hi David! Irina from CopyTrans here. Just wanted to stop by and thank you for mentioning CopyTrans Contacts in your article. Take care :) Reply 0 coldarmyman @coldarmyman May 29, 2017, 3:19pm having spent 20k on the itunes store over the years (movies and tv shows) not having the ability to use my entire catalogue on android has stopped me. oh and google photos app is the worst. i left it updating 10000+ photos on wifi and a week later it still had not finished Reply 0 soldant @soldant May 29, 2017, 3:48pm Really? It's not fast (few of them are in Australia, I think OneDrive is probably one of the better ones myself) but it's still way better than iCloud Photos, which has the most ridiculous syncing system ever. Reply 0 lunchbox99 @lunchbox99 May 29, 2017, 3:55pm Yeah totally ridiculous how you just take photos and they magically appear on your tablet or laptop/desktop (windows or mac). Such a hassle. Reply 0 soldant @soldant May 29, 2017, 4:34pm You can't selectively sync though, and it still keeps a local copy that chews up local storage. There's no way to really control it. One of the best parts of syncing is the ability to move stuff off local storage (especially given how absurdly expensive storage is on iOS devices). Reply 1 joshuaholmes @joshuaholmes May 30, 2017, 9:31am You can save space- iCloud Photo Library keeps all of your photos and videos in their original, high-resolution version. You can save space on your device when you turn on Optimize Storage. Reply 0 soldant @soldant May 30, 2017, 10:12am But it still stores a vast bulk of photos locally and there's no real way to control what it does or doesn't keep. It's vastly inferior to Google Photos or OneDrive. It could be easily fixed but Apple went for a strange system and ended up with something that only gets it half right. Reply 0 lunchbox99 @lunchbox99 May 29, 2017, 3:54pm Wtf? You spent $20k on itunes? You must have rocks in your head...lol. I thought I went too far buy $300 worth of itunes cards at 25% off sale to get music. At least the music files are DRM free. Reply 2 Join the discussion!

Here's what they had to say. NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

Smartwatches have finally stolen the lead in wrist-based gadgetry. Photo / 123RF Wearable technology is not just about counting your steps any more. Smartwatches have finally stolen the lead in wrist-based gadgetry, overtaking fitness bands from the likes of Fitbit and Xiaomi. And, just as in smartphones, it's Apple, Samsung, and Google vying for the most sales ... and space on your wrist, according to news.com.au. Former market leader Fitbit is not going down without a fight, however, plotting to deliver its own fully featured smartwatch later this year. The fitness-focused company suffered a serious drop in popularity this year, according to Canalys, plummeting 30 per cent and selling just 2.9 million devices. By comparison, Apple claimed top spot with 3.8 million Apple Watch sales, up 25 per cent on the same time last year. Canalys analyst Jason Low said additional fitness technology, phone features, and even fashionable accessories were making a smartwatch upgrade more attractive to buyers. "Water resistance, Bluetooth music streaming, and built-in GPS are becoming more relevant as runners and other fitness enthusiasts forgo the bulk of a smartphone," he says. "Just as we continue to see feature phone users upgrading to smartphones, basic band users find smartwatches to be a justifiable upgrade because of their additional (features)." Continued below. Related Content Google cozies up to China with AI secrets and an ancient board game Matt Suddain: What will your life be like in 10 years' time? Apple needs the 'iPhone 8' to succeed more than ever Telsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi says Australians bought more than two million wearable gadgets last year, and 37 per cent of those were smartwatches. He predicts that percentage will grow to half of all wearable devices this year at the expense of fitness trackers. One of the biggest drawcards of using a smartwatch in Australia, Fadaghi says, is its ability to be used like a credit card at the checkout. More than half of Apple Watch users have used Apple Pay, according to Telsyte's survey of 1060 Australians, and more than 70 per cent use it often. "Once users get over the initial barrier of raising a smartwatch to a payment terminal, they start to use it regularly, indicating it might be a critical application for smartwatch retention," he says. But Apple is not the only company to see a rise in smartwatch fortunes. Strategy Analytics found Samsung claimed 19 per cent of the smartwatch market between January and March, narrowly beating Google's Android Wear watches for the first time. But even the most pessimistic analysts aren't counting Fitbit out yet. The company is reportedly preparing to launch its own smartwatch in spring, codenamed Higgs, with leaks suggesting it will have a square screen, GPS chip, heart-rate monitor, payment technology, and four days of battery life. Rumours suggest it has struggled to introduce waterproofing and initially had problems with its GPS antenna, however. CCS Insight wearable technology analyst George Jijiashvili says pitting itself against the vast resources of Apple and Google will be a big ask, and Canalys research analyst Mo Jia says Fitbit's smartwatch will need to be something special from day one. "Its new smartwatch will need a good reception if Fitbit is to turn its fortunes around and return to growth in 2017," he says. - news.com.au Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Here's Why the Best is Yet to Come for Skyworks Solutions, Inc. This Apple supplier could still have room to run after its recent rally. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 27, 2017 at 3:00PM It's been a great year for Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), which supplies power amplifiers, front-end modules, and RF chips to a wide variety of markets. The company has soundly beat top and bottom line expectations for four straight quarters, and its stock has rallied more than 60% over the past 12 months. But looking ahead, Skyworks could still have room to run for five simple reasons. 1. Apple's upcoming iPhone Skyworks supplies its chips to the mobile, automotive, broadband, wireless infrastructure, home automation, industrial, and military markets. But its biggest customer by far is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which contributed 40% of its revenues in fiscal 2016. Image source: Apple. This makes Skyworks a great supply chain play on the upcoming iPhone 8. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Aaron Rakers estimates that Apple will sell 224.7 million iPhones this year and 250.6 million units in 2018 -- which would represent an impressive rebound from its first annual decline in 2016. 2. Content share gains in newer smartphones As the technology in smartphones improves, the number of power amplifiers, front-end modules, and RF chips per device increases. For example, an iFixit teardown of the iPhone 6s revealed two Skyworks components inside, while the iPhone 7 teardown found four components. Just over a year ago, Skyworks reported that it had a content share of $1 to $2 per 3G device, more than $3 per 4G device, and over $5 per "advanced" 4G device. But during last quarter's conference call, CEO Liam Griffin declared that certain high-end 4G devices were "approaching $8 to $10 in value," spurred by the growing use of its SkyOne, DRx technology, and DC/DC technologies. Huawei, in particular, notably packed ten Skyworks modules into its latest Honor smartphones: Image source: Skyworks' Investor Presentation. 3. Better connections equal bigger content share gains The main theme here is that fancier smartphones on faster networks will constantly boost Skyworks' average content share per device. The smartphone market may seem saturated today, but Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) Mobility estimates that the total number of mobile smartphone subscriptions worldwide will still rise from 3.9 billion in 2016 to 6.8 billion in 2022. Within that total, Ericsson expects 4G/LTE subscriptions to rise from 1.9 billion to 4.6 billion, and for 5G subscriptions to grow from nothing today to 540 million. This represents a huge long-term growth opportunity for Skyworks, as smartphone volumes grow and its content share per device increases. 4. The Internet of Things is expanding But over the next few years, Skyworks expects its dependence on Apple and other smartphone makers to wane as the total number of connected devices across the Internet of Things (IoT) surges. Skyworks believes that there will be over 25 billion connected devices worldwide by 2020 -- a figure which would easily dwarf the smartphone market. That growing market includes wearable devices, connected cars, drones, smart speakers, home automation devices, and headsets for augmented and virtual reality applications. Its modules are already used in stand-alone 4G smartwatches like Samsung's Galaxy Gear 3, connected cars like the new Jaguar F-Type, and Alphabet's Google OnHub router and smart home hub. Image source: Skyworks Investor Presentation. 5. Growing margins, profits, and revenues The RF module market generally isn't considered a high-margin one, but Skyworks' gross margins have gradually expanded over the past few years as it scaled up its operations. Source: YCharts That margin expansion, along with robust gains in shipment volumes and content share, are expected to boost the company's top and bottom lines for the foreseeable future. Analysts expect Skyworks' revenue to rise 11% this year and another 10% next year. On the bottom line, its earnings are expected to rise 13% this year and another 14% in fiscal 2018. Should you buy Skyworks today? I previously highlighted Skyworks as one of the best Apple supplier plays on the market, and I still stand by that assessment. It's also a solid long-term play on the Internet of Things market. To top it off, Skyworks' current P/E of 22 is lower than the industry average of 26 for semiconductor makers, and it pays a forward dividend yield of 1.1%. I believe those facts make Skyworks a compelling buy at current prices, but investors should still fully evaluate the risks -- like an unexpected drop in iPhone sales or emerging competitors in the RF space -- before buying any shares.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Some Great News for Apple Inc.'s iPhone 8 A report from a seemingly credible source indicates that Apple's iPhone 8 will have this ultra-cool feature. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 27, 2017 at 1:10PM The early leaks around Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 suggested that the company planned to integrate its Touch ID fingerprint scanning technology directly into the phone's display. This integration would allow Apple to retain its much-loved Touch ID technology, while nearly eliminating the bezels on the front of the phone. In recent weeks, however, rumors have circulated that Apple might -- due to manufacturing difficulties related to the in-display Touch ID sensor -- drop this feature, instead opting to either eliminate Touch ID or use a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner on the iPhone 8. Image source: Apple. Per a new report from Economic Daily News, summarized by DigiTimes, Apple will, indeed, go with a fingerprint scanner embedded in the display. What's the source? DigiTimes' summary of the Economic Daily News article says that this information comes from "sources from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)." Investors may know TSMC as the manufacturer of some of Apple's A9 processors and all its A10 chips found inside of current iPhone models, but TSMC is also believed to be the contract manufacturer for Apple's current Touch ID sensors. Given Apple and TSMC's successful collaboration on Touch ID technology for previous generations of iPhones, it makes sense that the former would continue to work with the latter on future Touch ID technology. Furthermore, since it is likely that TSMC will be manufacturing Apple's next-generation Touch ID sensor technology, it makes sense that individuals working at the contract chip manufacturing giant would know all about the Touch ID technology that'll be used in the iPhone 8. Great news for Apple, if true! If this information is true, then it seems like a clear win for the company. Apple's iPhone 6s-series didn't sell as well as the iPhone 6-series did, and it doesn't look like the current iPhone 7-series will live up to the iPhone 6-series' greatness, either. With the upcoming iPhone 8, Apple has an opportunity to drive iPhone unit shipments and revenue to record highs, as the design is expected to be all-new. While it wouldn't have been impossible for Apple to have a great iPhone 8 cycle with a compromised Touch ID, I do think the lack of Touch ID, or a rear-mounted Touch ID, would have turned quite a few potential buyers off from buying the device. Not only is a Touch ID sensor embedded directly into the display likely to be much more pleasant to use than a rear-mounted Touch ID sensor, but such integration would be a really "cool" feature that increases the sense of technological wonder of the new device. Remember that while smartphones have become so integrated into many of our lives that they've virtually become necessary products to own, Apple must both convince current iPhone users to upgrade to newer iPhones, as well as try to get owners of Android smartphones to want to switch to the iPhone. With Touch ID integrated into the display, coupled with all the other rumored features and design changes that'll be coming to the iPhone 8, there seems to stand a good chance of driving Apple's iPhone revenue to new heights after a few disappointing product cycles.   Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Weekly Rewind: 'Game of Thrones' is… Weekly Rewind: 'Game of Thrones' is coming, 'Twin Peaks' returns, Bond's best rides By Lulu Chang — Updated May 27, 2017 9:32 am Subscribe Share Helen Sloan/HBO Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: A lot can happen in a week when it comes to tech. The constant onslaught of news makes it nigh impossible for mere mortals with real lives to keep track of everything. That’s why we’ve compiled a quick and dirty list of this week’s top 10 tech stories, from the best of James Bonds’ cars to the future of the Apple MacBook — it’s all here. Apple joins the race to 5G, applies to test experimental technology Just about every major mobile carrier in the United States is hard at work on 5G wireless technology in advance of its launch (hopefully) in a few years’ time. Meanwhile, device makers have to be sure their products will be ready for the network when that day comes. Apple is seeking permission to begin testing 5G technologies for that very purpose, according to a report from Business Insider. Although 5G specifications have not been entirely hammered out yet, we know the FCC approved the 28GHz and 39GHz bands for commercial 5G use last year. These are the same ones mentioned by Apple in its testing application. The 28GHz band, specifically, is meant for ground-to-space transmission, and Apple has reportedly hired engineers with experience developing satellites ahead of testing. Read the full story here. Sir Roger Moore, the longest-serving James Bond actor, has died Roger Moore, the actor with the longest run as British superspy James Bond, has died at age 89. The news of Moore’s death was confirmed by his children — Deborah, Geoffrey, and Christian — in a statement posted on Twitter. The actor’s death was attributed to cancer, and his family indicated that he died Tuesday, May 23, in Switzerland.  Born in South London in 1927, Moore was the oldest actor to take on the role of Ian Fleming’s famous secret agent. Already well-known to American television audiences due to his featured roles in the medieval adventure series Ivanhoe, the Western series Maverick (in which he replaced James Garner during the show’s fourth season), and the popular British series The Saint (which became a hit in syndication in the United States), Moore began his run as James Bond in 1973’s Live and Let Die at the age of 46.

The world’s largest floating solar power plant just went online in China China has announced that the largest floating photovoltaic (PV) facility on earth has finally been completed and connected to the local power grid. Long reviled for its carbon emission record, this is the Chinese government’s latest achievement in its ongoing effort to lead the world in renewable energy adoption. Located in the city of Huainan in the Anhui province, the 40-megawatt facility was created by PV inverter manufacturer Sungrow Power Supply Co. Ironically, the floating grid itself was constructed over a flooded former coal-mining region. Read the full story here. Would Apple dare kill the MacBook? Yeah, it might What if Apple announced the Mac’s retirement? A huge swath of the company’s devotees would be furious … but is it truly an impossible scenario? To many, the MacBook has long been the gold standard for luxury laptop computers. But as Apple’s business interests continue to change over time, the importance of the device’s established user base has become less and less relevant to the company. Apple has enjoyed incredible success thanks to the iPhone and several other wildly popular products — and as a result, the company is poised to do whatever is deemed best for its long-term future. Few of its rivals would kill off such a cash cow, but Apple has no fear of making bold moves forward, even when it means leaving some of its fans behind.

There are countless examples of iconic imagery sprinkled throughout the James Bond saga, but perhaps none is more memorable than 007’s choice of transportation. During his lengthy tenure at MI6, Mr. Bond and his adversaries have had the pleasure of driving a wide array of vehicles, ranging from stunning Aston Martins to weaponized submarines to combat aircraft. Then there were some have embraced the oft campy nature of the British spy films, and it is those automotive oddities that we’d like to focus on here. Read the full story here. B&O Play gets crafty with its newest product, a music-infused beer Danish audio experts B&O Play, quirky fun-loving sister company to the more serious Bang & Olufsen, has revealed a new music product. It’s not a Bluetooth speaker, nor a pair of gorgeous headphones. It’s a beer. Not just any beer, but one infused with music played through the Beoplay A1 speaker. Don’t check your calendar, it really is the end of May, and not April 1. Now that we’ve established this isn’t a joke (at least, we don’t think it is), here’s what you should know about what’s being called the Beobrew. B&O Play worked with craft brewery Mikkeller to investigate the effect music has on how beer tastes. We imagine a fair amount of beer was consumed before this question was asked in the first place. To find out, a Beoplay A1 speaker was connected to a classic third-generation iPod Nano, and submerged into a fermenting tank over the course of a two-week period.

After eschewing the usual production schedule to get the right weather to finally allow winter to come to Westeros, the show’s season 7 premiere was pushed back until summer. In the meantime, we’ve had to obsess over any and all pieces of information we can find. The season is going to be a crazy one — even for Game of Thrones — as the stakes have never been higher now that the series finale just 13 episodes away. There are already interesting storylines in progress, from Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) seating herself on the Iron Throne to Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) coming to make her claim on the crown on the backs of her dragons. The great game could play out in so many ways, and it is going to be fascinating to watch it develop. Prepare yourself with everything we know so far — but be warned that there are spoilers ahead.

Wish you could spend the Memorial Day weekend tending your very own garden? A new Kickstarter project may be able to help with both of these desires. Billing itself as the World’s Smallest Garden, it promises to bring the joy of gardening to your home — even if you live in a tiny, top-floor apartment where the closest thing to wild vegetation is the leftover stir-fry in your fridge. The World’s Smallest Garden is a small cylindrical device you place in the top of a regular bottle, transforming it into a self-watering herb garden in seconds. Read the full story here. New ‘Twin Peaks’ episodes answer some ancient questions, pose many new ones There is a certain humor in Twin Peaks devoting one of the first scenes of its revival to a man staring at a glass box, waiting for something, anything to appear in it. Like the audience, that man — Sam Colby (Ben Rosenfield) — stares at the box, unsure how long he must wait for something to happen. David Lynch, back in the director’s chair, takes his time with the scene, with long cuts back and forth between Sam and the box, the only sound a faint hum. The buzz of an intercom, piercing the silence, gives a greater jolt than most horror movies could hope to. In the age of on-demand shows and binge watching, Lynch establishes that these new episodes of Twin Peaks will not provide quick satisfaction. These first two installments wander from place to place, story to story, briefly visiting old characters and introducing new ones. In New York, Sam maintains his vigil over the box. In South Dakota, police find the severed head of librarian Ruth Davenport in her bed, a scene that hearkens back to Lynch’s Mulholland Drive. And back in the town of Twin Peaks, Deputy Chief Hawk (Michael Horse) looks into a cold case: the disappearance of Special Agent Dale Cooper. Read the full story here.
Digital Trends Home > Apple > Apple is reportedly working on a dedicated AI… Apple is reportedly working on a dedicated AI processor for its devices By Christian de Looper — Updated May 26, 2017 7:32 pm Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Apple is working on a chip designed specifically for artificial intelligence, which means your iPhone could soon learn a whole lot quicker than it already does. Apple is looking to expand its horizons, and it seems as though those horizons could soon include more artificial intelligence. According to a report from Bloomberg, the company is working on a chip designed specifically for artificial intelligence. The chip is reportedly known internally as Apple Neural Engine, and will essentially improve how devices like the iPhone handle tasks that might otherwise need human intelligence to work properly. In other words, your iPhone could soon learn a whole lot quicker than it already does. Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important, but the likes of Amazon and Google seem to have gotten a head start on Apple. This new chip, however, could push Apple’s products onto the cutting edge of artificial intelligence technology — and could also power other new technologies, such as augmented reality and self-driving cars. There’s no word yet on when the chip could be officially unveiled — but when it doe,s it will go up against other, similar products that companies have already unveiled. Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon chips, for example, do have a dedicated module specifically for artificial intelligence, while Google has the Tensor Processing Unit, which works in Google’s own data centers to power some of its new services with built-in artificial intelligence. It’s possible aspects of Apple’s new AI chip could be discussed at its Worldwide Developers Conference, which is coming in early June. If not, the company may still talk about AI in general, especially considering how important the concept has become for large tech companies over the past few years. Apple will unveil iOS 11, its latest and greatest mobile operating system, at the show, along with a new version of macOS, its computer operating system. We’ll have to wait and see if Apple does eventually unveil an AI-specific chip — but one thing is for sure: AI will continue to be a major focus for Apple and other tech companies for the foreseeable future.

Officially known as Apple Orchard Road, the store is the latest of Apple’s next-generation retail stores, feature design elements like a large, all-glass front, open spaces to be used for community-focused events such as Today at Apple, tree planters inside, and custom wood furniture. The store’s design and interior were first revealed earlier this week when Apple finally had the barricades removed after months of work. At 10:00 AM on Saturday the store was opened to the public, with a significant crowd waiting outside. Apple’s senior vice president of retail, Angela Ahrendts, was present at the opening to welcome visitors and take part in the celebration with staff. An unbelievable morning on Orchard Road. So touched by the warmth and passion of everyone who joined us today. #AppleOrchardRoad pic.twitter.com/wYi9jVG9k9 — Angela Ahrendts (@AngelaAhrendts) May 27, 2017 After spending almost two years in the planning stages, Apple Orchard Road has come to life as two-story outlet featuring a curved staircase that features design elements borrowed from the new Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino. Upstairs guests will find the Genius Grove and gathering area for Today at Apple sessions, while the bottom floor has plenty of tables showcasing the company’s many products and accessories. The @Apple store at Orchard Road opened its doors to the public on Saturday (May 27) at 10am. https://t.co/R7c3HyUhHn pic.twitter.com/crj3seNcmU — TODAY (@TODAYonline) May 27, 2017 Part of Apple’s goal with redesigning their stores is to change the public’s perception of the locations as simply places to buy Apple products. Ahrendts has said that they want Apple stores to be viewed more as meeting spots, much like Starbucks, or as places where interesting events take place, with friends wanting to check it out together.

Two weeks ago we posted a report titled "AI Wars are almost reaching Fever Pitch with new Home Devices and Apple Fans look to WWDC 2017 for Apple's Response." One of Reuters latest reports makes the same point about the activity surrounding AI in the tech sector.   A new Reuters report quotes a statement by research firm CB Insights about the AI frenzy: "A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc's Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple, Facebook and Intel respectively."   The companies noted in the report declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company's recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data.   Apple is focused mainly on the retail/consumer sector while AI is ripping through all sectors of technology. Nvidia's Tesla P100 AI GPU was just adopted by IBM who see's this GPU as a game changer for the AI revolution.   Intel is going full tilt into into AI and made one of their largest acquisitions ever to gain Israel's Mobileye for autonomous vehicles. And the Reuters report today points to Ford Motor spending a billion dollars on Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams ag Google and Uber Technologies.   Large acquisitions aside, Apple never talks about their plans or projects. We know for a fact that they have a Project Titan team resides in Ottawa Canada in an industrial park that houses a research team from BlackBerry developing an autonomous vehicle OS and Apple is hiring as many of BlackBerry engineers that they can for their carOS efforts. You can't be developing an carOS for autonomous vehicles without a connection to AI. So while we don't know at what stage Apple is at, it's assured that one of their AI projects is related to Project Titan. One of their major AI acquisitions was Vocal IQ, a company that had a major focus on a digital assistant designed for the autonomous car.   I remember the unveiling of Apple's iPhone in 2007 which set off the mobile revolution which was an amazing time to see unfold. The AI revolution is not yet here. All we see is the preparation for the AI revolution, but for now it's just tiny baby steps coming to market in the form of Home devices and elementary digital assistants.   So many industries are banking on the coming 5G networks to help ignite the revolution and that's only three years away. So time will tell if that's when the starting gun for the AI Revolution truly fires.Yet whenever it does, we'll get to behold one of the most interesting times in history unfold. The AI revolution will of course dwarf the mobile revolution in shear scope covering every major market sector from the consumer, to the enterprise, to vehicles, to home automation, robotics and far beyond. It's a wonderful time to be alive.  For more on this, read the new Reuters report titled "Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI smarts."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

International Search Search aerospace and defenseOculus Founder Palmer Luckey Is Working on a Defense Startup Entrepreneur3 Questions You Should Ask Yourself Before Quitting Your Job trump budgetWhat the U.S. Loses If Trump Eliminates AmeriCorps CybersecurityBritain PM Theresa May Calls to ‘Regulate Cyberspace’ And Critics Are Going Ballistic Drones Why the World’s Best Consumer Drones Aren’t Just “Made in China,” They’re Designed and Developed There Too Clay Chandler May 27, 2017 I try not to get drawn into debates about whether Chinese companies can innovate. It's a ridiculous question and invites nasty stereotypes. Plus, if I hear one more genius invoke the iPad to justify his claim of American tech superiority I think my head will explode. You probably know the argument I mean. It goes: Sure, the iPad is manufactured in China but that doesn't matter because Americans design such awesome devices and brilliant operating systems that they add most of the value and capture most of the profit. (You'll find data to support the Apple "value-added" argument here and here.) I don't deny Apple's success. But it doesn't prove Chinese companies can't innovate, or that there aren't a lot of advantages to being heavily involved in both the design and manufacture of your products. Consider the case of another increasingly popular electronic gadget: consumer drones. In that category, the global leader isn't from Silicon Valley or any other Western economy. It's a Shenzhen-based company called Da-Jiang Innovations Science and Technology Co. (DJI). DJI claims 70% of the world’s market for drones. Sales surged 60% to $1.4 billion in 2016. DJI's financial backers include Accel Partners, and its latest funding-round gives the little known firm a valuation of $10 billion. This week DJI bolstered its already formidable lead in consumer drones by introducing Spark, a new model mini-drone that is as small as a soda can, can be controlled by hand gestures, and costs less than $500. As recently as two years ago, there were half a dozen companies competing to produce drones in a price and performance format that would appeal to mainstream consumers. Among them: Parrot, a 22 year-old French electronics manufacturer; Lily Robotics, a San Francisco-based drone startup; and GoPro, the popular maker of portable action cameras. Parrot surrendered in January, announcing it would eliminate two-thirds of the positions in its drone division. Lily, founded in 2013, released a dazzling video in mid-2015 touting a camera drone that would follow you around and could be launched simply by tossing it into the air. The video attracted millions of viewers, raised $15 million in funding, and sold more than $34 million in pre-orders. But the company ran into production difficulties and burned through all its cash. In January 2017, Lily shut down without shipping a single unit. GoPro had a well-known brand and a solid following among outdoor adventurers. In 2015, GoPro executives announced plans to release an small, affordable drone called the Karma by spring of 2016. But the release had to be pushed back until November and then, only days before launch, delayed again because malfunctions caused the Karma drones to lose power and fall from the sky. Karma was eventually released in February. DJI was founded in 2006 by Frank Wang, a Hangzhou native studying engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Its first product, the Phantom quadcopter released in 2013, was for enthusiasts and professional photographers. Late last year, the company launched a smaller, more portable consumer drone called the Mavic Pro that was priced under $1000 and delivered on features rivals had only promised. The Mavic Pro can fly for about 30 minutes on a single battery charge and has a range of 7 kilometers. It offers a 4K video and yet is is small enough to fold up and put in a book bag. The best thing about the Mavic is its unique software that enables it to detect obstacles mid-air and avoid crashes, and automatically return to "base" if runs low on power. The product drew rave reviews from customers. This essay was originally published in our CEO Daily Newsletter. Subscribe. DJI executives cite their location with the manufacturing ecosystem of southern China's Pearl River delta as critical to their success. The company has its own manufacturing facilities. Engineers can test prototypes in neighboring facilities, speeding product development. DJI can recruit from a large pool of engineering talent. They can't imagine trying to manage all that from a research park half a world away. Spark, the new mini-drone, is a classic example of Chinese innovation. It has a range of only 2-kilometers and can stay aloft for just 16 minutes. But it offers many of the same software features as the Mavic, and can be controlled by hand gestures, a big plus for beginners. (Read TIME's Spark review here.) Spark's rollout prompted analysts at the Motley Fool to declare: "GroPro's Karma is Now Dead in the Water." Smug assumptions about China's "inability" to innovate deserve a similar fate.

Nevertheless, shares initially jumped more than 12% after the report as the semiconductor and sensor specialist has potentially landed an important design win with a major smartphone customer. Why Himax can land a spot at Apple As it turns out, Himax has received a large order commitment from an unnamed customer for its wafer-level optics (WLO) sensors. Rumors suggest that this could be Apple as the next iPhone is expected to feature 3D sensing technology, so Cupertino could be tapping Himax to supply the 3D scanners. Image source: Himax Technologies.  Back in March, noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the next iPhone's front camera will come equipped with AR capabilities and advanced facial recognition. What's more, the front camera is also expected to take 3D selfies and scan 3D objects. Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan believes that Himax could become the supplier of choice for Apple given its progress in WLO technology (via Barron's): Today, Intel's RealSense 3D camera has enabled 3D sensing in PC/tablet platforms. Himax's wafer-level optics (WLO) technology can further reduce the size and fit the 3D sensing in smartphones. Now, Himax has been dropping subtle hints regarding the uptake of its WLO products. Earlier this year, the company pointed out that it will spend between $50 million and $55 million to enhance its WLO and liquid-crystals-on-silicon (LCOS) capacity. More specifically, Himax had pointed out that the "WLO technology is adopted by our customers to enable new things such as 3D depth scanning," so it was already preparing for a production ramp to meet an anticipated jump in demand. Now, a design win at Apple has probably encouraged Himax to boost investment in this area. The semiconductor specialist will spend $80 million to build new WLO capacity this year with a major ramp slated to begin in the third quarter. In fact, Himax believes that it will witness "explosive revenue growth" once this technology goes mainstream, and the company is already collaborating with leading OEMs to achieve this goal. Why a place in the iPhone will be big for Himax Himax Technologies has struggled to increase revenue in recent quarters, while its margin has also been on the decline as some of its AR customers have decided to scrap current-generation products. Data by YCharts. A design win for the next iPhone will bring about a much-needed boost to its financials. Chan believes that 20% of Himax revenue will come from 3D sensing products in 2018. Consensus estimates place revenue growth at 14% in fiscal 2018 versus a 6% decline this year. The turnaround makes sense if Apple ends up manufacturing approximately 100 million units of its next-generation smartphone. That will deliver significant top line gains to Himax, and the adoption of its 3D sensing products will also have a positive effect on the bottom line since they carry higher margins.

Now the electronics giant is bringing AI to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, a person familiar with the matter said. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way Apple devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence, such as facial and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that has not been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc in the booming field of AI. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and cofounder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Apple devices handle complex AI processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding AI processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc’s Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling AI tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit, last year. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that is to be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. Apple has tested prototypes of new iPhones with the chip, the person with knowledge of the matter said, adding that it is unclear if the component will be ready this year. The company’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photographs application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload AI-related tasks, the person said. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. This story has been viewed 2116 times. Comments will be moderated.

So, is he a chip off the old block? The music video for “The Apple” seems to indicate he is! An apple dangles from a tree branch, opening up the video as Max demonstrates his more than capable chops with a frenetic spotlight drum fill to kick the song off. “The Apple” takes on a djenty sound with undulating, downtuned rhythms accented by turntable scratching. Brutality is unleashed in the form of multi-tracked vocals, exploring bowel-churning growls before transitioning into a gleaming, clean-sung chorus. “Our new album incorporates many different styles from metal to prog. ‘The Apple’ shows the heavier side of the band while still having a melodic chorus,” Next to None stated as a collective. With a diverse sound, they can fit on a variety of different bills and recently wrapped up their first-ever European tour with labelmates Haken, who have been gathering considerable buzz around their sometimes quirky, but brilliant brand of progressive metal. With dates booked in June and early July, Next to None will share the road with Mike Portnoy as the legend has a series of dates booked with Shattered Fortress, the name he’s given to the lineup that was assembled to perform Dream Theater‘s “12 Step-Suite.” Portnoy has insisted that Shattered Fortress is an “event,” not a new band or project. Next to None’s sophomore record, Phases, will be released on July 7 through EMP Label Group (North America), which is headed up by Megadeth bassist David Ellefson, and InsideOut Music (Europe). Pre-orders for the album can be placed here where fans can explore both physical and digital options.

However there have been some photos that surface that suggests that maybe Apple might simply move the fingerprint sensor to the back. However that might not be the case because in a report from DigiTimes, it seems that TSMC themselves might have confirmed the embedded fingerprint sensor. For those unfamiliar with TSMC, they are one of the chipmakers for Apple’s A-series of chipsets. The report claims that TSMC had told their sources that there are a number of design changes to the iPhone 8, and that one of those changes is an embedded fingerprint sensor. That being said, DigiTimes doesn’t exactly have the best track record when it comes to Apple related rumors, so take it with a grain of salt for now. So far based on the feedback we’ve seen, many are disliking the possibility that the fingerprint sensor could be placed on the back, just like how many reacted negatively to Samsung’s choice of a rear-facing fingerprint sensor. In any case we’re probably still several months away from hearing about the iPhone 8, but here’s hoping this information is accurate! Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors.

Located on the affluent Orchard Road, the new shop -- easily distinguished by its iconic glass facade -- is expected to be one of the most popular Apple stores in the world according to the US tech giant. Merchandise such as the iPhone and MacBook were strategically placed on display across the spacious first floor, while the upper level acted as a classroom for customers to participate in hands-on sessions. Hundreds of shoppers camped out in anticipation of the launch, while more than a thousand thronged the store soon after the doors opened, an AFP reporter observed. First in the queue was Xiang Jiaxin, a twenty-five-year-old Chinese national working in Macau who had queued for more than 12 hours overnight and planned a holiday to Singapore specially to coincide with the opening. "I am very happy and excited to be part of this. I have participated in the official store openings in Macau, Guangzhou and Nanjing," he told AFP. Apple, which has a staggering $256.8 billion cash stockpile, celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. The Silicon Valley legend sprang out of Steve Jobs' garage to reshape modern life with trend-setting gadgets. Most of its earnings come from the iPhone, which faces increasingly tough competition in a saturated market. The tech behemoth has almost 500 stores globally with more than a million visitors daily. Aside from Singapore, its Asia shops are located in Hong Kong, China and Japan. A regional transport, business and financial hub, Singapore attracted 16.4 million visitors last year.

Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has acquired 11 AI start-ups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., and Intel Corp., respectively. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a start-up that specializes in working with unstructured data. Ford Motor The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co. invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. Start-ups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and start-up communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps, said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare start-up Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors recommendations. For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies, said Forward CEO Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate. AI companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, CEO of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the firm in 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc. and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” he said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. A company with a specialised mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,” Mr. Gundotra said.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Two Older Apple Office Buildings in Cupertino were Temporarily Evacuated due to a Gas Leak | Main | Major Tech & Industrial Companies Race to Acquire AI Startups as the AI Revolution Draws Nigh » May 27, 2017 Our Report covers Major Patent Troller Uniloc Filing 3 Lawsuits against Apple and a Video taking a Peek at the 'Patent Scam' Industry   The patent troll known as Uniloc USA filed four counts of patent infringement against Apple in June 2016 and another three counts in April 2017 covering iOS 7's Frequent Locations Feature and more. On Friday, Uniloc USA and Uniloc Luxembourg filed three more patent infringement lawsuits against Apple covering battery charging, AirPlay and Auto Dialing.   This is what professional patent trolls do for a living. They don't make a product that they're defending; they're just suing rich companies like Apple, over and over and over again for profit.   The Patent Scam   The video below is titled "The Patent Scam." A documentary is reportedly in the works, but for now, Austin Meyer tells us of his run in with Uniloc and touches on Apple being sued by this patent troll. It's a very interesting video if you're not a fan of patent trolls.   In December Patent Apple posted a report titled "The Patent Case of the Decade Could End Most Patent Troll Litigation in Eastern Texas Courts against Apple & others." Last Monday the Supreme Court decision was handed down with an 8 to 0 ruling that argued that patent infringement suits can only be filed in the jurisdiction where the target company is incorporated which is bound to hurt the infringement industry in Eastern Texas.   The battle against patent trolls continues with a new tactic in trying to get state laws to change to limit 'attorney-owned' patents. Ars Technica reported that "Cloudfare the CDN and Internet security company, has gone full berserker-mode in its fight against patent-holding company Blackbird Technologies" and they're fighting back. The company is giving away T-Shirts like the one below for anyone who provides them with a legitimate entry of prior art.   Uniloc v. Apple   In their first patent infringement case against Apple we learn that they're using an HP patent. The lawsuit states that "Uniloc USA is the exclusive licensee of patent 6,661,203 with ownership of all substantial rights therein, including the right to grant sub-licenses, to exclude others, and to enforce, sue and recover past damages for the infringement thereof.   HP wouldn't sue Apple directly because it would be bad for PR for something as ancient as charging batteries on devices. But surely they must have known that selling the rights to their patents to a patent troll would result in hurting competitors and falling back on them as being just as guilty.   Uniloc notes that Apple's iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and MacBooks incorporate rechargeable batteries having a temperature sensor that their patent licensed patent covers and therefore infringe on "their patent."   They note that Apple has directly infringes at least claim #1, as noted below:   "An apparatus for charging a battery comprising a charging circuit for providing a charging current to the battery; a temperature sensor positioned to sense a temperature of said battery; and a controller coupled to said temperature sensor and said charging circuit and operable to control said charging circuit in accordance with said temperature, said controller operable to set said charging current to zero when said temperature is higher than a first predetermined threshold value."   Apple's customers who use such devices in accordance with Apple's instructions directly infringe claims 1, 8 and 16 of the '203 Patent.   In one aspect of the "The Prayer for Relief" they want the court to award them "damages suffered as a result of Apple's infringement of the '203 patent."   They licensed the patent for the purpose of suing. What "damages suffered" are they talking about? They don't make a phone, tablet, watch or notebook using a rechargeable battery. The damages are purely one of financial gain. How can the courts not see that? It's crazy and a failure of the patent office, the courts and government for not stamping out patent trolls licensing patents only for the sake of hurting companies who actually hire people, make products and contribute a value to society. The nonsense of protecting IP is for most cases a con's argument. I'm sure others will disagree.   Patently Apple Presents the Uniloc USA, Uniloc Luxembourg S.a. v. Apple Inc Court Filing - May 26, 2017 by Jack Purcher on Scribd The patent infringement case presented in today's report was filed in the Texas Eastern District Court. The Presiding Judge in this case is noted as being Judge Rodney Gilstrap. At present, no Judge has been assigned to the case.   The second patent infringement case against Apple covers Airplay using patent 6,580,422 (an HP patent), while the third case covers Auto Dialing using patent 7,092,671 (a 3Com patent).    Notice: Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of certain legal cases/ lawsuits which are part of the public record for journalistic news purposes.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Science & Health Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Nokia 9 to give iPhone 8 a run for its money: What we know so far Nokia 9 is expected to boast of the best technology currently available in the market, giving iPhone 8 a run for its money. Raymond Ronamai   May 27, 2017 21:05 IST Nokia 9 codenamed 'Unknown Heart' reappears on Geekbench with Snapdragon 835 and 8GB RAM There is no doubt that Apple iPhone 8 is one of the most-awaited devices of this year. Apple fans look forward to it and gadget lovers can't ignore it, as it doesn't fail to fine takers in the market. However, it may face a stiff challenge from an unlikely competitor – the Nokia 9. All eyes are on HMD Global's flagship Nokia 9 as the brand has come to life again when it announced the Nokia 6 earlier this year and then the Nokia 3, Nokia 5, and Nokia 3310 after a lull. It is expected to be released either in July or August, perhaps along with the Nokia 7 and Nokia 8. Also read: Most-awaited devices in second half of 2017: Nokia 9, iPhone 8, Galaxy Note 8, OnePlus 5 Going by the reports and leaks that we have seen so far, the Nokia 9 will be feature rich with the best currently available in the market. It is expected to sport a 5.5-inch QHD OLED display with a 1,440x2,560p screen resolution, powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, and run an Android 7.1.2 Nougat operating system. The device is also expected to feature a 6GB RAM, a 64GB/128GB internal memory (with microSD card slot), a 22MP PDAF with Zeiss optics, a 12MP front-snapper, and a 3,800mAh battery with Quick Charge 4.0 support. It could be priced at $700 / €750. On the other hand, Apple is expected to release three variants of iPhone 8 – a regular iPhone 8 with 4.7-inch display, iPhone 8 Plus with 5.5-inch screen, and a premium version with 5.8-inch display – by the end of the third quarter of this year. All the variants are expected to have an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screen, and powered by an A11 chipset. It is also expected to feature a wireless charger, virtual home button, 3D depth-sensing front camera, new fingerprint ID solution, and wireless charging feature. Reports have claimed that it could come with a price tag of $1000 though not confirmed. Looking at the expected pricing, the Nokia 9 and iPhone 8 belong to different categories but their specifications say a different story. Some of the features in the Nokia 9 are likely to be superior than Apple's upcoming flagship, so it is almost certain that it will give its rival a run for its money.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: What to Expect From Analog Devices’ Q2 Results Analog Devices' upcoming report will shed more light on its Apple relationship. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) May 27, 2017 at 9:54AM Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) have done well this year despite rumors that Apple might drop its chips from the next iPhone. Last month, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said in a research note (via Barron's) that the chipmaker could lose its Force Touch socket in Apple's upcoming iPhone due to cost cuts. Though others doubt this and Analog Devices investors are apparently not worried as the stock is currently trading close to its 52-week highs after logging 13% gains so far in 2017. What should investors expect when Analog Devices releases its second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on May 31? Image Source: Analog Devices  Revenue and earnings are set to rise Wall Street expects Analog Devices' revenue to rise 41% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, which is significantly higher than the $910 million midpoint of the company's own guidance given in mid-February. But Analog should meet analyst expectations thanks to the Linear Technology acquisition that was completed in March. The Linear Technology acquisition is expected to contribute between $160 million and $170 million in revenue during the second quarter. But the interesting thing to note is that Analog is on track to achieve strong double-digit organic revenue growth as its factory automation, automotive, and consumer businesses are gaining robust traction. What's more, the terrific year-over-year jump in Analog Devices' revenue is estimated by analysts to push its earnings to $0.84 per share as compared to $0.64 per share in the prior-year period. But investors will be more concerned with the company's outlook as it will provide concrete signs regarding its Apple relationship. Gauging the outlook Analog Devices reportedly gets 12% of its overall revenue from Apple by supplying the Force Touch solution for iPhones. So, a potential loss of content at its biggest customer would definitely hurt its top line. But not everyone is convinced Analog Devices will lose out. Fool contributor Ashraf Eassa, for instance, says Analog Devices should retain its spot in the next iPhone given that Apple is going all out to pack the next iPhone with cutting-edge features. And analysts expect Cupertino to charge a heavy premium for the next iPhone. For instance, UBS believes that pricing will start at $870 and could go all the way up to $1,070, thanks to features such as wireless charging and an edge-to-edge screen. This indicates Analog Devices shouldn't lose its spot due to cost concerns as Apple allegedly plans a high price and won't want to exclude a popular feature. A design win in a higher-priced iPhone that some expect to ship 130 million units in 2017 would be a big deal for Analog Devices. But Apple isn't the only catalyst that Analog Devices investors should be looking out for as the company's automotive and industrial businesses are growing at a fast clip. Industrial is Analog Devices' biggest end market, with 41% of total revenue, and it is getting better thanks to the growing demand for factory automation solutions. In fact, Analog's factory automation sales jumped 15% during the first quarter, and it is likely that the trend will continue as this market could grow at 6.6% a year until 2024, according to Transparency Market Research. Meanwhile, Analog Devices is attacking the self-driving car opportunity with its Drive360 autonomous driving product. The company is primarily focusing on radar solutions that are crucial to the operation of driverless cars, so it is not surprising to see its automotive revenue increased 10% year-over-year during the first quarter and now accounts for 14% of the total. Investors, shouldn't be surprised if Analog Devices' outlook turns out to be stronger-than-expected thanks to a possible Apple boost and secular growth in the automotive and industrial markets.

Despite facing off against those bigger competitors, Roku has been steadily winning the battle for your living room. The streaming hardware company cites Nielsen numbers showing that, as of December 2016, Roku accounted for 48% of the active streaming players in the U.S. (with Amazon, Apple, and Google all trailing behind). Roku currently boasts roughly 14 million active accounts—up 40% year-over-year—and the company says its users streamed 9 billion hours of content last year, a 70% increase from the previous year. The company also posted its highest annual revenue in 2016, reaching $400 million, and sales already topped $100 million in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. One thing that helps Roku stand out is the fact that, unlike many of its biggest rivals, the Los Gatos, Calif.-based tech company relies solely on deals with outside content producers. In other words, Roku doesn't make its own original programming, in contrast with Amazon, Google's YouTube, and others. That means it can stay neutral when it comes to carrying streaming apps and the content it markets to users. Related AppleBozoma Saint John Leaving Apple, Report Says Apple Bozoma Saint John Leaving Apple, Report Says As Roku's user base has climbed, the company's focus has shifted somewhat, from selling hardware to generating additional revenue by selling advertising to its many content partners. Advertising and content distribution comprised roughly 75% of Roku's gross profit in the most recent quarter, up from a little over 50% last year, says CEO Anthony Wood, a Silicon Valley veteran and a former vice president at Netflix. Roku also has the backing of a handful of major players in both media and tech, with nearly $210 million in reported funding so far from a list of investors that includes News Corp, Viacom, 21st Century Fox, and Netflix. (Wood disputed reports from February suggesting the company was working on a $200 million funding round, telling Fortune that Roku is "well capitalized" at the moment.) Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Wood recently spoke with Fortune about competing with tech giants in the streaming hardware market, how user data and targeted ads are the "future of TV," and what the evolving landscape of streaming content means for companies like Roku. (The following conversation has been edited for clarity and length.) Fortune: You currently have the largest market share in the U.S. for streaming devices over companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google. How can you maintain that position and keep growing? Wood: If you look at the market share, it has been growing. We had our biggest market share ever in Q1—not just players, also televisions. 48% of active streaming players in the United States are Roku [according to Nielsen], and that number hasn’t changed in about a year. The other half is split between Amazon, Google, and Apple. Our market share is growing fast. It’s growing 40% to 45% active accounts year-over-year and that’s on a big installed base: 14 million active accounts. That comes from players and TVs. We released the Roku Express at the end of last year at $29 and it’s now our number one player. And, last year, one in eight TVs sold were powered by our OS [operating system]. This year, we expect it to be almost one in five TVs—almost 20% of the Smart TV market this year will be powered by our operating system. Roku Ultra— Courtesy of Roku  Roku has been described as "Switzerland" in the streaming devices market because it's content-neutral. How does that strategy help you stand out versus bigger rivals who produce and distribute their own original content? Having a strategy of carrying as much content possible and the most content definitely is a big part of our strategy and works well for us. And we can do it because we’re an independent company. We’re not vertically integrated like our competitors where they can’t carry each other’s content. So we have Amazon Instant Video and Google Play, for example. And, more importantly, we have built the only proprietary operating system for TV. We have the only purpose-built OS for TV and it’s got lots of advantages: it’s better for partners, it costs less to build TVs with our own OS, it’s a better consumer experience, and it has more content. So, I guess we shouldn't expect to see any Roku original programming anytime soon? [Laughs] You’d have to have a lot of scale, even more scale than Roku [with 14 million active accounts]. We have reasonably large scale and are growing quickly, but Netflix has 100 million accounts. So it makes sense for them to do original content. It doesn’t really make sense for us. You mentioned the success of the relatively new Roku Express. How important are those low-cost devices (including Google's Chromecast and Amazon's Fire TV Stick) to the market versus more expensive set-top boxes? What low-cost does is it brings more customers into streaming. That’s one of the things that we saw with the Roku Express is it was so inexpensive that people who hadn’t streamed before said, "Oh, well I’ll give that a go." And, then as they say, "I love this," then I think there’s a decent chance they will, at some point, upgrade to a more expensive product with more features. With that said, the vast majority of unit retail sales are sub-$50 price points. Most of the market is below $50. It’s one of the main reasons Apple is last in market share for streaming players. We have focused on great value for customers from the beginning as a way to gain market share. We introduced the first $100 streaming player. We introduced the first streaming stick, the first $29 player. We have a strategy of driving prices down to make the product more accessible to consumers. Because, for us, hardware is not a business, it’s a way to acquire active accounts. Our business is advertising and content distribution services. Roku Express— Courtesy of Roku  A big part of the advertising platform is tracking what users are watching to compile and analyze that data for targeted ads and content recommendations. It’s super important. The future of TV—both with content distribution and advertising—is based on data and machine learning. And it’s a huge competitive advantage to be good at that. I just want to clarify that the ACR [Automatic Content Recognition] program is opt-in for our customers. We don’t just force it on them, although it has a very high opt-in rate because we have some very cool features that they get access to that are powered by that data. One of those features is called "More Ways to Watch." If you opt in to the ACR data feed—let’s say you’re watching The Big Bang Theory on CBS—it will pop up with an overlay and say "Hey, you’re watching The Big Bang Theory, do you want to watch it from the beginning?" Because it’s available on CBS All Access and also you can watch all of the back episodes, so it gives them more ways to watch that TV show. There are lots of privacy issues around data that we have to be careful about, but it really delivers a much better end-user experience. When it comes to video content, does Roku root for companies like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon to upend the entertainment industry because it means more people are streaming content and that's good for device-makers? Or, at this point, is most content streaming at some point anyway? The big picture is one of the big drivers of our growth is when more content comes to streaming. Like you said, there’s been an explosion of streaming content. There’s not much you can’t get, if anything, streaming. So, in that sense, we’re completely neutral. We don’t really care. We want to offer our customers choices. I think one of the biggest advantages of streaming, for customers, is that it’s created competition in the TV business, which used to be controlled by a few big distributors and that’s really changed. So, that has resulted in lots of choice for customers: the choice of more content, the choice of not having to watch ads if they don’t want to, they can pay extra or they can sign up for Netflix, or whatever. So that’s all good. I guess we’re not really in anyone’s particular camp. Our biggest focus is just bringing on as much content as we can and keeping our UI [user interface] simple. One of the challenges with a simple UI when there’s so much content is how do you make it easier for customers to find what they want to watch in that sea of content. What are some ways that Roku helps customers manage the deluge of content? We were the first company to offer universal search, so you can search for a program and find out how much it costs and where it’s available and we sort results by price. Another example is we came out with a feature called My Feed, which allows you to follow shows you’re interested in and you’ll get notifications when new episodes come out. What are your thoughts on the proliferation of live-TV streaming services? If they succeed in drawing more consumers away from traditional cable packages, isn't that a game-changer for online content and streaming devices? We’re super positive on those services, because they’re bringing more content to the platform, they bring more people to streaming. We have business deals with all of those services, they buy audience development products, so it’s driving a big increase in our business. But, the dynamics are interesting. They often have overlapping content, so there’s going to be a lot of competition between them. And, I think that will result in better value for the customers. Personally, I am not sure how popular repurposing a linear cable network will be in a streaming environment. Certainly, it's in the millions the number of customers who want it. But is it 100 million, like Netflix? I think that’s an interesting question: whether people have changed the way they want to watch content and what content they want to watch.

It started with Siri, the digital assistant baked into iOS, that was waiting for me the moment I fired up my iPhone SE for the first time. But now Google is moving in on Apple's turf by releasing an iOS version of Google Assistant, its own take on a helper powered by artificial intelligence. Illustration: Tom's GuideAnd Google Assistant isn't even first app angling to replace Siri as my go-to iPhone helper. Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant, has been available for iOS devices for more than a year. Downton Abbey doesn't have this much help scurrying about. But which assistant should you turn to for help with everything from sending texts to getting answers for your burning questions? The correct choice seems obvious enough that you wouldn't even need a voice-powered assistant to help you figure it out. Siri is integrated into iOS, so you would think it has the edge over any Johnny-come-lately assistant vying for a space on your iPhone. MORE: 33 Hidden iOS 10 Features You Need to Try And you'd be right for the most part. Siri is extremely convenient, as it's just a Home button press or a "Hey Siri" command away. But Google Assistant for iOS has a few tricks up its virtual sleeve to make the competition closer than you would assume. Here's how Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana measure up as your go-to assistant on the iPhone. Ease of Use Let's start out with the category where it's no contest. Siri is, by far, the easiest to use since Apple integrates it into iOS, and you can summon the assistant from anywhere. Just make a long press on the Home button or say "Hey Siri" — provided you've enabled that feature in Settings — and Apple's built-in assistant springs to life. With Google Assistant and Cortana, you've got to launch those apps before you can ask either one for help. That's an extra step that seemingly negates the convenience of having an assistant on hand. Google Assistant at least throws in a few handy features to make using the app on an iPhone worth your while. When it answers your questions, Google Assistant will also offer up tappable actions that can dive deeper into what you want. (A question about an upcoming Oakland A's game might yield panels that can call up MLB news or the standings.) You can switch to a keyboard for those times you don't want to bark out a request to Google Assistant in public. And Google Assistant ties in rather nicely with other Google apps like Photos and Gmail if you have those on your iPhone. Cortana tries to take on more of a day planner role, with a panel of recommended articles pulled from Bing, the current weather conditions, and an email assistant that alerts you to urgent messages (if you tie-in an email account, that is). Another panel can also show you what traffic's like on your morning commute. As handy as it is to have this information in one place, it seemingly mirrors the Today screen on iOS 10, which I can reach simply by swiping right from my Home screen. Update: There is another way to access Google Assistant and Cortana, though it won't add voice-enabled controls and you'll still have to unlock your phone. You can add a widget for either assistant to the Today screen. Just scroll to the bottom of your Today screen, and tap the edit button: if Cortana or Google Assistant are installed on your phone you can add them to the list of Today screen widgets. Really, both widgets are just glorified shortcuts to accessing the app, but it's better than nothing. Winner: Siri. It's hard to beat an assistant that's immediately accessible when it comes to ease of use. Making Phone Calls Having to dig through your contacts to dial a phone number is drudgery. Better to have an assistant do the grunt work for you, and Siri is tops at this, thanks to its direct line into iOS 10. Tell Siri to call a contact, and the call gets placed immediately. (One complaint: If that contact has both a work and home number, Siri won't always stop to ask you which.) Both Cortana and Google Assistant will dig up phone numbers from your contacts, but you've got to hit the call button yourself to make the call. All three assistants are equally adept at looking up phone numbers such as the number of that nearby pizza place that offers takeout. Only Siri lets you then call with a voice command, though I like the fact that Google Assistant summons up additional information like directions to the place you've just looked up. Winner: Siri. Again, the iOS tie-in gives Apple's assistant the edge. Sending Messages Whether it's sending an email or text, Siri's dominance continues. I could dictate a text message to my wife without ever having to touch — or even unlock — my iPhone. Things get complicated if Siri mishears you and you need to edit the message, but at least Apple's assistant asks you if you're ready to send the text or email before it fires off an error-ridden missive. Google Assistant will happily take dictation on a text message, but you have to tap a button on the screen to send it. It will do the same for mail, provided you've got the Gmail app on your iPhone. I don't — instead I've tied my Gmail account into the built-in Mail app on iOS, but Google Assistant wouldn't take a message there, instead prompting me to download Gmail. Cortana's even less adept with messaging. Ask it to send a text or email, and it will pull up a blank message with the contact filled in, but you've got to do the actual typing. At least, Cortana doesn't require a specific mail client. When I told it to send an email to my wife, it pulled up a message with her contact info filled in — and from my Gmail account no less. (That is when Cortana was able to understand me: three times out of five, it misheard my wife's last name and left the contact info blank.) Winner: Siri. There's no better choice when it comes to hands-free communication. Looking Up Answers At some point during the day, you're going to come up with a burning question you're just dying to answer, but you don't want to endure the vagaries of a web search to find what you're looking for. So which of the assistants available on your iPhone does the best job at tracking down those answers? I asked four questions of each assistant: How many cups are in a pint? What's the longest river in Europe? What day is Christmas on this year? What's the weather like this weekend? Google Assistant was the only one to successfully answer all four questions, though it stumbled a bit when it came to Christmas. (When I phrased the question as "What day is Christmas this year?" Google Assistant told me the date for 2016; only when I rephrased it to "on this year" did Google Assistant produce the right answer. Siri got three of the four questions right, and even threw in a touch of personality on the Christmas question. ("I hope you get the day off," Siri added.) But asking Siri to name the longest river in Europe produced the dreaded "I found something on the web" response where Siri lists a series of search results. Cortana could tell me that the Volga River is the longest in Europe, but was flummoxed about Christmas, asking to see my calendar. Even when I granted permission, it couldn't find anything. Maybe Cortana's just not the celebratory type. Winner: Google Assistant. Google's knowledge graph means fewer virtual shrugs from its digital assistant. Asking Follow-Up Questions Sometimes you don't always get all the information you need with your first question. So how well do Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana deal with follow ups? I asked all three iOS assistants to tell me the score of the Giants game, and all three complied. Then I asked "Who are they playing next?" Siri and Google Assistant dutifully listed the next Giants game on the schedule; Cortana brought up a page of web results, most of which featured upcoming soccer matches. All three assistants also were able to rattle off the stars of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 when I asked. Only Google Assistant, though, successfully listed nearby theaters when I followed up with "Where is it playing?" Siri didn't understand the question; Cortana gave me another list of search results, led off by the definition for "playing." Winner: Google Assistant seems more adept at picking up on the context of your questions, even vaguely worded ones, than the other two assistants. Playing Music We're back in Siri's wheelhouse, at least when it comes to controlling music playback. You can use Siri to play songs, pause them or fast-forward to the next tune, all without ever opening the Music app. Siri can sometimes stumble on song titles — when I asked it to play "Desperado," it thought I wanted to download the 1995 Robert Rodriguez movie as opposed to listening to the Eagles standard. But for the most part, Siri's a great way to access whatever tracks you have stashed in your library. Asking for a song or album in Google Assistant would bring up links to either the Music app or YouTube. Tapping the Music App link would take me to Music, but nothing would play unless I searched for that track in the app. Why even bother with an assistant at that point? As for Cortana, it would either find videos — usually of someone showing you how to play that song on a guitar or keyboard — or links to purchasing that song on Grove or Amazon. Winner: Siri. The other two assistants have no ear for music. Getting Directions Your preference here is likely going to come down to which Maps app you prefer. Ask Siri for directions to a locale, and you'll be given turn-by-turn directions in iOS's Maps. (Funnily enough, asking Cortana for directions takes you to Maps, too.) Google Assistant, on the other hand, will send you to Google Maps, assuming you have that app installed on your phone. Google Assistant seems to do a better job at understanding the names and places of where you want to go. I asked Siri for directions to my daughter's elementary school, which is named after the artist Maya Lin; Siri thought I wanted to go to Myland Park Elementary School, plotting out the 2600-mile journey from my house to Morgantown, West Virginia. Using Google Assistant, I could also summon up alternative directions in Google Maps, like taking a different bridge to reach the San Francisco Airport instead of the Siri-mandated Bay Bridge route. MORE: iOS 10 Maps vs. Google Maps: Which Guides The Best? Winner: Google Assistant recognized my speech more accurately, and the Google Maps tie-in negates Siri's home-field advantage on the iPhone. Making Reservations Ask Siri to book you a table at your favorite and more often than not, you'll get an apologetic message that it can book a table right now. To Siri's credit, it will offer to help you call the restaurant to book the reservation yourself. To Siri's detriment, it has a hard time making sense of difficult restaurant names like the nearby German eatery Speisekammer (which Siri hears as "Spice a Comma). Cortana is even more inept at making dinner reservations, flat out refusing to book a table. If it understands the name of the restaurant, it will bring up an information page where you can place a call to reserve your own table. This is where Google Assistant really shines. I asked to book a table at Café Jolie, and it not only understood my horrible French accent, but walked me through the process of making a reservation using Open Table by asking me how many people were in the party and what time we wanted to eat. Winner: Google Assistant. This isn't even close. Reminders & Events Good news if you want your digital assistant to remind you of tasks, deadlines and to-dos. Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana are all equally up to the task. I told each one to remind me to turn in this story at 10 a.m. And at the appointed hour, reminders from all three assistants popped up on my iPhone's lock screen. (That I didn't file the story on time is something I'd like to blame on them but can't.) All three also do comparable jobs at setting up events on your calendar, though Siri was clever enough to know when I created an event for the first Saturday in June that I meant June 3. (This lack of a specific date flummoxed Cortana.) Google Assistant handled my calendar appointments, too, making them in Google Calendar rather than in the built in Calendar app, so your preference here is likely to come down to which calendar app you prefer. Winner: Siri, but only by the slightest of margins over Google Assistant. Other Actions Last fall's iOS 10 release opened up Siri to more third party apps, and Apple's assistant is the better for it. I can — and have — used Siri to book a ride on Lyft, and I could also ask it to send money to friends through an app like Venmo, start a chat on Skype or start a workout on Runtastic. Apple needs to broaden Siri integration to even more apps, but I suspect we'll hear more about that as soon as June's Worldwide Developer Conference. Google is promising more capabilities for Google Assistant, too, and the biggest coming feature is Google Lens integration. That will allow you to use image recognition capabilities to have the assistant summon up various commands, like buying tickets to a concert when you capture a picture of a concert poster. But that feature hasn't come to Google Assistant just yet. Winner: Siri, though it will be interesting to see how Google Lens-powered feature might change this assessment. Bottom Line As noted when we started, being built and maintained by Apple has its advantages when it comes to digital assistants. You can access Siri at any time on your iPhone as opposed to being forced to launch a specific app, and that's an edge that's difficult for either third-party assistant to overcome. Yet, Google Assistant is nearly up to the task, thanks in large part to its ability to both recognize what you're saying and to put that information in context. I particularly like the way Google Assistant can walk you through tasks like making a dinner reservation or creating a calendar event without throwing up its virtual hands and leaving you all on your own. Siri may be the best choice to act as your iPhone's virtual helper for most tasks, but Google Assistant outshines it in some areas. And hopefully, the arrival of Google Assistant on iOS will push Apple to make some improvements of its own.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: A Guide to Investing in Disruptive Technology Investing in disruptive technologies can be both tricky and enriching. Here's a field guide to making money by keeping track of upcoming trends and strong innovation. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) May 27, 2017 at 8:19AM You can get rich from investing in disruptive technology. But if it was easy, everybody would see the sea change coming and adjust accordingly, killing the disruptive new idea before it became a threat. So, how can you tell the best future innovations and unstoppable trends apart from the also-rans and the gadfly fads? I'll show you the ropes, and soon, you too will be investing in the second coming of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) long before they become game-changing giants. Image source: Getty Images. Step 1: Find a market in dire need of new thinking For Amazon, that started with an aging, staid retail sector. Big-box stores and large malls were cluttering up the American shopping landscape in the early 1990s, just as the internet started showing its game-changing muscles. Surely there must be some way to lower the capital costs of running a retail business -- perhaps by tapping into that new global network thing? Netflix reportedly started with a ridiculous late fee on a video store rental, coupled with co-founder and CEO Reed Hasting's desire to become "the Amazon.com of something." Here was another bloated, inefficient consumer market that could use a radical makeover. Apple returned from the brink of financial disaster as Steve Jobs made his triumphant return to the company he built. Way back in 1997, Jobs wanted to rebuild Apple around the idea of making "some really great products," and he had already identified several "giant holes" in the market that needed filling. iPods and iTunes were launched within four years. In 2007, iPhones became Apple's real long-term cash cow. The mobile computing market had been developing in the wrong direction from day one, and Steve Jobs had better ideas. Step 2: Track down companies that address this technology gap The next Netflix might apply a centralized, low-cost technology platform to some other business sector, creating a disruptive empire in the process. The next Apple could have fresh devices in mind for something else we do every day, like shaving or breathing. Or the next Amazon may be brewing up a next-level distribution and ordering system for -- well, who knows? Maybe you do. These companies might be tiny upstarts run out of a garage, not yet ready for the public market. Or maybe it's an older company, digging into new market opportunities to stay relevant. If you can buy shares of it, you're ready for the third step. If not, put that disruption-ready business in your back pocket and keep looking for explorers in these uncharted waters. Keep in mind that today's giants were small and easily overlooked once upon a time. Some of our current small-cap tickers will take similar paths to gigantic market caps and shareholder returns. Don't write off any ticker just because the company is too small and unknown: Company Market Cap in July, 2002 Market Cap Today Change Apple $6.7 billion $799 billion 11,800% Amazon $5.8 billion $461 billion 7,900% Netflix $386 million $67.9 billion 17,500% Data source: YCharts. Step 3: Confirm that there's a real business model in play Ideas are a dime a dozen. The real value lies in building a workable business model around your revolutionary technology. This is where you should dig into quarterly earnings releases, management's conference calls, and SEC filings of every kind. Is the disruptive idea ready for prime time, producing an operating profit right now? Great, but you may have missed a significant part of the skyrocketing returns already. Is the company low on cash and burning more of it in order to give its big idea a proper launch? Better have a plan to raise more cash as needed without drowning in high-interest debt or robbing early shareholders via dilution-boosting batches of stock sales. Remember, Netflix is burning cash right now in order to create a top-notch library of original shows with lasting value. Amazon did the same in the 1990s, on its way to creating the e-commerce colossus you see today. Even Apple reported negative cash flows for long stretches in the 1990s, and again in the early 2000s as the transformative iPod/iTunes launch was taking shape. Spend money now, reap the rewards later. Just make sure the company can actually afford the planned level of heavy spending without causing irreparable damage to the balance sheet. Some investors may prefer lower levels of risk, writing off any ticker with negative earnings and/or cash flows. That's fine, but you can't reach extreme long-term returns without accepting some financial risk. This is a judgment call. If you've read this far, I assume you're fine with a bit of (well-researched, firmly understood) risk. Image source: Getty Images. Step 4: Invest, then keep close watch as disruption hits your chosen sector Keeping an eye on the disrupted market is very important. Sure, you could place your bets on the forward-thinking champion of new technology and upside-down operating procedures, and then leave the revolution alone for years or decades. But that's gambling, not investing. The idea here is to find a strong new challenger in an established field, and then take an active interest in the market rumblings. Things can go wrong along the way, and you should always be ready to take appropriate action when that happens. Sometimes, that means selling out and never going back. Remember when BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY) was so hot, its management shrugged off the rise of Apple's iPhones because strong data security and high-quality physical keyboards would surely win the day? Co-CEO Jim Balsillie publicly thanked Apple for bringing more attention to the smartphone market but didn't see Cupertino as a threat until it was too late. BlackBerry's own disruption of mobile communications was stopped in its tracks by do-it-all Apple and Android smartphones, user-friendly app stores, and powerful marketing. Other times, a fixable stumble might open up an attractive buying window where you can double down on your best disrupting technologies. When Netflix split its streaming service apart from the red DVD mailers in 2011, the Qwikster announcement was seen as an empire-ending mistake, and share prices plunged quickly. But Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was quick to roll back the Qwikster split while sticking to the separation of DVD and streaming subscriptions. When it became obvious to informed investors that Hastings had corrected his mistakes, I tripled my personal Netflix holdings. My older Netflix investment has grown 470% larger while the 2011 cohort rose 13 times higher. The blended return is 820% -- so far. Selling out would have been a grave mistake in this case. Sitting on my hands would not have been much better. So, you have to stay on your toes, ready to get out or dive deeper as the market conditions change. The deeper you understand the disrupted market, the better equipped you'll be to take full advantage of the fundamental changes. Anders Bylund owns shares of Amazon and Netflix.

Apple's market cap entered the spotlight this week after an analyst questioned whether the company could reach a $1 trillion valuation within the next year. It preceded, however, not such good news for Apple, which saw its worldwide smartphone market share slip in the first quarter due to increasing competition out of China. Even Apple (aapl) design chief Jony Ive got into the mix this week, with news that he's taken on another job. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter As with most weeks, the past several days were eventful for Apple (aapl). And although it got some good news out of India, there are still some things it'll need to address if it is to become the first company to ever reach a $1 trillion valuation. This is Fortune’s weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week’s roundup, click here. Read on for this week's biggest Apple headlines: In a note to investors on Monday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said that he believes Apple's market cap could reach $1 trillion within the next 12 to 18 months. He said that Apple has several "levers" that could help it get there, including its fast revenue growth, an expected boost in margins, and higher earnings. Apple's current market cap is hovering around $800 billion, and if it did reach $1 trillion, it would become the first company to reach those heights. Apple owned 13.7% of the smartphone market in the first quarter, putting it in second place behind Samsung's 20.7% share, according to new data from research firm Gartner. However, Apple's market share was down from 14.8% in the first quarter of 2016, due to competition from Chinese vendors offering high-end devices at more affordable prices. Huawei, one of Apple's chief Chinese competitors, grew its market share from 8.3% in 2016 to 9% last quarter. Apple design chief Jony Ive has a new gig. He was appointed chancellor at the Royal College of Art in London this week. In his new position, Ive will serve as the head of the college and join the school's Council governing body. It's an unpaid position and largely honorary, though he did say he would advise students and employees during his five-year term. The U.S. government was actively seeking Apple data last year, a new transparency report from the company revealed. During the second half of 2016, the U.S. government issued between 5,750 and 5,999 national security orders to Apple, up from a range of 2,750 to 2,999 in the first half of the year. Apple said that between 4,750 and 4,999 accounts were affected in the orders. The U.S. government bans companies from revealing the exact number of orders and account requests in transparency reports. Apple and Nokia ended their protracted patent spat this week. The companies signed a new patent license agreement, as well as a business deal, to end the dispute. Nokia will receive an upfront cash payment and additional revenue from Apple. The iPhone maker said that it plans to expand its "business relationship with Nokia" now that the deal has been signed. The Indian government this week said that it would allow Apple to import components for its iPhone production tax free. Apple had previously requested a series of tax breaks from India, most of which were denied. The move comes just days after Apple started producing some of its iPhone SE units in India. One more thing...Apple has begun charging for trial access to its Apple Music streaming service in Australia, Spain, and Switzerland. The trials were previously free, but the company is now charging the equivalent of 99 cents in those countries for three months of access. It's unclear if Apple will be ditching free trial programs elsewhere around the world.

By: Bloomberg | Published: May 27, 2017 6:23 PM Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. (Reuters) Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved Performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. You May Also Like To Watch This: The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. J Jack Smith May 28, 2017 at 5:39 pm Apple has become the vapor ware company and it really saddens me. We hear that Apple will do a self driving car but then nothing. Apple will do a TV streaming service and we get nada! Apple will create their own cloud and even gets a code name of McQueen but nothing produced. Continue spending over 600m a year to use Google cloud and still has a large chunk running on AWS. Apple resorts to leaking something so they do not look so pathetic and we get nothing. I remember when Apple kept things secret and close to the vest and then when it was done and really something surprised us and completely blew us away and then I loved those words and you can buy it today! I have goose bumps right now. This is not my Apple any longer.

Flophone: Analyzing the iPhone 8 Video WWDC 2017: Our Top 3 Predictions When it comes to wishing for magical, iPhone-killing devices, dope springs eternal because every new device is surely the one, no matter how little you know about it. Writing for TheStreet, Amanda Shiavo adopts her spookiest voice and says “Beware Apple, Android's Founder Andy Rubin Is About to Reveal 'Something Big’.” (Tip o’ the antlers to @JonyIveParody.) Android founder Andy Rubin's new company, Essential, tweeted today that "something big" is coming on May 30 and the announcement is likely to be a new smartphone. We’re not really sure what it is but the thing we know for sure is that Apple is probably going out of business on May 31st. Keep an eye out on this one, Apple. Helpful advice. Apple might have missed it. The often don’t pay attention to what’s going on in the industry so… good tip. TheStreet isn’t the only outfit that is very helpfully warning Apple about this iPhone-killing Rubicorn. Boy Genius Report’s Chris Smith goes even further: “Andy Rubin’s mysterious new Android phone will do something your iPhone can’t.” We don’t know many things about the Essential phone right now… But it’s gonna be so awesome and Apple-affecting, y’all. …other than it’s supposed to have an edge-to-edge screen and offer a feature unseen on the iPhone so far. WOW! You know what other smartphone had features that weren’t on the iPhone? THE HITLERPHONE IS NOT A THING, GARY, STOP SAYING THAT. The Amazon Fire Phone. Anyone know how that turned out? Probably super well. Not worth checking. …Essential tweeted an image that shows a phone complete with a strange accessory on top. Thus causing a giant sinkhole to open up at One Infinite Loop and swallow Apple whole, The End. Seriously, a strange accessory? Is there any point in even having WWDC? If you Zapruder the heck out of the image you’ll see that what appears to be on the top of the device might (possibly) be (who knows?) “a 360-degree camera accessory for VR and AR” (or not). Because clearly the problem with the current state of VR and AR isn’t that the quality of what’s been produced so far is so bad, it’s that there isn’t a crapton more really lousy stuff out there. You might want to keep a bucket next to you when you check out community-produced VR and AR. That’s all we know about the Essential iPhone killer at this point… It seems like it’s a phone. And it has a thing on top. And it will kill the iPhone. That’s all we know. But, really, we didn’t need to know anything about it at all to know the third thing. That was a given.

PHOTO: Apple It seems that Apple has achieved what Samsung couldn’t. According to a new report, Apple has finally been able to integrate Touch ID fingerprint sensor directly into the display of its much awaited upcoming iPhone 8. Quoting sources from Apple’s supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Chinese-language Economic Daily News claimed the company had apparently confirmed Apple’s achievement during a technology convention held in Taipei on Thursday. Here’s when iPhone 8 is expected to be released During the TSMC 2017 NA Technology Symposium, the Taiwanese company discussed how Cupertino-based tech giant has been able to forgo the physical home button on its upcoming by using “an optical fingerprint sensor to enable authentication directly on the screen”. If the reports are true, it would come as a relief for Apple fans anxiously waiting for the tenth edition iPhone especially after reports that Apple has been struggling to find a viable solution to integrate the Touch ID sensor into display that overcomes the production challenges involved. The company has reportedly been trying to find ways to integrate fingerprint sensors directly into screens since June 2015. Is this what the iPhone 8 may look like? Further, the sources claimed that the new iPhones would also be equipped with “invisible infrared image sensors to enhance the functionality of the high-pixel camera” and to enable augmented reality functions. Apple is widely expected to release the iconic iPhone 8 to mark the tech giant’s 10th year anniversary this year along with the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, two phones that follow the tech giant’s traditional update cycle.   This article originally appeared on MacRumors.

Aside from Singapore, its Asia shops are located in Hong Kong, China and Japan. Singapore, May 27:   Apple opened its first Southeast Asia store in Singapore today, drawing hundreds of excited fans to the swanky two-storey site in the city’s upmarket shopping district. Located on the affluent Orchard Road, the new shop — easily distinguished by its iconic glass facade — is expected to be one of the most popular Apple stores in the world according to the US tech giant. Merchandise such as the iPhone and MacBook were strategically placed on display across the spacious first floor, while the upper level acted as a classroom for customers to participate in hands-on sessions. Hundreds of shoppers camped out in anticipation of the launch, while more than a thousand thronged the store soon after the doors opened, an AFP reporter observed. First in the queue was Xiang Jiaxin, a twenty-five- -ear—old Chinese national working in Macau who had queued for more than 12 hours overnight and planned a holiday to Singapore specially to coincide with the opening. “I am very happy and excited to be part of this. I have participated in the official store openings in Macau, Guangzhou and Nanjing,” he said. Apple, which has a staggering $256.8 billion cash stockpile, celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. The Silicon Valley legend sprang out of Steve Jobs’ garage to reshape modern life with trend-setting gadgets. Most of its earnings come from the iPhone, which faces increasingly tough competition in a saturated market. The tech behemoth has almost 500 stores globally with more than a million visitors daily. Aside from Singapore, its Asia shops are located in Hong Kong, China and Japan. A regional transport, business and financial hub, Singapore attracted 16.4 million visitors last year.

By: Bloomberg | Published:May 27, 2017 1:02 pm Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. Related News Apple WWDC 2017: Look for signs when Tim Cook takes the stage Apple WWDC 2017: iOS 11 to Siri speaker, everything to be announced Apple WWDC 2017: Refreshed MacBooks, Siri-powered speaker, and more announcements expected Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved Performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research.

So Google inference per joule is a tiny fraction of someone like Nvidia. Smart move on Apple to try to copy Google and create something similar.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Science & Health Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Apple iPhone 8 may include a feature that Samsung Galaxy S8 failed to incorporate Apple has finally found a solution to integrate the fingerprint sensor right into the iPhone 8's OLED screen. Kukil Bora   May 27, 2017 12:50 IST Recently leaked iPhone 8 renders also hinted at an on-screen fingerprint sensor. It will definitely be an epic battle between Samsung and Apple for the top spot in the smartphone market, after the later releases its next-generation iPhone 8 towards the end of this year. Although it's too early to gauge the winner of this ultimate showdown, the placement of a particular feature on the new iPhone could give it a competitive edge over the Samsung Galaxy S8 as it failed to execute the same. Yes, we are talking about the fingerprint sensor, which is now rumoured to be integrated into the display of the upcoming iPhone 8. According to a new report, Apple has finally found a solution to use a new optical fingerprint recognition technology, which will allow users to get their fingerprint scanned directly through the new iPhone's OLED screen. In addition to the display-mounted Touch ID, the screen ratio on the iPhone 8 is also said to change from 16:9 on iPhone 7 to 18.5:9. The new flagship handset will also apparently have "invisible" Infrared sensors to unlock enhanced camera and augmented reality features, Economic Daily News reported, citing sources from Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). If the report turns out to be true, the iPhone 8 will come without a physical home button like the recently launched Samsung Galaxy S8. However, the fingerprint sensor to enable authentication directly on the screen will surely be counted as an added advantage for the iPhone 8 over the Galaxy S8. Samsung Many reviewers of the Galaxy S8 were disappointed with the placement of the fingerprint scanner, with some even saying that it was a big design flaw by Samsung. According to reports, the Galaxy S8's front bezels are so thin that Samsung had to shift the fingerprint sensor to the back. The Cupertino-based tech giant was also reportedly struggling with the production of its in-house fingerprint sensor, leading many to speculate that the company would have to either remove Touch ID entirely from the iPhone 8 or place it on the back of the device like the Galaxy S8 does. There were also reports of Apple delaying production of the iPhone 8. Therefore, a successful integration of the on-screen fingerprint recognition solution will bring relief to Apple fans waiting eagerly for the company's tenth anniversary edition iPhone. Rumours are rife that the iPhone 8 will sport a redesigned steel and glass chassis and an edge-to-edge OLED display. The phone is also likely to carry a "premium" price, compared to the existing models.

This new chip which is being currently developed by the company is internally called as Apple Neural Engine. This chip is mainly dedicated to AI-related works such as facial recognition, speech recognition, and few related tasks. The company did not speak anything about this newly popped up subject. Since all the tech giants are running towards creating a powerful AI based system, it looks like Apple has also joined the race to catch up with the competitors. Especially Google and Amazon have already created the biggest space in this segment, so Apple may have to struggle a bit to reach the higher peak. The upcoming chip is said to be designed in such a way that it can integrate it into autonomous cars and robots which may rely on AI technology to operate. Also Read: Apple introduces new app development curriculum with Swift for students Regarding this, Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures says, "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI. At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence." This new AI chip is also said to work faster when compared to the previous one. The Apple devices currently in the market depends on the processor and the graphics chip to handle the AI processes. So, we can consider this new chip to work faster and reliably compared to it. This, in turn, improves the battery life of the device.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Science & Health Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Tech & Trend Apple developing dedicated AI processor chip codenamed 'Apple Neural Engine' Apple's new AI-powered chip is expected to take the world of augmented reality to the next level with system-level integration. Vinod Yalburgi   May 27, 2017 12:38 IST Apple developing dedicated AI processor chip codenamed 'Apple Neural Engine' Apple is currently developing a dedicated Artificially Intelligent (AI) processor chip called Apple Neural Engine to support advanced AI-related tasks like augmented reality (AR) that can integrate into existing facial recognition and speed recognition technologies. Next-gen iPhones including the iPhone 8 are widely touted to incorporate the 3D-sensing front camera with AI-powered depth detection capability. With Siri setting the trend of Voice Assistant apps in the smartphone market, we have seen Apple's competitors making amends to aggressively deploy AI-powered upgrades to their devices such as Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants. Now the California-based company is looking at deploying the potential capabilities of AI in self-driving cars as well as all those gadgets that are capable of running augmented reality. In a nutshell, Apple is focusing at superimposing graphics and other 3D elements into the perceptible 2D world of the user. A few iPhone prototypes have already been tested with the dedicated AI chip wherein the dedicated processor module is built exclusively for demanding artificial intelligence processing and thereby help in optimising the device's battery performance. Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon chip and Google's upcoming Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) are said to be the best illustrations of incorporating a dedicated AI chip onboard. Google's TPU has already found its use in image recognition and driving search results in data centres. The Apple AI chip is expected to become a norm in future iPhone and iPad releases. Bloomberg citing a familiar source, says the Cupertino Company is already working on ideas to offload facial recognition in the photos app, some parts of speech recognition and the iPhone's predictive keyboard to the chip. In its bid to make rapid strides in the AI development and research, Apple has recently invested heavily in acquiring several companies with ties to artificial intelligence such as Tel Aviv-based RealFace as well as hiring research personnel with AI work-related background. For instance, Apple recently hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. Apple is expected to detail its latest accomplishments in the AI field at the forthcoming annual developer conference in June, wherein the company is also touted to unveil iOS 11 for the next-gen iPhones and iPads with a revamped user-interface.

SINGAPORE: Apple opened its first Southeast Asia store in Singapore on Saturday, drawing hundreds of excited fans to the swanky two-storey site in the city’s upmarket shopping district. Located on the affluent Orchard Road, the new shop — easily distinguished by its iconic glass facade — is expected to be one of the most popular Apple stores in the world according to the US tech giant. Merchandise such as the iPhone and MacBook were strategically placed on display across the spacious first floor, while the upper level acted as a classroom for customers to participate in hands-on sessions. Hundreds of shoppers camped out in anticipation of the launch, while more than a thousand thronged the store soon after the doors opened, an AFP reporter observed. First in the queue was Xiang Jiaxin, a twenty-five-year-old Chinese national working in Macau who had queued for more than 12 hours overnight and planned a holiday to Singapore specially to coincide with the opening. “I am very happy and excited to be part of this. I have participated in the official store openings in Macau, Guangzhou and Nanjing,” he told AFP. Apple, which has a staggering $256.8 billion cash stockpile, celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. The Silicon Valley legend sprang out of Steve Jobs’ garage to reshape modern life with trend-setting gadgets. Most of its earnings come from the iPhone, which faces increasingly tough competition in a saturated market. The tech behemoth has almost 500 stores globally with more than a million visitors daily. Aside from Singapore, its Asia shops are located in Hong Kong, China and Japan. A regional transport, business and financial hub, Singapore attracted 16.4 million visitors last year.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 27 May 2017 | MYT 12:00 PM Digital wallet services gain rising acceptance by george avalos The most common mobile-payment activities include paying bills through a mobile phone or web browser, buying items or digital content remotely with a phone, and paying for goods in a store with a phone, according to the Federal Reserve Bank in a report titled Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2016. — Reuters SAN JOSE: Money and wallets simply aren't what they used to be.  Tech giants' card-less payment services – including Apple Pay, Android Pay from Google and Samsung Pay – aim to ease the path to the truly digital wallet, and researchers project huge growth in adoption by retailers and consumers. Even staid financial giants such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America are behind a push to encourage and enable customers to access ATMs without their debit cards.  Yet the digital wallet business has gotten off to a rough start, said Bay Area-based analyst Trip Chowdhry, managing director with Global Equities Research.  "There have been many false starts in this industry," Chowdhry said. "The current payment methods are intrusive, and they are not seamless."  Even so, card-less payment services are here to stay.  "Mobile proximity payments, enabled though near-field-communications, are projected to vastly increase to US$118bil (RM503.68bil) in 2018, up from US$3.5bil (RM14.91bil) in 2014," according to a report by Statista, a web-based data and statistics company. "Some of the benefits of mobile payments include the speed of payment, the convenience as well as the integration with pre-existing loyalty and coupon programs."  These benefits point to a brave new world of virtual wallets.  The most common mobile-payment activities include paying bills through a mobile phone or web browser, buying items or digital content remotely with a phone, and paying for goods in a store with a phone, according to the Federal Reserve Bank in a report titled Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2016.  As of December 2016, Apple Pay led the way in North American retailers' adoption of mobile-payment systems, with 36% acceptance, according to Statista. PayPal had 34% acceptance, Mastercard PayPass had 25%, Android Pay had 24%, Visa CheckOut had 20% and Samsung Pay had 18%, the report said.  One of the next steps, analysts say, is to make payments seamless for the consumer, and to make it easy for shoppers to pick up items in stores without lining up at check stands.  This sort of convenience is already available in a different industry that new technologies have disrupted: "Uber and Lyft enable users to simply get out of the car at the end of the journey, while the app seamlessly processes the fare in the background," Sunnyvale-based technology company Rambus noted in a report.  The technology providers also need to overcome consumers' worries about security.  Campbell-based market researcher Creative Strategies recently studied digital wallets to assess barriers to greater adoption of the services.  "We found that fears about security, trusting in the apps, are the primary concerns," said Ben Bajarin, a principal analyst. "Consumers don't quite buy the story that they are secure. They are concerned that anything in a digital form can be stolen."  Bajarin said Apple, Android and Samsung mobile payment technologies all encrypt users' information, securing their credit card details.  "Compared to a physical credit card or physical wallet that can be stolen, digital wallets are secure," he said.  Here is a brief look at some of the technology leaders in mobile payments.  Apple Pay  Apple Pay is a free digital wallet and mobile payment service that can be used to make in-person payments and is compatible with an array of contact-less terminals. The system is live in 15 countries, including the United States and Canada, along with United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, Japan and several other European and Asian countries.  Q: How many retailers accept your service today? A: Tens of millions of customers are now using Apple Pay, and more than 13 million contact-less enabled locations exist in the countries where the service is live, Apple said in a statement. More than 4.5 million locations now accept Apple Pay in the US.  Retailers that support Apple Pay include Best Buy, B&H Photo, Bloomingdale's, Chevron, Disney, Dunkin' Donuts, GameStop, Jamba Juice, Kohl's, Lucky, McDonald's, Office Depot, Petco, Sprouts, Staples, KFC, Trader Joe's, Walgreens and Whole Foods, according to the MacRumors site.  Q: What improvements are you making to the service? A: Apple didn't disclose any upcoming upgrades. But Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy Cook told analysts during a conference call this month: "Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. We're seeing strong, growing usage as points of acceptance expand, with transaction volume up 450 percent in the US alone."  Android Pay  Google developed the Android Pay digital wallet platform to power tap-to-pay purchases on mobile devices so customers can make payments with Android-based phones, tablets, or watches. Android Pay uses the near-field communications technology to exchange bank card information so funds can be transferred to the retailer.  Q: How many retailers accept your service today? A: "We don't have this number available to share," said Genevieve Park, a Google spokeswoman. However, some of the retailers using Android Pay are Best Buy, BJ's Wholesale Club, Bloomingdale's, Coca Cola, Dunkin' Donuts, Game Stop, Jamba Juice, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Macy's, Meijer, Panera Bread, Subway, Trader Joe's, Walgreens, Wegmans and Whole Foods.  Q: What improvements are you making to the service? A: A Google alliance with PayPal enables people to tap their PayPal accounts to make payments using their Android phones; Google has teamed up with multiple banks, including Bank of America and USAA Bank, to add bank cards to the Android Pay platform; and Gmail users can send money as an attachment in an email, the company said in a statement.  "Android Pay is a mobile wallet that allows Android users to save their credit, debit and loyalty cards to their phone and pay easily in-store, in-app, and on the mobile web," Google said.  Samsung Pay  Samsung Pay uses near-field communication technology and supports more than 500 banks and credit unions, which together represent more than 85% of the US debit card and credit card market.  Q: How many major retailers accept your service today? A: Samsung Pay works at more than 90% of the top 250 retailers and the vast majority of merchants, including small, local businesses, Samsung said. Because Samsung Pay supports both Near-Field Communications (NFC) and Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) technologies, Samsung Pay is accepted almost anywhere you can swipe or tap your credit card, it said.  Samsung Pay is driving toward the goal of universal merchant acceptance, which is critical to consumer adoption, Samsung said.  Q: What improvements are you making to the service? A: Samsung has provided new incentives to help customers reach for their phones every time they go through checkout. Samsung Rewards, for example, serves as the loyalty platform for the entire Samsung ecosystem, working much like standard credit card points programs.  "With Samsung Rewards rapidly accelerating consumer adoption of mobile payments, and Samsung Pay's ability to work almost anywhere you can swipe a credit card unlike other solutions, we know that Samsung Pay is uniquely positioned to lead the mobile payments industry into the future," said Nana Murugesan, general manager of services and new business at Samsung Electronics America.  Wells Fargo  Instead of a physical card, customers can now use a mobile Wells Fargo app to choose card-free ATM access and then obtain a one-time token for that session to conduct transactions at the machine.  "Wells Fargo is the first large bank in the U.S. to have card-less ATM technology on our entire fleet," said Ruben Pulido, a Wells Fargo spokesman.  Bank of America  Bank of America focuses on digital wallets for its card-less ATM services.  "The way we deployed card-less technologies is we are accepting all digital wallets, including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay," said Charles Liu, chief of branch transformation, ATM innovation and market strategy. "We have enabled this so all of the digital wallets will work with our ATMs. You simply place your phone near an ATM terminal and they communicate with each other."  This sort of access is available at more than half of the Bank of America ATMs in the US and can be activated by uploading the bank card information to a digital wallet.  Retailers  Macy's and Bloomingdale's both accept Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay, said Orlando Veras, a spokesman for Macy's Inc, whose subsidiaries include the two department store chains.  The only digital wallet Walmart accepts is Walmart Wallet, the retailer said in an e-mailed response. — San Jose Mercury News/Tribune News Service  Related Stories You May Be Interested Wal-Mart tests delivery of online packages by store workers Bansen Labs adapter allows gamers with disabilities to connect with technology Snapchat’s ‘Spectacles’ go on sale in Europe 5 superpowers every mum has 6 beautiful cities to add to your bucket list How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Others Also Read Mixed reviews of MPAJ‘s parking app Chinese spend RM110mil on cosmetics Williams set to face Lions, Perofeta gets first start advertisement Latest News European telecoms firms pin hopes on Esports video game gladiators China agrees to delay electric car quota by a year Google’s Chrome browser to start blocking annoying ads next year Bansen Labs adapter allows gamers with disabilities to connect with technology Toyota-supported flying car hopes to light the Tokyo 2020 Olympic flame Most Viewed in Tech Bentley on Demand is like Uber for the uber rich Here’s how to know if someone’s blocked you on WhatsApp Microsoft’s weapon in high-stakes cloud-computing battle with Amazon?

Hundreds of people waited outside Apple’s first store in Southeast Asia in Singapore, which opened on May 27. AFP SINGAPORE—Apple opened its first Southeast Asia store in Singapore on Saturday, drawing hundreds of excited fans to the swanky two-story site in the city’s upmarket shopping district. Located on the affluent Orchard Road, the new shop — easily distinguished by its iconic glass facade — is expected to be one of the most popular Apple stores in the world according to the US tech giant. Merchandise such as the iPhone and MacBook were strategically placed on display across the spacious first floor, while the upper level acted as a classroom for customers to participate in hands-on sessions. ADVERTISEMENT Hundreds of shoppers camped out in anticipation of the launch, while more than a thousand thronged the store soon after the doors opened, an AFP reporter observed. First in the queue was Xiang Jiaxin, a twenty-five-year-old Chinese national working in Macau who had queued for more than 12 hours overnight and planned a holiday to Singapore specially to coincide with the opening. “I am very happy and excited to be part of this. I have participated in the official store openings in Macau, Guangzhou and Nanjing,” he told Agence France-Presse. Apple, which has a staggering $256.8 billion cash stockpile, celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. The Silicon Valley legend sprang out of Steve Jobs’ garage to reshape modern life with trend-setting gadgets. Most of its earnings come from the iPhone, which faces increasingly tough competition in a saturated market. The tech behemoth has almost 500 stores globally with more than a million visitors daily. Aside from Singapore, its Asia shops are located in Hong Kong, China and Japan. A regional transport, business and financial hub, Singapore attracted 16.4 million visitors last year.

She also fancies herself a bit of a rock star in her town and spends too much time reading comic books.  If she's not typing away at her keyboard, you can probably find her at Disneyland or watching Star Wars (or both). Last week was Global Accessibility Awareness Day and Apple made a point to let the world know that it is always working on improving accessibility features. Good for Apple. Apple has long been a trailblazer down the path to accessibility with such features as VoiceOver; it originated on the Mac back in 2007, and is now on every device the company makes. In recent years, Apple has been highlighting the importance of including accessibility features in new technologies and sharing its work with the world. It's incredible, the things Apple has accomplished in working toward an inclusive and supportive range of devices that anyone and everyone can use, no matter what their level of ability is. Apple isn't the only one doing these things. There are lots of tech companies that include accessibility features on there devices and in their software programs, and even more app developers that provide incredible help to those that need it. More companies should be spotlighting what they do to advance accessibility technologies and proudly share their successes with the world. The competition to see who is the best at it could produce some amazing and revolutionary results. How accessibility has helped my family My nephew has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). He is high-functioning, but didn't start out that way. He didn't say his first word until after turning three years old. Before he started speaking, his parents discovered a way to communicate with him using TapToTalk on a tablet or phone (TapToTalk has since gone out of business). When he was hungry, he could tell his parents that he wanted a bowl of cereal. The frustration that comes with not knowing why your child is upset eased up significantly once my nephew was able to talk to them thanks to TapToTalk. It's software like this that has helped a lot of families communicate when they never could before. Fast forward seven years. My brother has been undergoing treatment for throat cancer, which has damaged his voice-box so he can no longer speak. Today, my brother uses an app called Speak4Me Pro, in which he types what he wants to say and the app uses VoiceOver technology to relay the information. It's been incredibly helpful for my brother to have the ability to tell my nephew to stop talking, even though he doesn't have a voice to do it (just kidding, though he sure does talk a lot now). Both apps used by my family to help them have a voice when they weren't able to on their own didn't cost more than a dollar. Imagine how incredible it is to be able to talked to your loved ones, when you couldn't before, for just a dollar. Accessibility issues are a part of my life, and that's just my immediate family. It's likely that you know at least a few people that deal with something relating to accessibility, too, like a grandparent that has vision impairment or a friend with hearing loss. It's not a niche market. It's a huge market. How other companies besides Apple are helping the world If you do a Google search right now for "Accessibility Apple," you'll see dozens of hits at the top of the page of reports of Apple showcasing accessibility features on its products — spreading the word. If you do a Google search right now for "Accessibility Android" or "Accessibility Windows" you'll find some very informative how-to guides for using accessibility features, but very little reports of how these companies are making strides in the industry. Less people are talking about it because tech companies aren't spotlighting it. There doing it, they're just not talking about it. For example, Android has its own version of VoiceOver, which allows users to have words on screen and actions read allowed. It also lets a person connect their phone to switches or keyboards instead of the touch screen for people with dexterity impairments. It has braille display support, screen adjustments, and captions for supported content. Windows has a long list of accessibility features available with its desktop software and Windows Phone includes a number of features similar to Android, like a version of VoiceOver, adjustable screen options, a magnifier and zoom, and captions for supported content. Are they ashamed of their progress? Do they feel uncomfortable talking about it? I doubt it. I just don't think Google or Microsoft are spending much effort spreading the word of their part in making technology more accessible to everyone. How competition encourages growth Just like Google, Microsoft, and Apple are always fighting each other to prove who is the best at education, art, and generally cool features in their software updates, they should be fighting to prove who is better at inventing incredible advancements in accessibility. If every tech giant's keynote had a wow-factor section on accessibility, I'll bet we'd see the technology grow a lot faster. Google and Microsoft, it's time you put on your boxing gloves and took off your humble suit. Tell the world about what you do for accessibility and try to make it the "next big thing" at your yearly keynotes. Let's see some healthy competition in the accessibility field.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Google has Tensor cores. Could Apple soon have AI cores of its own? Apple is already driving mobile silicon in a way few if any other companies have been able to keep up with. Now, a new report claims Apple will be using its considerable chipset chops to accelerate artificial intelligence as well. Mark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg: Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition. If true, this should surprise no one. Arguably, Apple's biggest advantage in computing right now is that the company custom crafts the complete stack, from atom to bit to pixel. That includes an ever-increasing amount of custom silicon. A few years ago, Apple offloaded motion tracking from its main A-series system-on-a-chip to an M-series sensor fusion hub. A few years later, it added onboard natural language parsing to the M-series to enable "Hey, Siri!" in as power-efficient a way as possible. The latest A-series, A10 Fusion, combines two high-efficiency cores with two high-performance cores to try to eek out as much battery life as possible while pushing pixels and bits as fast as possible. Anything that makes sense to offload to increase efficiency and performance, you can bet Apple is working on offloading. Including and especially AI, since it's such a hot topic these days. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants. This part reads oddly to me. Nothing against Mark, but it's a particularly bad narrative pervasive across U.S. media. Google Home is a single product. Echo is a growing line of similar, home-based products. Apple has pushed Siri from iPhone to and through iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, CarPlay, HomeKit, and accessories like AirPods. Apple has also expanded Siri across dozens of languages, including Chinese, Hebrew, and Arabic, as well as dozens of regions. It's fair to say no other vendor has yet been as aggressive as Apple in deploying virtual assistants across product lines or to customers around the world. "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI," said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. "At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence." This also reads oddly to me. Almost everything Apple does already requires AI. AI is going to be everywhere in computing the same way math is everywhere. There's nothing unique about special projects like augmented reality or cars. Machine learning, computer vision, and related technologies are already powering everything from battery efficiency to photo tagging, sequential inference to computational photography. Just because Google made its sound like they invented AI on the I/O 2016 stage, and it's now parroted alongside AR and VR the way mobile/social/local was a decade ago, doesn't mean companies like Apple (and Google) haven't been working on it for years. What's interesting isn't that the big tech giants are working on it; it's how they will use it to solve real problems in the information and computer space and, in Apple's case, how it will solve those problems while protecting our security and privacy at the same time.

Apple has pushed Siri from iPhone to and through iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, CarPlay, HomeKit, and accessories like AirPods." ... except that Google's Assistant is available across mobile devices (Android, iOS), within Chrome I believe, not just through the Home product. And Alexa is present and capable on the Echo products as well as through the Alexa app, the Amazon app, the Fire stick, presumably the Fire TV, and so on. It's a valid comparison, correct? And - pardon my ignorance - is Siri present in Airpods independent of the phone? 0 1 week ago Reply bhatech Yeah smh at google home is a single product. Hello !!! google now, assistant, voice recognition is everywhere. 0 1 week ago Reply cuttheredwire The AirPods have a tap for Siri feature. Viticci mentioned he uses them for Siri in his latest podcast. "While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants." Rene's point is that the media forgets that Siri is in so many places. Apple has been aggressively implementing Siri, but you would never know it by news coverage. He does *not* claim that Google is less aggressive or in fewer places in any way at all. 0 1 week ago Reply bhatech News coverage is about how Siri sucks, no one complains that's not in many places. They complain because it's bad compared to competition. 0 1 week ago Reply bhatech "This part reads oddly to me. Nothing against Mark, but it's a particularly bad narrative pervasive across U.S. media." Nothing against Rene, but it's just pro apple narrative from you, Gruber and few others on everything Apple does. At least Mark is honest even though he loves Apple products. Pretty much everyone is right Siri lacks and is just dumb compared to google. And, yeah Google does it many languages as well if that's your defense for whatever little Siri can do. On the positive side, I'm excited to see what Apple comes up and see how it can compete with Google given it has no other option other than pushing privacy story and how it can do everything on device. They would love to be like google but given the lack of their ability we have to see how well they can do this AI stuff on device and keeping privacy in mind. "Just because Google made its sound like they invented AI on the I/O 2016 stage, and it's now parroted alongside AR and VR the way mobile/social/local was a decade ago, doesn't mean companies like Apple (and Google) haven't been working on it for years." Really? You are so hurt on this? Even on MacBreak weekly you brought this up. This is what Apple does for pretty much everything in their keynote. Every feature they talk as if they invented it even though it's on competitor's device for years. 0 1 week ago Reply cuttheredwire They all try to make it sound like they invented it. Heck, people have forgotten there were smart phones before 2007. There were, but far fewer people had them. As for the narrative, I am seeing a lot of criticism on the media praising the Echo and viewing the Apple Watch as a flop. Yet I've read on multiple places that the watch sells more in volume and for a profit while the Echo is sold for a loss and fewer are sold. Numbers are not released, so I'm going to dig for the articles (but I believe Above Avalon was one of them). What is interesting is the way the Echo has caught the attention of the media. It's different and it is functional. There is plenty to write about since it is so open (too open for my tastes). The hardware is getting refreshed at a good pace too. As for Siri, yep, it needs work. Actually, it needs a way for me to tell it that, no, it did not understand me. That's really all I want… that and to have more fluid conversations. 0 1 week ago Reply Jose_Rey Really? The Echo losing money? That seems strange to me. I mean, after all, it's useless if you have no internet. It cannot do anything unless it has access to it. No timers, alarms, nada. At least that's what they said in the reviews. 0 1 week ago Reply themacbuddha How Apple approaches the digital assistant is predicated on these factors: Security/Privacy, Ubiquity, and Extensibility. Security/Privacy---Data storage and manipulation is best served on the local device when it can be and only stored and manipulated on the cloud if it can be done so at the deepest level. For a photo to be synced to and manipulated in the iCloud and for Apple to do so having excluded their ability to hold any encryption key protecting it is a very, very, very tall order. There is a reason they hired Jonathan Zdziarski. The call to crop and apply a filter needs to happen on all devices AND the cloud without compromising privacy. Keeping customer data encrypted at these levels on their servers is not in Google's best interest or even their wheelhouse. Google doesn't talk the security game. Therefor they keep themselves open to running fast and loose with your data. That means ample blood in the water for any number of bad players to go after. The trope of Google User Data Anonymization is prime for failure. Not a matter of "if" but "when". The continued treatment of end user devices as dumb terminals and the shoving of ever more data and processing power to the cloud leads to laziness on the OEM's part. We've seen this battle before. One can only assume that Samsung is not simply glomming Viv to things but actually following through on the promise of Android as a true open source solution. Don't Hold Your Breathe. Reports that Apple is creating custom silicon for managing digital dossiers should not surprise anyone. Nor should the fact that they are telling Qualcomm to take a hike now be a surprise. That they added Intel as a supplier for cellular modems is quite telling - they are going to make their own modems too. 0 1 week ago Reply themacbuddha Ubiquity---Though it might seem obvious to most the scale of this can not be understated. The "Internet of Things" is akin to the "World Wide Web" in my mind. Tremendous promise turns into absolute morass of pain. To put some perspective to something that was mentioned in an earlier post regarding the Amazon Echo line: There is plenty of talk about how wonderful Tesla is doing. Yet the Apple Watch has generated more unit sales then Echo and more revenue then Tesla. Apple Watch is primed to leap forward this fall. This is not to belabor those companies' successes but to illustrate that the reach of Apple products and there for Siri (or whatever the overall solution is deemed to be called) exemplifies how far it can go. Apple Watch can be viewed as an accessory to iPhone. And what of any Siri Speaker (hate that name) product. What of a newer wifi system that integrates and amplifies Siri and HomeKit. What of CarPlay and other integrated auto systems. Project Titan is aptly named but probably a **** lot closer than most think to producing fruit. Extensibility---Echo has both language support and security working against it. Amazon is predominately US company. However one must appreciate that it is Walmart and their ilk that Amazon is truly competing against. Don't undersell that. Google's bread and butter on the other hand is in advertising. And they will ride that pony straight in to the ground. Their forte is on the server. Their greatest success found almost exclusively within a web browser. Again...Advertising and the World Wide Web! When combined, the most hated concept in existence. They will have a difficult time assailing that wall. I foresee a lot of WTF results that is far worse the bane of Siri now. And where might Apple fit in this? Yes, yes, yes! Fluid conversation is nice but natural language is better suited. In fact it is absolutely imperative. And never mind about just simple language support. What about muddled accents and mixed languages - Spanglish anyone? Recognize the extent third party support for Siri introduces a set of complexities far, far, far beyond the chicken scratch/Graffiti approach of Google Assistant and Alexa, and is dependant on Apple growing domains instead of leaving businesses to grab at the lowest hanging fruit. Make no mistake it is not about competing against Android/Amazon/Google/Advertising/BuynLarge. It's about creating a platform for communication and commerce that doesn't bank on the gullibility of the end user. It's all my data; what I buy, who I buy it from, what I do with it? Whose to say that a viable solution positively requires that I give up that control. Just remember....the road less travelled. (All Over The Place, I Know!) 0 1 week ago Reply johnnygoodface That last sentence says it all! Yes indeed, security and privacy are the hole point of making an AI chip in the phone, so that requests are analyzed and decisions are taken locally, and not from a distant server, and this will hopefully makes the response time much faster. 0 1 week ago Reply delta4s Google and Amazon are into AI for the purpose and goal of increased efficiency in advertising and selling of your data. The promoted benefits to you personnally are a side effect and not the goal. However, Apple really needs to step up. Siri has improved but has a long way to go. Apple doesn't have the cloud infrastructure setup to process AI so it needs to do it not the device. I wonder if that data can transferred to a new device. 0 1 week ago Reply johnnygoodface "I wonder if that data can transferred to a new device."? That's indeed a very good question, one Apple should take into consideration, since all that the AI chip will have learned will need to be backup to iCloud too ---- sorry I should have replied to delta4s instead 0 1 week ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Rob Sabo | This empty lot just east of Downtown Reno will get a newhigh-tech look with its purchase by Apple for a distribution center. Prev of images Next Every time she looks out the front window, Belen Morales, manager of BJ's Hair Shop on Evans Avenue, has stared at a barren dirt lot across the street from the salon for the six years she's been employed there. The blighted lot at Fifth Street and Evans Avenue in downtown Reno soon could get a major facelift from a big-name tenant, though. Apple recently announced plans to construct a distribution facility as part of an additional $1 billion investment in its operations in northern Nevada. The site was formerly home to a warehouse that was demolished following heavy winter snows in 2005. It's been a vacant dirt lot ever since. For awhile the lot used for impromptu parking for Reno Aces baseball games, but a chain-link fence went up about a year ago that put a kibosh on the free parking. Morales is all for the Apple project. "I think it is fabulous that we will have something across the street," she says. "We have a lot of traffic this way anyway, so I don't think it will have a huge impact. We probably will have more police patrol, and more lighting. "We have a great little area here," she adds. "This is not a bad spot for them. It will only benefit all of us, and I think it is a great thing." The area surrounding Fifth and Evans site was part of the sweeping Tessera redevelopment project, which called for 1.2 million square feet of mixed-used development. That project ultimately never transpired as the hard-hitting recession scuttled developers' plans for the district. Apple five years ago announced a $1 billion dollar investment in northern Nevada to take place over 10 years, and accomplished that spending goal in five years as it built out its data center at Mustang. The tech giant recently announced it will increase its investment in northern Nevada by an additional $1 billion to expand on its data center and construct a distribution facility in downtown Reno. Apple originally wanted to lease the downtown land but now wants to purchase the property to build its distribution facility. The land is held by Northern Nevada Urban Development Company, the proposed developers of the Tessera District. Buying the land is a key part of Apple's investment strategy in northern Nevada, said Apple representative Mike Foulkes to the Reno City Council. "We spent a long time trying to find a good site in town that would be good for us and the city," Foulkes said. "To make the kind of investment we are willing to make, we need to own the property. It is not the type of investment you make on a leased property." Apple's investment in the downtown facility would be in excess of $4 million, Foulkes says, and the new facility would mirror the look and feel of Apple's retail and employment centers. "We are working to really make it a showpiece for downtown," he says. "We think it will be the most beautiful building in that corridor. For us, beauty is important." It wouldn't take much to be named the most beautiful building in that area, although the area does exude the rustic charm of old Reno with many old brick buildings. Fifth Street and Evans Avenue are home to older 1960s homes and some even older apartment buildings — one dates back to 1908. There also are several older storage warehouses in the adjacent areas. Stantec Consulting Services in March filed a special use permit with the City of Reno that details plans to build a 27,000-square-foot warehouse/distribution center on 1.38 acres at 520 Evans Avenue. The facility would be built to accommodate between five to seven truck deliveries each day from Sixth Street. The facility would employ between eight and 12 people, although office space could accommodate 15 or so employees. This mirrors what Foulkes told the city council. The proposed building would be constructed using a combination of masonry, metal panels and resin panels, the Stantec permit states. It also would include new eight-foot sidewalks with deciduous trees planted every 30 feet along Evans, Fifth and Sixth streets. Forty trees in total and 240 shrubs would ring the property, and signage would be limited to address signage on Sixth Street and Evans Avenue. Josh Rosenstock, Apple spokesman, said in a statement in early May that the Silicon Valley tech giant supports more than 700 jobs in Nevada. "Nevada is home to our largest solar investment, powering our data center with clean energy. We're excited to be increasing our contributions to the local economy with an additional $1 billion investment to expand our data center and supporting facilities. As part of our growth we plan to hire 100 employees and expect construction will support an additional 300 jobs."

S. Bradford — in Contributors 327 shares The world of technology has given us so much in the way of improving quality of life. From practical application in the world of medicine to creating virtual playgrounds for recreation, we see innovation moving so quickly that it can be hard to keep up sometimes. In looking to our future, we look to our past, which – relative to the age of our planet – is not that long at all. We can learn a lot from those that came before us and are still with us now, sharing their experience and continuing to make the world a better place. I had the great fortune of sitting down with John Sculley, the former CEO of Apple and Pepsi President, to talk about what it was like to work with Steve Jobs, what he has learned during his long and impressive career, and what future innovators need to succeed in the world of tech. The Next Web: Hello John. Thank you for joining me today. As we all know, there was once a time when Apple, as a fledgling company, was going through a tumultuous time. As someone who has been successful in several ventures, what was your experience during this time and what was it like to work with Steve Jobs? John Sculley: I was Steve Jobs’ partner and closest friend for three years.  What made Steve Jobs different is he never tried to adapt to fit into the world. Steve always wanted the world to change and see the possibilities he saw. When he was 27, Steve was brilliant and in deep learning mode. Like many geniuses, he experimented and made mistakes. It was amazing experience to be with him seven days a week. It was during these years that Steve Jobs defined his first principles that still the foundation of Apple today. TNW: What were those principles, John? JS: There are six: 1.) Empower non-technical people with bicycles for the mind that will unleash their creativity. 2.) Change the world by enabling people to visually communicate (in those days before the Web, Steve Jobs created AppleTalk that wired Macs together). 3.) Design is important to everything Apple will do and simplification is the ultimate sophistication. 4.) No compromises. 5.) Every detail of how we do things at Apple must be as perfect as possible. The six colors of the logo. The Mac Factory, and many other examples. As we were getting ready to finish the final rev of the Mac mother board, just before first release, Steve saw a slight imperfection. The engineer working on it said to Steve, “ This board will be inside the Mac box and no one will ever know.”  Steve looked at him will a deep stare and said, “I’ll know.” 6) The Mac team needs to be willing to devote every waking moment of their lives to making Macintosh insanely great. There is no time to waste. TNW: [Laughs] I love how Jobs’ words were so ominous, but I get it. It’s not enough for the products to be great, they have to be the best. The standards are what separate competing forces from one another and gives the edge to the ones that give way more attention to every little detail. It’s respectable. Those core values certainly have helped Apple gain a huge market share and I do agree that there have been some beautiful products that have come out of the company. What do you think about the direction Apple has gone with Tim Cook at the helm? JS: Tim Cook is an outstanding Apple CEO. TNW: What role and ideas did you have to make Apple a product marketing company? What knowledge did you bring from the successes of Pepsi to create the perception that Apple was the product to buy over other computer brands? We see the same kind of marketing now, and have for years, with imagery of people’s lives being vastly improved by Apple products, from listening to music, photography, and even tracking one’s own health metrics. Let’s talk about the focus on targeting the creative community and lifestyle. JS: My role was to teach Steve Jobs about consumer marketing. In the 1970’s, Coca-Cola outsold Pepsi in half the US by 10:1. As Pepsi’s then 30 year old CMO, I realized the reality was: Coke was the most famous and most profitable consumer brand in the world. Coca Cola owned reality. Perception leads reality. So, Pepsi needed to own ‘perception’. We achieved this goal by focusing on the customer’s experience with Pepsi versus Coke. The marketing campaign we developed was called ‘The Pepsi Challenge’. I called it “experience marketing”. Steve Jobs loved our conception of “experience marketing” as he was then developing and building the Mac. The user’s experience was at the heart of Steve Jobs’ vision. Steve told me, “You have got to come to Apple and teach me how to do experience marketing.” The first iteration of experience marketing was the launch of the TV campaign for the Mac, known today as the 1984 Super Bowl TV commercial. TNW: The world of high tech is an incredibly competitive market and one false move can make or break any company, but to be successful, one must take risks. How do you find the balance between sound decision-making and taking chances? What can aspiring business-owners and entrepreneurs learn from our forefathers in the tech community that can lead to success? JS: Most ‘adaptive innovators’ try to fit their innovation into the world. Steve Jobs never cared about fitting into the world. He wanted the world to adapt andfit in to his vision of the future. This is when Steve meant when he said he wanted to put a dent in the universe. TNW: During your time at Apple, you oversaw the development of the Newton. That project specifically ran into many obstacles during development and the competition, Palm Pilot, ultimately gained the market share at the time. Do you think that, even though Jobs terminated the project, he still held onto a little piece of the concept to aid in the development of the iPhone and other touchscreen products? Do you think that the technology would have been as sought-after by consumers had Jobs not famously unveiled the iPod Touch and iPhone the way he did? JS: Newton turned out to be seminal development for Apple. It was the first PDA that used a graphics screen interface. The first machine learning digital assistant. The Newton team co-developed the ARM microprocessor and Apple owned 43% of ARM. If Apple hadn’t of sold their 43% of ARM for a reported $800 million in 1997, Apple would have gone bankrupt. TNW: What is your take on the trending of new technology such as VR/AR? Do you think that there is an important use for it that can be utilized beyond the recreational use of average consumers? JS: I am very involved with AI now. I am vice chairman of ‘Lantern’ a fin-tech company in California that is developing an A platform for consumer credit scoring called BeamAI. TNW: What traits and instincts do Millennials absolutely need to possess in order to compete and earn success in today’s market? JS: There has never been a better time for entrepreneurs. So many exponentially growing technology breakthroughs like: cloud, mobile, unstructured data, AI, IoT.  Milennials need to have insatiable curiosity and they need to find noble causes that inspire them and others that can change the world. There has to be a better way to do things and technology is now reliable, inexpensive, and highly scalable. TNW: You’ve earned a tremendous success during your long career, and continue to do so. What is it like to experience such success and what is the best advice you’ve received throughout your career? What knowledge and experience can you now teach to those who are making the trek behind you? JS: My best advice is: Stay curious. Take chances. Failure is a learning experience. Never ever give up. TNW: Thank you so much for your time, John. It’s been a pleasure to speak with you today.   Learn more about John Sculley through his website, where he shares even more about his wealth of knowledge in specific markets, and shows future entrepreneurs how to create a successful business in today’s market to solve the problems of tomorrow.

Ahead of the official opening at 10am, an Apple representative said there were more than 200 people queuing around Knightsbridge Mall along Orchard Road, with some in line as early as 5pm on Friday. Another Apple representative later told Channel NewsAsia there were about 2,000 people in the queue by the time the doors opened. First in line: Mr Peter Xiang, from China, flew in specially for the opening of Apple Orchard Road. (Photo: Tang See Kit) First in line was Mr Peter Xiang, who had been in line for more than 10 hours. The 25-year-old Chinese national, who has been to several Apple Stores in China, decided to fly to Singapore on May 23 for the opening. Advertisement Advertisement "I've been on standby here for more than 10 hours. No matter, I'm still excited (but) a little tired now," he told Channel NewsAsia. "Looking forward most to (getting a) Apple T-shirt and maybe I will buy something. Maybe some accessories."  Students Timothy Wang and Afreen Akbany were in the queue for more than 10 hours to be one of the first to enter Apple Orchard Road. (Photo: Tang See Kit)  Also in the line for more than 10 hours were Mr Timothy Wang and Ms Afreen Akbany, both 17-year-olds studying at ACS International. Mr Wang said the tech giant's retail outlets stand out for their great customer service and well-planned in-store designs. "I've been to several Apple stores in the US and in Hong Kong, but this is certainly prettier because this is in Singapore ... They have really good customer service too so I'm excited about finally having an Apple Store here." For 20-year-old Tim Shao from China, live trees taking up prominent spots within were what made the new store in Singapore unique. "The designs of all the Apple stores are uniformed so in terms of the layout, this is nothing special," he told Channel NewsAsia. "What's unique is the trees here and this is the Apple Store version 2 design that only started last year. This is not available in the US." Apple's senior vice president of retail Angela Ahrendts was seen at the opening of Apple Orchard Road on Saturday. (Photo: Tang See Kit) The two-storey Apple Orchard Road is also the first official Apple store in Southeast Asia. “Generally, Apple stores in Hong Kong, Tokyo and many other cities have turned out to be a destination retail space. Tourists as well as locals are often drawn to the stores to experience the offerings as well as to enjoy the new concepts,” said Mr Desmond Sim, head of CBRE Research for Singapore and Southeast Asia. “Hence, it is not surprising that this will also be the same for the first Singapore store.” Apple has nearly 500 stores in 20 countries worldwide and as of April, welcomes more than a million visitors a day. It expects the newly unveiled Singapore store, which it sees as a “modern-day town square”, to be one of its most popular around the world. Apart from having its core products like the iPhone on display prominently on the first level, the store will also be conducting free hands-on educational sessions on topics such as photography and coding. These sessions will be conducted in a space called the Forum on the second level, which is equipped with a large screen and break-out tables. Industry experts said the incorporation of activity-based and experiential-based concept stores is synonymous with brands such as Apple. It also serves as a strategy for brick-and-mortar retailers in their battle against e-commerce. “The business of retail is not only about pure transactions but it has a high experiential component that consumers yearn for and is drawn to. This is especially so for new technology for lifestyle,” said CBRE’s Mr Sim. “Not to mention that the business of retail is also a very visual business. Design of stores will attract crowds.” The crowd seen at the opening of Apple Orchard Road. (Photo: Tang See Kit) One unique design at the Singapore Apple Store that caught much attention was the two curved stone staircases, which drew inspiration from Apple’s new campus in Cupertino. Industry experts expect the Apple Orchard Road, which opened after many reported delays, to be a boost for Singapore’s prime shopping belt and neighbouring stores. Ms Christine Li, research director at Cushman & Wakefield, said: “Before Apple Store came to town, people could have been a bit bored of Orchard Road because there is little differentiation between Orchard Road and, say, a suburban shopping centre as people see more or less the same brands and retail offering. “I personally believe that Orchard Road is not dead, but it needs to be exciting and entertaining in order for locals and tourists to visit it repeatedly,” she added.  Source: CNA/sk Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail More stories for you More information about Channel News Asia jump to top of page Sections Asia Pacific Singapore World CNA Insider Business Sport Lifestyle Technology Health Commentary About Us About Channel NewsAsia Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Advertise with us Contact Sales Online Advertising TV Advertising Get the news that matters in your inbox every morning!

Perhaps Apple should call it the MacBook Exec or Edition. I won’t bother rehashing the many quibbles that others have already covered. Yet, once again, the punditry has failed to notice the biggest and most obvious flaw and are ranting about the wrong things. Let me rant about the right things for you. You’re welcome. The Touchbar MacBook Pro is a failure because you cannot upgrade its storage capacity. Ever. Why? Because the SSD is a soldered-in and non-upgradable boat anchor. A woman using Touch Bar on MacBook Pro While some may quibble with the 16GB RAM limit, at least there were technical limitations to that. Namely it was limited by the particular Intel chipset. Furthermore, nothing stops you from maxing out the RAM when you order the machine. Generally speaking, Apple lets you buy a Pro laptop with the maximum addressable RAM for its given chipset. However, that argument does not hold water with storage. The Touchbar MacBook Pro is limited to a paltry 2TB SSD. I have an old 2011 17” MacBook Pro with a 2TB SSD, and I can easily put in a 4TB SSD today, and 15TB in the not so distant future. Storage Size Matters for Pros The reality is, professional users need and use lots of storage, and those storage needs change with time. A pro machine needs to be adaptable. By limiting and freezing the machine to 2TB, Apple ensures that professionals who need more storage space need to look elsewhere. Further, it totally makes the machine a ‘disposable’ device for those that buy it today. Once they run out of space, for example, a year later, the only option is to get rid of the machine, and hope there is a new machine with more storage available. That’s nuts! There is no excuse for Apple making storage non-upgradable (other than greed or gross incompetence). They put an upgradeable SSD slot in the non-Touchbar, entry-level MacBook Pro. So whatever marginal idiot reason they trot out for not including it on Touchbar models is total BS. Talk to the hand; I don’t give a $#*%. The machine’s battery or thinness would not have been compromised in any serious way with the inclusion of the slot, again, as evinced by the entry level model. This storage lock-in has no business on any machine with a “Pro” moniker. It just further shows how heinously out of touch Apple has become with its core professional and creative user base. Let’s pray that Apple has woken up, and the next revision of its MacBook Pro will avoid this critical mistake. Otherwise, Apple will continue to bleed its pro users to companies that are not tone deaf to their needs.

Thank You! We need to stand up and scream that the emperor has no clothes. Eventually Apple will get it. May 26, 2017 at 4:50 EDT PM vr8ce May 26, 2017 I completely agree with the premise — memory and storage should be upgradeable on any pro machine, because they both drop in price dramatically over a relatively short period of time. However, there are several problems with the article: 1. This is old news. Really, really old news. 2. No, you couldn’t put a 4TB SSD in a MBP right now. MBP’s don’t use SSD “drives,” and haven’t for quite some time. The 9-to-5 article you linked to even shows you a nice picture of the SSD chips. Which means there may, in fact, have been (and still be) “technical limitations” to the 2TB limit. I doubt it, but it’s possible. Regardless, what kind of SSD drives exist is immaterial for the MBP’s, because they don’t use them. 3. The idea that we would a) run out of room in a year, and b) throw out the machine when we did, is facile. I’m using a late 2013 MBP with only a half-terabyte SSD, and although I don’t have as much free space as I would like, it’s fine. And even if it wasn’t fine, I’d use my 1 TB SSD external drive for whatever I needed to do. (And if I didn’t have one, I’d buy one instead of throwing out a 2K+ machine.) If you want to make a stink about non-upgradable storage, do it when it’s actually news, and don’t make up nonsense in a sad attempt to bolster your case. The case doesn’t need any bolstering, it stands on its own. May 26, 2017 at 4:54 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 @vr8ce So what that the MBP doesn’t use a 2.5″ ‘drive’ the same SSD chips in those drives can and are easily adapted to the stick format used by apple. OWC provides a 3rd party SSD adapted to use with such a slot in the trashcan mac pro, see here: https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/SSDA13MP4.0K/ Or OWC’s upgrade options for even your 2013 MBP via stick: https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/ssd/owc/macbook-pro-retina-display/2013-2014-2015 Agreed, it is old news. However, as much bitching as I heard about the 16GB limit, which is a bunch of noise IMO, I really haven’t heard complaints about how this renders the machine disposable. Your comments actually support my pointing attention to this. Now I’m glad for you working on a machine stiffed at it’s storage limit is something you can live with, but for many professionals, this isn’t a ‘fine’ situation at all. And frankly is an unacceptable set of circumstances. And for those that need the expanded storage now or in the future, this is a problem, because for their needs, it will require a machine swap rather than just getting because for many, dangling a brick SSD off their ULTRA LIGHT TINY LIGHT LAPTOP is a bit of an anathema. As always, YMMV May 26, 2017 at 5:41 EDT PM Lee Dronick May 26, 2017 Perhpas what Apple needs a is portable MacBook Pro which is pretty much the current form factor and then a luggable MacBook Pro+ that is thick enough for user replacable hard drives and has more ports than the Hanseatic League May 26, 2017 at 5:58 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 Maybe Lee. But the lower end non-touchbar MacBook Pro has a slot for upgrading the SSD, so it really wouldn’t be difficult or cause any extra thickness to put it into the Touchbar model. And I think you may be right and why I think maybe call the Touchbar MacBook the MacBook Executive, or MacBook Edition, and come out with a MacBook Pro that has a bit more expansion and interoperability in mind. Still, it’s wacky that the would put the upgrade slot in the entry level MacBook Pro, but not in the Touchbar model. Weird. May 26, 2017 at 6:16 EDT PM Lee Dronick May 26, 2017 John, would the circuitry for the touchbar take up too much space? I wouldn’t think so, not these days, but I suppose that it is possible. With faster WiFi and cellular data then the storage for big files could be in the cloud or on a server via FTP. May 26, 2017 at 6:26 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 Lee. I suspect the touch at does have a bit of circuitry, but I don’t buy that the delta in size is that vast because the entry level MacBook Pro fits in the slot just fine. Any marginal difference in thickness could easily have been accommodated on the chassis being a touch thicker. Probably less than a millimeter difference. Don’t get me started on the cloud , but for creative pros with big heavy files, they need super fast SSD speed (e.g. For videos etc), so the cloud won’t cut it for real pros. For executives and “edition” fashion conscious, that might be more predictable an option. As always, ymmv May 26, 2017 at 6:58 EDT PM belmikey May 26, 2017 I am a professional — a software engineer, in fact. Maybe it’s a failure of imagination, but I cannot actually envision ever needing more than ONE TB of actual, on-board storage, on a portable device. The reason for this is really very simple: no matter how well built it is (and sadly build-quality is not what it used to be, but that’s a different rant, because as I say here, it wouldn’t matter), a portable device is, by its very nature, much more liable than a stationary one to take damage. As such, I am not going to keep anything on its internal drive that I don’t actually need RIGHT NOW for my work. And then, I’m going to back it up at least two different ways to the cloud, and then also to some external drive. And anything I don’t actually need for my work is going to live in cloud storage or on an external drive. Because no matter how well built it is, ALL portable devices ought to be treated as disposable. Let me say that again: all portable devices are disposable. Your phone, your laptop, your tablet? Disposable. It’s your data that’s not disposable. And if you’re keeping it all on one large drive on a portable device? You’re pretty much asking for it to eventually suffer an unrecoverable catastrophe. May 26, 2017 at 7:24 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 Ok belmikey, but you can imagine a creative professional, say video user needing more, right? Or are you subscribing to the old bill gates schoo,, of why would anyone ever need more than 640k of memory? And you’re changing the goal post playing semantics, by that token, your home is disposable. The point is many professionals need or will need more storage a year or two after buying the laptop, and won’t be able to upgrade a “professional” machine. That’s a problem. Not for you? Ok, the person that uses pages.app on their iPad thinks that’s plenty machine for their “professional writing/editing” and therefor, programmers like you should get with their program and be fine with iPad power. The professional tarp is broader than just programmers or any one sector, and as such, those machines need to be more, not less adaptable. Storage adaptability goes hand and hand with that. Apple ignored this in their disaster its trashcan Mac and had to do an embarrassing mea culpa because so many pros are abandoning the platform. Being tone deaf to their needs just because it works for some, is exactly how they got lead into the dead end thermal corner with the Mac Pro. I posit, they should avoid repeating the G4 cube/trashcan Mac Pro debacle with their pro laptops, and limiting primary mass storage options is doing just that. As always, ymmv May 26, 2017 at 7:45 EDT PM Lee Dronick May 26, 2017 There is talk of an update and perhaps they will greatly increase the RAM and storage. I was all set to buy one, my reward for meeting a weight loss goal. Instead I decided to put the money into some home improvements and limp along with my 2011 MacBook Pro. That was the basis for my luggable statement, my MBP is a beast compared to the newer models and I almost never use the built in optical drive. A thin and trim MBP to go with my thin and trim body. May 26, 2017 at 8:02 EDT PM BradMacPro May 26, 2017 I’m sure Apple would would tell you a Thunderbolt 3 connected external SSD or array of SSDs would be fast enough to handle data storage needs exceeding the internal capacity. May 26, 2017 at 8:58 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 @BradMacPro. Hehe. That argument worked out great for the trashcan Mac Pro: https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/the-new-mac-pro-is-a-failure May 26, 2017 at 9:22 EDT PM furbies May 26, 2017 I’m with you Mr Kheit And the other thing about the “fixed” SSD ? Repairability: If either the SSD or the Logic Board fails ? Dead SSD ? Just hope you have a backup ! Dead Logic Board ? Just hope you have a backup ! In either case ? Be prepared to buy a new laptop…… 🙁 May 26, 2017 at 10:19 EDT PM vr8ce May 27, 2017 You said you could drop a 4TB SSD drive in MBP right now, and you linked to an SSD drive. You can’t put that drive in a MBP. When called out on your inaccurate reporting, you link to OWC, whose chips on that page max out at 1 TB, or in other words half the capacity of the Touch, not double it. So, again, bad reporting. If you’re going to claim Apple could have put 4 TB of space in the MBP last year when they introduced it, then by all means provide a link to an actual shipping product that can actually be used in the MBP. Otherwise, you’re just a noise-maker. And you know even less than you appear to if you think hanging a “brick” off a MBP is necessary to get extra storage. Several companies make barely over thumb-sized SSD drives these days, including Samsung (one of which I have) and Sandisk (which I do not). The memory limit on the Touch is every bit as bad as the storage requirement, for all the same reasons. I have 16GB on a four-year old MBP; it’s unconscionable to still have that limit four years later. It may not be a big deal to you, but it is to others. Just as storage appears to be to you and isn’t to others. I agreed with the premise from the first — the non upgradability of memory and storage in the Touch is absolutely a failing of the product line, and of Apple to not recognize it as such. But outside that, the article is a bunch of noise and non-facts and a full year too late. May 27, 2017 at 2:45 EDT AM John Kheit May 27, 2017 You said you could drop a 4TB SSD drive in MBP right now, and you linked to an SSD drive. You can’t put that drive in a MBP. When called out on your inaccurate reporting, you link to OWC, whose chips on that page max out at 1 TB, or in other words half the capacity of the Touch, not double it. So, again, bad reporting. Um, I said you can put in a 4tb in the 2011 MBP and linked to the drive. And that’s in the article. And my rejoinder to you said that so what that the 2.5″ format isn’t usable because you can adapt an SSD stick to have that 4TB and showed you that OWC has done so with the Mac Pro, a machine that Apple never provided upgraded storage space. So bad reading. If you’re going to claim Apple could have put 4 TB of space in the MBP last year when they introduced it, then by all means provide a link to an actual shipping product that can actually be used in the MBP. Otherwise, you’re just a noise-maker. Way to move the goal posts. I didn’t make such claim. I pointed out that 4TB drives are currently available for the 2011 MBP and the point here is you can never upgrade the Touchbar MBP, so again, nice sophistry, not. And you know even less than you appear to if you think hanging a “brick” off a MBP is necessary to get extra storage. Several companies make barely over thumb-sized SSD drives these days, including Samsung (one of which I have) and Sandisk (which I do not)., Lol, yea, a small brick/wart. If you think that’s winning an argument, I’m happy you’re pleasing yourself in your own mind. But it’s errata. The memory limit on the Touch is every bit as bad as the storage requirement, for all the same reasons. I have 16GB on a four-year old MBP; it’s unconscionable to still have that limit four years later. It may not be a big deal to you, but it is to others. Just as storage appears to be to you and isn’t to others. Well at least this limit seems to be one dictated by Intel’s chipset’s inability to address more than that. And as long as Apple allows you to max addressable memory from the get-go, it’s better than nothing. Meaning, even if Apple put in a slot, and the chipset simply couldn’t address more than 16GB, it’s somewhat moot. That said, I too would prefer upgradeable RAM. I agreed with the premise from the first — the non upgradability of memory and storage in the Touch is absolutely a failing of the product line, and of Apple to not recognize it as such. But outside that, the article is a bunch of noise and non-facts and a full year too late.. I feel your comments earn even fewer stars. So enjoy that noise. 😀 May 27, 2017 at 4:05 EDT AM rg May 27, 2017 Trying to make a case that all “professional” users need replaceable disks is absurd. There is a small sub-set of users who will run out of space but they are a tiny fraction of all “professional” users. This is ridiculous (and quite offensive) self-importance by a tiny minority. Most “professional” users, who rely on their laptop to earn their living, are not going to run out of space. More likely that many “amateur” users who want to download and/or rip movies for fun will run out of space. I have been a “professional” user for well over 20 years and will never run out of space before I need to replace a laptop for other reasons, even though I totally depend on my MBP for my work. Every day. But wait there’s more. The argument is basically “we used to be able to do this so we are going to fight for it at any cost” I am old enough to remember the launch of the first PCs in the 1970s, and the incredible robust metal chassis and keyboard designed for 20 years use. And the matching unaffordable price. They were for “professional” users only and totally out of budget for anyone else. No-one would seriously expect a laptop or a phone to use a chassis and wiring that is totally replaceable and designed for a 20 year life any more. But we did, 40 years ago. I’m old enough to remember the kicking and screaming when for the first time each individual integrated circuit was direct soldered to the motherboard instead of in its own socket. Every time a company pushes the envelope we are told why it is a bad idea. Upgradeability and even repairability are not unlimited benefits – they have significant costs too. Far more cost than the price of the little socket. Unity design, without individual item focus, is a whole new design envelope that most people don’t understand because they only look backwards – the argument is a 1980’s argument. There is no problem about upgrading – never has been – but the way to do it is different and you have to learn to think in new ways. For some people new thinking simply isn’t going to be possible. The new way to upgrade is to change the hardware, and then transfer across all the software. All the hardware. If you are a “professional” user then when you run out of disk space you will also be wanting to replace the keyboard, perhaps upgrade ports, video capability etc. First thing to fail for me is usually the keyboard. If your old machine is still in good shape you sell it on Gazelle or a similar service. And finally – if you are indeed a “professional” earning your living with your tools then (a) you will value your tools and (b) the cost of a new laptop is simply not relevant. Equivalent to just a few minutes saved per day – a $2000 tool used daily for two years is costing you about $5 per working day – even before the tax breaks. If you can’t do even the basic cost-benefit calculation then do you really have the skills and attitude of a “professional” ? I don’t expect my devices to be upgradeable or repairable beyond common issues like a cracked screen on the phone. It simply is not a universally good use of resources – including design cost, manufacturing cost, total environmental impact, etc. Welcome to the future. Sell your old hardware and move on. The computer is the software and data, the hardware that surrounds them is replaceable. Russell May 27, 2017 at 4:17 EDT AM Jamie May 27, 2017 With all due respect, Russell, we are hardly a ‘small minority’ of pro users. The specs and limitations on this particular machine are just not appropriate for users whose needs will likely vacillate multiple times within the space of a *single* year, no one is going to shell out for multiple machines multiple times within that short of a time frame. We aren’t talking about programmers or people making spreadsheets, here. Though if you feel your needs are met, more power to you, your view really just comes off as sounding insular. It’s understandable that something as micro-engineered as a phone or small wearable would require specialized servicing. That logic doesn’t hold for something like this. To a professional a work machine is more than a pretty ‘appliance’. The Macbook Pro doesn’t make any more sense than the Trash Can Pro did in these terms. Apple can and should do better. May 27, 2017 at 12:15 EDT PM skywatcher May 27, 2017 Vr8ce is right! Much of the critique is old news and the market has gone way past it! Yet, it would be good to have upgradable drives, RAM, and replaceable batteries– and keyboards. One spill and you’re in deep trouble. In any case,, one thing we found offensive was the caption “A woman using Touch Bar on MacBook Pro” Weird! Just plain irrelevant. Just curious. Have you all ever run a caption for a photo: “A man using Touch Bar on MacBook Pro” or “A man using an iPad” or anything else?! LOL! 😎 May 27, 2017 at 2:04 EDT PM John Kheit May 27, 2017 @RG, sure, i made the case for “all” professionals. I might find your comments reasonable if they just weren’t so provably lame. Apple tried to limit Pro users with the Cube and the trashcan mac, both met with disaster. Particularly the trashcan mac, which was plagued with needing a rats nest of external storage (and heck, that wasn’t even a portable machine), and so lame that Apple had to have a press conference basically to acknowledge what a disaster that design is. So since you’re sure that closed approach will definitely work for sure this time, you know, trying the same thing over and over and expecting results different than pros abandoning the mac, we can leave it at we disagree. @skywatcher, Thanks for demonstrating with rare clarity, just how much you missed the point. As always, YMMV. Cheers! 😀 May 27, 2017 at 5:01 EDT PM Rick Allen May 27, 2017 Semantics aside. There is no excuse for the hubris of Apple offering disposable machines to Pro users. I still have a 2010 Mac Pro (My second one as I made mistake of selling first one). This is the best machine Apple ever made. I have upgraded it many times and am going to keep upgrading it. I have PCI/E SSD boot drive, Modern AC networking, USB 3 card and a modern NVidia GPU. The real failing of the “Pro” line of Mac computers is the anathema of Apple to use standard or even custom parts that can be swapped out and upgraded. I want a workhorse machine that has enough upgradability and longevity to make it last for years. I don’t want the new anorexic MacBook Pro with keyboard that has many failures. They tried to get too cute and artsy with that machine and it does not have battery life, a keyboard prone to failure and no upgrade path. I have a 2012 I7 maxed out MacBook pro and I won’t buy another one if this is what Apple is going to put out. May 27, 2017 at 5:48 EDT PM mick May 27, 2017 I can’t believe all of those dinosaurs on here, including the author, complaining about a lack of storage on their portable devices. Seriously? What kind of professional user works permanently disconnected? All of those creative content pros that sit in the park working on 15Tb project files – those ones? What a load of rubbish. Just because you joined the industry long before cloud storage, wireless networks, or even wired networks were around, doesn’t mean that vendors should support your old habits. Keeping all your files on a portable device is the most ridiculous concept in 2017 – not to mention a security and productivity risk to your organisation. Lose the laptop and lose all your work. My colleagues and I all use the current 15″ MBP with 1Tb SSD. None of us come anywhere near using all of that and many of them are working on large media files. I’m sure there are professionals working on much larger projects, but why they would require storing all their work on a single device which can be stolen or damaged is a mystery. Secure your work on the server. Invest in decent broadband. I can’t believe the number of articles I read on on Mac sites that complain about the direction Apple is going in. Go buy a PC or keep your outdated gripes to yourself. May 27, 2017 at 8:00 EDT PM John Kheit May 27, 2017 I’m sure you and your “colleagues” are busy making very very high quality and sassy gifs, but those creative that work with more than that, might need a bit more storage for say their video needs. You know mick, if Apple had read this article: https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/the-new-mac-pro-is-a-failure They might have avoided the embarrassment of this: https://www.macrumors.com/2017/04/06/mac-pro-interview-full-transcript/ Enjoy your 1TB drive, who could ever want more than that, or 640K 🙄 Bill Gates approves. May 27, 2017 at 8:16 EDT PM Lee Dronick May 27, 2017 Professionals come in a number of models and configurations. It would help if when referring to yourself if you would say writer, illustrator, video editor, journalist, photographer, or whatever. May 27, 2017 at 8:40 EDT PM Jayme Capurso May 27, 2017 “Go buy a PC or keep your outdated gripes to yourself.” And that is exactly what many long term mac users have done or are considering doing and many of them are speaking out in the hope Apple will hear them somehow from with their arrogance vacuum! You and Apple can spin it however you like, modular offers more options than a closed design, more options will suit the needs of more people which means more sales. Apple has forgotten their own mantra ‘form follows function’ and now its ‘form over function’. Or rather ‘Profits over function’ which given Tim (bean counter) Cook is trying to fill visionary shoes is not in the least surprising! I predict a new player will enter the market to serve the users Apple once did and that will make Apple and this conversation irrelevant! May 27, 2017 at 9:08 EDT PM Lee Dronick May 27, 2017 It isn’t like Apple is struggling financially with the products that they are offering. if the “professionals” left how much would hurt Apple’s bottom line. May 27, 2017 at 9:38 EDT PM John Kheit May 28, 2017 Lee. True, financially they are doing great. And if the Pros left, I think it would affect probably less than 1% of their revenue, if that…at least initially. However, I think it’s good to remember that John Scully had record revenues in the years after firing Steve Jobs. Scully was coasting off Steve Job’s work before the bottom fell out and the company almost went under. Just because the financials today are good, doesn’t mean they will be good in another 5-10 years. And I guarantee you, if a sizable number of creative/pro’s leave, they will have an outsized impact on others, over time. Pros affect way more sales and influence in far greater numbers than direct sales to that segment would suggest, IMO. May 28, 2017 at 2:06 EDT AM Michael Siever May 28, 2017 Aside from their apparel, Steve Jobs and Tim Cook couldn’t be less polar opposites of each other. From what I’ve heard about Steve Jobs, he was a major jerk towards his employees, but man, was he a visionary! Tim Cook I have heard is super nice to his employees, but boy howdy, does he stink as a businessman! The only reason that could possibly explain why he hasn’t been ousted yet by the shareholders is because he *is* the majority shareholder. Between the removal of the SD card port on the latest MBP iterations, the non-removable SSDs on the higher tier MBP models, the decision to go with all USB-C ports on the MBP just after the most recent iPhone refresh was released with lightning port and not USB-C, the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack on the latest iPhone, and the lack of touchscreen capabilities on any of their MacOS-based computers, if Tim Cook’s Apple is trying to be pioneers like Steve Jobs’ Apple, they’ve clearly strayed far away from the trail as of right now. May 28, 2017 at 2:57 EDT AM mick May 28, 2017 Then scurry off to buy your big professional Windows laptops with lots of local storage then. You never answered why you need so much storage on a portable device. I’m all ears. What special projects are you working on that you need to store more than 1Tb LOCALLY? Do you not have a corporate SAN? Can you not afford a NAS box? Is your broadband slow and flakey? Do you do your remote work in a McDonalds? I am genuinely interested in what kind of work you do that requires you to keep that much with you when you are disconnected. This has nothing to do with the Bill Gates quote concerning 640K. We all work with large datasets and massive media files – we just do it while connected where the files are secure and backed up. The world has moved on. You might have heard of cloud computing? Maybe not I suspect it has nothing to do with reality. You all just love to pretend that apple used to be this or that and you were there when it was cool to be a rebel. Sorry those days are over. Apple are dead mainstream these days. Professionals choose the tools they need for the job – primarily MacBooks and azure cloud solutions in our case. We don’t care who the vendor is. We are reasonably new to mac and our staff are happy with the choice. Sorry to interrupt your circle jerk. Please continue to use Apple forums to bag out the company you used to love so much May 28, 2017 at 3:36 EDT AM Lee Dronick May 28, 2017 I am genuinely interested in what kind of work you do that requires you to keep that much with you when you are disconnected. Mick that was the basis for my comment about identifying ourselves as what professional field. Someone writing literature is going to have different portable computing needs than someone working in video. Even then I would rather do extensive work at a desktop than at “portable location” even if I had a portable hooked to an external monitor and keyboard. I used to work in graphic arts, these days I mostly yell at the kids on my lawn and turn off lights in empty rooms (HUE and HomeKit help with that). I want a new MacBook, be it a pro model or less, to get out of the house and play around. I have a 2011 MBP, but it is getting slow and I very much like the Touchbar It has been quite a while since I have seen this many comments on a MacObserver story which is a good thing. We used to get email notifications when there was a comment and that helped keep the conversation going, but that seems to no longer work. Do I need to change a setting or something? May 28, 2017 at 10:37 EDT AM lemon4611 May 28, 2017 Apple has taken the closed system to a perverted level. Hard drives, ram and video cards should be expandable. By forcing one to only be able to upgrade at the time of purchase with only Apple making the upgrade is not just greedy it will prove fatal for Apple. Cook has damaged Apple’s integrity with some decisions that Jobs would have had nothing but contempt for. El Captain and Sierra show that Apple is ending it’s relationship with the customer base that has been loyal from day one. Cook’s team has degraded the hardware, can’t release any OS on any platform that isn’t half assed at best. For profits sake only the hardware prices stay high while the technology used lags far behind. Apple will soon burst their own bubble as they condition us to move away to competitive offerings even if it means giving up the “at present” edge it has with the App store and developers. Developers will migrate with the customer. When your computing needs are not based on current trends then Linux opens all of the doors Apple is shutting. Sorry Apple but you have become the definition of hypocrisy as you mix business with politics, play both sides of the field and gouge the masses with products that no longer pass the Jobs Test. Mac pro / Newton Apple Watch / newton MacBook Pro / Newton …….. May 28, 2017 at 12:54 EDT PM John Kheit May 28, 2017 @Mick, I need more than 1TB because I do more than work with GIFs. I did give you one. Video professionals, when they composite video they work on while traveling will frequently need well over 1TB of video, and the more storage they have, the better. Non local storage tends to be too slow, or counter to the purpose of a small svelte laptop. Again, your arguments of 1TB should be enough for anyone not only fly in the fact of reality for many creative professionals, they go down in the pantheon of super great ideologies like ‘640k should be enough for anyone’—bill gates. The cloud doesn’t cut it for applications where you need super fast local access, and those are many for professionals, and video work is one such creative field. And being attached to a san while you travel is not a realistic luggable option. The reality is that professionals are leaving the mac in significant numbers precisely due to it’s lack of expandability with regard to the mac pro. Now apple is making that same mistake with the MacBook pro. May 28, 2017 at 1:13 EDT PM Lee Dronick May 29, 2017 The reality is that professionals are leaving the mac in significant numbers Can you give us any links to studies on that? May 29, 2017 at 9:07 EDT AM Macsee May 29, 2017 Apple should release new Mac models every year, as done with iOS gadgets. Macs should have standard connectors allowing upgradable components, including SSD, RAM, CPU and GPU. And last but not least, Apple should not charge two to three times more for the very same component when compared to resellers like Amazon. May 29, 2017 at 1:04 EDT PM joe297 May 29, 2017 Agreed John! And a sincere Thank You Mr. Kheit for having the courage to point it out and defend your position! The unexpectedly large number of complaints about the new models seem like background noise by comparison. Why? Tho not ideal, you can workaround most with a few dongles or extra power supply. But the soldered-in SSD is the only one that truly limits the usefulness & useful life of the machine! Cloud Storage isn’t a cure-all: I’m an engineer & programmer. Most of my customer sites are government, pharmaceutical, military, & health care. These generally aren’t supportive of Cloud Storage. It may be viable for other professions. But it assumes: 1- Cloud access is always available. 2- Cloud file transfer speeds are always fast enough to be practical. 3- You’re permitted to store customer database files in the cloud. 4- You’re allowed to use a USB stick from a computer with cloud access. 5- Your cloud solution is safe from hackers at HIPAA or gov’t levels. 6- The time needed to upload local files, delete local files to free space, download needed cloud files, etc is fast enough to justify the smaller storage. Yes I could’ve said “file management” but think about what that actually means with multiple sites, large databases, & downtime. Go PC as a post suggested: I’ve been a huge Mac fan since Steve Jobs triumphant return to Apple in the late 90s. I bought my 1st Mac in 2000 and have owned many since. Many of my customers (schools, universities) use both Mac & PC. So it helps to be familiar with our products on both platforms. I use Parallels Desktop on my 2012 15” MacBook Pro Retina to run several Windows VMs. If I wanted to use a PC notebook I certainly could. But only if I have no recourse. Budget concerns: I have a limited budget & can’t buy top of the line. Add to that management & IT Dept pushing for less expensive PC notebooks with the same or higher specs. The way I convinced them with my 2012 15” Retina MacBook Pro was to request the entry model; knowing I could upgrade storage later if needed. It still cost a bit more than a similar spec PC notebook of its day. But not terribly so. Entry models: My 2012 15” Retina entry model vs the latest: 2012: 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM, 1GB Nvidia, 2.3GHz i7, $2000 2016: 256GB SSD, 16GB RAM, 2GB Radeon, 2.6GHz i7, $2400 5 years on and the 15″ entry model is still 256GB SSD storage?! No, I don’t have fewer customers, I have more. Their jobsites & databases have grown, not shrunk. 512GB would be more appropriate given the other increases. The 2012 entry model storage can be upgraded both internally and via slower, flush mount, SD card storage. But the 2016 15” entry model does away with both solutions. Bottom line: I’m holding out hope that Apple will offer a 15” entry model with a larger, upgradeable (non-soldered in) SSD. If it means giving up the Touchbar as with the 13” entry model, that seems a fair trade. May 29, 2017 at 3:41 EDT PM John Kheit May 30, 2017 @Lee. I do not know of any studies, and I don’t think Apple breaks out numbers on individual models much less groups of buyers. As far as I know I’m the only one that’s done some investigation on this. I have been in the MacRumors Mac Pro forums for years and years and noticed that many of the die-hard mac pros were leaving. In 2 of my articles I cite to the threads where mac pros were leaving and you can see some excerpts in those articles from the threads or read through the threads yourself: https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apples-failure-to-scale/page2 https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/the-new-mac-pro-is-a-failure/page3 There was also a poll about how successful or not the trashcan Mac Pro was to such pro users, and it was quite ugly a result considering how ‘pro’ the users were towards apple in years past: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/is-the-new-mac-pro-a-failure.1939541/ Then there was this poll if pro users though apple was abandoning the pro market, also with an ugly result: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/more-evidence-apple-is-abandoning-the-pro-market.1953013/ Worse yet, since then I did a little more investigation and found pro users leaving in even higher numbers, and that the mac ecosystem really breaks down quite fast for pros. We discussed it on the pop.0 podcast here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEFdvgcudpE There were numerous other threads I’ve seen there over time, and I don’t remember them all, but the vibe has been growing from a small murmur as early as 2010/11 to a roar around 2015… https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/why-apple-now-sucks-for-creative-mac-users.1768458/ May 30, 2017 at 1:32 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

The vacation blackout window generally fits with Apple’s typical iPhone release cycle, but the actual dates seem odd, so we’re taking this memo with a big grain of salt. Apple employee time off blackout memo fits with iPhone 8 September launch The memo comes from Benjamin Geskin who has been fairly prolific with iPhone 8-related leaks over the past few weeks. Here’s the memo: The upcoming months are going to be very exciting for all of us and for our customers! As you know, there are new product announcements and launches in September. In anticipation of the upcoming events and the corresponding heightened call volume expected, we will be increasing our stall across all of our programs over the summer. In order to support our client during this very important time of year, we will be implementing Black Out Days in all AppleCare programs for Advisors and Leaders. The upcoming black out dates will be September 17 through November 4. Keep in mind that these dates are subject to change as our support volume expectations fluctuate. We will keep you advised of any black-out date changes and additions as soon as we are made aware of new initiatives. What are Black Out Days? Black Out Days are days in which we expect call volume to be at the highest, and we need all hands on deck. Advisors and Leaders will be restricted from requesting days off for Paid Time Off (PTO) and Unpaid Time Off. It is extremely important that everyone works their assigned scheduled days during this period – absences are unacceptable. Once you get past the “client” reference—which could imply contractors working as part of the AppleCare team, or an english as a second language reference to customers—the black out window dates are just weird. They start on a Sunday, and run through the entire month of October. Typically, Apple’s iPhone launch time off black outs run about two weeks from the device’s release, and they historically start on weekdays. What we can say for sure is that previous iPhone launches have come in September, and Apple employees are prohibited from taking time off for a couple weeks after to deal with new user questions and problems. This memo, legit or not, generally fits with that pattern, but until we see more proof to back it up we aren’t going to ink those dates in on our calendar.

Such a chip could give Apple a significant leg up deploying device-centric-AI, and if it succeeds, few of its competitors could respond. The chip is known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, according to Bloomberg’s unnamed sources. The story doesn’t include a target date, or even how far along the project is. The chip, “would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition,” according to the piece. But let’s talk about why this is important, because that’s a lot more fun. The Whole AI Widget Apple was dismissed as a serious chip maker when reports first surfaced the company was developing its own ARM chip for iPhones. It turns out Apple is really, really good at chip design. No small part of that is rooted in the fact that Apple can custom design both the hardware and the software to meet its exact needs. Apple also has enough volume that it can have these chips made cost effectively. No other company can do this in today’s tech landscape. That’s been huge in the smartphone business, and it could be just as huge in the device-centric AI space. Areas where Apple can focus this chip include security, processing power, and battery efficiency. All three are incredibly important, and no company can match Apple on this because Apple controls the whole widget. Device-Centric AI vs. Cloud AI Apple’s competitors are relying on the cloud for AI-related processing. That’s great in terms of throwing processors at the AI problem, but it carries significant compromises in terms of security and privacy. Amazon’s and Google’s home wiretap devices listen in on you, the product’s, lives. Those devices then send data to those company’s cloud servers, and Big Brother smiles in delight. Apple handles as much as it can local to your device, keeping the data is needs to know about you, the customer, with you. It sends only anonymized data to its servers using differential privacy, improving your personal privacy. Apple currently does a lot of this processing with its A-series of processors and the powerful GPUs on each device. A powerful, dedicated AI chip might allow Apple to do even more processing local to your device, increasing the company’s privacy edge. Apple could also use a custom AI chip to make its devices all that more power efficient. The company already does a lot by turning off components for even microseconds when they’re not being used. A custom chip will further Apple’s control over what’s used when. For each task an appropriate processor—it’s a power-maniac’s wet dream. Apple’s Long AI Game Apple has been playing a long game with AI. That long game has allowed Amazon’s AI shortcut, Alexa, to gain a foothold, but developments like a dedicated AI chip would give Apple a significant edge. It’s possible nothing will come of the Apple Neural Engine—the company routinely kills projects for a variety of reasons. I hope, however, that Mr. Gurman’s sources have it right and that Apple is able to bring this chip to an Apple device near me. Device-centric AI benefits us all.

I’m hoping Apple will give us a decent improvement in capability & accuracy soon (June?) with voice recognition at least, with AI (Siri) not far behind. May 27, 2017 at 1:05 EDT AM Dean Lewis May 28, 2017 This is good insight. The long game is critical, especially so Apple can stick as much to it’s security promises as possible. I hear a lot of negativity about Siri, and I try to point out this long game myself. Particularly I point to this article from last year that interviews three of Apple’s high muckymucks and really goes into their ideas of where they are going. This chip appears to be another part of that strategy. https://backchannel.com/an-exclusive-look-at-how-ai-and-machine-learning-work-at-apple-8dbfb131932b May 28, 2017 at 12:30 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS US Edition News Reviews Insights TechRadar Laptops/PCs Printers Hardware Software Mobile Working Security Networks Data Centre VPN Hands on: Voyo VMac Mini PC review A rival to the Mac Mini, you say? Not yet rated By Desire Athow PC & Mac  Shares What is a hands on review? Our Early Verdict If you can live with a relatively noisy computer, then Voyo’s VMac Mini may well be the compact PC you’re waiting for given its superb hardware configuration. For Great value for money Superb design Support for 2.5-inch HDD Fast M.2 SSD Against No Wi-Fi out of the box Review unit was noisy Windows 10 already registered 4K support at 29Hz only You can’t fault Voyo for trying its best: the Chinese company is attempting to differentiate itself from the constellation of other PC makers out there, unveiling the Voyo VMac Mini PC earlier this year. The name is obviously a crystal clear reference to Apple’s popular Mac Mini. Not that Voyo’s PC looks like Apple’s box of tricks. The VMac is smaller at 120 x 120 x 27mm and is available in metallic blue, aurora silver, ‘luxury’ gold or champagne gold colours, not just the standard silver aluminium look.  This isn’t Voyo’s first attempt to create a different mini PC, either. Last year’s Voyo V3 left a lasting impression: hardly bigger than a CD box, it packed some serious punch for the price and had only minor issues. Online Chinese retailer, Geekbuying, sent us a sample for review and sells the VMac Mini for £181 (or $233). Note that, while this price includes delivery, it is exclusive of any taxes that may be levied by HMRC or the courier companies on behalf of the vendor. Want to buy tech from online Chinese retailers? Read this first. The VMac Mini has, therefore, a lot to live up to – the 1-litre chassis of the computer is entirely made of metal and acts as a heatsink to dissipate extra heat (more on that later). There’s a Voyo logo on top with the obligatory Intel Inside sticker, four rubber feet on the bottom, with a power button on one side (plus a white status LED), and on the opposite side are all the connectors: three USB 3.0 ports, an audio socket, a mini-HDMI connector, a microSD card slot, a GbE LAN port and the power supply socket. We’re pleasantly surprised by the choice of ports provided by the device. There’s no USB 2.0 (for a change), a microSD reader (which removes the need for a connector) and a fast Ethernet port. It’s only a shame about the proprietary PSU port. The VMac Mini uses a 36W (12v, 3A) power supply unit, a higher than expected wattage that’s explained by the components found inside the device. At its heart is an Intel Pentium N4200, an Apollo Lake CPU with four cores, four threads, a TDP of 6W, a base clock frequency of 1.1GHz and a burst frequency of 2.5GHz. It also has 2MB of L2 cache and integrated Intel HD Graphics 505, clocked between 200MHz and 750MHz, with 18 execution units. Roughly speaking it’s a souped-up version of the Core M-5Y51 – the CPU found in the amazing Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro – with twice the core count but half the cache. It is worth noting that while the graphics can run 4K at 60Hz, we could only manage 4K at 29Hz on our test PC. The VMac’s CPU is actively cooled by a fan that has a rather high variable pitch and was active for most of the duration of our hands-on review. It was distracting to say the least, and there didn’t seem to be any way of mitigating that irritating whir. Next to the processor is a single 4GB DDR3 RAM module, which can be expanded to 8GB. Sadly, although the N4200 supports two memory channels, there’s only one DIMM slot. What sets apart the VMac Mini from the rest of the competition, and explains the high wattage PSU, is the fact that this mini PC can take a laptop drive (2.5-inch SATA) in addition to the 128GB M.2 2280 SSD and the embedded 32GB eMMC flash storage. Still, we don’t understand the logic of having eMMC flash storage in addition to the SSD – although it does open the way for multiple SKUs (one with flash memory only, one with SSD and flash, and the other with SSD and hard disk drive). The device ran a licensed version of Windows 10 Home which we found to be already registered, a common practice among Chinese manufacturers and something we neither condone nor encourage. The PC logged straight into desktop mode without asking for a password. Unfortunately we couldn’t get Wi-Fi to work at all on the VMac Mini. This is likely to be down to a defective component rather than Windows itself as Bluetooth – which is usually serviced by the same card – was unavailable as well. Expect the device to deliver 802.11n Wi-Fi. When it came to sheer performance, we couldn’t fault Voyo’s mini PC. This is a solid device that will run almost any office or business applications without flinching thanks to a capable processor and a surprisingly nippy storage subsystem. In terms of benchmarks, its CPU-Z single and multi-thread scores are far ahead of the Dell Latitude 12 7202 which is powered by the Intel Core M-5Y71. The Atto benchmark also returned some very good read/write numbers thanks to the M.2 SSD, even higher than the SSD inside the Asus AsusPro B9440UA laptop managed.  Other tests we performed (Passmark, Cinebench, Novabench and CrystalDiskMark) cemented the belief that Voyo may well have struck a sweet spot with the VMac Mini. Early verdict We’ve got mixed feelings about this one. On the one hand, the Voyo VMac Mini will appeal to businesses looking for a reasonably well-specced workstation with oodles of local storage and an affordable price tag.  However, the lack of Wi-Fi out of the box is frustrating, and the noisy fan is equally annoying at times. While you can add a USB Wi-Fi dongle to your device, you cannot really do anything to mitigate the boisterous cooler. Voyo should solve these two issues in the next version of this PC to hit the jackpot. Truth be told, though, none of the existing competitors we’ve tested lately (like the Chuwi HiBox) have the quality of components found in the VMac Mini.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Case about the Downing of an Air Egypt Flight related to Apple Devices is still ongoing with Apple not Involved | Main | Apple Opened their First Singapore Store Today with 237 Staff and Angela Ahrendts Greeting Happy Customers » May 26, 2017 Apple's advances in AI Continue to Surface at a Record Pace as news of a 'Neural Engine' Chip now Emerges   Even though Apple was the first major tech company to adopt a digital assistant for use in their smartphone natively, progress on this front seemed to be at a snails pace. Then out of nowhere Amazon shocked the market with a smarter digital assistant on a home device called Echo. Google Home rapidly followed and their latest upgrade will offer free phone calls within the U.S. and Canada and deeper connectivity to Android. Now Microsoft, Harman Kardon and many tech companies are jumping on the bandwagon with new smart home digital assistant based devices aimed to land on the market this fall.   Even Samsung has technically jumped into the market with Bixby in the last month on their Galaxy S8 that they promise will be integrated into future devices and appliances as part of their IoT roadmap. In fact a new design patent that surfaced on May 16 shows us that they have an advanced Echo-like device with a full flexible display on the drawing board that could run Android as their patent figures suggest below.   We noted in a report back on May 11 that the AI Wars were almost reaching Fever Pitch levels. Almost ever week if not every day there's an AI story surfacing. On May 14 Apple aquired their third major AI company in three years. On the same day we posted a patent report titled "Apple has designed a new Siri Architecture allowing Two Digital Assistants to Communicate with Each Other." Last month we posted a patent report tiled "Apple Patent Reveals a Visual System to Assist Siri in Future Devices to understand Gestures, Activities, & More"   At the top of this month we posted a report titled "Inventec Lands First Order for Apple's Echo-Like Home Device with Siri." Although it's a supply chain rumor, Apple fans hope that this could be a big moment at Apple's WWDC in June. Some believe it will launch this fall. Yet what matters is that Apple brings a new Siri based device into the home to support their Smart Home project and to keep the competition at bay.   Google is crafting the argument that they are the one's to beat in AI without question. Patently Apple covered Google's vision in two reports titled "The Vision of Artificial Intelligence According to the Gospel of Google" and "The Google Manifesto: The Arrival of the AI Revolution."   Apple supplier TSMC sees some of the sand beginning to shift into new directions. Co-CEO Mark Liu.Mobile let if be known last month that while smartphones will still drive the market for them in the short term, that new and innovative features for smartphones and other mobile devices including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), context-aware computation, and artificial intelligence (AI) and deep machine learning require support of more powerful computing technology." Translation: new chips are on their roadmap to power new technologies and features like VR/AR and AI.   The hint of new advanced chips coming to market gave way this afternoon to a new report by Bloomberg claiming that "Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition." So now the chip will have a name.   The timing of this latest leak about the Apple Neural Engine may have been timed perfectly to start cranking up their developers and fans for the WWDC keynote on June fifth.   The news of advances to Siri in the works have been mounting so fiercely in the last few months that it's now time for Team Apple to knock one out of the park and set their developers on fire for the next phase of Apple AI.   On the flip-side, it's always best to not get over-hyped about anything Apple until it actually unfolds. We know positive things are in the works and they'll roll out whenever Apple is ready to unleash them. But I have to admit, I'm definitely pumped-up for next month's event – are you?   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Problem Solving | 22 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (20) Never Be Late or Forget a Task Again with “Take Control of Calendar and Reminders” by Scholle McFarland [Tonya Engst here. Little is more embarrassing than showing up late for a meeting or missing an important deadline due to forgetfulness. The go-to solution for Apple users is to offload your fallible human memory to Apple’s Calendar and Reminders apps, which are built into macOS and iOS. But even worse than forgetting a meeting or task is messing up due to a misconfiguration or misunderstanding in Calendar and Reminders. Been there, done that. These apps are the focus of the first Take Control book to be published since we sold the series: Scholle McFarland’s $10 “Take Control of Calendar and Reminders.” It’s a classic Take Control title that explains all you need to know about real-world usage of these heavily used but under-documented apps. I helped Scholle develop and edit the book, learning a lot about Calendar and Reminders that I didn’t know along the way. To give you a taste of her advice, here’s a slightly modified excerpt from the troubleshooting chapter, which addresses a few common problems that can prevent you from using Calendar and Reminders successfully. Whether you’re suffering from one of these problems now, suspect that a family member is, or want to avoid future mishaps, read on for Scholle’s solutions to some common conundrums!] How Can I Change the Default Calendar for New Events on My Mac? -- If new events are showing up in the wrong calendar, choose Calendar > Preferences > General and then pick a calendar from the Default Calendar pop-up menu at the bottom of the preference pane. Now, whenever you create a new event, it will appear in this calendar automatically. Note that the default, Selected Calendar, adds new events to whatever calendar you last selected, which can produce some unexpected results. Why Do Events I Add with My iPhone End Up on the Wrong Calendar on My Mac? -- When you add events with an iPhone, you can use Siri or do it in the Calendar app. Either way, events are placed in your iPhone’s default calendar, so make sure you’ve designated the one you want to use. On your iPhone, tap Settings > Calendar > Default Calendar and choose the calendar you want from the list. How Do I Prevent Calendar Spam? -- It started in November 2016. Suddenly, Mac users were inundated with calendar spam — bogus event invitations from counterfeit companies hawking cut-rate Ray Bans, Ugg boots, and other supposed bargains, often in Chinese (see “How to Stop iCloud Calendar Spam,” 29 November 2016). Calendar spammers take advantage of the macOS and iOS feature that scans Mail messages for calendar invitations and then sends you a notification. What’s worse, if you click Accept, Decline, or Maybe, you notify the spammer that your account is real and ready for more. To prevent calendar spam, log in to iCloud.com, click Calendar, click the Settings icon (it’s a red gear), and choose Preferences > Advanced. Then, change the Receive Event Invitations radio button to Email To email address. Now, instead of appearing as notifications, calendar invitations will run through your email account, which undoubtedly checks for spam. You can also safely delete messages there without alerting the spammer. How Do I Remove Duplicate Events? -- If you open the Calendar app and your calendar is littered with duplicate events, try this: On the Mac, choose View > Refresh Calendars (or press Command-R). Or, on your iOS device, tap Calendars to see your list of calendars. Swipe down to refresh. If that doesn’t work, check whether you have an On My Mac calendar that is identical to one of your iCloud calendars. Hide it by deselecting it in the Calendars list and see if duplicates disappear. If they do, you can either keep this calendar hidden or delete the calendar altogether by Control-clicking its name in the Calendars list and choosing Delete. How Do I Delete Duplicate Birthdays? -- If Calendar’s special Birthdays calendar shows a birthday more than once, you can remove the extras. First, on the Mac, choose Calendar > Preferences > General. Deselect the Show Birthdays Calendar checkbox and select it again. If that doesn’t work, duplicate contacts are probably to blame. Open the Contacts app and choose Card > Look for Duplicates. If the app finds them, choose Merge. You may need to repeat this step. If some duplicate birthdays still appear in Calendar, go into Contacts and manually delete the stubborn duplicates that the app is unable to detect. Your duplicate birthdays should disappear. How Do I Get Rid of Duplicate iCloud Calendars? -- If identical iCloud calendars appear to be multiplying like bunnies, first try launching Calendar and choosing View > Refresh Calendars. If you are having trouble verifying whether two calendars have completely duplicated events, try making them different colors (Control-click a calendar in the Calendars list to pick a color). Deselect all other calendars in your Calendars list besides these two. Now you can scan more easily to check for non-duplicated events. If you find a non-duplicated event, move it to the calendar you want to keep. If you are sure you need to de-duplicate, log in to iCloud.com, click Calendar, and see if the duplicate calendars appear in the list there: If duplicates appear on the iCloud Web site: To be safe, go back to your Calendar app and make a backup of each of the affected calendars by selecting them in turn and choosing File > Export > Export to create calendar (.ics) files labeled with their names. Once that’s done, go to iCloud.com and delete the duplicate calendar(s) from the Web site, by clicking Edit at the bottom of the calendar list and then clicking the Remove button next to a calendar. A warning asks you if you’re sure. If you are, click Delete. Now, return to the app and refresh your calendars by pressing Command-R. Duplicates should disappear. If duplicates don’t appear on the iCloud Web site: That means the problem is on your end. Choose Calendar > Accounts, click iCloud, and deselect Calendars. Your iCloud calendars disappear from the Calendars list. Then, choose Calendar > Accounts, click iCloud, and select Calendars. As iCloud re-populates your calendar data, this time it should get it right. How Do I Move a Calendar to Another Computer? -- Here’s the beauty of cloud accounts such as iCloud or Google: your calendars show up on any other device that’s connected to that account, no effort required. If you use local On My Mac calendars, though, and want to move one to another computer, you must export a copy and then import it elsewhere. To export a calendar so you can move it to another computer, share it with someone else, or make a local backup: Select the calendar’s name in the Calendars list. Choose File > Export > Export. Choose a location and then click Export. The events are exported to a calendar (.ics) file. Here’s how to import a calendar (.ics) file: Create a new calendar that will hold this file’s events, or choose an existing calendar you want to add its events to. Make sure your choice is selected in the Calendars list. Choose File > Import. (You can import a calendar archive (.icbu) file with the File > Import command, but when you do, it replaces all of your current calendar and reminders information, so make sure you get a .ics file here.) Select the calendar file and then click Import. Alternatively, drag a calendar file from the Finder to the Calendar window to add its events to whichever calendar is selected in the Calendars list. How Can I Merge Calendars? -- If you were over-enthusiastic about making calendars, so long as they are stored in the same account (or are all in On My Mac), you can merge them after the fact. Select one of the calendars in the Calendars list and choose Edit > Merge Calendar. Calendars that you can add events to appear in the submenu. If you can’t merge the two calendars you want, instead consolidate them by exporting the contents of one and then importing it into another, as described earlier in this excerpt. Why Won’t My Calendar Show Maps or Travel Time? -- To see travel time related to a calendar event, you must turn on Location Services on the device where you are working with the event: Mac: Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy. Click Location Services, and then click the lock icon and enter your administrator name and password at the prompt. Click Location Services. Then, in the list to the right, select the checkbox next to Calendars. iOS: Open the Settings app, tap Privacy > Location Services, and turn on the Location Services switch. Still on the Location Services screen, tap Calendar and ensure that Never is not selected. With these settings on, Calendar can determine your approximate location using information from Wi-Fi networks, and if your device has cellular data turned on, from the cellular network. Apple asserts that this is collected in a way that won’t personally identify you. Why Can’t I See Any of My Reminders on My iPhone? -- If you’re faced with a blank screen when you try to check reminders on your iPhone or another of your iOS devices, you may be saving them to iCloud elsewhere, but not be using iCloud on this one. Tap Settings > Your Name > iCloud. Now tap iCloud and make sure the Reminders switch is On. How Can I Get an “On My Mac” Option? -- If you want to store a calendar or reminders list locally on your Mac, you need to choose On My Mac from the submenu when you create the calendar or list. If you don’t see that choice, and you don’t have an On My Mac heading in the app’s left-hand Calendars list or sidebar, you can solve the problem by turning off all accounts associated with calendars or reminders and then turning them back on. To see an On My Mac option in Calendars: Go to Calendar > Preferences > Accounts. Select each account listed there in turn and uncheck the Enable This Account box. Your account-based calendars disappear from the Calendars list — do not be alarmed! In fact, if they don’t disappear, try quitting and relaunching Calendar. Choose File > New Calendar and a new calendar appears in your Calendars list under the header On My Mac. If you want to view your account-based calendars in addition to your On My Mac calendar, return to Calendar > Preferences > Accounts and select those accounts’ Enable This Account box. To see an On My Mac option in Reminders: Choose Reminders > Accounts to open the Internet Accounts pane of System Preferences. For each account listed at the left, select it and then see whether the Reminders checkbox is selected. If it is, deselect it. Your account-based lists disappear from the Reminders sidebar — this is okay! An On My Mac option appears. Return to the Internet Accounts pane and for each account where you do want to view its reminders on your Mac, select its Reminders checkbox. Solving any one or the above described problems may put your calendaring and remembering system back on track.

I've found the iOS option to have them display, but they only show until the time of the event. Once the event has passed they mysteriously disappear from the iOS calendar. This inconsistency between iOS and macOS calendars is driving me crazy. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 12:56 Hi Simon, Open Calendar on your iPhone, tap the word Calendars (in red) at the bottom of the screen. Then scroll all the way to the bottom. You'll see a Show Declined Events slider. Toggle that on. Declined events show up in your Inbox. (Which is a bit odd.) Go to Calendar's Year view, tap Inbox at the bottom of the screen, and then tap Replied. A list of events--Declined or not--should appear there. Does that work? Reply Simon  2017-05-23 13:21 Thanks, but as I already mentioned I know how to get them to display. That's not the problem. The problem is they only display in the calendar until the time of the event. However, once the event time passes, they mysteriously get removed from the calendar. So you have no way of going back and checking events in the past if you had declined them. This is highly inconsistent. The macOS calendar does not do this. Events there don't just disappear oon their own. To make matters worse, as far as I can tell there's no option to change this behavior. Apple just decided that nobody would ever need to know about a past event if they declined it. And we users are stuck that on iOS. Argh. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:23 Do you still see them in the Inbox, though? I can see my older declined events there. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:26 I do see older suggested events in my calendar (even from more than a year ago), but only if I didn't accept or decline them. (Once you tap Add To Calendar, they become a regular event.) Reply Simon  2017-05-23 13:28 No, only future events are listed there. Both accepted and declined, but nothing from the past. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:29 Actually, I see that the declined events in my Inbox are in the future (there's just no year with them). I'll research this some more. Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-23 12:32 I started using Reminders recently and was just getting into it when one day all my Reminders were gone. They weren't in iCloud and not on my computer. Just gone. Makes me hesitant to rely on it. Any idea what caused my reminders to disappear after working reliably for months? Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:00 There are a few things that might make this happen. Probably the most likely is that Reminders got turned off for an account. Go to Reminders > Accounts and click on the account the reminders belonged to (or take a look at all the accounts if you're not sure). Reminders should be selected in the account's list. If this is what happened, when you select Reminders for the account again, they will reappear. Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-23 13:36 I did what you said and checked Reminders. However, this did not cause the missing reminders to reappear, even after quitting and restarting Reminders. What else can I try? Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-23 13:40 A couple of questions: What kind of account were the missing reminders in (iCloud, On My Mac, etc)? Also, are they missing on a particular device or on all your devices (Mac, iPhone, etc.)? Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-23 14:11 I entered them into the Reminders app on my iMac. I never used them on iCloud or my iPhone. I have checked now and the iCloud and iPhone have similar lists (with no entries except a few completed items). On the iMac it's different--there's just nothing where there used to be several recurring reminders. Reply Tonya Engst   2017-05-25 19:00 Stan, do you think the problem is that your _list_ disappeared or is the list still around but the entries in it have disappeared? Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-26 20:07 I believe it was the entries. I don't remember creating any new lists--just used the default. Reply Tonya Engst   2017-05-30 18:31 Stan, I have to say that I am mystified. Even if you had checked off your reminders as done, they should still be available in the Completed section of the list (that section is available from the top, which you usually have to scroll up on the list to see). My only idea is that you have two lists with the same name, and one of them is in an account that isn't currently active, like Google or Yahoo. Reply Stan Hoffman  2017-05-31 14:09 Thanks for your response. No idea how I would have an account that's not active. Will poke around, but I'm a bit wary of entrusting reminders (especially ones several months out) to a program that makes them disappear so easily. Reply Peter U   2017-05-23 21:17 Do you discuss time zones in Apple's Calendar app? I moved from Europe to the US 10 years ago and never managed to change the time zone in Calendar (still on Central European time). Changing to Eastern Time messes up all my future (and past) appointments, i.e. moves them to 6 hours earlier. When I am in a different time zone I like to use the LOCAL time in my calendar not the time zone I live in. Not sure why the damn app doesn't understand that. Thanks :) Reply Peter U   2017-05-23 21:21 PS: I meant the macOS Calendar v7.0 (currently still in OS 10.9.5, sorry, different story). Reply Simon  2017-05-23 21:42 I've had exactly the same problem. It appears the problem is Calendar does not offer support for local time. It's hell bent on being smart so as soon as you move, either all your past or your future appointments will shift to weird times in your calendar. It's frustrating. Apparently it was designed by people who cannot imagine life beyond a single time zone. Reply Scholle Sawyer-McFarland  2017-05-24 12:06 Dealing with time zones is covered in the book.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

January 1, 2016 marked the biggest day in App Store history with customers spending over $144 million. It broke the previous single-day record set just a week earlier on Christmas Day. “The App Store had a holiday season for the record books. We are excited that our customers downloaded and enjoyed so many incredible apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, spending over $20 billion on the App Store last year alone,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “We’re grateful to all the developers who have created the most innovative and exciting apps in the world for our customers. We can’t wait for what’s to come in 2016.” Worldwide, the App Store has brought in nearly $40 billion for developers since 2008, with over one-third generated in the last year alone. Largely as a result of the App Store’s success, Apple is now responsible for creating and supporting 1.9 million jobs in the U.S. alone. Nearly three-quarters of those jobs — over 1.4 million — are attributable to the community of app creators, software engineers and entrepreneurs building apps for iOS, as well as non-IT jobs supported directly and indirectly through the app economy.* Apple has previously reported that the iOS app economy has created 1.2 million jobs in Europe and 1.4 million jobs in China. Gaming, Social Networking and Entertainment were among the year’s most popular App Store categories across Apple products, with customers challenging themselves to Minecraft: Pocket Edition, Trivia Crack and Heads Up!, and staying in touch with friends and family using Facebook Messenger, WeChat and Snapchat. Games and subscription apps dominated this year’s top grossing titles including Clash of Clans, Monster Strike, Game of War – Fire Age and Fantasy Westward Journey, as well as Netflix, Hulu and Match. The launch of the all-new Apple TV® and Apple Watch® have paved the way for entirely new app experiences, changing how people consume content through their television and providing useful information at a glance on Apple’s most personal device yet. Since its launch in October, the new Apple TV’s most popular apps include Rayman Adventures, Beat Sports and HBO NOW. Chart-topping apps for Apple Watch owners include fitness apps Nike+ Running and Lifesum, and iTranslate and Citymapper in the Travel category. *Job creation estimate based on research by Dr. Michael Mandel, Progressive Policy Institute. “App Economy Jobs in the United States,” January 6, 2016 Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.

The iOS App Development Center, to be located at a partner institution in Naples, will support teachers and provide a specialized curriculum preparing thousands of future developers to be part of Apple’s thriving developer community. In addition, Apple will work with partners around Italy who deliver developer training to complement this curriculum and create additional opportunities for students. Apple expects to expand this program to other countries around the world. “Europe is home to some of the most creative developers in the world and we’re thrilled to be helping the next generation of entrepreneurs in Italy get the skills they need for success,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “The phenomenal success of the App Store is one of the driving forces behind the more than 1.4 million jobs Apple has created in Europe and presents unlimited opportunities for people of all ages and businesses of all sizes across the continent.” Apple is a powerful engine of growth across Europe and the company’s ecosystem now supports more than 1.4 million jobs, including 1.2 million attributable to the community of app creators, software engineers and entrepreneurs building apps for iOS, as well as non-IT jobs supported directly and indirectly through the app economy.* The unprecedented growth of the App Store® has helped developers in Europe earn over €10.2 billion from selling their apps around the world. In Italy, over 75,000 jobs are attributable to the App Store and the developer community is vibrant. IK Multimedia launched its first app in 2009 and since then has had over 25 million downloads. Musement, launched in 2013, is now available in seven languages and 300 cities across 50 countries, making it easy for people to book travel and excursions on the go. Roberto Macina, CEO and founder of Qurami, said: “Apple’s continued innovation inspires us to create the best mobile experiences and make our customers’ lives just a little bit easier. Apple’s app ecosystem is the anchor for our business, and developing across Apple’s operating systems has enabled us to easily and quickly bring the Qurami experience to iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch users.” Thousands of companies are expanding because of their work with Apple, which supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in communities large and small across Europe. Milan-based Laboratorio Elettrofisico makes some of the most sophisticated magnetization equipment in the world and their technology enables some of the industry-leading magnetic features found in Apple products. Apple also works with Europe’s leading manufacturers of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems, which create tiny components that power some of the incredible sensor and audio technologies found in iOS devices. *Job creation estimate based on research by Dr. Michael Mandel, Progressive Policy Institute. “App Economy Jobs in Europe,” January 21, 2016.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple Union Square Highlights New Design Elements, Community Programs SAN FRANCISCO — May 19, 2016 — Apple® today revealed its new store on San Francisco’s Union Square, offering many new features and services rolling out to Apple retail stores worldwide. The new store will open its signature 42-foot tall sliding glass doors to customers on Saturday, May 21 at 10 a.m.  “Fifteen years ago today Apple opened its first two stores and we’re thrilled to mark the occasion with the opening of Apple Union Square in San Francisco,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail and Online Stores. “We are not just evolving our store design, but its purpose and greater role in the community as we educate and entertain visitors and serve our network of local entrepreneurs.”  Apple Union Square’s glass doors open the store to Post Street and Union Square. The building’s unique position connects San Francisco’s most famous square to a rejuvenated plaza to the north, creating a beautiful gathering place for the community. The art-filled plaza offers seating, public Wi-Fi, a 50-foot tall “green wall” and regular acoustic performances. The store is powered by 100 percent renewable energy, including power produced by photovoltaic panels integrated into the building’s roof. “We have a deep commitment to the cities we work in, and are aware of the importance that architecture plays in the community,” said Jonathan Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “It all starts with the storefront — taking transparency to a whole new level — where the building blends the inside and the outside, breaking down barriers and making it more egalitarian and accessible.”  Features in the new Apple Union Square design include: “The Avenue,” inspired by the window displays along a boulevard that dynamically change with the season. Avenue walls are interactive themed “windows” where Apple’s products and services come to life, from music, to creativity, apps, photography and more. New “Creative Pros,” Apple experts in creative arts, offer advice and expertise at each of the displays. Customers will also find “Only at Apple” products on the Avenue, a curated collection of third-party accessories. “Genius Grove” invites customers to get support working side-by-side with Geniuses under the comfortable canopy of local trees in the heart of the store. “The Forum” is a vibrant gathering place, centered around a 6K Video Wall. It is home to “Today at Apple,” which brings to the community the world’s most talented artists, photographers, musicians, gamers, developers and entrepreneurs to inspire and educate our customers to go further with the things they are passionate about. Today at Apple includes year-round programs for kids, new monthly events for teachers, sessions for current and aspiring developers, Creative Sessions in partnership with local experts in creative arts, Game Night with editors from Apple’s App Store® and more. The Forum and Video Wall are a place of discovery, including events about the making of movies from iTunes®, or exclusive premieres of new music and music videos from Apple Music™.  “The Plaza” will be found only at Apple’s most significant stores, including Apple Union Square. It’s open to the public 24 hours a day, features public Wi-Fi and seating, and takes Today at Apple outside, with a regular weekend series of well known local acoustic performances such as Travis Hayes and global talents like Escondido, who will then give exclusive interviews about their craft in the Forum. The Plaza at Apple Union Square features a fountain by well-known San Francisco sculptor Ruth Asawa, originally commissioned in 1969, and a new work, “Love” by local artist Laura Kimpton, commissioned by Hyatt Hotels.  “The Boardroom” is an intimate space where the store’s Business Team offers hands-on advice and training to entrepreneurs, developers and other small and medium business customers. Apple’s original San Francisco store opened on Stockton Street in 2004 with about 100 employees. Having welcomed more than 20 million visitors, and seen the launch of iPhone®, iPad®, MacBook Air®, Apple TV®, Apple Watch® and more, the team moving to Apple Union Square has grown to more than 350.  While the store offers regular learning experiences in the Forum and Plaza, Apple is also committed to furthering creative arts education throughout San Francisco. Apple is working with the Ruth Asawa School of the Arts to build a visual arts lab with 45 workstations outfitted with the latest Apple products.  Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud.

But, apparently, no longer. Or, at least, not a physical one. Digitimes is reporting that Apple has licked the rumored problems with the fingerprint sensor, and it doesn’t involve putting it on the back. Instead, they’ve embedded it in the screen, so now you can scan your finger and continue not using Apple Pay. There will probably be a “home” button of sorts, but it’ll be on the screen, and exist as software, as opposed to a clickable button. It’s an interesting, if perhaps inevitable step, as Apple wants a smooth sheet of glass, instead of all those gross buttons and ports. But it does raise the question of what happens if the screen is damaged or otherwise refuses to work. The Home button being a physical thing was something of a fail-safe to ensure you could still use your phone even if your screen was cracked, so what happens when that’s off the table? The designs we’ve seen do have buttons, of course, so they might fill in, or the Home button may still wind up on the side. For now, though, Apple’s goal of a buttonless, portless phone proceeds apace.

Originally from John’s Creek, Georgia, Davis is a self-described “southern Jewish girl” living out her dreams in the Big Apple. As a sought-after dating coach, the Georgetown University alum connects singles to each other the old-fashioned way — in person, without the use of dating apps. She’s also helped invigorate the city’s Shabbat scene for singles by organizing more than two-dozen “Shabbatness” dinners, a highly coveted but invite-only experience. Four months ago, the Millennial matchmaker took a “leap of faith” by performing a 6-minute set at Manhattan’s Gotham Comedy Club. During that fateful evening, Davis met sit-com legend Jerry Seinfeld, who also performed. After appearing in several more shows at Gotham, Davis had the honor of Seinfeld “opening” for her during a March performance. “I got in and I got lucky,” said Davis in an interview with The Times of Israel. Having performed a dozen sets in New York and Las Vegas since January, the blossoming comedienne cannot get enough of the spotlight, she said. “I’m addicted,” said Davis of performing. “I’m one of those freaks who gets an endorphin rush from this. I want to push myself to try new material and to improve, to push myself to be uncomfortable,” she said. In making hay of her personal life, Davis takes audiences back to her childhood in Georgia, where her parents met and courted at a Denny’s restaurant. As a teenager growing up outside Atlanta, Davis willed herself to lose 60 pounds and forge a new self-image, and the last laugh is on her audiences. ‘Even worse than being fat and Jewish in Georgia is being hairy’ “Even worse than being fat and Jewish in Georgia is being hairy,” Davis told the crowd at a recent Gotham show. After explaining the perils of being attracted to men who range in age from 22 to 62, Davis revealed that one of her eyebrows was accidentally — but permanently — waxed off by her unibrow-fearing mother. “After many years I just got sick of penciling it in every day,” said Davis. “So I got it tattooed on, and now I’m a Jew with a tattoo,” said the petite comic. As the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, the “Jew with a tattoo” line is the closest Davis would go to joking about the Shoah, she said. “It’s never okay to joke about it. I think the Holocaust should always be off-limits,” said Davis, who has visited several former Nazi camps with American Jewish Committee delegations. Erin Davis serves food at a mixer in New York City, September 2016 (Courtesy) Davis’s survivor grandparents — Roza and Kissel Goldberg — have long been her inspiration, she said. The couple met while hiding from the Nazis in occupied Poland, each having lost many family members. Their love story, noted Davis, underpins her most cherished matchmaking project: the staging of “Shabbatness” dinners for single Jews on the prowl, always held in private homes and “with lots of booze,” she said. During the weeks before each gathering, Davis carefully selects who will fill the 12 seats. Having paid $72 to attend a Friday evening, participants come with expectations. Last year, two couples who met during “Shabbatness” dinners got married, and many others are still dating, said Davis. To kick off 2017 with something new, Davis organized her first all-male gay dinner in December — “a big brisket dinner with a ‘Jew Year’s Eve’ theme and of course a rainbow challah,” said the Spanish-speaking socialite. Erin Davis participates in a panel about love at Beverly Hills Studios, April 2017 (Courtesy) “I am a slave to these dinners,” said Davis, known for a trademark mini-skirt and high-heels. “I don’t sit at the table or eat. I run ice-breakers and deal with people who are coming in nervous,” she said. With some dinners lasting several hours past midnight, all kinds of relationships can form around the table. “We have business deals come out of these dinners, and we have bromances. When people come together for a shared experience, anything can happen,” said Davis, who is “happily seeing” a man she set herself up with one year ago. ‘Momentum is everything in dating’ As a sought-after dating coach, Davis encounters clients who are unable to break into the dating scene. “‘Can you get me out of my apartment and to an event you think I would like?’ is the most common request I get,” said the animal-loving Davis. She said many young adults are “overwhelmed” by the city’s Jewish community. To cater to this demographic, Davis became a “wing-woman,” taking her clients to bars and events where she can connect them to potential mates herself. A 2016 photo of Erin Davis, founder of ‘Shabbatness’ in New York City and celebrated dating coach (Courtesy) “I am the ice-breaker, I am the wing woman, I do it,” said Davis. “I am the flirt and I run over and connect people. I want them to meet in an organic and wholesome way,” said the effusive coach, who also helps clients avoid common dating mistakes. “The biggest mistake that people make after coming to an event like ‘Shabbatness’ is trying to go out with only their top choice first,” said Davis. “They wait too long to contact the second person. No, no, no! Contact them all right away, because momentum is everything in dating,” said Davis, who will soon be a certified personal trainer. In addition to her Holocaust survivor maternal grandparents, Davis was influenced by the lives of her father’s parents. Their relationship, too, was forged by working through obstacles together. ‘My grandparents’ perseverance and commitment to each was inspiring’ “My grandparents were both deaf,” said Davis. “My dad was an only child born with hearing and full speaking ability, but American Sign Language is his first language,” she said. “My grandparents’ perseverance and commitment to each was inspiring,” said Davis, who moved to New York City in 2010 with virtually no connections in town. Next up, the rising comic hopes to wrap negotiations for a reality TV show based on her romance gigs, said Davis. A wearer of many hats, she is also completing a graduate degree in international affairs at The New School, where Davis researched the role of “love as a bridge-builder between Judaism and other faiths.” Whether on stage with Seinfeld or leading a “Shabbat Shvitz” work-out, Davis said that one theme connects her endeavors to each other. “With all of my projects and businesses, I am trying to address modern Jewish love,” said the Millennial matchmaker.

The investor Alex Parent, 28, always wanted to invest in stocks but was too “scared” of the volatility and possibility of losing money. Then an investor friend managed to allay his fears, and helped him get going. “I was shocked how easy it was,” Mr. Parent says. How he invests “Before starting with real money, I went with a stock-market simulator,” he says. As his comfort level grew, he went to a bank and put money into a real account with its online discount brokerage. His only caution is that the bank “will try to pressure you into getting a financial adviser.” Mr. Parent is happy to invest on his own because he can get the information he needs online. He is discovering that it’s better to buy and hold stocks such as Shopify Inc., rather than trade in and out of them. His portfolio is earning 5 per cent to 15 per cent a month, he says. True, the economy and stocks can go down a lot, too. But studies show if you stay invested and ride out the downturns (or even buy more stocks), you’ll come out ahead in the long run. Best move The price of his Shopify stock has gone up more than 75 per cent since he bought in early February. Worst move He got a scare when he bought a security and sold it within a day or two. As it takes three days for a transaction to settle in a brokerage account, he didn’t put up any capital for the stock purchase. This kind of “free-riding” can result in a cash account being frozen. Advice “For my generation, having a stable job with a pension plan is very hard,” Mr. Parent adds. “I personally think that the stock market is a way out of this frustrating problem.” Want to be in Me and My Money?

An action-thriller novel — book 1 in the KESTREL series. ★★★★★ — Amazon Room To Think May 28th, 2017 tech & ipad-only 9 min read I had good intentions. I know that’s what everyone says, but it’s true. Seven years ago, when I set up my home office in our new place — I’ve worked from home full-time for more than a decade now, by the way — I took a photo of my then-unsullied desk. Here it is. It was an IKEA Galant, configured as a big, L-shaped monster of a thing. I was a consultant iOS and Mac software engineer, and I need a lot of tech gear. Big iMac, keyboard, pointing device, external drives, additional display, test devices, and so on. The clutter grew and grew. Latterly, by the middle of last year, I’d long since switched careers (I’m a writer now), and downsized my computing setup too: I was using just a 12” MacBook or 11” MacBook Air, and I sat at the short leg of the desk, having carved out a small, calm space within so much redundant stuff. I’d try not to notice the rest of it, but of course I always did. It took half an hour to properly dust the whole room. I wasn’t happy with it at all. When my little sister had to move here to Edinburgh for a few months for work, we naturally invited her to stay with us, and I jumped at the chance to finally clear out the office and turn it into a bedroom for her. After dropping my wife off at the airport very early one morning, I spent the whole day transforming the place, bidding a final goodbye to a room that had ceased to be a place of focus for me. Time moved on and little sis moved out, and this year my wife gave me the nudge I needed to do something I’d thought about since we bought the place: create the office I wanted, from scratch. The first thing needing attention was the wooden floor, which for reasons unknown the previous owner had painted magnolia. It looked awful, and was always a bone of contention for both of us. It needed professionally stripped and restored, and we decided to just go for it. Next, we’d have additional power sockets installed in several places, to give more flexibility in hiding away cables, and avoiding any extension blocks trailing around the room. Last but not least, the walls and ceiling needed fully stripped, repaired, plaster skimmed, and painted — including rewiring the ugly smoke alarm cabling back into the wall. We decided to go ahead and get all of it done in series, queuing up tradespeople to visit one after another, during a marathon two-week period. But first, I needed to know how I wanted it to look when it was done. I measured all the relevant surfaces and distances, made a model in Home Design 3D on the iPad, and came up with something radically different from before, to suit my iPad-only setup and my need for a minimalist workspace. Here’s the concept render. I’m a huge fan of feature walls, with a vivid colour to contrast against more subdued decor for the majority of the room. My favourite colour is purple (it was the highlight colour at our wedding, and I have two books out with covers in that colour), so it was an easy decision to choose it for the feature. I wanted clean, empty walls as a blank canvas. I can add some judicious art there later, but initially I wanted to keep the place as formless and distraction-free as I could. To that end, the only piece of furniture from the old office making a reappearance, besides my guitar and exercise bike, was my Aeron chair. The old desk was dead and gone, and far too large for my current needs anyway. I needed something smaller, simpler, and able to slot in below the window that looks out into the park. I chose an IKEA Bekant, again in the oak veneer but this time with white legs to match the woodwork, and with that decision made, we cleared the room, and invited the professionals in. Two weeks later, and having vacuumed, mopped, and wet-dusted more sanded-down plaster dust than I ever care to see again, I had a new office. Here’s how it looks. The guitar is a Fender American Special Stratocaster, maple neck, in Candy Apple Red. The puppy is a labradoodle, and his name is Whisky. Here’s a wider-angle view of the room, incorporating my old, reliable York c101 exercise bike. And here’s the desk. It’s the 140x60cm Bekant, lowered to about 70cm in height. The iPad is a 9.7” Pro, and its stand is from AboveTEK. The plant is faux-grass from IKEA. I’m not sure where the coaster is from, but I have three more just like it. The keyboard is an Apple Magic Keyboard, and there’s also an Apple Pencil in a Samdi holder. All the pens in the pot are black Staedtler pigment liners. I’m especially happy with how the floor turned out. It adds so much warmth and light to the room, and it’s now an element that I can actively enjoy, instead of trying to forget about it. With the exception of the adjoining purple feature-walls where the desk sits, the rest of the walls are a soft grey called turtledove, and all are blank. It has the effect of immediately blurring my visual focus — figuratively speaking — when I look at it, and turning my thoughts inward. That’s exactly what I wanted: a zero-distraction backdrop that pulls me back to what I’m actually thinking about. This is the view towards the door from my chair. The hook on the far wall is for the hatch in the floor, which conceals the stairway down into the basement. In the old office, I had a printer cabinet which protruded into the room, plus a filing cabinet at one end of the curved desk. In each case, the drawers and shelves were junkyards of chaos, and I had no real idea what was in there. Finding anything was an exercise in irritation, and because it wasn’t organised, I had no motivation to keep it tidy, so I regularly added more miscellaneous stuff and just allowed the annoyance and shame to be compounded. Urgh. It was very important to me to not allow things to get that way again. The printer nook is opposite the door, and is a recessed, shallow, open-shelved cupboard within a door-frame; a construct called an “Edinburgh Press”, from its historical use as a linen cupboard where tightly-folded and stacked items would be pressed flat by their confinement, thus keeping them relatively wrinkle-free. I was fortunate enough to find an IKEA unit — the Kullen 3-drawer chest — that fit the space nigh-perfectly, comfortably holding the laser printer. I built the unit but left the back open, so I could route cables inside it, and I’d previously had the electrician install a power socket inside the press itself, again to avoid ugly cables running along the edges of the floor. Here’s how it looks now. The top shelf of the press has a selection of books, including the classics of Computing Science that remind me of university, my previous career, where I came from, and my passion for order and logic. There’s also a series of design-related books that inspired and delighted me, and which I enjoy leafing through. In the middle, there are some nods to my new career, including my first novel, CHANGER. The relative position of each discipline is deliberate; writing a novel requires some of the skills from each of those two other fields, both of which had equal importance when I was writing code instead of words. The second shelf holds a Sound Blaster Roar Bluetooth speaker, which delivers an amazing amount of bass, and impressive clarity in the high range. The mono laser printer is Wirecutter’s recommendation: the Brother HL-L2340DW. Both devices are wired in for power, with the cabling concealed. What’s more important, though, is the drawers themselves. Mindful of the mess of the past, I bought a series of divider trays (with repositionable sub-dividers) and fabric dresser boxes, to carve up the space in the drawers and let me categorise and organise the various necessities of a modern home office — i.e. a lot of USB cables and white Apple adapters. The topmost drawer also has sections for personal items, stationery, and useful tools like a Leatherman, measuring tape, and LED flashlight. There’s some room to grow there, too, but any additions will have to earn their place. Concealed within, there are powered USB sockets to allow charging items with the drawers closed; I made those with USB plugs, USB male-to-female extension cables, and adhesive-mounted cable clips. Since taking the above photos, I’ve made some more tweaks: motion-sensor lighting for the printer area (only active when it’s sufficiently dark — here’s a video of it in action), and I’ve also inlaid felt into some of the drawer compartments, to hold my watches, as shown below. The felt is purple, naturally. I’m thrilled with how it all turned out. It’s just what I wanted, and when I open the door in the morning and walk in there, hearing Whisky’s claws clicking on the floor beside me as he makes for his new bed just behind my work area, I feel both energised and relaxed. My focus is immediately on the desk, with the calming vista of the grass hillside out beyond the window, curving down towards the river. The space outside has always been inspiring, but now the space inside no longer pales in comparison. It hasn’t been without stress and hassle, but it was absolutely worth it. I have a room that fits with my evolving sense of what I need from an environment for productivity, and I’m confident that it’s a place where I can get the next phase of my work done.

While the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has refused to allow the company to sell its second-hand phones in the country, the government is still open to its request of allowing used handsets to be imported to meet Apple’s after-sale service contract. “We are still looking at their proposal of being allowed to import refurbished phones to meet their after-sale service requirements. The discussions are still on in that matter,” a DIPP official told BusinessLine. Allowing Apple to import its used phones into the country for meeting after-sale services requirement would essentially mean that the company be permitted to use the parts of such phones to service the i-phones sold in the country. “The DIPP has received such requests before for products such as photocopy machines and printers, where foreign companies have proposed that they be allowed to import second-hand parts to service products sold in the country,” said another official. “However, a positive decision has not been taken on any of the proposals yet.” The policy uncertainties notwithstanding, Apple started manufacturing its devices in India last week, at its Taiwanese contract manufacturing partner Wistron’s plant, in Bengaluru.

Woman shot in chest while waiting in line at Pizza Luce Charley Walters: The way he’s hitting, Joe Mauer might have a .300 season for Twins Wally McCarthy, car-selling wizard of the Twin Cities, dies at 94 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers go out with a bang on what could be their last tour Body found in Lake Minnetonka ID’d as Blaine man Call this a “dads ‘n’ grads” tech-gift guide, if you must — it’s that time of year, after all. But there are all kinds of occasions for such gift giving, and you want the tech products you pick out to be extra-special, regardless. I have a handful of suggestions for tech-related gear that is attractive, practical and of the highest quality — I know because I’ve used it all. VOICE-CONTROLLED ASSISTANT Amazon’s Echo, a hands-free speaker you control with your voice, is a big hit. That’s partly because the personal assistant can do so much with vocal prompts: read you the news, play your favorite music, set alarms or timers, give you the weather forecast, summon an Uber, even adjust your home’s temperature and lighting if you have smart-home accessories installed. But the Echo is a big, somewhat ungainly cylinder, and a bit pricey at $180. Fear not: Amazon’s Echo Dot is more compact, and a lot less expensive at about $40 (and keep your eye out for deals). Its speaker is sub-par, but the Dot is intended for use with the standalone speakers folks tend to have around the house (I hooked my test Dot up to my trusty ol’ Apple Hi-Fi). And since the Dot has Bluetooth, the speakers turn into wireless gear. A WIRELESS MOUSE (OR TWO) Stop using that cheap computer mouse that is horrifically imprecise, makes your hand ache, and (ugh) has a bothersome cord. Go wireless with one of the best mouse makers around. The company has just updated its line of highly regarded MX rodents with a couple of new wireless models, the full-size MX Master 2S, and the smaller, more mobile MX Anywhere 2S. The Bluetooth peripherals feel crazy comfy in the hand, have vastly more precise cursor tracking, and connect to three computers at a time. They even let you easily copy and paste text, imagery and files among the machines, which is a new trick called “Logitech Flow.” BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES Bluetooth headphones are a pain. Wirelessly pairing them to smartphones, tablets and computers can be tricky business, and good luck maintaining the connection. Wouldn’t it be great to have sound gear that just works — every time? Bose’s SoundLink Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II came pretty close for me — pairing them with computers and mobile gizmos was painless, for the most part. And I didn’t even use the headphones’ companion phone app. The SoundLinks sound decent and they are pretty comfortable. Best of all, they’re less expensive than some of Bose’s other, fancier wireless headphones, and as of this writing are steeply discounted — only $230. RELATED: Instead of cash and a personalized mug, these gifts give graduates a good start in life For something a bit more portable, check out Apple’s AirPods. These look just like the company’s EarPods, but without the cords. The $159 AirPods sound pretty good for the money, and stay in place even if you are working out. Phone calls are great on these babies, too. These will work the best with Apple devices — iPhones, iPads, Macs — but will pair up just fine with your Android phone, too. PORTABLE POWER PACKS You are lucky if the charge on your phone, tablet or laptop gets you through the day. All too often, you have a dead gadget when you can least afford it. That is why a booming market in portable battery packs has arisen, and a company called Anker is one of the leaders (it just got written up by tech site The Verge). Anker’s rapidly expanding line of battery packs has something for every budget and situation. Its $66 PowerCore 20100 has two USB ports for charging smartphones and tablets, along with a Micro-USB port for charging the battery pack itself via a home wall outlet. Other options include the $66 PowerCore+ 20100 USB-C model that comes in handy if you have recent-model laptops and smartphones with newfangled USB-C ports. I’ve used both of these packs and love ’em. Apple-related power gear I like includes Apple’s odd-looking but quite-comfortable-to-hold Smart Battery Case ($99, in versions for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 6 and 6s) and Nomad’s $40 Battery Cable, a rugged iPhone charging cable that incorporates a battery for powering up a phone while away from a wall outlet. HARDWARE PROTECTORS There’s also a booming market in cases and sleeves for digital devices, which are just one finger slip away from taking a tumble onto the hard floor and becoming damaged. Two companies, Minneapolis-based Pad & Quill and San Francisco-based WaterField Designs, provide some of the finest device protectors around. Pad & Quill is known for cases that encase devices — from iPhones to MacBooks — in lightweight wood frames that are then wrapped with leather or linen covers. Some of the company’s products eschew the wood for trimmer designs. WaterField tends to take a different tack with soft, padded sleeves and cases that take a pounding with no damage to your devices. Attractive, durable materials used to make these protectors include waxed canvas and ballistic nylon. Related Articles It’s important to protect your computer and the data on it. Just do it.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Tips for buying a used smartphone Tips for buying a used smartphone By Simon Hill — Updated May 26, 2017 11:43 am Subscribe Share Jessica Lee Star/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: The best smartphones pack tempting features into stylish bodies, but they don’t come cheap. You can easily spend upwards of $600 on a new smartphone — the Samsung Galaxy S8 starts at $750, for instance — but you don’t have to clean out your bank account to nab a snazzy smartphone. Buying a used device is a tried-and-true method of saving cash on a purchase. In this guide, we’re going to lay out your options and run through some tips for buying a used smartphone, helping ensure you don’t get ripped off. Not all second-hand smartphones are created equal, so let’s break this down by category. Buying refurbished smartphones The best kind of used smartphone to go for is a refurbished phone. These are phones that were returned to the manufacturer for one reason or another. They are fully tested, factory reset, and certified. They also usually come with some kind of warranty. When you buy a refurbished phone, it should be close to the experience of buying a new phone. If you buy a refurbished iPhone from Apple, for example, it will have a new battery, a pristine outer shell, and a box with all the necessary accessories. It will also come with a one-year warranty, but that won’t be the case if you buy elsewhere. Standards vary, so always check the details carefully. Whenever possible, buy directly from manufacturers, as they have the greatest incentive to ensure the refurbished phones they sell are problem-free. Before you get too excited about refurbished smartphones, however, it’s worth noting that they’re the most expensive kind of used smartphone around. You can often reap significant savings with little risk, but real bargain hunters will be unimpressed. If you want to shop for refurbished phones, then check out these stores: Amazon Apple Best Buy Samsung Walmart Buying certified pre-owned smartphones One step down from refurbished phones, you’ll find the certified pre-owned category. Once again, these phones have undergone some kind of testing, been factory reset, and should come with a limited warranty. They’ll be a bit cheaper than refurbished phones, too, though they probably won’t be in as good condition. Certified pre-owned phones have been tested to make sure that they work properly, but they’re not like-new — these are used smartphones and may have cosmetic damage or internal wear and tear. They also won’t necessarily be re-boxed or presented as new phones, and could be missing some accessories. Always check the details before you buy, because there may be differences when it comes to the definition of certified pre-owned from retailer to retailer. There will also be differences in the warranty they offer.. If you want to shop for certified pre-owned phones, then check out these stores: Amazon AT&T Best Buy Target Verizon Buying used smartphones The biggest bargains are to be found in the used smartphone category, but there are also greater risks in buying a used smartphone. You might be able to secure last year’s flagship with extra accessories at a knock-down price, but you could also end up with a dud and no way to get a refund. You need to check the seller’s description carefully, only consider listings with photos, and ask questions before you buy. Try to deal with sellers who have positive ratings, if possible. Some services offer listing verification and payment protection in the event something goes wrong, while others don’t. You should look for a return policy and use a service like PayPal, so you have some possibility of getting a refund if your new phone turns out to be damaged or stolen. If you’re going to meet in-person to buy a phone, always take someone with you and choose a well-lit public place to meet. Make it clear to the seller that you want to test the phone before you buy, and that you’ll be bringing a SIM card to do just that. This will discourage scammers. Some of the best places to buy used smartphones are: eBay Craigslist Glyde Swappa The price is right You should do some research to get an idea of how much you need to spend. Swappa is particularly helpful for this, because it shows a chart of the average selling prices for each smartphone over time. You can also search the “sold listings” on eBay, if you want to see what the going rate for your desired phone is. Remember that prices for older smartphone models — like the iPhone 5, or Samsung Galaxy S6 — will always fall when a new one is released, as people tend to sell their older devices in order to raise cash for a new one. When you settle on a target price, be patient. If you’re trying to get a better-than-average bargain, then you need avoid being drawn into a bidding war. There’s a ton of variance on sites like eBay, so it can be smart to wait to bid on items until the last moment. Choose listings that end mid-week, because they won’t attract as many buyers as listings that end on Saturday or Sunday. Important things to consider There are several things you need to keep in mind when buying a used smartphone, so here’s a checklist to run through. If any of these things aren’t clear in the listing, then you need to ask the seller before you buy. Is the phone on your network or unlocked? Smartphones that are locked to a carrier tend to be a bit cheaper, so if you’re happy on Verizon, for example, go for a device that’s locked to Verizon. Unlocked smartphones, on the other hand, can be used on any network. Does the phone come with any accessories? Find out if it comes in the original box, with the charger and cable that it shipped with. You need to know if there any extras being thrown in, such as cases or headphones. The original box is a good sign that the phone is not stolen and a case suggests the previous owner has been taking care of the device. Has it been factory reset? You want a phone that has been wiped clean. Make sure the previous owner has removed all personal accounts and watch out for Factory Reset Protection (FRP). It’s a safety feature that Google recently added to Android to discourage would-be thieves. If FRP is not disabled before the phone is sold, then, even after a factory reset, you’ll be prompted to enter the username and password for the last Google account that was registered with the device before you can use it. Is there any physical damage? Ideally, you’ll be able to review a good mix of photos before you buy, but it’s worth checking whether there’s any damage that isn’t obvious from the supplied photos. You may also want to ask about water damage before you make your purchase. Test your phone When your new phone arrives, make sure you test it immediately and thoroughly. Put your SIM in and make sure it works, insert your MicroSD card (if it accommodates one), try charging the phone, and test the headphone port. You should also watch out for battery problems, especially with older phones. After all, batteries deteriorate over time and may eventually struggle to hold a charge. You may also want to try a diagnostic app or use service codes. You can find them for most phones with a quick online search, and they’ll allow you to test the battery, screen, and a few other bits and pieces. If you’re going to find a problem, it’s better to isolate it sooner rather than later. If you have a warranty, then you can quickly make a claim. If not, you can try to return your phone or claim a refund via PayPal. If you’re meeting in person and paying cash, then go to the meeting equipped with a SIM card, cable, laptop, and headphones and perform the tests before making your purchase.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Tech giants acquired 34 AI startups in Q1 2017 Reuters May 28, 2017 9:33 AM Above: Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google, onstage at Google I/O 2017. (Reuters) – A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple, Facebook and Intel, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Company invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber. Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said.

But in her next breath, she proved she either isn't telling the truth or doesn't know what she's talking about. "We are making good progress with the companies who have put in place end-to-end encryption, some of them are being more constructive that others but we will continue to build on that," she told the BBC's Andrew Marr. She indicated frustration that messaging firms won't let the government "break" such encrypted messages for anti-terror investigations - among other things. Here's why that makes less than no sense. OK, so what is end-to-end encryption, anyway? Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now End-to-end encryption means messages can only be decoded by the sender or receiver. They use a publicly available algorithm to scramble and unscramble the message on the phone itself, rather than the encryption being done by the service provider. The upshot of this is that Apple, WhatsApp, Telegram and other services that use the technology could not decrypt messages sent through their services if they wanted to. Read More Tory Amber Rudd attacked WhatsApp's encryption and people are all mad about it So when Amber Rudd says she doesn't want to ban it... (Photo: BBC) She's either not telling the truth, or she doesn't know what end-to-end encryption means. There's literally no way to offer a 'back door' to messages encrypted in this way. By its very nature, it is impossible. Would it be so bad if we didn't have end-to-end encryption? (Photo: REUTERS) Well, it depends on whether you like having your bank account hacked. Allowing a back door into end-to-end encryption wouldn’t just make it less secure for terrorists - it’d make loads of things you do online every day more vulnerable to attacks from hackers. This kind of security is not only used by messaging services. It’s used, entirely legitimately, by banks, card companies and healthcare providers to protect users from hackers.

Huawei's position in smartphones and tablets has dramatically risen over the last two years.   On her blog site, Brody notes today that "As Chief Design Executive, and now as Founder and Design Entrepreneur — I am charged with leveraging best UX practices in product design and branding strategy from a holistic perspective. I am delivering industry-defining products in cooperation with executive teams — usually the CEO, CMO and CTO. At Huawei, I was leading a world-class, global design team of 100+ employees with offices based in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, San Francisco, London and Munich. Very recently, I quit Huawei to focus on my own venture, Abalone.   I am a recognized expert, innovator and contributor in product and UX with numerous granted or filed technology patents encompassing user interface design, gesture interaction and UI implementation strategies for system designs for any platform. I am passionate about humanizing technology by crafting elegant, easy-to-use applications that delight and make a difference in people's lives.   My experience with, and insight into organizational development, design culture, process, strategy and execution is the direct result of having shipped numerous award-winning releases: I spent the majority of my work-life at Apple during its most defining decade (2001-2011) when Steve Jobs was most active and still alive.   I helped to establish the UX discipline within Apple's applications department. I created signature look & feel for: Apple's "ProKit" (Apple's design language for Photo, Video, Word processing and other productivity apps); iOS (for the launch of the iPhone in 2007); iCloud.   By working 1:1 with executives, engineers, stakeholders, and investors, as well as cross-functional software design and development teams, I make sure that products and services — for cloud computing, ecosystems and the internet of things (IoT), AI, AR and VR, self-driving cars — software and hardware, the sky is the limit — exhibit simplicity, consistency, stylistic breadth, attention to detail, balanced beauty, innovation, usability, and deep visceral satisfaction."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

By Douglas A. McIntyre May 28, 2017 6:38 am EDT Print Email Tweet Source: courtesy of Apple Inc.Expectations for the sales of the iPhone 8 are extraordinarily high. There remain a number of questions among tech experts and Wall St. analysts who follow the company. Among them is whether the iPhone 8 launches in September or later. Even with a delayed release, the forecast for fourth quarter sales is, in some cases, close to 100 million. The iPhone 8 sales expectations depend largely on two things. The first is that the iPhone 7 is close to its one year birthday. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) customers anticipate these anniversaries as the time when they can buy an upgrade. iPhone releases have been a year apart in the past. The second expectations is that the iPhone 8 may be a larger leap in technology and features than any model since the iPhone 5. The iPhone 5 was lighter than earlier versions. It was much thinner. It had an upgraded camera. It was the first model design by Apple’s management after the death of Steven Jobs. There is always tremendous speculation about new iPhone features which begin months before release. For the iPhone 8, this might include a wireless charger. It may have an curved AMOLED display which allows for more picture sharpness and better contrast. It’s “home button” may be gone. The speaker and camera may be behind the display screen. It may come in new sizes. It is impossible to predict which if any of these will wildly excite potential buyers. Apple’s share price is near an all time high and its market cap at a record $800 billion. It cannot hold those numbers if the iPhone 8 is not a home run, both in the third calendar quarter when it will be released and more important the holiday quarter after. Cowen & Co.’s Timothy Arcuri was quoted by Barron’s as saying that what is most important to investors is not when the iPhone 8 is released as much as whether Apple can sell 90 million iPhones in the last quarter of the year. Apple is the best performing Dow stock this year, and to hold that position of the balance of 2017, the iPhone 8 needs to eclipse expectations. For the last quarter of the year, the number needs to be 100 million. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

The official release is presumed to be early June. The flagship devices already went on sale in South Korea, China and the United States. Samsung, however, may face hurdles in promoting the Galaxy S8 in Japan as the Japanese smartphone market is dominated by Apple Inc. In the first quarter of the year, Samsung sold some 300,000 smartphones in Japan to account for 3.8 percent of the market share. In 2012, Samsung's presence was 14.8 percent, but it lost ground since then in the face of growing competition with Apple, whose market share topped 50 percent. The Galaxy S8 smartphones feature high resolution displays that bend on both sides and come with various innovative technologies, such as iris and face recognition scanners, and a smart voice assistance program named Bixby.
