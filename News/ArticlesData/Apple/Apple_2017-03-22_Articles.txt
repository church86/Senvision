Apple announced the device in a press release, alongside the (RED) iPhone 7, new Apple Watch bands, and new iPhone cases. Yesterday, we briefly highlighted some of the differences between the new iPad and the iPad Air 2 it replaces, but read on for a full breakdown of all of the differences… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Display There are a couple of things worth noting in terms of the display discrepancies between the new iPad and the previous iPad Air 2. One thing that Apple left unclear was if the new iPad features the same anti-reflective display coating that the iPad Air 2 featured. The company confirmed to The Verge, however, that the 2017 iPad does indeed lack that display coating and is not laminated to the cover glass. What this means is that there will be a visible are gap between the display and the glass, while the display will also be more reflective than the iPad Air 2 was. Apple does say, however, that the new iPad features a brighter display than its predecessor, but specific information here is unclear. Nevertheless, it sounds somewhat akin to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and its display. The Air 2 was the first iPad to feature anti-reflective coating on the display and lamination directly to the cover glass, so this is very much a step back on Apple’s part, but likely a way to keep the price of the new model as low as possible. Specs In terms of the power you’ll find inside the new iPad, it’s a notable step up from the iPad Air 2 originally introduced in 2014. The new iPad is powered by Apple’s A9 processor clocked at 1.85GHz. That’s the same processor that’s found in the iPhone SE, though it’s closed at 1.8GHz there. The iPad Air 2, on other hand, is powered by a 1.5GHz Apple A8X processor. Additionally, iPad Air 2 processor is a triple-core chip with Apple’s M8 coprocessor, while the new iPad is a dual-core processor with Apple’s M9 processor. In terms of RAM, the iPad Air 2 features 2GB and it’s expected that the 2017 iPad features the same. All in all, the new $329 iPad should be notably more powerful than the iPad Air 2. It makes sense, too, considering the iPad Air 2 was originally announced back in 2014, so it was lagging behind in terms of processor technology. Either way, you can’t really beat having the A9 and M9 compressor in sub-$400 iPad. Battery Another difference between the iPad Air 2 and the 2017 iPad comes with the battery size, though Apple doesn’t expect the end user to notice any battery life improvements. Like it did with the iPad Air 2, Apple quotes 10 hours of battery life despite the bigger battery. The 2017 iPad features a 32.4Wh battery, while the iPad Air 2 featured a 27.62Wh battery. As Apple says, however, noticing any improvements in battery is unlikely here. Because of the brighter display and more powerful processor, the increase in battery size was likely necessary to offset the increased power draw. Although, the drop from three cores to two cores might somewhat help in the battery life department. Design One disappointing change with the 2017 iPad comes in terms of design. As our own Benjamin Mayo pointed out yesterday, the new iPad is thicker and heavier than the iPad Air 2. The iPad Air 2 featured a slim 6.1mm and .96 pounds design, while the new iPad comes in at 7.5mm and 1.03 pounds. This means the new iPad is more than 20 percent thicker than the iPad Air 2, but in the grand scheme of things it’s not a huge deal. It does mean that any cases and accessories made for the iPad Air 2 won’t work, but it’s rare that accessories do work across multiple product iterations. The new iPad also features the old antenna design on LTE models: iPad 5th-generation has the old antenna (and USB-A) pic.twitter.com/8D5PjPnaTE — Zac Hall (@apollozac) March 21, 2017 It’s disappointing to see Apple move in the opposite direction in terms of product design, but it was likely a necessary compromise to squeeze in a larger battery and lower the price… Price Headlining the changes between this year’s iPad and the iPad Air 2 is a price drop. The 2017 iPad comes in at $329, whereas the iPad Air 2 carried a $399 retail price. The base model of the new iPad will offer 32GB. The cellular model will start at $459. The price drop means that Apple will hopefully be able to reach a larger segment of the market. The drop comes as Apple faces increased competition from affordable devices such as Chromebooks in education. Apple is also working with IBM to increase the iPad’s enterprise usage, and a price drop will likely help in that area as well. As Ben Lovejoy noted this morning, the more affordable iPad comes as Apple is seemingly switching its pricing strategy to get its products to the most customers possible. Wrap up The new iPad isn’t necessarily the dramatic update to the device that many have called on Apple to make, but it isn’t meant to be that device either. It represents an iterative update from the iPad Air 2 that comes with a notable price drop. While there are some setbacks, ideally the $329 price tag will offset those for most customers. As for the iPad lineup heading forward, it’s still believed that Apple has a 10.5-inch model in the works, as well as additional changes for 2018.

We’ve been tracking this one for a while but were able to confirm just now that the ink on the deal is drying as we speak. Workflow itself has been acquired, and is now free on the iOS App Store. The team behind it, led by Ari Weinstein, will be working for Apple. As you may imagine, Federico Viticci has written about this news: At this stage, it’s not clear what Apple’s plans for Workflow in the long term might be. I have a few theories, but this isn’t the time to speculate. I’ll say this, though: Workflow has been the driving force behind my decision to embrace the iPad as my primary computer. Workflow is a shining example of the power of automation combined with user creativity and its underlying mission has always been clear: to allow anyone to improve how iOS can get things done for them in a better, faster, more flexible way. Workflow is the modern bicycle for the mind. There’s nothing else like it. I have a million questions, many hopes and quite a few fears about this. Workflow is the foundation on which many like Federico have built their iPad-as-a-work-machine houses. I can see a future where it becomes more deeply supported and integrated into iOS, like an Automator or AppleScript for the modern age, but this would require Apple to really commit to making the hooks for it in iOS deeper and more accessible. As I said on Connected this week, I believe Apple is on the cusp of making a major push with iOS in terms of making it more friendly and powerful for professionals who want to work on the iPad. Workflow being part of iOS would certainly be a good step in that direction, and one I hope Apple is ready to make. So far, things don’t look awesome, but those changes may have been out of Apple’s control.

A group that calls itself the Turkish Crime Family is claiming to have the login credentials to more than 627 million iCloud.com, Me.com, and Mac.com email addresses. They are also threatening to wipe the data from millions of Apple accounts if the company does not pay them a ransom of $150,000. According to a report from Motherboard, they claim to have seen screenshots of the alleged emails sent by the hackers to members of Apple’s security team. The hackers also reportedly uploaded a video of them proving that they could log into Apple accounts. However it seems that Apple’s security team has no interest in paying the ransom. In one of the alleged exchanges, an unnamed member of Apple’s security team wrote, “We firstly kindly request you to remove the video that you have uploaded on your YouTube channel as it’s seeking unwanted attention, second of all we would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law.” It is unclear as to what will become of this and whether or not Apple will be able to sort this out, or if maybe the hackers are bluffing. Either way we’ll just have to wait and see, but maybe in the meantime it might not be such a bad idea to update your login information. Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

The tech giant’s new mobile device features a brighter Retina display, improved performance and the “most affordable price ever” for an Apple tablet. The company says that the first iPad 2017 model can “do even more” than its predecessor with its new enhancements. There’s no doubt that the iPad is the world’s most popular tablet PC. And it seems that it’s only going to become more popular as the Cupertino, California-based titan has not only made its most favoured-sized iPad better, it’s also the most affordable one yet. Apple believes that the new device is a leap forward as users can now do more, including learning to code with Swift Playgrounds and utilising multitasking facets like Split Screen. “Customers love the large, 9.7-inch display for everything from watching TV and movies, to surfing the web, making FaceTime calls, and enjoying photos, and now it is even more affordable,” said Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, Philip Schiller. “New customers and anyone looking to upgrade will love this new iPad for use at home, in school, and for work, with its gorgeous Retina display, our powerful A9 chip, and access to the more than 1.3 million apps designed specifically for it.” It was previously (and heavily) reported that Apple was set to launch a revamped iPad 2017 model directly aimed at the education sector, which seem to consider the iPad Pro variants as too expensive. Educational apps like Swift Playgrounds should make the new 9.7-inch Apple tablet the ultimate tool for students. It’s also very portable, featuring a solid yet slim aluminium unibody enclosure and weighing just one pound. The new iPad comes with iOS 10.3, which should allow users to multitask seamlessly with apps like Slide Over, Split Screen and Picture-in-Picture. The operating system also allows for more expressive and animated ways to connect via Messages and new means to use Siri with any favourite app. A built-in Touch ID is also included for quick and secure shopping in addition to simple and easy device unlocking. The new 9.7-inch iPad 2017 unit comes in three colours: silver, gold and space grey. The 32GB with Wi-Fi model starts at US$429 (AU$560) while the 32GB Wi-Fi + Cellular variant begins at US$599 (AU$781) at Apple’s official site and stores. The new tablet is available to purchase starting March 25, with delivery to customers and Apple Stores set for next week, including those in the US, China, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Denmark, India, Turkey, Norway, Russia and other countries will follow in April, while Brazil, Taiwan and other regions will follow in May.

Matthew Panzarino, reporting for TechCrunch: Apple has finalized a deal to acquire Workflow today — a tool that lets you hook together apps and functions within apps in strings of commands to automate tasks. We’ve been tracking this one for a while but were able to confirm just now that the ink on the deal is drying as we speak. [...] Apple confirmed the deal, and has said the following about Workflow: “The Workflow app was selected for an Apple Design Award in 2015 because of its outstanding use of iOS accessibility features, in particular an outstanding implementation for VoiceOver with clearly labeled items, thoughtful hints, and drag/drop announcements, making the app usable and quickly accessible to those who are blind or low-vision.” According to Panzarino, Workflow's Ari Weinstein, Conrad Kramer, Nick Frey, and Ayaka Nonaka are joining Apple; the Workflow app will continue to be available on the App Store, and it'll become a free download later today. Workflow doesn't need an introduction on this website. I've been covering the app since its debut in 2014, and have been following every update until the last major version, which brought the fantastic addition of Magic Variables. You can catch up on over two years of Workflow reporting and tutorials here, and access even more advanced workflows in our dedicated section on the Club MacStories newsletter. At this stage, it's not clear what Apple's plans for Workflow in the long term might be. I have a few theories, but this isn't the time to speculate. I'll say this, though: Workflow has been the driving force behind my decision to embrace the iPad as my primary computer. Workflow is a shining example of the power of automation combined with user creativity and its underlying mission has always been clear: to allow anyone to improve how iOS can get things done for them in a better, faster, more flexible way. Workflow is the modern bicycle for the mind. There's nothing else like it. I want to personally congratulate the Workflow team for building a beautiful product that has enabled thousands of people to be more productive from iOS every day. I hope that Apple will continue to believe in the vision behind Workflow's automation. If Apple takes Workflow seriously, its automation – now deeply integrated with iOS and private APIs – could fundamentally reinvent iOS for power users, especially on the iPad. It's an exciting time for iOS productivity and automation. I can't wait to see what Apple's newfound interest in automation is going to produce.

Apple is reportedly in the grip of a very public extortion attempt, with the blackmailers promising to wipe 200 million iCloud accounts and reset the iPhones to factory default if they do not receive tens of thousands of dollars. The hackers claim to have access to hundreds of million iCloud accounts which they've promised to use to reset customers' iPhones if they do not receive US $75,000 in bitcoin, or US $100,000 in iTunes gift cards by 7 April. Motherboard, a tech news outlet, broke the story yesterday, having been tipped off by the extortionists. The group handed over screenshots of a conversation that it had supposedly had with Apple's security team and an account which was apparently used to communicate with the team. It did not, however, hand over details of any accounts which might verify the group's claims. In the correspondence between the two groups, The Turkish crime family claims to have access to 300 million apple email accounts, only then to change that number to 559 million accounts.   According to Twitter accounts thought to be associated with the group, the number of accounts in its possession has increased to 627 million, and the group claims to be strengthening its infrastructure for the upcoming assault. The Twitter account also promised more attacks and that this assault on iCloud accounts would only be its first. We are a new organization, the 7 April 2017 attack isn't going to be our only one. This is just the start. — Turkish Crime Family (@turkcrimefamily) March 21, 2017 Publicity is often sought by hackers to help further their extortion efforts. Not only did the hackers publish a video showing them accessing accounts, but according to Motherboard, went to multiple outlets before approaching them. Apple has not yet responded for comment.

Weighs less than 2.5 pounds. Bright, clear display. USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 support. Anti-Fry cable protection. Cons Ethernet requires a dongle. Omits OneLink+ dock compatibility. No touch screen option. Bottom Line The latest Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon is a very thin, light, and powerful laptop that lasts nearly 16 hours on battery power. By Joel Santo Domingo The latest ThinkPad X1 Carbon (starts at $1,349; $1,629 as tested) is the thinnest and lightest one yet. Lenovo's flagship business ultraportable weighs less than 2.5 pounds, yet has the processing muscle to power through presentations, spreadsheets, and a lot more. And with almost 16 hours of battery life, this laptop is built to handle those long work sessions when a wall outlet is nowhere in sight. It's the best ultraportable for business, whether you're a C-level executive or the proprietor of a small-to-medium-size business. //Compare Similar Products Compare Lenovo ThinkPad X260   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple MacBook (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (4th Gen, 2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS 13 Touch (2016 Rose Gold Edition)   %displayPrice%%seller% VAIO S   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Precision 15 5000 Series (5510)   %displayPrice%%seller% HP EliteBook Folio G1 (1080p HD)   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo ThinkPad 13   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Chromebook 14 for Work   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Chromebook 13 G1   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell Latitude 13 3000 Series 2-in-1 (3379)   %displayPrice%%seller% Getac S410   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple MacBook Pro 13-Inch (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Honey, I Shrunk the Laptop! It was easy to tote last year's X1 Carbon around the office, and the fifth-generation iteration is even more portable. It measures a smaller and thinner 0.6 by 12.7 by 8.5 inches (HWD), and at 2.45 pounds, it's 14 ounces lighter too. The 14-inch laptop is closer in thinness and weight to the 12-inch Apple MacBook (0.52-inch thick; 1.99 pounds), though some of the X1 Carbon's extra thickeness is due to its wider port selection. View All 6 Photos in Gallery On the left side are a pair of USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 3. The Apple MacBook has just one USB-C port (sans Thunderbolt 3 support), while the Dell XPS 13 Touch gives you one USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 port, though like the X1 Carbon, it also has a selection of legacy ports. Both of the X1 Carbon's USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports support charging and DisplayPort (with an adapter, which is not included), in addition to data transmission at USB 3.1 (10Gbps) and Thunderbolt 3 (40Gbps) speeds. You're all set for multi-monitor support (up to three displays) or a single-cable connection to a supported dock, like the Lenovo ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 dock ($279.99) or ThinkPad USB-C Dock ($199.99), or to a Thunderbolt 3-equipped monitor. Good thing, because this X1 Carbon iteration loses the Lenovo OneLink+ docking connector you may use on your current Lenovo ThinkPad. You'll also find an HDMI jack on the left side, as well as a USB 3.0 port, and a proprietary mini-Ethernet jack that works with an included dongle. The XPS 13 Touch also needs a USB-to-Ethernet dongle for wired connections, but that system is aimed at consumers, while the X1 Carbon is all business. The dongle is easy to forget in your office, a definite drawback if you travel to a hotel with iffy Wi-Fi service. On the right side are a headset jack, a second USB 3.0 port, and a security-lock port. Around back are a microSD card slot and a SIM card slot for an optional 4G LTE modem. Another notable feature is Anti-Fry protection. All USB-C chargers will physically plug into the USB-C ports on the laptop so it's easy to plug the wrong cable into the X1 Carbon, but not all chargers and cables are as well engineered as the ones that come with Acer, Apple, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and other first-tier laptops. The X1 Carbon can prevent damage if you're using a non-standard AC adapter (say the one that comes with a no-name $125 Windows tablet). When we plugged a 36W USB adapter (made for Android phablets) in, it couldn't supply enough power to charge the laptop, but when we plugged the 60W AC adapter from the discontinued Google Chromebook Pixel into the X1 Carbon it charged the battery without incident. This is a good sign that USB-C charger interoperability is progressing, so you won't necessarily have to buy a Lenovo-sourced replacement if you lose yours. The 14-inch In-Plane Switching (IPS) display has full HD resolution, with very small bezels around the screen, which helps shrink the overall depth and width of the laptop. The webcam is in its usual spot centered over the screen, avoiding the camera-angle problems of the Dell XPS 13 Touch, which has the it below the screen, so it almost looks up your nose if you don't readjust the lid. The screen is rated for 300-nit brightness, a bit less than the 400-nit display on the Dell XPS 13, but both are easily readable in direct sunlight. Not surprisingly, the X1 Carbon's keyboard is one of the most comfortable in the business, and it has an embedded TrackPoint pointing stick for ThinkPad vets. There's also a one-piece, glass-surface touchpad below three physical mouse buttons. The fingerprint reader that sits to the right of the touchpad works with Windows Hello, and can be integrated into your company's security policies for one-touch logins to your accounts. The speakers are on the base, pointed toward you. They produce an impressive amount of sound, though it's understandably tuned for voice use in web conferences. Our review configuration comes with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. While you can replace the SSD with something larger (up to 1TB). Memory is soldered to the motherboard, so you will have to choose between 8GB and 16GB when you order the system. Our unit has Microsoft Signature prep, a service that eliminates any added bloatware, so a Microsoft Office 2016 Trial, a few Lenovo utilities, and Windows 10 Pro are all that are on the drive. A Productivity Workhorse Our X1 Carbon test unit is equipped with an Intel Core i5-7300U processor with integrated Intel HD Graphics 620. Advances in the CPU technology and the SSD's data throughput helped the laptop achieve top scores in the PCMark 8 Work Conventional (3,240 points), CineBench (367 points), and Photoshop (3 minutes, 36 seconds) tests, ahead of rivals like the Apple MacBook, the Dell XPS 13 Touch, the Lenovo ThinkPad X260, and the VAIO S. With a score of 2:38 in Handbrake, the X1 Carbon trailed the Dell XPS 13 (2:08), though not enough for it to be a concern. The X1 Carbon was above average in our 3D benchmark tests, making it good enough for business-related 3D rendering. You can even play a casual game like Minecraft in your down time. This laptop will serve you well over the three to eight years it takes your company to depreciate its capital expense. In our battery rundown test, the X1 Carbon lasted an impressive 15 hours and 59 minutes. That's hours longer than all the ultraportables in its category, save the Lenovo ThinkPad X260 (23:08), which has the benefit of an extended battery (it managed 10:45 with its standard battery). It certainly lasts longer than the the HP EliteBook 1040 G3 , which lasted 6 hours, 55 minutes: less than the 8 hours we'd consider all-day computing. This means you're all set for any trans-oceanic trip, even if there's no AC power at your seat. It'll certainly last a couple of business days between charges, longer if you let the system sleep between uses. See How We Test Laptops The Best Ultraportable You Can Buy The latest iteration of the Lenovo X1 Carbon is easy to carry everywhere, it's sleek enough to show off, it'll last all day (and then some), and it has the power to motor through office and multimedia tasks easily. In addition, the screen is brilliant, and the keyboard is top-notch. It's about $300 more expensive than the Lenovo ThinkPad X260, another favorite, but that extra cost gets you a thinner, lighter, and more powerful laptop, and adds forward-thinking features, like two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and two USB 3.0 ports, to the mix. It's our top pick for business ultraportables. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

March. 23, 2017 07:12. by Ji-Hyun Kim jhk85@donga.com. Apple is launching a red version of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones to commemorate its partnership with fighting AIDS. “Since we began working with (RED) 10 years ago, our customers have made a significant impact in fighting the spread of AIDS through the purchase of our products, from the original iPod nano (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition all the way to today’s line-up of Beats products and accessories for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook says. This is the first time in its history that the U.S. tech giant is introducing an iPhone series in red. (RED) was founded in 2006 by singer Bono and activist Bobby Shriver. The organization has raised more than 465 million U.S. dollars in fund to support the fight against AIDS, and Apple has donated more than 130 million dollars. Electronics industry insiders are paying attention to Apple’s unusual move to introduce a special edition in March, given that the company used to unveil new products in September. Apple is unveiling the new edition just one week ahead of Samsung Electronics’ introduction of the flagship "Galaxy S8." iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition will come in 128 gigabytes and 256 gigabyte models. Order can be placed at online and offline stores worldwide from Friday.

The organization has raised more than 465 million U.S. dollars in fund to support the fight against AIDS, and Apple has donated more than 130 million dollars. Electronics industry insiders are paying attention to Apple’s unusual move to introduce a special edition in March, given that the company used to unveil new products in September. Apple is unveiling the new edition just one week ahead of Samsung Electronics’ introduction of the flagship "Galaxy S8." iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition will come in 128 gigabytes and 256 gigabyte models. Order can be placed at online and offline stores worldwide from Friday.

The outlet received a statement from the developers, as well as Apple, confirming the deal, but the financial details are not yet known. For those who aren’t familiar with the app, Workflow is similar to the popular IFTTT service in that it allows you to create custom recipes to perform complex tasks. The app was designed by former jailbreak developers. Here’s a statement from Workflow’s Ari Weinstein: “We are thrilled to be joining Apple. We’ve worked closely with Apple from the very beginning, from kickstarting our company as students attending WWDC to developing and launching Workflow and seeing its amazing success on the App Store. We can’t wait to take our work to the next level at Apple and contribute to products that touch people across the world.” And here is Apple’s comment: “The Workflow app was selected for an Apple Design Award in 2015 because of its outstanding use of iOS accessibility features, in particular an outstanding implementation for VoiceOver with clearly labeled items, thoughtful hints, and drag/drop announcements, making the app usable and quickly accessible to those who are blind or low-vision.” TechCrunch says the deal was finalized today, and both the app and the small team will be joining Apple. While the company tends to shutdown acquired apps, Workflow will remain active and even go free later today.

Sebastien I would definitely not assume that. As a matter of fact, I am wondering what Apple will do with not only the app, but the team behind it. SKR Imaging you never know.. of course they will somehow merge the assets of Workflow into iOS.. allow developers to call for actions through WorkflowKit or something… maybe home kit automation.. “when I get home, open TV, turn on living room lights, turn heat on, play my favourite Apple Music track..” AMB_07 That IS the real worry, people rarely think about the team behind the apps. CAIO MARIOZ Amazing ericesque I’m going to take a minute to be wildly over optimistic and imagine Workflow with even tighter OS integration. I have many scripts that should be completely automated, but due to OS restrictions, require an extra tap or two on my part (see: sending a text message requires me to manually tap send after Workflow drops me into Messages). It’ll never happen, but dreaming just feels good sometimes. Chang in Charge Some of the actions that are used to compose automations have already been disabled, i.e. google street view actions, google maps actions, uber actions. This being my favorite app for the last two years it really felt like this was going to happen sooner or later. This app was way to innovative for this team to not get acquired eventually. Hopefully this level of automation makes its way into iOS. Not counting on it though. Rowan09 If Apple acquire them that’s the plan. Just like they added train directions after acquiring 2 companies, I would expect the same. Tdt Could it be the beginning of a new integration in iOS? What I’d want (or someone’d want) is the possibility that Apple could open its OS to new functionalities without the Jailbreak… Is that an “utopia”?   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines How to view the HTML source code of a web page on iOS or Mac How to change the default search scope in Finder MaskMe10 lets you mask notifications based on keywords or specific names This charging cable is like MagSafe for your iPhone Apple acquires powerful automation app Workflow   The latest jailbreak news MaskMe10 lets you mask notifications based on keywords or specific names Home Depot 32-bit jailbreak update released Choose the default email app on your iPhone with MailClientDefault10 NotifyCensored lets you hide notification banner content on a per-app basis This tweak prevents the passcode screen from appearing after every respring iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Apple to debut augmented reality content on iPhone… Apple to debut augmented reality content on iPhone ahead of dedicated hardware By Brad Jones — March 20, 2017 8:15 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Apple isn't giving up on augmented reality, and functionality related to the tech could show up on the iPhone as soon as next year. It’s no secret that Apple is interested in augmented reality, as the company’s CEO Tim Cook has said as much publicly several times before. However, there’s now confirmation that Apple is actively pursuing the technology, with a view to introducing related functionality in an upcoming iteration of the iPhone. A team of hundreds is working on AR under the former head of Dolby’s hardware and new technologies group, Mike Rockwell, according to a report from Bloomberg. Rockwell is reporting to Dan Riccio, who helms the iPad and iPhone engineering groups, which hints at the way Apple plans to familiarize users with AR. Some engineers on the iPhone team are apparently already working on AR functionality. For instance, there’s a feature in development that would allow iPhone users to take a photograph, then isolate a single object in the image and tilt it 180 degrees. More: Apple making major augmented reality push, CEO Tim Cook confirms Another feature is said to use AR to superimpose digital effects and imagery over a person’s image, like the various filters offered by Snapchat. This functionality is expected to underpinned by the work of PrimeSense, a motion-sensor firm that Apple acquired in 2013. For the time being, the iPhone is the centerpiece of Apple’s AR strategy. However, looking further forward, the company hopes to launch a dedicated device that specializes in this type of content. Apple is working on a pair of glasses designed for AR, which will likely be tethered to the iPhone in a similar manner to the Apple Watch. As well as the hardware, it’s vital that an appealing spread of content is assembled to encourage users to adopt the device, which is why some features are being prepped to hit the iPhone in 2018 and beyond. While the likes of Oculus and HTC pursue virtual reality, it’s interesting to see both Apple and Microsoft concentrate their efforts on AR tech. Apple clearly has plenty of ambition when it comes to this sector, but there are still major doubts as to whether the general public has any interest.

 Apple just bought the app it once crowned 'most innovative' and made it free for everyone Biz Carson Mar. 22, 2017, 8:30 PM 72,337 facebook linkedin twitter email print Workflow If you can't beat it, buy it. That's what Apple did on Wednesday when it acquired an app called Workflow, an automation app that it had labeled "most innovative" in 2015.  Apple confirmed the acquisition to Business Insider on Wednesday but did not disclose the price or any other terms of the deal. Workflow takes a complicated series of tasks, that would normally require opening multiple apps, and lets users press one button to get the job done. For example, if you want to let someone know you're running late, you can use the "running late" workflow to automatically find your next calendar event, get the travel time, create a text and fire off a message.    It's so powerful that at the time, Business Insider's Alex Heath called it the "Swiss Army knife for completing tasks" and said it could potentially replace entire apps on your home screen. Workflow first caught the eye of Apple first in 2015, and now the company confirmed it acquired it on Wednesday. In a rare move, the company is keeping the app alive in the App Store and setting its price to free. It previously cost $2.99. As part of the deal, Workflow's creators — developers Ari Weinstein, Conrad Kramer, and Nick Frey — will be joining Apple, according to TechCrunch, which first reported the deal. "We are thrilled to be joining Apple," said Weinstein in a statement to TechCrunch. "We’ve worked closely with Apple from the very beginning, from kickstarting our company as students attending WWDC to developing and launching Workflow and seeing its amazing success on the App Store. We can’t wait to take our work to the next level at Apple and contribute to products that touch people across the world."

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Hackers threaten to wipe millions of Apple devices, demand ransom Lucian Constantin 23 March, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments Security A group of hackers is threatening to wipe data from millions of Apple devices in two weeks if the company doesn’t pay them $150,000. The group, which calls itself the Turkish Crime Family, claims to have login credentials for more than 627 million icloud.com, me.com and mac.com email addresses. These are email domains that Apple has allowed for users creating iCloud accounts over the years. Even though the Turkish Crime Family hasn’t been in the media spotlight before, its members claim that they’ve been involved in selling stolen online databases in private circles for the past few years. The group said via email that it has had a database of about 519 million iCloud credentials for some time, but did not attempt to sell it until now. The interest for such accounts on the black market has been low due to security measures Apple has put in place in recent years, it said. Since announcing its plan to wipe devices associated with iCloud accounts, the group claimed that other hackers have stepped forward and shared additional account credentials with them, putting the current number it holds at over 627 million. According to the hackers, over 220 million of these credentials have been verified to work and provide access to iCloud accounts that don’t have security measures like two-factor authentication turned on. This was determined by testing the credentials using automated scripts and a very large number of proxy servers to avoid getting banned by Apple, the hackers said. Initially the group asked Apple for the equivalent of $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum cryptocurrency. The ransom value has been raised to $150,000 and the group intends to increase it further if Apple doesn’t pay in three days. News website Motherboard reported seeing alleged emails between the hackers and Apple in which a member of the company’s security team said that the company does not plan to reward cybercriminals for breaking the law and that the communications have been archived and sent to the authorities. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the absence of payment, the group plans to launch an automated attack on April 7 that would log into iCloud accounts and wipe their contents and the devices associated with them. “We are doing this because we can and mainly to spread awareness for Karim Baratov and Kerem Albayrak, both of whom are being detained for the Yahoo hack and one of them is most probably facing heavy sentencing in America,” a representative for the group said via email. “Kerem Albayrak on the other hand is being accused of listing the database for sale online.” The representative said that the group’s members are originally from Istanbul, Turkey, but that they now “rep” Green Lanes, an area in North London. Karim Baratov, a Canadian national, was indicted last week for allegedly hacking into email accounts at various email providers at the request of two officers from the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB. The same indictment accuses the two FSB officers and a Russian hacker for breaking into Yahoo’s infrastructure and gaining access to over 500 million Yahoo accounts. The Turkish Crime Family’s claims haven’t been confirmed by Apple so far, but someone posted a video on YouTube showing some of the leaked credentials being used to access iCloud accounts. The group claims that the person who posted the video is not one of their members, but that he had access to one of the servers hosting their database, which is how he managed to get the credentials and record the video. The video shows usernames and passwords in plain text, even though Apple most likely doesn’t store passwords in plain text in its database. This would be a very bad security practice and one that serious websites have avoided for many years. However, it is possible that these passwords were stolen as part of other breaches or cracked from stolen cryptographic hashes and then matched to iCloud accounts due to password reuse practices. Most passwords shown in the video are not complex enough to withstand brute-force attacks. If Apple does confirm the group’s claims, it could force password resets for its entire iCloud user base just to be on the safe side. Until then, concerned users can change their passwords on their own and turn on the iCloud two-factor authentication feature.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Apple today confirmed that it has acquired DeskConnect, the startup behind Workflow, an iOS app that makes it possible for people to build custom actions involving multiple apps. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Apple has now made the app free, instead of charging $3 for it, and the app will remain available, an Apple spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. Currently, the app supports more than 200 actions, with integrations into Apple apps, as well as third-party services like Dropbox, Evernote, and Facebook. In that sense, Workflow resembles Automator, an Apple utility app that ships with macOS Sierra but has no standard-issue equivalent for iOS. The news was originally reported by TechCrunch. DeskConnect killed its eponymous cross-platform file-transfer app last month. The company suggested people try using Apple’s AirDrop, Handoff, and Universal Clipboard, among other services. The Workflow app won an Apple Design Award in 2015. My colleague Harrison Weber called Workflow one of the 15 most beautifully designed apps of 2015. DeskConnect was founded in 2012 and was based in San Francisco. Investors include Rough Draft Ventures. LinkedIn indicates DeskConnect has nine employees.

The most recent is a deep red that matches earlier special-edition Product Red devices. But before that, Apple added two fresh colors to its catalog when it first released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus back in September. The first was a matte black that replaces Apple’s space gray color with a stealth black color, and the second was a color unlike anything we’ve ever seen before. Dubbed “Jet Black,” the glossy, mirror finish instantly became the most desirable new iPhone color available, and it remains the most attractive option out there… with one big caveat. Apple’s Jet Black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are indeed absolutely gorgeous — until you actually start using them. Don't Miss: New leaks show how impressive Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design truly is Apple’s smooth and glossy Jet Black finish is indeed an industry first, but unfortunately the finish is nowhere near as durable as it is attractive. Jet Black iPhones are so prone to scratching that Apple had to include the following disclaimer on its website: The high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process. Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use. If you are concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iPhone. That’s a nice way to put it. Another way to put it is this: your phone is going to get scratched up as soon as you start using it. A case offers some protection for the Jet Black finish, of course, but then a new question presents itself. If you’re going to cover up your iPhone with a case, why get Jet Black to begin with? So, a number of people have decided to go caseless. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to work out very well. We’ve seen plenty of people post photos of what happens to the Jet Black finish on Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus over time when it’s not protected by a case, and now a new post on Reddit serves as a painful reminder to any Apple fans out there who are considering a caseless Jet Black iPhone.

According to TechCrunch, Apple finalized the deal today but financial details are not yet available. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In a statement, Workflow developer Ari Weinstein said that the team is thrilled to be joining Apple and remarked on how amazing of a journey it has been going from the company’s beginnings to today: “We are thrilled to be joining Apple,” said Weinstein in a statement. “We’ve worked closely with Apple from the very beginning, from kickstarting our company as students attending WWDC to developing and launching Workflow and seeing its amazing success on the App Store. We can’t wait to take our work to the next level at Apple and contribute to products that touch people across the world.” Apple has also confirmed the acquisition. The company said in a statement that Workflow’s use of iOS accessibility features is something that really makes the app standout out from other services. In 2015, the app won an Apple Design Award, something Apple attributes to those accessibility features in today’s statement: “The Workflow app was selected for an Apple Design Award in 2015 because of its outstanding use of iOS accessibility features, in particular an outstanding implementation for VoiceOver with clearly labeled items, thoughtful hints, and drag/drop announcements, making the app usable and quickly accessible to those who are blind or low-vision.” Workflow is based around the idea of transforming a process that would normally take a handful of interactions with iOS into a single tap. The goal is to “hide” a complex set of commands under a single, instant tap of a button. What’s somewhat unusual about Apple’s acquisition of Workflow is that the app will remain on the App Store and has transformed into a free offering today. It’s unclear at this point how the Workflow team will be integrated into Apple, but the acquisition is good news for pro users who have called on Apple to make iOS more powerful, as well as good news for those who have called the iOS interface overly complicated.

Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article The 2017 iPad range has three categories of device: iPad mini, iPad and iPad Pro. — Apple handout pi via AFP-RelaxnewsCUPERTINO, March 23 — Apple’s latest iPad — replacing the iPad Air 2 — is a relatively inexpensive 9.7-inch tablet that bridges the gap between the compact iPad mini and the high-end iPad Pro. Splitting the iPad offer into three distinct categories makes Apple’s tablet offer clearer and easier for consumers to understand, which hasn’t always been the case. The original iPad launched in 2010, riding high on the success of Apple’s iPhone smartphone. This 9.7-inch (1024 x 768 pixels) touchscreen tablet was essentially based on the same principle as the phone but came without call capabilities. It ran the same operating system (iOS) and offered users the same selection of applications, although many weren’t initially compatible with the new format. The iPad was released in the USA on April 3, in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi/3G versions, before progressively conquering the rest of the world. In 2012, the third-generation iPad brought a high-resolution “Retina” display, which is now the norm across the brand’s tablet range. In November 2012, Apple presented the iPad mini, a more compact and affordable take on the touchscreen tablet. This 7.9-inch slate brought Apple in line with tough new competitors like Google (Nexus 7) and Amazon (Kindle Fire), in the increasingly popular market for small-format devices. The iPad mini also came with a more affordable price tag, starting at US$329. Then in 2015 came the iPad Pro, with a larger screen size (12.9 inches), boosted performances and an accompanying stylus. Thanks to the A9X processor, Apple billed the tablet as a head-on rival for certain PCs, especially when paired with its various accessories (a keyboard and a stylus, sold separately). The iPad Pro also now comes in a 9.7-inch version, still promising more powerful performances than the newest standard iPad model. As always with Apple, price is above all determined by internal storage capacity. The cheapest model in the firm’s current tablet range is the new iPad, in its 32GB Wi-Fi version, starting at US$329 (RM1,456). At the top-end, 32GB versions of the iPad Pro start at US$500 for the 9.7-inch model and US$799 for the 12.9-inch model. The iPad mini 4 is now only available with 128GB of storage, which explains its slightly higher retail price — from US$399 — over the new iPad. All models are available in Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi + cellular versions. Although global tablet sales have been declining since 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook is still highly optimistic about the future of the iPad. He hopes to continue positioning high-end models as credible alternatives to PCs. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Smartphone device can test sperm quality Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Montblanc just launched a smartwatch — here’s why it matters China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Google could have three Pixel handsets in store for late 2017 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Touchscreen tablets found beneficial to the visually impaired Analysts: Consumers are turning away from tablets and towards 2-in-1s Say hello to Apple’s brand new iPad Pro!

First we discover PayPal founder and Trump acolyte Peter Thiel is a secret citizen, now it's emerged Apple pays the country absolutely nothing in taxes.  Apparently the tech giant paid no income tax on local profits to Inland Revenue over the past 10 years, because its local operations are owned and run out of Australia. According to financial documents examined by the New Zealand Herald, this was despite Apple Sales New Zealand making sales of NZ$4.2 billion ($2.96 billion) since 2007. SEE ALSO: Apple patent suggests an iPhone VR headset in your future Matt Nippert (the same journalist who uncovered Thiel's citizenship), found the income tax owed to New Zealand was instead sent to the Australian Tax Office. Apple's Australian branch said the company follows the law and pays tax on everything it earns. "Apple aims to be a force for good and we're proud of the contributions we've made in New Zealand over the past decade," a spokesperson said in a statement. "Because our products and services are created, designed and engineered in the US, that's where the vast majority of our tax is paid." The New Zealand revelation is only the latest controversy caused by Apple's byzantine tax structures around the world. In August, the European Commission ruled Apple should pay €13 billion ($14 billion) in retroactive taxes to Ireland. The investigation found Ireland had violated EU law by giving Apple "illegal" tax benefits unavailable to other corporations. Apple CEO Tim Cook reacted angrily at the time, writing in a letter to customers that the European Commission was trying to "rewrite Apple's history in Europe." "The most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe," he said. "Using the Commission's theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed." Closer to home, Apple was brought before a Senate inquiry in Australia in 2015 after it emerged substantial local profits were being funnelled through Irish subsidiaries. A 2014 report from Fairfax Media found Apple paid A$80 million ($61 million) tax on A$6 billion ($4.6 billion) worth of revenue in 2014, shifting A$8.9 billion ($6.8 billion) of untaxed revenue via Ireland. Apple's managing director in Australia, Tony King, maintained at the time that Apple met all its Australian tax obligations. Inland Revenue said it could not comment on the affairs of individual taxpayers.

On stage at the IEEE TechIgnite conference in Burlingame, California, on Wednesday, he gave a glimpse into how a tech legend thinks. On open source In the early Seventies, Wozniak read about phone phreaking, in which "phreakers" made free phone calls by using electronics to mimic the tones used for dialing each number. To learn how to do it, he went to the only place he knew that had books and magazines about computers: The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. He went on a Sunday and walked right in. "The smartest people in the world don't lock doors," Wozniak said. A similar philosophy led him to give away his design for what later became the Apple 1. After drawing up plans that would let people build their own computer for US$300, he handed them out at the Homebrew Computer Club, an early gathering place for tinkerers who helped launched the PC revolution. He didn't even include copyright notices. "My motivation wasn't to start a company, wasn't to make money, it was actually just to show off my engineering excellence," he said. It was a non-engineer friend, Steve Jobs, who persuaded him to monetize both phreaking and the personal computer. On resourcefulness Wozniak always sought to build things with not only the fewest parts but also the cheapest ones. After learning about phreaking, he set out to build a machine for it in his dorm room. "I bought a sack of diodes at Radio Shack that weren't guaranteed. And about half of them were bad, but I didn't know which half. ... When a tone didn't work on my box, I would go to this guy who had perfect pitch. He was a musician in the next room over." On myths and movies: The early days of Apple are the stuff of legend and pop culture now, but not all the stories are true, according to Wozniak. One is a scene in the Ashton Kutcher film "Jobs" in which Jobs pushes Bob Dylan on a Beatles-loving Wozniak. When they met, Jobs was 16 and had no music albums at home, Wozniak said. "I"m the one who introduced Steve Jobs to all this Bob Dylan stuff." The two ended up going to many concerts and collecting bootleg recordings and analyses of Dylan's lyrics. On robotics: If he were young today, Wozniak would go into robotics. He wants to design a robot that could go into a house it doesn't know, find the kitchen on its own, and figure out how to make coffee. He's not too worried about the machines taking over. "It's getting scary the direction it's heading, but it'll take a long, long time before there's something like a master race over humans. They'll need us," Wozniak said. On education: Wozniak, who has worked as a grade-school teacher, said motivation is more important than knowledge from books or teachers. "If you want to learn something, you'll get there," he said. It's good for children to learn programming, but they should wait until age 12 for their brains to mature, he said. On his dream job: Before he and Jobs founded Apple, Wozniak offered his PC designs to Hewlett-Packard, where he worked on the company's legendary calculators. He didn't want to risk that position by starting a new company. The fifth time HP turned him down, he reluctantly left. Forty years later, in a very different Silicon Valley, the job of Wozniak's dreams is a poignant vision: "I was going to be an engineer forever at Hewlett-Packard, because you could get old and still be an engineer there. How lucky for me! I would never lose my job at HP." ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The deal was reportedly finalized today for an unspecified sum. Workflow, first released in 2014, is an automation tool that can essentially do anything. It allows users to create a variety of workflows to accomplish tasks like creating GIFs from a series of photos, pulling images from a web page, translating an article, posting photos to multiple social networks at once, calculating a tip, and tons more. It is equipped with a built-in Gallery, which allows people to quickly find and use a wide range of automation tasks, and it can be used to create custom automations. Apple is purchasing the Workflow app and the Workflow team, including Ari Weinstein, Conrad Kramer, and Nick Frey, will be joining the company. "We are thrilled to be joining Apple," said Weinstein in a statement. "We've worked closely with Apple from the very beginning, from kickstarting our company as students attending WWDC to developing and launching Workflow and seeing its amazing success on the App Store. We can't wait to take our work to the next level at Apple and contribute to products that touch people across the world.Apple confirmed the acquisition of Workflow, which notably received an Apple Design Award in 2015 for its excellent accessibility features, likely one of the reasons behind the purchase. Typically apps acquired from Apple disappear from the App Store, but Workflow will remain available and will be made free starting later today. The Gallery will continue to be updated on a regular basis, as will app integrations. Beyond the app, it is not clear what Apple will do with Workflow in the future, and whether it will be built into future versions of iOS and macOS, but it is definitely a possibility. TechCrunch speculates that it could be used alongside Siri in the future, or perhaps be the backbone of powerful automation tools for the iPad. Update: Workflow can now be downloaded from the App Store for free. [Direct Link] Tags: Apple acquisition, Workflow [ 82 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) OmarKhafagy 14 hours ago at 04:50 pm Two ways this could go: 1. Workflow is left to die a slow and agonizing death while the team is reassigned to (probably AI-related) projects. 2. Workflow gets superpowered with deeper access to the OS. Here's hoping it's number 2. EDIT: I'd be curious to see if they'd be willing to acquire Launch Centre Pro or perhaps build something similar to it right into the OS. To me, the combo of LCP & Workflow is a fantastic 1-2 punch. Rating: 16 Votes jclo 14 hours ago at 05:00 pm Having Workflow built directly into iOS, especially on the iPad, would be amazing.

In speaking with Motherboard, the hackers say they’ve been in contact with Apple’s security team regarding a ransom of $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum (another decentralized blockchain-based distributed computing platform) or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards. The team reportedly provided the publication with access to an e-mail account and screenshots of e-mails between them and Apple’s security team. The hackers also shared a YouTube video in which it appears as though they log into some stolen accounts including one allegedly belonging to an elderly woman. Said account includes backed-up photos as well as the ability to remotely wipe her device. In an alleged reply from Apple, the company asks the hackers to remove the video uploaded to YouTube as it is seeking unwanted attention. The Cupertino-based company goes on to say that they do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law and that the communications with them will be sent to the authorities. The publication says the hackers have told Apple they will reset a number of the iCloud accounts and remotely wipe victim’s devices on April 7 unless the ransom is paid. As Motherboard notes, there are some inconsistencies in the hackers’ story. At one point, they claimed they had 559 million accounts, not 300 million. Also, it’s not all that difficult to fake screenshots and e-mails. Then again, it’s entirely possible that they do have access to the accounts but are keeping details close to the vest. Barring any legal intervention or patches, I suppose we’ll find out either way come April 7. In the meantime, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to change your Apple account password and enable two-factor authentication if you haven’t already done so.

CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Bill O'Leary. By Bloomberg News Mar 22, 2017 at 5:38 pm | Print View Amazon.com’s battle with Apple over digital assistants is moving to a new venue ­— hotel rooms, where Alexa and Siri are both vying to be the voice-controlled platform of choice for travelers. Marriott International, the world’s biggest lodging company, is testing devices from the two tech giants at its Aloft hotel in Boston’s Seaport district to determine which is best to let guests turn on lights, close drapes, control room temperature and change television channels via voice command. In December, Wynn Resorts Ltd. became the first hotel company to install Alexa-powered Echo devices, starting with suites at its flagship Wynn Las Vegas property. Technology companies are using hotel room as showrooms for new services and devices that also can control so-called smart homes. Amazon and Apple are competing for dominance in the nascent market, which promises to let consumers access and manage household systems such as heating, cooling, lighting and entertainment by speaking a request at home or using a smartphone from afar. Marriott expects to decide whether to adopt the technology for one or more of its chains as early as midyear, potentially boosting sales for the device of choice. More important, it will increase the winning company’s exposure in the market for voice-activated devices, which are gaining more mainstream traction. “Those two players are in the game right now,” said Toni Stoeckl, who oversees the Aloft, Element, AC and Moxy chains as global brand leader for lifestyle brands at Marriott. There are almost 130 Aloft hotels in the United States, and more than 100 additional ones planned. Your next Nation & World articles Gorsuch hearings Day 3: Supreme Court pi ...

By Emily Bary March 22, 2017 5:30 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large These little guys could soon end up being more useful than the Apple Watch. Illustration: Stephen Lam/Getty Images Just a few months old and still largely sold out, Apple’s AirPods are gaining on the company’s better known watch line. The AirPods already have key advantages over the Apple Watch. The wireless earpods already make it easier -- and arguably less awkward -- to converse with Siri. And they should get health-tracking capabilities, just like the watch, in the near future. “At this point, it might not even be that crazy to say it, but we think AirPods are going to be a bigger product for Apple than the Watch,” wrote Doug Clinton, an analyst at Loup Ventures. More from Barron’s Next Apple’s AirPods Could Be Pioneering a Whole New Product Category Here’s How to Fix Wearables Here Comes The iPhone ‘Supercycle’ While Apple might sell roughly the same amount of Apple Watches and AirPods this calendar year, AirPod unit sales will outpace watch sales next year, according to Loup Ventures estimates. And by 2020, Apple could sell three times as many AirPods as it does watches -- enough for the two products to bring in the same amount of revenue. Ears, like wrists, can pick up on biometric data like heart rate. Apple has filed for a patent to make earphones that pick up on that and other measures, including temperature and EKG, Clinton points out. The big issue is finding a way to incorporate these elements without draining battery or making the earphones too heavy. In our review of the AirPods, we noted that ears had, until now, been neglected in the “wearable” category: “The AirPods are light enough and comfortable enough that they could be worn like other wearables (i.e. nearly all the time), while giving the same information you get from a watch and probably more.” Some analysts are now referring to the category as hearables. Clothing is also gaining steam in the wearable space. Big Picture: Apple’s AirPods arrived with less fanfare than the Apple Watch, but the earphones are poised to become the company’s hot wearable product.

Amazon brings Alexa to its main iOS app to help iPhone users shop and track... Smart bulbs that work with Amazon's Alexa Video Watch SwapBots spring to life thanks to augmented reality Amazon’s Alexa has successfully challenged Apple on your home turf—literally. The Echo and other various Alexa-equipped devices are rapidly becoming the go-to when you need assistance at home, though Apple’s HomeKit has the edge when it comes to automation and security standards. But the real battle comes down to Alexa vs. Siri—which voice-activated assistant is more useful? Now hotel chains are trying to decide for themselves. The high-end Wynn Las Vegas resort chose Alexa last December, adding Amazon Echo devices in its suites. Now Marriott International is trying to decide between Amazon and Apple, according to a Bloomberg report. The JW Marriott in San Antonio, Texas has been testing Amazon Alexa-integrated devices since October as an operator of sorts—the conduit to room service and housekeeping. Alexa can also control the lighting in a handful of the Marriott’s rooms, though that isn’t her primary role. But Marriott International, which owns Marriott, W Hotels, Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, Sheraton, Westin, etc., etc., is trying to decide between Alexa and Siri to control a wide variety of functions, including lighting, drapes, room temperature, and TV. The company is testing out both Amazon and Apple devices at one of its Aloft hotels in Boston. Aloft is Marriott’s experimental brand, where the company has used robot butlers and Apple Watches to replace room keys. According to Bloomberg, Marriott will decide between the two companies’ devices sometime this summer. It’s unclear whether Alexa or Siri will come to just the Aloft hotels, of which there are 130 in the U.S., or to all Marriott brands down the line. “The race is still on,” Toni Stoeckl, Marriott’s global brand leader of lifestyle brands, told Bloomberg. Why this matters: Putting HomeKit-compatible, Siri-capable devices in hotel rooms would be key to getting those devices in more homes. If you have a good experience at a resort and can replicate that at home with a splurge from the Apple Store, why not? The same applies for Amazon. The hotel room could be a gateway to the smart home, and not vice versa. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

The news today throws that logic out the window and confirms that some of the top PC vendors are planning to raise prices in 2017. If Apple gets away with it, then why can't they, right? Apple has led the way in pricing for success for some time now and more PC vendors are going to follow that model.   According to a supply chain report today, in order to reflect continual hikes in component costs, including display panels, DRAM, SSDs, Li batteries, PC vendors including Apple are likely planning to raise retail prices when new models equipped with revised Kaby Lake processors launched in Q3 2017.   Intel is planning to release upgraded Kaby Lake processors in Q3 and PC vendors are expected to release new products with increased prices to target back-to-school demand.   At an analyst conference in February, Lenovo COO Gianfranco Lanci stated that PC component shortages have not improved and the company will raise its PC prices in order to reflect some of the increased costs.   Asustek Computer CEO Jerry Shen also recently noted that the company's biggest challenges in 2017 are exchange rate fluctuations and component price hikes. To minimize the impact from the component pricing, Asustek is also planning to increase the prices for its new products.   The component shortages are also expected to create more pressure on small PC vendors, as big vendors placing bigger amounts of component orders will be given priority by their suppliers.   With Apple considered a premium vendor, they're likely to lead the way in premium pricing again this year. While many thought that the latest MacBook Pro was too expensive, Apple's Phil Schiller shruged off such talk. He stated back in October 2016:   "Affordability is absolutely something we care about. But we don't design for price, we design for the experience and the quality people expect from Mac. Sometimes that means we end up at the higher end of the range, but not on purpose, just because that's what it costs."   With a statement like that, it would seem that Apple will use the current price increases of components to justify their next price increases – and this time premium PC vendors are likely to follow Apple's lead.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

ENTERTAINMENT MUSIC Reporter's Notebook With 'More Life,' Drake continues to experiment with the streaming era Drake Bethany Mollenkof / Los Angeles Times Drake performs during his headlining set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio. Drake performs during his headlining set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio. (Bethany Mollenkof / Los Angeles Times) Gerrick D. KennedyContact Reporter Is it an album or a mixtape? Such was the question when Drake released “More Life,” a collection of new music billed as a “playlist,” last weekend. Presented by October Firm, the team of Drake and his co-manager Oliver El-Khatib, and released through Young Money/Cash Money, the 22-track offering tackles the many moods and genres favored by the superstar Canadian rapper-singer. As a listening experience, “More Life” plays like an hour-and-a-half DJ set, possessing the fluidity of a curated playlist. Yet it has the marketing — and price tag — of a traditional album. “It is an evolutionary progression of the mixtape in the streaming environment,” said founder digital music analyst Mark Mulligan, founder of MiDia Research. Got it? The idea of the album continues to evolve, as the likes of Beyoncé, Kanye West, Chance the Rapper, Frank Ocean and others have embraced the streaming era with unconventional releases. One advantage of the medium is the immediacy it provides. Another is the added buzz. With “More Life,” Drake is arguing for another tweak to the template. It’s a new work, but also one in which he’s introducing listeners to artists he supports and is a fan of. Consider it somewhere between a proper album and, well, a playlist you’d send to a friend. Increasingly, curated playlists — more or less recommendation engines — are a major component of streaming services. If “More Life” starts a trend, it could re-brand the playlist as a more artistic-driven endeavor. Thus far, Mulligan said playlists are still fundamentally very two-dimensional — “essentially static Excel spreadsheets with a little bit of artwork.” “Spotify has started pushing the needle with heavily personalized playlists such as Discover Weekly, but that is largely the limit of the innovation,” he said. “With ‘More Life’ Drake is going beyond simply curating tracks, he is using the playlist as a new tool for delivering creative output.” The collection is as much a showcase of the rapper’s talent as it is of his personal tastes, as Drake collaborates with a number of artists and styles throughout the work. Tracks dive between hip-hop, contemporary R&B, dancehall, trap, grime and Afrobeat, and some of the collection’s standout entries are solo offerings from British rapper Skepta and electro-soul singers Sampha and Jorja Smith. It’s far more relaxed than the largely singular-focused “Views.” “I see this as Drake pushing the boundaries, testing how far the definitions can be stretched, Mulligan said. Late last year Drake revealed he was culling a collection of music after feeling energized from playing arenas behind “Views,” an album that set a streaming record and become the first to hit 1 billion streams on Apple Music. “I’m off like mixtapes, I want to do a playlist. I want to give you a collection of songs that become the soundtrack to your life,” he said at the time. Unlike previous efforts, the collection — featuring guest spots from West, 2 Chainz, Young Thug, PartyNextDoor, Giggs and more — wasn’t an exclusive to any one streaming service. However, Drake still managed to leverage his deal with Apple Music. Drake’s new music premiered on OVO Sound Radio, the radio show his label hosts on Apple’s Beats 1 station, ahead of its availability on other services (and the episode was the most listened to of any show on Beats 1 to date). His popularity as a streaming artist, industry analysts say, guaranteed him an engaged audience — one that doesn’t care how the music is defined. “The average Drake fan … they are going to listen to ‘More Life’ whether its called a playlist, an album or something else,” said Billboard's co-director of charts Keith Caulfield. “He’s called albums of his mixtapes in the past but they’ve still been No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.” For the past two years, Drake has been operating under the auspices of a reported multimillion dollar deal with Apple Music. The company sponsored his aforementioned summer tour, and he’s released a number of visuals exclusively to the service, including the short film, “Please Forgive Me.” He also issued two albums directly to Apple — the mixtape “If You're Reading This It's Too Late” and “What a Time to Be Alive,” a joint record with Future — in 2015. Both debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. “He already obliterated the traditional album release cycle with those mixtapes,” said music industry analyst Bob Lefsetz. “[‘More Life’] will be successful but you can't extrapolate to others. Only he can do it. Kinda like Radiohead with ‘In Rainbows.’” Following the first full day release of the playlist, the rapper shattered the record for release-day album streams and single-day streams for an artist at Spotify. The collection generated 61.3 million global streams, besting Ed Sheeran’s “÷,” which notched 56.7 million streams. The work currently sits at No. 1 on Tidal and on iTunes. The entirety of the playlist dominates the top songs on Apple Music following 89.9 million streams during its first 24 hours of availability — a new single-day record for the service. It’s expected to debut atop the Billboard 200 chart. So have we moved beyond the album-era and entered the playlist era? “Considering many artists would contend that we are living in a playlist world … I don’t think it’s terribly surprising that Drake would call this a playlist” Caulfield added. “But he’s also choosing to sell it at digital retailers and it’s going to be released on compact disc and vinyl LP — so it’s basically an album.” See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour » Caption Beauty and the Beast video - A Portrait of 'Gaston' "Beauty and the Beast" actors Josh Gad and Luke Evans, along with composer Alan Menken, talk about the impact of the song "Gaston."

Show More Local Real Estate Subscribe Now HACKERS who claim to have control of at least 200 million iCloud accounts have issued a public demand to Apple: pay ransom or we wipe them all. The hacking group calling itself the Turkish Crime Family has provided video evidence of its claims to the tech site Motherboard, with a demand to Apple that it pay the ransom or face the consequences. The hackers have listed the price of the ransom as either US$75,000 ransom in Bitcoin or US$100,000 in iTunes gift cards. While the demands seem both outlandish and alarming, Motherboard confirms it has seen screenshots of emails appearing to be communications between the hackers and Apple's security team. 200 Million iCloud accounts will be factory reset on April 7 2017— Turkish Crime Family (@turkcrimefamily) March 21, 2017 The hackers also have shown off video which appears to demonstrate how they can log into the compromised accounts. Apple has not commented on the report. Without confirmation from Apple, it is difficult to verify the claims of the hackers. There are also some discrepancies in their story. One account from the hackers says it has access to 200 million accounts, another says 300 million and a third says 559 million. The hackers have given Apple an April 7 deadline before it performs a factory reset on the accounts, wiping all of their data. Tyler Moffitt, senior threat research analyst with Webroot, said the threat illustrates that every company was vulnerable to attack no matter how reputable or confident it was with its security. "Unless there are adequate backup policies in place, I have no doubt that ransom will be paid, regardless of what Apple publicly claims," Mr Moffitt said. "There is a high chance of this data eventually appearing on the dark net." Security analysts said Apple users should consider changing their iCloud passwords to prevent unauthorised people having access to their accounts. Chris Roberts, chief security architect at threat detection and defense solutions firm Acalvio, said consumers should be concerned if the hackers claims were true. "If, and it's a big if, they have the data then yes, consumers should be concerned. They need to be ready for another round of password resets and hopefully some two-factor authentication discussions," Mr Roberst said. "If, and again it's an if, they have access to that volume of accounts, they will have already harvested anything good out of them therefore it sucks. However, once again, data is out in the wild. "Finally, if this is real, then what the heck is Apple doing with security? And why the heck are they not putting anything official out?" apple Read More Login to follow games and gadgets Read More Login to follow general-seniors-news Read More Login to follow hackers Read More Login to follow iphone Read More Login to follow ransomware Read More Login to follow technology Read More Login to follow Topics:  apple games and gadgets general-seniors-news hackers iphone ransomware technology 0 PRINT Just In Travis Collins, Keith Urban win big at CMC Music Awards Aussie Mr Nice Guy in for the kill Aussie among dead in London terror attack Benji set to make way for booming Bronco Miller on why coalminers and families 'bleed black' Bruce Hwy police chase sparks traffic gridlock Top Stories Two Ipswich councillors called for CCC hearing Tully and Silver served notices to appear on Wednesday, April 19 News Comment Travis Collins, Keith Urban win big at CMC Music Awards Miller on why coalminers and families 'bleed black' Percy Verrall is in constant chest pain and struggles to walk Ipswich to host CMC Rocks for 'at least another three years' Country music festival will stay at Willowbank Raceway until 2020 GREEN LIGHT: Bunnings plans another warehouse in region Construction of a hardware superstore is in planning stages Local Partners Community Your Story Local History More Community What's On REVEALED: Four new food hubs destined for Silkstone They include a cheese wall, burritos, sushi and baked goods TripAdvisor and Council partner in new tourism magazine Copies home delivered, featuring independent reviews of top sites Witches, wizards and magical creatures to light up Ipswich Ping pong is back on the table for Springfield New $6M multipurpose hall for Springfield Central High Ipswich music event set for revamp after poor turn out VIDEO: Bullmastiffs 'great family pets' Tribute to Australian rock superstars comes to Springfield Tribute to Aussie Rock legends CMC Rocks is just the ticket for Eric Paslay Country music singer is touring overseas for the first time.

Photo / Getty Images Amazon.com's battle with Apple over digital assistants is moving to a new venue: hotel rooms, where Alexa and Siri are both vying to be the voice-controlled platform of choice for travellers. Marriott International, the world's biggest lodging company, is testing devices from the two tech giants at its Aloft hotel in Boston's Seaport district to determine which is best to let guests turn on lights, close drapes, control room temperature and change television channels via voice command. In December, Wynn Resorts became the first hotel company to install Alexa-powered Echo devices, starting with suites at its flagship Wynn Las Vegas property. Technology companies are using hotel room as showrooms for new services and devices that can also control so-called smart homes. Amazon and Apple are competing for dominance in the nascent market, which promises to let consumers access and manage household systems such as heating, cooling, lighting and entertainment by speaking a request at home or using a smartphone from afar. Marriott expects to decide whether to adopt the technology for one or more of its chains as early as mid-year, potentially boosting sales for the device of choice. More important, it will increase the winning company's exposure in the market for voice-activated devices, which are gaining more mainstream traction. "Those two players are in the game right now," said Toni Stoeckl, who oversees the Aloft, Element, AC and Moxy chains as global brand leader for lifestyle brands at Marriott. There are almost 130 Aloft hotels in the US, and more than 100 additional ones planned. Continued below. Related Content Airport security clampdown 'the biggest in 10 years' Fonterra looks to replicate co-op structure abroad Annika Streefland: Pay equity is achievable Two decades after Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates first installed smart-home software in his compound on Lake Washington facing Seattle, businesses from homebuilders and carmakers to hotel operators are adopting such technology for the average consumer. Hotel rooms are an ideal place for Amazon and Apple to showcase their devices and let guests see how they can be used to make their lives more convenient, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at San Jose, California-based research firm Creative Strategies. She likened it to hotel rooms installing iPhone docking stations years ago so people could enjoy their own music in their rooms. A key question is whether the interaction will be personalised, allowing guests familiar with the devices to log into their own accounts, or instead use a standard set of skills relevant to a hotel stay, like getting news reports, checking weather forecasts or calling for an Uber -- commands more appropriate for those unfamiliar with the technology. It will be interesting to see how much education they have to go through to get guests to use them. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at San Jose "It will be interesting to see how much education they have to go through to get guests to use them," Milanesi said. "This is not mass-market technology." Crestron Electronics, a closely held residential and commercial automation company that enables technologies such as Alexa to work with various applications, says hotels are a newer market -- and one it expects to grow. Lodging currently accounts for 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the firm's annual sales of about US$1.5 billion (NZ$2.1 billion). "You're starting to see more of this home-automation technology being deployed in these spaces," said John Clancy, vice president of residential systems at Rockleigh, New Jersey-based Crestron. "Initially, there was a big fear about whether it works and what the customer expects." The new Waldorf Astoria luxury hotel in Beverly Hills, California, operated by Hilton Worldwide Holdings and set to open in June, will have Crestron technology in iPads that let guests control things such as lighting, temperature, TVs, alarm clocks and room service, but the application relies on typing, not voice commands. "We are currently working with various voice assistants and, while we do not have Siri integration at the moment, it is definitely something we continue to explore and consider," Clancy said. Siri works on Apple mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads. Probably by the end of the first half of this year, we'll have a pretty good indication of where we're headed. The JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort & Spa, a Texas property with 1,002 rooms, has installed Alexa devices in 10 of its most popular rooms, with plans to equip an additional 100 rooms next month. The digital assistant can be used to control lights in five of the rooms, but the focus is on using Alexa as a personal concierge for ordering room service, or requesting towels or toothpaste from housekeeping. The resort said it has been testing the Amazon technology since October. Marriott's Stoeckl said his company is "looking for the ideal solution to make this a global platform." Aloft hotels act as a "tech incubator" for new concepts, and a successful test may determine whether digital assistants -- and which ones -- are installed at other Marriott chains, he said. Eventually, the digital assistants will be able to perform more concierge-like services and connect with a guest's personal device to do things such as set an automatic wake-up temperature or have the drapes open at a certain time, Stoeckl said. Wynn Resorts has said it plans to equip all 4,748 rooms at the Las Vegas hotel by this summer. The company is considering installing Echo at other resorts, hotel spokesman Michael Weaver said in an email. The Vegas property is expanding the range of functions controlled by Alexa. It recently enabled guests to listen to music via most radio stations and is about to add a station of songs chosen by Chief Executive Officer Steve Wynn personally, Weaver said. Also in the works is an audio guest directory to replace the printed version. Hotels are just one new avenue for Amazon to get its technology in front of more customers. Ford Motor Co. said in January that it plans to begin offering Alexa this summer in vehicles equipped with its Sync 3 infotainment system. An automotive version of the Echo assistant will let drivers order items on Amazon, listen to audio books, play music, check news, search for restaurants and get directions. Amazon also is working with BMW to integrate Alexa into its luxury cars. Alphabet's Google has the Google Assistant, which powers its Home internet-connected speaker and Android phones, including its in-house Pixel handsets, and is collaborating with Hyundai Motor on voice commands for its cars. For Marriott's Aloft, a decision between Alexa and Siri could come by summer. "Probably by the end of the first half of this year, we'll have a pretty good indication of where we're headed," Stoeckl said. "The race is still on."

Here’s Why It Matters It's a niche luxury brand going up against the likes of Apple and Casio—but that might be exactly why it has a shot. by Chris Rovzar @Rovzar More stories by Chris Rovzar March 22, 2017, 4:56 PM EDT Last week, Montblanc became the first brand in the Richemont family of luxury companies to put out a smartwatch. The Montblanc Summit, based on Google's Android Wear 2 platform, aims to compete with, among others, the Apple Watch and rival Swiss brand TAG Heuer's Connected Watch (which was released last year and will get an upgrade likely to be announced this week). Like the TAG, which is also on the Android platform, the Montblanc watch is targeted to fans of the brand. By designing the case to look like a classic mechanical watch from its 1858 line, it hopes to attract a mix of loyalists and also millennials who aren't necessarily accustomed to wearing anything on their wrists but who might try out a unique-looking smartwatch. Montblanc CEO Jérôme Lamberg. Source: Montblanc "We hope that the Summit shows customers new and old that Montblanc is rooted in innovation and adapts to what the modern professional needs," said Montblanc Chief Executive Officer Jérôme Lamberg. The differences between the TAG and Montblanc versions are not vast—they both offer an array of Android apps. While the TAG has GPS for sports apps and NFC for making mobile payments, the Montblanc watch has a heart-rate monitor embedded in the back of the case. They both come loaded with watch faces that look like their iconic models, which these companies swear is important, but to me slightly misses the point. Fans love mechanical watches for their ingenuity, beauty, and internal structural achievement—a dimly-lit 2D simulacrum on a screen, cased in something that looks like a mechanical watch, is hardly the same thing The Greater Market Smartwatches have become a large category but have still undersold compared with expectations. Market research firm IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were shipped in 2016, missing a 28.3-million projection by almost half. In the third quarter of last year, for example, Apple Watch sales were down more than 70 percent. A large part of the problem is that makers of this kind of wearable (as opposed to a simpler, more purpose-built Fitbit) haven't yet really made a case for why its users need them, when a smartphone is almost always near at hand. Think about it. If you own a smartwatch, and you accidentally leave it at home, what do you do when you get to work or school and you realize it's not with you? Then think about what happens when you leave your phone at home. Improving by Iteration When Apple Inc. launched its series 2 watch in September 2016, it featured improvements based on feedback from communities that use the device.  The Apple Watch Series 2. Photographer: David Paul Morris "A significant difference between the first and most recent versions of Apple Watch software is that a lot of what you want to do, from functional stuff to what's just plain fun, lives at the top layer of the UI now," explains Jack Forster, an industry expert and the editor-in-chief of the watch enthusiast website Hodinkee. "It's often simple stuff, but it makes a huge difference in the experience. For instance, you can change the watch face now much more easily and without navigating submenus. There's a familiar-to-Mac-users app dock now, and so on." The Apple Watch 2 also featured built-in GPS, which meant that a runner or cyclist could hit the road without having to carry a phone—a huge difference for athletes. Smaller Brands  While Apple owns more than 40 percent of the smartwatch market, according to IDC, you'll find more community enthusiasm, in my experience, for such watches as Garmin's sports offerings—which offer exactly what outdoor athletes want.  "Dedicated fitness trackers still do a better job at filling specific needs, although there are other mission-specific smartwatches out there that show how much room there is left to innovate and clarify product identity," explains Forster. "Casio makes trekking-oriented smartwatches, for instance." A Garmin Fenix 3 smartwatch. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg The same IDC report that had smartwatches on the decline listed Garmin Ltd. as the industry's one bright spot, increasing more than 300 percent year over year. (That report came out right as the Apple Watch 2 was hitting stores and does not reflect a bump that may have come from the new technology.) If Swiss watchmakers and Apple and Google want to make smart timepieces more essential, it's good that brands with smaller, more specialized communities are having watches made just for them.  Montblanc's Summit Watch "Smartwatch makers are creating products with a clearer identity," says Forster. For example, the Montblanc watch comes with a clever, intuitive worldtimer app that was built for the timepiece. Why? Montblanc users are travelers.  The Summit's optional faces mimic popular chronograph timepieces from the brand. Source: Montblanc "The Montblanc customer is a modern, on-the-go professional that enjoys the luxury heritage lifestyle/status that Montblanc is known for," explains Lambert, the CEO. "Today’s Montblanc customer is living in a digital world where connectivity is key to success." At 46mm across, the watch is large, as well. That's too big for my wrist, but it's huge for a reason. "This large face, made with curved glass, allows for users to play in various apps and text or email with ease," Lambert added.  Future versions of the Summit may link with Montblanc's Augmented Paper (paper notebooks that record your writing into the cloud) in a work/play ecosystem that suits fans of the brand perfectly. Say you're traveling business class on a flight from Dubai and you can't bring on a laptop or tablet. Suddenly your phone, your watch, and such gadgets as Augmented Paper become much more important. A Long Road Travel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter. Sign Up Analyst John Guy of Mainfirst Bank estimates that the Connected Watch has come to represent less than 10 percent of TAG Heuer total sales over the past year; in other words, it didn't change TAG's bottom line or its business model. And it likely won't, at least for a while. (In pricing, the Swiss are nowhere near competing with Apple. At roughly $960 for the Montblanc and $1,500 for the TAG, they way overshoot the $369 Apple Watch 2.) But they are teaching the Swiss brands what their users want from a smartwatch—if anything. "I think it's still not entirely clear to a lot of players in the traditional watch space why their fans would want a smartwatch version of their watches," says Forster. "Which isn't very surprising, because I don't think the tech world in general has figured that out either. "Manufacturers feed new designs into the marketplace, and consumers say to themselves, 'Well, I didn't know it, but I really do want one,' and as various products are accepted or rejected, manufacturers refine their approach."

It’s led to an entire culture of annual upgraders who buy the latest iPhone model and switch out a year later, selling the previous model and making the difference an effective “rental price” for the new handset. iPhones have been especially popular in Australia, and funding a new phone by selling the old one makes good financial sense. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Apple’s quiet update of the iPhone SE has only bumped up the storage. Photo: Bloomberg Even if you don’t want to upgrade every year, the prospect of getting a little extra cash for your iPhone once you’re off contract has solid appeal.By way of contrast, even new premium Android phones typically tumble in outright price terms just a few months after they debut. Last year’s excellent Samsung Galaxy S7 commanded a price above $1000, but it didn’t take long for directly imported models to come to market at $700 or less. In that market, selling your old Android phone and expecting any great return was a frustrating experience.Exactly a year ago, Apple introduced the smaller iPhone SE handset, built on what were fundamentally the same innards as the then-current iPhone 6s. The SE looked like the older iPhone 5 physically, and it was markedly cheaper than the 6s at the time, even though Apple truly loathes the word “cheap”.Apple has typically worked with one year refresh cycles for its new smartphones, so an update to the iPhone SE was due. Among the hype for a new iPad model and a PRODUCT iPhone 7 this week, Apple also quietly updated the iPhone SE. Advertisement However, where you might have expected it to expand to the processor and functionality of the iPhone 7 as its predecessor, all Apple did was bump up the storage on the iPhone SE. The iPhone SE 16GB is no more and the same $679 asking price will buy you a 32GB model from this Friday. The $749 64GB model has given way to an $829 128GB model.Otherwise, they’re the same phones they always were, which isn’t a huge vote of confidence by Apple in the whole iPhone SE range. It typically reduces choices down to just one or two variants for product lines it’s likely to discontinue. When you consider that in six months time when the presumed iPhone 8 is likely to be announced, the internals of the iPhone SE will be a full two generations behind, it’s not hard to draw that conclusion.So who wins and loses as a result of … Post navigation Jason Day exits of WGC Match Play mid-round, due to mum’s illness Raghu not dragging his feet Search for: Recent Posts Men!

In December, Wynn Resorts became the first hotel company to install Alexa-powered Echo devices, starting with suites at its flagship Wynn Las Vegas property.   Technology companies are using hotel room as showrooms for new services and devices that can also control so-called smart homes. Amazon and Apple are competing for dominance in the nascent market, which promises to let consumers access and manage household systems such as heating, cooling, lighting and entertainment by speaking a request at home or using a smartphone from afar.   Marriott expects to decide whether to adopt the technology for one or more of its chains as early as mid-year, potentially boosting sales for the device of choice. More important, it will increase the winning company’s exposure in the market for voice-activated devices, which are gaining more mainstream traction.          “Those two players are in the game right now,” said Toni Stoeckl, who oversees the Aloft, Element, AC and Moxy chains as global brand leader for lifestyle brands at Marriott.   There are almost 130 Aloft hotels in the US, and more than 100 additional ones planned. Two decades after Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates first installed smart-home software in his compound on Lake Washington facing Seattle, businesses from homebuilders and carmakers to hotel operators are adopting such technology for the average consumer.   Hotel rooms are an ideal place for Amazon and Apple to showcase their devices and let guests see how they can be used to make their lives more convenient, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at San Jose, California-based research firm Creative Strategies. She likened it to hotel rooms installing iPhone docking stations years ago so people could enjoy their own music in their rooms.   A key question is whether the interaction will be personalized, allowing guests familiar with the devices to log into their own accounts, or instead use a standard set of skills relevant to a hotel stay, like getting news reports, checking weather forecasts or calling for an Uber — commands more appropriate for those unfamiliar with the technology.   “It will be interesting to see how much education they have to go through to get guests to use them,” Milanesi said. “This is not mass-market technology.”   Crestron Electronics, a closely held residential and commercial automation company that enables technologies such as Alexa to work with various applications, says hotels are a newer market — and one it expects to grow. Lodging currently accounts for 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the firm’s annual sales of about $1.5 billion.   “You’re starting to see more of this home-automation technology being deployed in these spaces,” said John Clancy, vice president of residential systems at Rockleigh, New Jersey-based Crestron. “Initially, there was a big fear about whether it works and what the customer expects.”   The new Waldorf Astoria luxury hotel in Beverly Hills, California, operated by Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and set to open in June, will have Crestron technology in iPads that let guests control things such as lighting, temperature, TVs, alarm clocks and room service, but the application relies on typing, not voice commands.   Being Considered   “We are currently working with various voice assistants and, while we do not have Siri integration at the moment, it is definitely something we continue to explore and consider,” Clancy said. Siri works on Apple mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads.   The JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort & Spa, a Texas property with 1,002 rooms, has installed Alexa devices in 10 of its most popular rooms, with plans to equip an additional 100 rooms next month. The digital assistant can be used to control lights in five of the rooms, but the focus is on using Alexa as a personal concierge for ordering room service, or requesting towels or toothpaste from housekeeping. The resort said it has been testing the Amazon technology since October.   Similarly, the Four Seasons in Washington this month put Alexa devices in its rooms to allow guests to find music or information such as weather and destinations. Alexa doesn’t yet control functions such as lights or temperature at the hotel.   Marriott’s Stoeckl said his company is “looking for the ideal solution to make this a global platform.” Aloft hotels act as a “tech incubator” for new concepts, and a successful test may determine whether digital assistants -- and which ones -- are installed at other Marriott chains, he said.   Concierge-Like   Eventually, the digital assistants will be able to perform more concierge-like services and connect with a guest’s personal device to do things such as set an automatic wake-up temperature or have the drapes open at a certain time, Stoeckl said.   Wynn Resorts has said it plans to equip all 4,748 rooms at the Las Vegas hotel by this summer.

In December, Wynn Resorts became the first hotel company to install Alexa-powered Echo devices, starting with suites at its flagship Wynn Las Vegas property.   Technology companies are using hotel room as showrooms for new services and devices that can also control so-called smart homes. Amazon and Apple are competing for dominance in the nascent market, which promises to let consumers access and manage household systems such as heating, cooling, lighting and entertainment by speaking a request at home or using a smartphone from afar.   Marriott expects to decide whether to adopt the technology for one or more of its chains as early as mid-year, potentially boosting sales for the device of choice. More important, it will increase the winning company’s exposure in the market for voice-activated devices, which are gaining more mainstream traction.          “Those two players are in the game right now,” said Toni Stoeckl, who oversees the Aloft, Element, AC and Moxy chains as global brand leader for lifestyle brands at Marriott.   There are almost 130 Aloft hotels in the US, and more than 100 additional ones planned. Two decades after Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates first installed smart-home software in his compound on Lake Washington facing Seattle, businesses from homebuilders and carmakers to hotel operators are adopting such technology for the average consumer.   Hotel rooms are an ideal place for Amazon and Apple to showcase their devices and let guests see how they can be used to make their lives more convenient, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at San Jose, California-based research firm Creative Strategies. She likened it to hotel rooms installing iPhone docking stations years ago so people could enjoy their own music in their rooms.   A key question is whether the interaction will be personalized, allowing guests familiar with the devices to log into their own accounts, or instead use a standard set of skills relevant to a hotel stay, like getting news reports, checking weather forecasts or calling for an Uber — commands more appropriate for those unfamiliar with the technology.   “It will be interesting to see how much education they have to go through to get guests to use them,” Milanesi said. “This is not mass-market technology.”   Crestron Electronics, a closely held residential and commercial automation company that enables technologies such as Alexa to work with various applications, says hotels are a newer market — and one it expects to grow. Lodging currently accounts for 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the firm’s annual sales of about $1.5 billion.   “You’re starting to see more of this home-automation technology being deployed in these spaces,” said John Clancy, vice president of residential systems at Rockleigh, New Jersey-based Crestron. “Initially, there was a big fear about whether it works and what the customer expects.”   The new Waldorf Astoria luxury hotel in Beverly Hills, California, operated by Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and set to open in June, will have Crestron technology in iPads that let guests control things such as lighting, temperature, TVs, alarm clocks and room service, but the application relies on typing, not voice commands.   Being Considered   “We are currently working with various voice assistants and, while we do not have Siri integration at the moment, it is definitely something we continue to explore and consider,” Clancy said. Siri works on Apple mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads.   The JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort & Spa, a Texas property with 1,002 rooms, has installed Alexa devices in 10 of its most popular rooms, with plans to equip an additional 100 rooms next month. The digital assistant can be used to control lights in five of the rooms, but the focus is on using Alexa as a personal concierge for ordering room service, or requesting towels or toothpaste from housekeeping. The resort said it has been testing the Amazon technology since October.   Similarly, the Four Seasons in Washington this month put Alexa devices in its rooms to allow guests to find music or information such as weather and destinations. Alexa doesn’t yet control functions such as lights or temperature at the hotel.   Marriott’s Stoeckl said his company is “looking for the ideal solution to make this a global platform.” Aloft hotels act as a “tech incubator” for new concepts, and a successful test may determine whether digital assistants -- and which ones -- are installed at other Marriott chains, he said.   Concierge-Like   Eventually, the digital assistants will be able to perform more concierge-like services and connect with a guest’s personal device to do things such as set an automatic wake-up temperature or have the drapes open at a certain time, Stoeckl said.   Wynn Resorts has said it plans to equip all 4,748 rooms at the Las Vegas hotel by this summer. The company is considering installing Echo at other resorts, hotel spokesman Michael Weaver said in an email. The Vegas property is expanding the range of functions controlled by Alexa. It recently enabled guests to listen to music via most radio stations and is about to add a station of songs chosen by Chief Executive Officer Steve Wynn personally, Weaver said. Also in the works is an audio guest directory to replace the printed version.   Hotels are just one new avenue for Amazon to get its technology in front of more customers. Ford Motor Co. said in January that it plans to begin offering Alexa this summer in vehicles equipped with its Sync 3 infotainment system. An automotive version of the Echo assistant will let drivers order items on Amazon, listen to audio books, play music, check news, search for restaurants and get directions. Amazon also is working with BMW to integrate Alexa into its luxury cars. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has the Google Assistant, which powers its Home internet-connected speaker and Android phones, including its in-house Pixel handsets, and is collaborating with Hyundai Motor Co. on voice commands for its cars.   For Marriott’s Aloft, a decision between Alexa and Siri could come by summer. “Probably by the end of the first half of this year, we’ll have a pretty good indication of where we’re headed,” Stoeckl said. “The race is still on.” Bloomberg Hui-Yong Yu & Spencer Soper | Bloomberg Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 MORE ON MARKETS: Quick Links Stock Market Live Portfolio Commodity Market Upcoming IPO Personal Finance Stock Market News Derivatives Mutual Funds Gold Price Sensex Browse STOCK Companies A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Browse Mutual Funds A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Index Stocks ACC Adani Ports Ambuja Cem.

Plus, the Nike+ watch bands are also coming to the standard Apple Watch, should you wish to cover your arm in hollow polka dots. Some of the new colour options will also be available as cases for your iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Unfortunately, those don’t cover (excuse the pun) the fancy multi-coloured hues that you see above.

In other Apple news from Tuesday, the company also introduced a refreshed iPad (the Air moniker has disappeared). While it has the latest processor inside, it borrows the rest of its design and hardware from the first iPad Air (circa 2013), which is why Apple could price it lower than normal, starting at Rs. 28,900.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 March 2017 by Military News Jamf Prepared with Pre Zero-day Support for All Apple Spring 2017 Releases /EINPresswire.com/ — MINNEAPOLIS, MN–(Marketwired – Mar 22, 2017) – Jamf, the leader in Apple device management, announced support for the upcoming Apple releases of iOS, macOS and tvOS. When customers upgrade their iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV, IT administrators using Jamf Pro (formerly Casper Suite) or Jamf Now (formerly Bushel) can be confident their management workflows will be uninterrupted. Committed to helping organizations succeed with Apple, Jamf has offered zero-day support for all Apple releases for over a decade, ensuring customers can take advantage of new Apple technology as it becomes available. Jamf Pro Supports Operating Systems’ New Functionality In addition to version compatibility, Jamf Pro, a solution designed specifically for professional Apple administrators, supports the new functionality launched for macOS, iOS and tvOS. This includes new security capabilities and configuration management for devices, additional managed restrictions, a new version of Apple’s Classroom app, making it easier to set up ad-hoc classrooms, and substantial new device management capabilities for Apple TV, including zero-touch setup, configuration and app distribution. Apple TV With New Management Capabilities Will Transform Experiences „For the first time, businesses and schools can set up and manage Apple TV just like they do iPhone or iPad, which means they can not only mass deploy Apple TV with ease, but create a seamless and interconnected experience between Apple devices,” said Dave Alampi, vice president of product management and marketing, Jamf. „And, the desire to make Apple TV management more turnkey is there. In a recent survey of 959 IT admins on Jamf Nation, 97 percent reported Apple TV devices in their environment, with 35 percent saying they have 50-plus TVs. When asked about Apple TV growth, 44 percent of respondents are planning to add more Apple TV devices in the next year.” „We imagined teachers being able to display any historic picture, map or other educational content on a classroom display with the simple command of their voice,” said Blair Anderson, technology manager, Shawnee Heights School District in Tecumseh, Kansas. „That’s why we deployed fourth generation Apple TV devices to every classroom and conference room in the district. Being able to use Jamf Pro to manage our entire ecosystem of Apple products, including Mac, iPad and Apple TV, lets us transform, yet supervise, the total learning experience for students and help improve teacher effectiveness.” „As usual, Apple’s new functionality for iOS, macOS and tvOS coupled with Jamf’s zero-day support will help organizations empower people with technology that puts the user first,” said Dean Hager, CEO, Jamf. „Specifically, the new management support for Apple TV opens up tremendous potential for transformation in education, healthcare, hospitality and boardrooms around the world. We have only seen the beginning of what life looks like in a world of network connected things. I look forward to the automation we can help organizations achieve by supporting future Apple innovations the day they become available.” About Jamf Since 2002, Jamf has been solely focused on helping organizations succeed with Apple. Jamf is committed to enabling IT to empower end users and bring the legendary Apple experience to businesses, education and government organizations via its Jamf Pro and Jamf Now produces, and the 42,000+ member Jamf Nation Community. Today, more than 10,000 global customers rely on Jamf to manage 7 million Apple devices.

The iOS 10.3 update is currently in beta ahead of release and it will be a massive upgrade for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. And with an iOS 10.3 release getting closer, we want to take a look at everything we currently know about the contents of the update, the iOS 10.3 release date and time, and more. An iOS 10.3 release is confirmed. A number of key iOS 10.3 release details remain unconfirmed so this roundup adds in a few things we expect from Apple. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details so check back for frequent updates. We should learn more about iOS 10.3 as it progresses through its beta. How to Get the iOS 10.3 Update Right Now If you want to try the iOS 10.3 update on your device ahead of the official release date you can do that thanks to the iOS 10.3 beta. Apple’s released its iOS 10.3 beta 7 to both developers and those signed up for the free Beta Software Program. The company’s Beta Software Program is available to anyone with a working Apple ID. If you decide to try the iOS 10.3 update before its official release you’ll want to be extremely careful. Early software can (and probably will) cause problems on your device. This is why we recommend doing some prep work before you install iOS 10.3 beta. We’ve put together a guide that will take you through the steps to take before you download the iOS 10.3 beta on your iPhone or iPad. You’ll also want to take a look at our list of reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.3 beta update on your device. Most of you will probably want to skip the beta and wait for the official version of iOS 10.3 to arrive. When and if you get the iOS 10.3 beta on board your device, make sure you report issues to Apple so company engineers can improve the software ahead of its official release. You Can Downgrade from iOS 10.3 Beta to iOS 10.2.1 If you decide to try the iOS 10.3 update know that there is a way to drop down to an official version of iOS 10. If iOS 10.3 starts causing problems for you, you can get off the beta. Apple is currently signing off on iOS 10.2.1 which means you can drop down to it if you’re unhappy with the beta’s performance on your iPhone or iPad. Unfortunately, you can’t drop down to anything older than iOS 10.2.1 so you’ll want to be absolutely sure about the iOS 10.3 beta if you’re coming from an older iOS 10 update or an older operating system like iOS 9. For more on the iOS 10.3 beta to iOS 10 downgrade process, take a look at our roundup. It’ll take you through the important steps. iOS 10.3 Release Date An iOS 10.3 release date remains unconfirmed though it will be out for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch by the end of April. This is confirmed. Earlier this month Apple made some significant changes to its iPad lineup. The company killed the 32GB iPad mini 4 in favor of a $399 128GB model. Apple also killed off the iPad mini 2, a budget option that has been available for several years now. Apple also announced a brand new 9.7-inch iPad that features a brighter Retina Display and improved performance. It runs iOS 10 and it will arrive on Friday, March 24th. There’s a chance Apple releases iOS 10.3 ahead of the new iPad (similar to how it releases iOS updates ahead of a new iPhone release) but this remains unconfirmed as we push toward the device’s release date. It’s also worth noting that one of the key features from the latest version of iTunes, 12.6, requires the iOS 10.3 update. The iTunes 12.6 update delivers a “Rent once, watch anywhere” feature that lets iTunes users watch their movie rentals across all of their devices. iOS 10.3 is required to use this feature which seems to point to an imminent release date. If not March, we’ll definitely see iOS 10.3 arrive before the end of April. Apple’s also announced a new Clips application that requires iOS 10.3. Clips is expected to be out sometime in April and we could see the company opt to roll out iOS 10.3 alongside its brand new application. iOS 10.3 Release Time The iOS 10.3 release date is still a bit unpredictable but the iOS 10.3 release time for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch isn’t. Apple’s iOS release times are very predictable. The iOS 10.3 update will almost certainly arrive around 10AM Pacific on release day. You can expect the same from upcoming Apple’s iOS 10.3 beta updates, if there are any left. Here’s what that will look like for other regions in the United States and countries around the world including Australia and Japan: Eastern – 1 PM Central – 12 PM Mountain – 11AM London – 6 PM Moscow – 9 PM New Delhi – 10:30 PM Shanghai – 1 AM Tokyo – 2 AM Melbourne – 3 AM Auckland – 5 AM Apple might not confirm the iOS 10.3 release time ahead of the official roll out. So, if you want to get it as soon as possible, you’ll want to keep an eye out for new software around 10AM Pacific Monday-Friday. Apple never releases iOS updates on the weekend. iOS 10.3 Update The iOS 10.3 beta’s confirmed some of the potential features coming with the official version of the iOS 10.3 update. We say potential because the beta’s change log could be a little different than the official version. Apple could add features and/or it could strip out some features/functions that didn’t perform well in testing. iOS 10.3 will deliver a new Find My AirPods feature. One of the main features in iOS 10.3 beta is a “Find My AirPods” function that will make it easier for AirPod owners to, you guessed it, find their AirPods. The feature is currently located in the Find My iPhone app.  iOS 10.3 comes with a new iCloud storage breakdown function. iOS 10.3 beta also includes a useful new iCloud storage breakdown feature that’s found in the new iCloud section of the iOS 10.3’s new Apple ID Settings. As you can see in the screenshot above, the feature makes it easier to see how your iCloud storage space is being used. I remain reasonably convinced that an iOS device screen refresh rate higher than 60Hz is possible this year pic.twitter.com/k9W4q8rxcm — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) March 22, 2017 The iOS 10.3 beta also includes a way for app developers to respond to user reviews on the App Store and the Mac App Store, code that hints at a 10.5-inch iPad, a hidden one-hand floating iPad keyboard layout, Wi-Fi Calling to Verizon customers with iCloud-connected devices, and an important feature for unexpected shutdown issues plaguing the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6. New in iOS 10.3, a one-handed floating iPad (9.7" or less) keyboard layout. Can be moved around onscreen like the PiP overlay 🤔 pic.twitter.com/KLKybkR820 — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) January 24, 2017 Here are a few other potential iOS 10.3 features developers found in the first beta, courtesy of MacRumors forums: Expanded HomeKit switch accessory support. Siri learns cricket scores from Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. Safari now supports Reduced Motion preference in web apps. New user security section in Settings app. Podcast Widget. In App Ratings & Reviews in settings lets you turn them on or off. New app opening animation (angled in the corners then expands to full screen). Three (UK) now includes Wi-Fi Calling support. Playlist sorting changes in Music app (Apple Music Playlists are now at the top, rather than the bottom when sorted by type). In CarPlay the time/cell strength/network in the status bar is now centered between 3 current apps and the home button. That CarPlay tweak is tiny compared to one testers found lurking inside Apple’s iOS 10.3 beta 2 update. In older versions of iOS, CarPlay users had to tap twice to get to another application. One tap to go Home and another to open up the application. Apple’s made improvements in iOS 10.3. In iOS 10.3, CarPlay users will now notice three recently used applications sitting in the dock that’s aligned on the left side of the screen. This will make it easier, and safer, to switch back and forth between applications. Also noteworthy is the change to the iPhone file system. When you install iOS 10.3 beta on your device, your iPhone’s file system will be updated to use Apple File System (APFS). This change, announced at WWDC 2016, APFS is optimized for Flash/SSD storages. It delivers stronger encryption among other features. AFPS also reportedly improves boot speed on older devices like the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5s, two aging former flagships running iOS 10. It’s also worth mentioning that iOS 10.3 beta is spitting out warning messages when users try to run 32-bit applications. The message tells users that these apps “will not work with future versions of iOS” and that the developer will need to update them to continue running properly. Apple has required 64-bit support for new app submissions and app updates since 2015. RIP 32-bit emulation mode in iOS 11? pic.twitter.com/byMFuJPuVN — Peter Steinberger (@steipete) January 31, 2017 These apps still run in iOS 10.3 which means Apple will likely drop support for old 32-bit apps with its iOS 11 release later this year. The message still appears in the latest iOS 10.3 beta though there is a new “Learn More” button attached to it. In the iOS 10.3 beta 3, there is now a “App Compatibility” section in Settings that lists apps that might not be compatible with future versions of iOS, probably iOS 11. Testers using the iOS 10.3 beta 5 in Canada discovered the TV app lurking on board. It’s non-functional but it could go live when the official version is released. And finally, the newest versions of iOS 10.3 beta have also started prompting users to enable two-factor authentication via a push notification. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2.1 & 8 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 12 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 13 known patches for potential exploits. That's one more than its predecessor (iOS 10.2). These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2 update and/or the iOS 10.1.1 update, know that iOS 10.2.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2 update had 12 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 12 6 Responses 01/10/2017 Stephen Reply Really a very terribly written article, with numerous grammar mistakes.

The symbolic meaning behind Apple’s newest color Offbeat Red iPhone? The symbolic meaning behind Apple’s newest color /node/1072541/offbeat Red iPhone? The symbolic meaning behind Apple’s newest color ARAB NEWS | Published — Thursday 23 March 2017 Apple announced it is introducing red iPhones. DUBAI: Apple announced Tuesday it is introducing red iPhones and cutting prices on two iPad models. The newly-revealed red color iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is the sixth color in the range, after jet black, black, silver, gold and rose gold. The shade is part of Apple’s Product Red line, which donates to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS. According to Apple, the color is symbolic of AIDS awareness. “100 percent of all money raised by Red goes directly to Global Fund HIV/AIDS grants that provide testing, counseling, treatment and prevention programs with a specific focus on eliminating transmission of the virus from moms to their babies,” Apple wrote on its website. “Since it was founded in 2006, Red has generated more than $465 million for the Global Fund, with more than $130 million from Apple alone.” Apple is cutting prices on two iPad models and introducing red iPhones, but the company held back on updating its higher-end iPad Pro tablets. A much-speculated 10.5-inch iPad Pro did not materialize, nor did new versions of existing sizes in the Pro lineup, which is aimed at businesses and creative professionals. The new devices are mostly refreshes of existing models. Apple unveiled them through press releases Tuesday rather than a staged event, as it typically does for bigger product releases. Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said Tuesday’s announcement makes it “even clearer that there are two very distinct iPad tiers now — the iPad Pro and the basic iPads. The iPad Pros will likely continue to get all the best new features, while the basic iPad will get occasional updates and new features a little later than the Pros, lagging a generation or two behind.” DUBAI: Apple announced Tuesday it is introducing red iPhones and cutting prices on two iPad models.

The 9.7-inch tablet is a budget device, which costs $329 for the 32GB Wi-Fi only version and goes on sale Friday. While it looks quite similar to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, that is where the similarities end. The new iPad is a budget device, while the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is more high-end device that costs $599 for the 32GB version. Let’s compare both tablets and find out what they offer. Display Both devices come with 9.7-inch displays but there are succinct differences between them. While both devices come with LED-backlit displays, with multi-touch support and fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating, the iPad Pro features a more vibrant P3 wide color True Tone display. A True Tone display is not influenced by light in the surroundings, which makes reading on the tablet, even in sunlight, easy. Read: Apple Unveils New 9.7-inch iPad Camera The 9.7-inch iPad comes with a 12-megapixel f/2.2 rear camera while the new iPad comes with an 8-megapixel f/2.2 camera. The iPad Pro is much more advanced in terms of camera since it offers features such as Live Photos, True Tone flash and wide color photo capture. While both tablets have autofocus, iPad Pro’s is slightly refined since it uses Apple’s technology called focus pixels, which provide better depth of field in photos. The iPad Pro offers Panorama up to 63-megapixels, while the new iPad’s Panorama is limited to 43-megapixels. Another feature that the iPad Pro has and the new iPad doesn’t is Auto HDR, which automatically adjusts the colors of a photo taken by the tablet's camera. In terms of video recording too, the iPad Pro’s camera comes out on top. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro features 4K recording while the new iPad records full HD 1080p video. Processor The new iPad comes with an Apple A9 processor, while the iPad Pro comes with an A9X processor. The A9X is a 64-bit chipset with M9 motion coprocessor embedded. It performs better than A9 and has better storage performance. Most importantly, it has integrated LTE while the A9 doesn’t. Read: 9.7-inch iPad Comes With A9X Chipset, 2GB RAM Apple Pencil The iPad Pro is the only device in Apple’s tablet line-up, which can be used with the company’s $99 Apple Pencil Stylus. While all iPads are touch screen and you can interact with them using your fingers, the Apple Pencil can be used for work, which needs more precision, such as creating pie charts. Smart Connector              Unlike the iPad Pro, the new iPad Pro does not come with a smart connector, which is used to connect devices such as keyboards. Therefore, accessories such as the $149 smart keyboard are not available for the new iPad. Consumers will have the option to use a bluetooth keyboard with the new iPad though. Colors The 9.7-inch iPad pro is available in rose gold color, while the new iPad isn’t. In conclusion, the new iPad is a budget tablet, which will replace the iPad Air 2, but in terms of specs, it doesn’t stand up to the premium features of the iPad Pro 9.7-inch tablet.

Investors were also cautious ahead of Thursday’s vote in the House of Representatives on a Republican health-care bill. “Even the mistiest-eyed optimist appears to be coming to the realisation that even on health care, where there is some form of consensus, reforms are likely to take a lot longer than realised,” CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson wrote in a note, Bloomberg reported. “Any other programs like tax and banking reform and infrastructure spending are likely to get pushed further out into the future.” In 1.20pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.2 percent. In 1.05pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent. Tuesday’s drop on Wall Street increased the appeal of some shares. “What we’re seeing today is buyers being opportunistic and trying to gain entry into the overall market,” Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York, told Reuters. “That’s why we’re seeing tech and industrials stocks, which last a lot on Tuesday, lead today.” The Dow moved lower as slides in shares of Nike and those of Goldman Sachs, down 6.5 percent and 1.6 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Microsoft and those of Apple, up 1 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. “Everyone has been waiting for a dip for so long that when you get some kind of a dip, for not just tech but large-cap value too, it’s one of those opportunities to buy in,” Mariann Montagne, a portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, told Bloomberg. “Maybe people are seeing a cue that things aren’t deteriorating across tech land,” Montagne noted. “The deterioration of tech wasn’t due to fundamentals, it was just a function of pricing.” However, Nike’s stock dropped after the company’s lower-than-expected quarterly sales bolstered concern it’s losing ground to key rivals. “A lot of the concern about Nike is its growth in a competitive environment,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told Reuters. “Three to five years ago, a competitive environment (for Nike) was almost non-existent and the market was moving towards athleisure.” US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, slated to speak on Thursday, might offer fresh clues on the pace of interest rate increases. A National Association of Realtors report showed its pending home sales index retreated 3.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million in February, from 5.69 million in January. Closings retreated in February because a lack of properties for sale and weakening affordability conditions stifled buyers in most of the country, according to Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. “Realtors are reporting stronger foot traffic from a year ago, but low supply in the affordable price range continues to be the pest that’s pushing up price growth and pressuring the budgets of prospective buyers,” Yun said in a statement. “Newly listed properties are being snatched up quickly so far this year and leaving behind minimal choices for buyers trying to reach the market.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.4 percent drop from the previous close. France’s CAC 40 Index gave up 0.2 percent, Germany’s DAX Index declined 0.5 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.7 percent. A terror attack in London, near Parliament, left at least one person dead.

The announcement lacked the fanfare of some of Apple's formal product launches. Some called the reaction muted, while others said Apple's tablets seem to be "on the decline." But the overlooked expansion of Swift Playgrounds could speak just as much to Apple's ruthless forward-looking attitude. VCG/VCG | Getty Images A young boy looks at an iPad at the Apple store in Kunming, China. Apple tends to pivot hard toward where it thinks technology is headed — remember the removal of the headphone jack? The numbers show pretty clearly where the future of the iPad growth is: it's the next generation, it's overseas, and Apple may be designing with that in mind. Apple said on Tuesday that Swift Playgrounds would be available in Simplified Chinese. Swift Playgrounds is an app, only available on iPads, that helps kids learn to code through games. Not only does Playgrounds help kids learn to code, but it teaches them Apple's new coding language, Swift, released in 2014. So while the fogies are using Apple's old coding language, the next generation might adopt Swift and fuel Apple's growth as a services company, especially in China, a historically difficult market for U.S. internet companies. The release of Swift Playgrounds in Simplified Chinese came on the heels of CEO Tim Cook's visit to China. Consider that iPad sales overall fell 22 percent in the holiday quarter — but in mainland China and India, the product had double-digit growth, Apple said in January. "I view it as a seeding strategy for a company that has established itself as a golden consumer brand," said Daniel Ives, senior vice president of finance and corporate development at mobile enterprise company Synchronoss Technologies. "Education is a major vertical that Apple, as well as other technology stalwarts, must continue to successfully penetrate." Getting kids hooked has historically been part of Apple's long game for the iPad — Steve Jobs once told Barack Obama that it was "absurd" that teachers still used chalkboards instead of iPads. It worked. "Almost every single trend we've identified has started in the younger generations. As they age, they don't become like the older generation. Quite the opposite. The older generation starts to become like them," said Kevin Westcott, vice chairman and U.S. media and entertainment leader, Deloitte. "The exception to this pattern was the adoption of tablets. They came into households at older generations and got handed down." Increasingly, students have been lured by cheaper options, like Chromebooks, pressuring Apple to release an inexpensive product, Ives said. "With Google (Chromebooks) and Microsoft very embedded in the educational market, Apple needed to tweak their gameplan on this front with a more affordable iPad and now the industry is watching to see the potential impact and adoption changes," Ives said. The growth in China and India, and the rise of the Chromebook, puts Apple's new price point of $329 — the cheapest ever for a new iPad — into perspective. In the United States, average yearly GDP per capita sat around $56,000, last time the World Bank measured. Mainland China is at $8,000 and India is at just under $1,600. Plus, iPads now have SIM cards and LTE connectivity, which can be key in areas of countries like India where cell phone networks are faster gateways to the internet than Wifi or broadband. Apple also doubled down on storage for the iPhone SE on Tuesday — the cheapest iPhone ever by starting price. Swift Playgrounds was also released in Japanese, French, German and Latin American Spanish. So even if you don't want a thicker, heavier iPad, a child in India might. "I think developing markets are key for Apple going forward with a product portfolio that is built for successfully ramping its presence with the right price points," Ives said.

A group of hackers claims to have breached Apple's iCloud platform and gained access to hundreds of millions of user accounts. If Apple doesn't pay a ransom, the hackers say they will remotely wipe the accounts. The hackers, who call themselves the "Turkish Crime Family," are asking for $75,000 worth of bitcoin or Ethereum, or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards, Motherboard reported on Wednesday. To encourage Apple to pay, the hackers are seeking publicity by sending screenshots of alleged emails between them and Apple's security team to media outlets. The hackers are threatening to reset some of the stolen iCloud accounts and remotely wipe victims' devices if Apple doesn't pay by April 7, according to Motherboard, which reported that the hackers didn't share any evidence of millions of hacked iCloud accounts other than a video of them allegedly logging into some of the accounts. Apple downplayed the severity of the extortion attempt on Wednesday, suggesting that the hackers guessed iCloud login credentials based on passwords from data breaches of other companies' software that was leaked online. The company said it is working with law enforcement to identify the hackers. "There have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems including iCloud and Apple ID," Apple said in a statement. "The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services." Among the emails provided to Motherboard were a few from Apple's security team, which asked the hackers "to share a sample of the data set" and informed them that "we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law." Related The Growing Threat of Ransomware The Growing Threat of Ransomware Although hijacking accounts and demanding ransoms is not uncommon, the Apple extortion is unusual both for the size of the alleged breach and the relatively low ransom amount the hackers are demanding. Recent successful ransomware attacks have targeted lesser-known victims like hospitals and received millions of dollars in ransom payments. Still, the extortion is a good reminder that even Apple, whose systems thoroughly protect user data, is still a target for hackers seeking ransoms. It's also a good reminder to change the password of your iCloud account and set up two-factor authentication. Editor's Note: This story was updated with comment from Apple.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Mar 22, 2017 at 4:14PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) enjoyed a few headline wins last year, notably including overtaking arch-frenemy Samsung as the top smartphone vendor in the world in the fourth quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. Considering the fact that much of Samsung's unit volumes have always included low-end phones while Apple only participates in the premium segment, that was quite an accomplishment. (Thank you, Galaxy Note 7 recall and political corruption scandal.) Adding to its accolades, IHS Markit has just released estimates for 2016, showing that the four most popular smartphones of the year were all iPhones. Image source: Apple. We're No. 1! We're No. 1!...and 2, 3, and 4. For the full year, the iPhone 6s came out on top, which makes sense since the device was available throughout 2016. Just as expected was a surge in iPhone 7 and 7 Plus shipments in the fourth quarter; the iPhone 7 was the top seller in the fourth quarter alone. For both generations, the smaller 4.7-inch versions sold better than the larger 5.5-inch Plus models. Image source: IHS Markit. Samsung makes up the majority of the other best sellers. Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge was the South Korean company's most popular flagship, coming in at No. 5, which coincides with Samsung's efforts to direct customers there in the wake of its flaming Galaxy Note 7 debacle (despite a few Galaxy S7 Edge units also catching fire). The regular, non-curved Galaxy S7 came in at No. 9. Samsung's other popular models were part of its Galaxy J series, which address mid-tier price points. Despite the Note 7 recall, the S7 and S7 Edge collectively sold 10 million more units than the prior year's S6 and S6 Edge, according to the estimates. While Huawei has risen the ranks within the global smartphone market and is currently the No. 3 vendor, the Chinese company is doing so with a wide range of models that address numerous price points and market segments. As such, no single model placed within IHS Markit's top 10, despite Huawei's overall growing importance. Rising star Oppo, also based in China, had its A53 rank at No. 7 with approximately 25 million units shipped throughout the year. iPhone momentum Apple enjoyed a record 78.3 million iPhone unit sales in the fourth quarter (all models), which helped improve investor sentiment and mitigate concerns that the company's most important product was peaking. That earnings release helped spark a rally that has since brought shares to all-time highs, and it appears that the momentum could carry on. Expectations are running high ahead of this year's 10th-generation iPhone, which should be unveiled in about six months. Meanwhile, Samsung is facing considerable uncertainty as its corruption scandal continues to unfold, and heir Jay Lee was arrested last month in connection with bribery charges. Samsung has many other capable executives, but turmoil remains within the highest echelons of the company. Whether or not the scandal puts a dent in unit sales remains to be seen.

March 23rd 2017 15 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Google Maps launches a location sharing service that has privacy implications. Picture: AP Photo/Patrick Sison Rod ChesterNews Corp Australia Network GOOGLE Maps has finally caught up with Apple in letting users share their location. But while it’s now easier to make sure you meet up with friends, there are also privacy concerns of how the service can be abused. Apple users for a long time have been able to share the location with their friends, either with the app Find Friends or, more recently with Apple Maps and Messages. But the Google sharing announced today goes a step further, with the ability to follow friends around a map in real time. The feature, which will be rolled out to users around the world soon in an app update, lets anyone with Google Maps share their location with a friend, regardless of whether both or either have an Android or Apple iOS phone. To start sharing location, you open Google Maps and tap “share location”. You then select who to share it with and how long you want to share it. The person, or people, you have selected, will see an icon of your on their map, and you see an icon on your map as well, reminding you that you are sharing. One likely use for the feature is when you’re trying to meet friends. Share your location and they can then navigate to you. But you can also share trips. If you’re driving home from work, before you start your journey you share a trip with your family so they can track your progress through the traffic. You can turn off sharing at any time on your phone, the person you are sharing your location with can turn off sharing, and you can set the period of your sharing from 15 minutes to three days. If you turn on sharing with an unlimited time period, Google will send you an email every few weeks to point out that someone is tracking your location at every moment. For parents who want to make sure their kids are on the right train home from school, you can imagine this can be handy — although that is assuming the child is willing to have sharing turned on. The latest Google Maps update is a privacy killer! https://t.co/XimY8Ctn6G— NetamakerIndia (@netamakerIndia) March 22, 2017 Why can't my mum just accept "out" as an answer to where I'm going, she needs the post code & an image on google maps and my location— ㅤ (@LiamMc_01) March 3, 2017 Or if you’re wanting to know if it’s time to put dinner on before your partner walks in the door, you can check how they’re travelling in the traffic — again, assuming they have turned on sharing. But what are the downsides? Do teenagers have a right to their privacy from their parents? Could an abusive partner demand that their spouse always turn on location sharing so that they check their every move? If a spouse is willing to turn on location sharing, do they have something to hide? And when you go through a relationship breakup, do you have to remember that part of the checklist of giving your ex back their crappy DVDs you also have to turn off location sharing?

"This group is known for getting accounts and credentials, they have gotten credentials in the past," said Lamar Bailey, director of security research and development at Tripwire, of the purported hackers. "But whether they have that many ... who knows?" There's another reason for not panicking, Bailey said: People can quickly make their accounts more secure, assuming the criminals have only collected, not actually compromised the iCloud accounts by changing millions of passwords. "The best thing to in this instance is to change the [iCloud account] password, especially if it's a weak password," said Bailey in an interview. Weak, in Bailey's mind, was not necessarily simply short, but "one that was in the dictionary." Hackers can brute-force passwords that consist of a single real-world word -- one in the dictionary -- by relying on, not surprisingly, lists of words from the dictionary. Bailey reiterated the long-standing advice to compose passwords from numbers, letters and special characters, such as & and ^. Changing an iCloud account password is straight-forward; Apple spells out password reset on this page. "They should also enable two-factor authentication," Bailey continued, referring to the security layer available to those running iOS 9 or later on an iPhone or iPad, or OS X El Capitan (version 10.11) or later. iCloud/Apple ID two-factor authentication -- iCloud and Apple ID are synonymous for most users -- prevents a hacker from changing credentials unless they have one of the user's designated "trusted devices," typically a smartphone. To access one's iCloud/Apple ID account -- say to change the password -- a person must have not only the password, but also the trusted device, which receives a verification code that also must be entered before the password reset can be processed. Apple outlines two-factor authentication on this web page. Those with iPhones, iPads or Macs that don't meet the operating system requirements for two-factor authentication -- or who don't have any Apple device -- can substitute the similar, yet different two-step authentication. Instructions for enabling and using two-step authentication are available here. Because two-factor authentication isn't a good fit for everyone -- there's a trade-off between security and usability -- Bailey suggested that those who hesitate to enable two-factor should instead change passwords on a frequent basis. Many companies mandate regular password resets, for example. By changing passwords, credentials stolen by criminals can be made obsolete. "An alternative for two-factor is to change passwords fairly often," said Bailey, who recommended a password manager -- he used the label password vault that offers automated resets. Both LastPass, which Bailey hesitated to name because of a recent breach of its own, and Dashlane, include features that can reset multiple passwords at a time, although not for every website. Bailey also urged iCloud account holders to back up their devices, not just to the cloud but to local storage as well. "You don't want to lose your pictures," Bailey said.

Product awareness, product interest, product evaluation, product trial and product adoption - the five stages of cloud acceptance have already been negotiated. With Australian organisations now on board and now investing, cloud has moved past the hype and into the mainstream, creating new opportunities for partners as a result. Whether it be public, private or hybrid, implementations will continue to accelerate in 2017 as end-users seek to take advantage of the cloud’s economies of scale to build core applications. But as cloud becomes default, a default cloud channel strategy still ceases to exist. In association with Exclusive Networks, Fortinet, Storagecraft, Veeam, Westcon-Comstor and Zerto, this exclusive ARN roundtable assessed how partners can profit amidst a seemingly lucrative cloud world, outlining the new technologies coming to play, and the strategies required for ongoing success.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Swatch is developing its own smartwatch OS, coming in late 2018 03/19/2017 at 11:01 AM by Brad Linder 1 Comment Want to launch a new smartphone? Then you’re probably going to want to load it up with Google’s Android operating system. Android dominates the smartphone space, and unless your company’s name is Apple, odds are you’re not going to have a lot of success selling a non-Android phone. But what if you want to launch a new smartwatch? Things might not be so cut and dry in that emerging space yet. At least that’s what Swiss watch maker Swatch seems to be hoping. Bloomberg reports that Swatch is developing its own operating system for wearables, and plans to launch its first smartwatch powered by the software by the end of 2018. There area already a number of players in the smartwatch OS space. Apple has a version of iOS that runs on its Apple Watch. Samsung uses a Tizen Linux-based operating system for its Gear line of wearables. And a whole bunch of companies including Motorola, LG, Huawei, Fossil, and Tag Heur have adopted Google’s Android Wear platform. But while there are probably more watch models using Google’s software than any of the alternatives, Android Wear is actually on fewer wrists than the competition. Industry watches say Apple’s WatchOS and Samsung’s Tizen watches have the top market share, and while some predict that Android Wear could gain a larger portion of the market (particularly as Pebble/Fitbit loses ground), it’s not clear how accurate predictions will be in this market that’s still relatively new and unpredictable. All of which is to say… maybe Swatch’s decision to build its own platform isn’t as crazy as it sounds. There may be room for yet another smartwatch operating system… if it turns out that there’s enough demand for smartwatches in the first place to justify the amount of effort watch makers and tech companies are pouring into smart wearables. Swatch says its operating system will let you connect one of its Tissot branded watches with a smartphone, and that it will consume less power than competing platforms, leading to longer battery life. That may be good enough if you only want a watch that can display smartphone notifications and perform some other basic functions. But if you want a watch that can run a wide range of third-party apps, it remains to be seen whether Swatch will be able to compete with Apple, Google, and Samsung, all of which have already attracted third-party developers to their platforms. via Pocket Lint Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 1 Comment on "Swatch is developing its own smartwatch OS, coming in late 2018" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest mike moller Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

By Gregg Keizer Senior Reporter, Computerworld | Mar 22, 2017 1:23 PM PT Credit: Pixabay More like this Hackers demand $150K ransom, threaten to wipe millions of Apple devices 5 things you should do following the Yahoo breach Review: Password managers help keep hackers at bay Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Hackers claiming to have hundreds of millions of iCloud credentials have threatened to wipe date from iPhones, iPads and Macs if Apple does not fork over $150,000 within two weeks. "This group is known for getting accounts and credentials, they have gotten credentials in the past," said Lamar Bailey, director of security research and development at Tripwire, of the purported hackers. "But whether they have that many ... who knows?" There's another reason for not panicking, Bailey said: People can quickly make their accounts more secure, assuming the criminals have only collected, not actually compromised the iCloud accounts by changing millions of passwords. "The best thing to in this instance is to change the [iCloud account] password, especially if it's a weak password," said Bailey in an interview. Weak, in Bailey's mind, was not necessarily simply short, but "one that was in the dictionary." Hackers can brute-force passwords that consist of a single real-world word -- one in the dictionary -- by relying on, not surprisingly, lists of words from the dictionary. Bailey reiterated the long-standing advice to compose passwords from numbers, letters and special characters, such as & and ^. Changing an iCloud account password is straight-forward; Apple spells out password reset on this page. "They should also enable two-factor authentication," Bailey continued, referring to the security layer available to those running iOS 9 or later on an iPhone or iPad, or OS X El Capitan (version 10.11) or later. iCloud/Apple ID two-factor authentication -- iCloud and Apple ID are synonymous for most users -- prevents a hacker from changing credentials unless they have one of the user's designated "trusted devices," typically a smartphone. To access one's iCloud/Apple ID account -- say to change the password -- a person must have not only the password, but also the trusted device, which receives a verification code that also must be entered before the password reset can be processed. Apple outlines two-factor authentication on this web page. Those with iPhones, iPads or Macs that don't meet the operating system requirements for two-factor authentication -- or who don't have any Apple device -- can substitute the similar, yet different two-step authentication. Instructions for enabling and using two-step authentication are available here. Because two-factor authentication isn't a good fit for everyone -- there's a trade-off between security and usability -- Bailey suggested that those who hesitate to enable two-factor should instead change passwords on a frequent basis. Many companies mandate regular password resets, for example. By changing passwords, credentials stolen by criminals can be made obsolete. "An alternative for two-factor is to change passwords fairly often," said Bailey, who recommended a password manager -- he used the label password vault that offers automated resets. Both LastPass, which Bailey hesitated to name because of a recent breach of its own, and Dashlane, include features that can reset multiple passwords at a time, although not for every website. Bailey also urged iCloud account holders to back up their devices, not just to the cloud but to local storage as well. "You don't want to lose your pictures," Bailey said.

Designed to replace the iPad Air, the iPad comes with a tantalizingly low price tag: $329. It is Apple's most affordable tablet to date and it's a competitive price point that will allow the iPad to better compete with lower-priced Android offerings. What do you get for $329? As it turns out, quite a lot. The iPad is a little bit iPhone 6s, a little bit iPad Air, and a little bit iPad Air 2. In a nutshell, compared to the iPad Air 2, the iPad has a brighter display and a faster A9 processor (first introduced in the iPhone 6s). Other internal hardware seems to be very similar to what's included in the iPad Air 2, with the exception of the display and the casing. Camera, battery life, Wi-Fi, LTE, and other sensors are all nearly the same. The iPad does not include a laminated display, and is thus thicker, much like the original iPad Air. It measures in at 7.5mm thick, compared to the 6.1mm iPad Air 2. The thickness and accompanying weight discrepancy is noticeable and the one downside between the new iPad and its predecessor. Compared to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, the new iPad is, of course, significantly inferior, which is why it's priced at $329 and not $599. It does not support the Apple Pencil or the Smart Keyboard (no Smart Connector), and it lacks many of the display improvements, including True Tone color shifting and wide color gamut. The iPad has a slower processor than the iPad Pro, an inferior camera (8-megapixel vs. 12-megapixel rear and 1.2-megapixel vs. 5-megapixel front), two speakers instead of four, a slower LTE modem, and of course, since the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is the same size as the iPad Air 2, the iPad is noticeably thicker and heavier. If you're looking for top of the line hardware and accessory support, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is the tablet to buy, but if you don't need the bells and whistles, the iPad is a steal at its price point. Performance wise, it's going to run all the latest games and apps, it'll take decent pictures, it still has a high-quality Retina display, and it features a 10 hour battery life, so it will hold up for several years, especially when doing basic tasks like web browsing and emailing. Click for larger version For those looking for a bit more, Apple is rumored to be planning to introduce an updated ~10-inch iPad Pro model that's going to replace the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The ~10-inch model is said to have smaller bezels and perhaps an edge-to-edge display, allowing it to feature a bigger screen in a 9.7-inch-sized body. That tablet was originally rumored to be coming in the spring, but now it's looking like we won't see it until later in the year. Based on rumors, it may be worth the wait for those willing to shell out more money for the best technology. Apple plans to start selling the new iPad on Friday, March 24. The entry-level 32GB Wi-Fi only model will be priced at $329, and a 128GB model is available for $429. Wi-Fi + Cellular models are available at a $130 premium, so $459 for 32GB and $559 for 128GB.

Ditch the Air, but the thickness doesn't provide us with let's say more battery life or other advantages. Why not keep it as thin then? Just because we don't want a thin MBP and we do want full functionality on these laptops doesn't mean they have to reverse the iPad?!? They seem like they are undoing some confusion to me. The 'Air' moniker is outdated and no longer in line with the rest of their products. An iPad Mini, iPad, and iPad Pro lineup is logical. While the 'new' iPad is thicker than the iPad Air 2 its replacing, its the same size the original iPad Air. They just need to apply this to the rest of their product lineup. The Macbook Air no longer makes sense when the Macbook is lighter and smaller. You can criticize their individual products, but I think ditching the 'Air' name makes too much sense.

Can they actually do it? Should you be worried? It’s unclear at this point. The hackers apparently engaged in conversations with the media to force Apple’s hand. The Turkish Crime Family hacker group, which spoke to Motherboard, want either $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum, or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards. - Advertisement - 100% Natural Solution To Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection, Watery Sperm, Other Sexual Dysfunctions And Last More Than 30 Minutes During Sex. 100% Natural Solution To Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection, Watery Sperm, Other Sexual Dysfunctions And Last More Than 30 Minutes During Sex. 100% Natural Solution To Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection, Watery Sperm, Other Sexual Dysfunctions And Last More Than 30 Minutes During Sex. 100% Natural Solution To Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection, Watery Sperm, Other Sexual Dysfunctions And Last More Than 30 Minutes During Sex. “I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing,” one of the hackers said. Apparently, the hackers have been in contact with Apple’s security team for quite a while now. They even posted a video on YouTube to prove they have actual access to iCloud accounts, access which can be used to remotely wipe iPhones. Apple, understandably, doesn’t appear to be willing to pay up the ransom. “We firstly kindly request you to remove the video that you have uploaded on your YouTube channel as it’s seeking unwanted attention, second of all we would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law,” a screenshot of a message purportedly coming from an Apple security team member reads. The hackers say they have access to more than 300 million Apple email accounts, including @icloud and @me domains. The number is the source of some confusion though, because a different hacker from the group claimed they had 559 million accounts in all. They have not explained how they gained access to Apple ID credentials. The hackers are threatening to move forward with remotely wiping Apple devices on April 7th, unless Apple pays up. Apple hasn’t publicly commented on the matter at this point. On the off-chance that the hackers are indeed holding access to millions of iCloud accounts, you might consider changing your password to protect your Apple ID.

They say they’ll follow through if Apple doesn’t pay up US$75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum by April 7th. Hackers trying to extort Apple with threat of wiping out iCloud accounts The hackers are going by the name Turkish Crime Family, and are demanding payment in either of the crypto-currencies. Alternately, they say they’ll accept $100,000 in iTunes gift cards. The TCF shared their plan with Motherboard saying, “I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing.” The hackers say they have access to over 300 million accounts and may have shared their plan with Motherboard in hopes of pressuring Apple into paying up. That doesn’t, however, look like something Apple is interested in doing. The email interaction between Apple and the hackers shows the iPhone and iPad maker isn’t ready to play along. Apple told the group, “We would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law,” adding that their email communications are being handed over to law enforcement. TCF isn’t sharing a list of accounts they plan to wipe. Presumably they’re accounts where two-factor authentication isn’t enabled. Two-factor authentication requires an additional one-use access code along with your password to access your account. If you haven’t enabled two-factor authentication for your Apple ID and iCloud account yet, now looks like a really good time.

March 22, 2017 at 12:42 EDT PM wab95 March 22, 2017 Jeff: This would-be heist has all of the sophistication of the Three Stooges. And yes, we are passed time for users to switch to two-factor authentication, although it’s not exactly clear what the threat is here and whether or not two factor authentication would be protective (how are they resetting iPhones – malware already installed on compromised phones?). @geoduck: Balls, perhaps, but not a lot of smarts. If you’re going to commit what amounts to felony extortion, why stop at chump change for a company like Apple ($75,000 or $100K in gift cards – which are traceable I might add, but let’s not digress), when the penalty when one is inevitably caught will be the same as if you requested, I don’t know, $75,000,000 – also chump change for said company. The ransom bespeaks not-yet-ready-for-prime-time-even-if-prison-bound. March 22, 2017 at 3:32 EDT PM jscottk March 22, 2017 $75,000?!? Who are they, Dr. Evil? March 22, 2017 at 4:23 EDT PM geoduck March 22, 2017 wab95 I agree these are not mental giants, I kept thinking of that graphic that’s been floating around social networks. IT looks like a Windows pop up and says something like “This is the Albanian virus. Please delete a critical file and send this to seven of your friends.” And the $75k did crack me up.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 22, 2017 3:06pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL Snap's Fortunes May Be Tied To Apple And Vodaphone Analysts Respond To Apple's Mid-Cycle iPhone Refresh Introducing The ActiveAlts Contrarian ETF (Seeking Alpha) Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock is higher by more than 20 percent year-to-date and more than 30 percent over the past year, which has some calling for a correction. One of those is Tom McClellan, the editor of The McClellan Market Report. On Wednesday, he was a guest on CNBC to offer his take on why Apple's stock is due for a minor pullback. McClellan explained that Apple's stock has been trading in the same direction as the broader Nasdaq index, which is a positive sign. Apple investors should be worried when Apple's stock is printing lower highs at a time when the index is printing higher highs, but this isn't the case, as Apple's stock held up on Tuesday despite the market meltdown. 'Garden Variety Correction' With that said, Apple's stock could see an "ordinary garden variety correction" at any time and this may be happening right now as Apple's stock is about $2 off its all-time highs of $142.80. Nevertheless, Apple's ongoing strength should give investors confidence that any correction won't result in "carnage." Also important to keep in mind is the fact that many investors are expected to pull capital out of the stock market ahead of the tax deadline. Bottom line, McClellan said we simply aren't seeing any sort of dire warning from Apple.

An investigation by the New Zealand Herald found that Apple had paid nothing to the Inland Revenue Department since at least 2007 because its local operations are run by a parent company registered in Australia. Financial statements for its subsidiary, Apple Sales New Zealand, showed total sales in the last decade had amounted to NZD$4.2bn but income tax of NZD$34m had been apparently paid to the Australian tax office. Apple and Ireland will fight the EU's €13bn tax ruling all the way Read more A tax agreement between New Zealand and Australia sees dual claims on income tax default to where the company is controlled. In a statement to Guardian Australia Apple said it was the largest taxpayer in the world and respected the role taxes play in society as “important and necessary”. “We follow the law and pay tax on everything we earn, wherever we operate. Apple aims to be a force for good and we’re proud of the contributions we’ve made in New Zealand over the past decade.” The company said it pays the majority of its taxes in the US, where its products and services were created, designed and engineered. Deborah Russell, a senior lecturer at Massey University’s school of accountancy, said Apple’s tax arrangement in New Zealand was, at face value, legal. “The real question is just the morality of it.” She said it was “very surprising” that Apple would opt to pay more than necessary, with the company tax rate of 30% in Australia 2% higher than in New Zealand. “From Australia’s point of view, I hope the ATO is having a close look at what Apple is doing.” Company tax makes up 15% of New Zealand’s total tax take but a cabinet paper published in December raised concerns that multinational corporations were not paying their fair share. Judith Collins, New Zealand’s revenue minister, announced a crackdown on tax avoidance by multinational companies with employees in the country earlier this month. The consultation period ends 7 April. But Russell was sceptical about the ability of any one country’s laws to bring as large and global a company as Apple to heel. “I think Apple is bigger than New Zealand – they’ve got tremendous resources to fight back,” she said. “Every time a government comes up with a new way to rein in these multinationals, clever tax accountants come up with a way around it. That’s essentially their job.” The amount of income tax Apple pays in Australia has been criticised as inadequate, given its practice of profit-shifting via Ireland revealed in 2014. In the ATO’s corporate report of entity tax information for 2014-15, the most recent results available, Apple Pty Ltd was shown to have paid just under AUD$146.3m out of a total income of over $8.3bn and taxable income of nearly $488m. Antony Ting, an expert on international tax avoidance at the University of Sydney Business School, said even if Apple paid tax in Australia on its sales income in New Zealand, “the key issue” remained the company’s diversion of profit to Ireland. “The bulk of the profit is shifted to Ireland and never taxed anywhere in the world,” he said. “It’s a very small portion that is being taxed, even in Australia.” He said Apple’s international tax structure was “perfectly legal” under the prevailing tax law in Australia but the forthcoming diverted profits tax could give the ATO teeth to tax the profits lodged in Ireland. Described by Ting as “basically a carbon copy” of the UK’s diverted profits tax, it was announced in the 2016-7 budget and was due to come into effect on 1 July 2017, though Ting warned its effectiveness remained to be seen. Asked about the ethics of Apple’s sending profits offshore, Ting said: “Tax law is not always fair or just. If the law is perceived to be unfair, we should seek to change or improve it.” Ireland may not get Apple's €13bn back taxes in full, EU says Read more Questioned in front of the Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance in April 2015 that preceded the amendment, Apple Australia and New Zealand’s managing director, Tony King, denied the company had strategies in place to reduce the tax it paid in Australia. He said it paid all taxes it owed under Australian law and was committed to the success of its economy and a transparent and collaborative relationship with the ATO. “In fact, in our most recently lodged accounts, our effective tax rate was above the Australian corporate tax rate of 30%.” The company faces a titanic legal battle against the European Commission after it was ordered in August to pay a record €13bn in taxes to the Irish government. The outcome has implications for the more than 600 US multinationals based in Ireland and thousands more using tax-avoidance vehicles globally. Its chief executive, Tim Cook, strenuously rejected the commission’s finding that Ireland had given Apple “a special deal”, stating that it had “no basis in fact or in law”. On 31 January 2016, Apple reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of US$78.4bn, its highest quarterly revenue ever.

At least that’s what a group of hackers seem to suggest, as they’re currently attempting to blackmail Apple for up to $100,000 before they start remotely wiping millions of iPhones. Can they actually do it? Should you be worried? It’s unclear at this point. Don't Miss: Apple just added a brand new iPhone 7 model to its lineup The hackers apparently engaged in conversations with the media to force Apple’s hand. The Turkish Crime Family hacker group, which spoke to Motherboard, want either $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum, or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards. “I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing,” one of the hackers said. Apparently, the hackers have been in contact with Apple’s security team for quite a while now. They even posted a video on YouTube to prove they have actual access to iCloud accounts, access which can be used to remotely wipe iPhones. Apple, understandably, doesn’t appear to be willing to pay up the ransom. “We firstly kindly request you to remove the video that you have uploaded on your YouTube channel as it’s seeking unwanted attention, second of all we would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law,” a screenshot of a message purportedly coming from an Apple security team member reads. The hackers say they have access to more than 300 million Apple email accounts, including @icloud and @me domains. The number is the source of some confusion though, because a different hacker from the group claimed they had 559 million accounts in all. They have not explained how they gained access to Apple ID credentials. The hackers are threatening to move forward with remotely wiping Apple devices on April 7th, unless Apple pays up. Apple hasn’t publicly commented on the matter at this point. On the off-chance that the hackers are indeed holding access to millions of iCloud accounts, you might consider changing your password to protect your Apple ID.

But $600 is a lot to pay for a tablet. Review To inject new life into tablets, Samsung has borrowed liberally from its smartphones to create the Galaxy Tab S3. By bringing over some of the best things about Samsung's flagship phones -- such as a premium glass-and-metal design, a versatile S Pen stylus and a slick Android 7.0 experience -- Samsung is betting that the Tab S3 can deliver a Galaxy-class device for use around the home or even in the office. Samsung has also added a couple of multimedia perks, including support for high dynamic range (HDR) content and quad AKG speakers. But with mediocre  battery life and a camera that doesn't live up to the S7's, the $600 Galaxy Tab S3 is easy to like but hard to justify buying. article continued below Design: Premium pedigree By revamping its flagship tablet with a new glass-and-metal design, Samsung has sent a clear message that the Tab S3 shares more than just a passing connection with its more mobile siblings. Like the Galaxy S7, the Tab S3 (available in black or silver) has sleek glass panels on the front and back, a strip of brushed aluminum running around the outside, and a home button with a built-in fingerprint reader that's flanked on both sides by touch controls for Back and Recent Apps. On the tablet's bottom, there's a handy USB Type-C port with support for quick charging, along with a handy headphone jack for all of your audio needs. MORE: Best Tablets The Tab S3 distinguishes itself from being just big smartphone with a new quad-speaker setup, thanks in part to AKG, and a subtle strip of Pogo pins on the left side that are used to connect the Tab S3's optional folding keyboard (more on both of those later). Measuring 9.37 x 6.65 x 0.23 inches and weighing 0.94 pounds, the Tab S3 is essentially the same size and heft as Apple's 9.7-inch iPad Pro (9.4 x 6.6 x 0.24 inches and 0.98 pounds). Display: A real treat for the eyes With a high-res 2048 x 1536 QXGA resolution and a vibrant Super AMOLED panel with support for HDR content, the Tab S3's screen is downright mesmerizing. The Tab S3 gains an edge with its HDR support, which can completely change how you see color and lighting in movies. Its pure blacks are perfect for watching space movies such as Life, though with the screen's 4:3 aspect ratio, you will run into some pretty heavy letterboxing on the top and bottom. But the Tab S3 gains an edge with its HDR support, which can completely change how you see color and lighting in movies. Watching an HDR video for the first time can feel the same as moving from standard definition to full HD. Just one problem: HDR content isn't widely available yet, though there are a few select titles -- such as Bosch and Man in the High Castle, both on Amazon Prime Video -- that do work on the Tab S3. In those shows, the Tab S3's HDR screen reveals many more details in very dark or light scenes while also adding a new richness to colors. Putting out a peak brightness of 441 nits, the Tab S3 is one of the brightest tablets we've ever tested, even outshining the 9.7-inch iPad Pro (432 nits). However, the Tab S3 fell short of the Google Pixel C, which put out a superbright mark of 509 nits. Even with a stunning HDR-enabled AMOLED screen and a luxurious design, it's hard to justify spending $600 on any tablet. Where the Tab S3 really shines is with its color range. It covered an expansive 188 percent of the sRGB spectrum; in comparison, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro registered just 122 percent. Finally, with a Delta-E rating of 3.44, the Tab S3's color accuracy was good, but not great. The screens on both the Pixel C and the iPad Pro were much more precise, with ratings of 1 and 1.9, respectively. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.) Audio: A new era of sound from Samsung Samsung looks to be entering into a new era of audio excellence. The Tab S3's quad-speaker setup by AKG features omnidirectional tuning that adjusts the audio so that it will sound good in both portrait and landscape orientation. When I put it up against the iPad Pro (which also has a dynamic four-speaker arrangement) while listening to Chic's "I'll Be There," the differences we're quite apparent. While the iPad Pro definitely wins on volume, the vocals and guitars from the Tab S3 were much crisper, and and sounded richer, in the highs and mids, especially up against the iPad's overly airy audio. Performance: Quick, but still can't touch Apple Featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of onboard storage and microSD card expansion up to 256GB, the Galaxy Tab S3's specs are almost identical to those of Samsung's current flagship phone, the Galaxy S7. As a result, performance always felt snappy, whether I was watching a high-res movie, playing a game or flipping between apps. Even though the Tab S3's performance is quite good, Apple's iPad Pro still holds a considerable advantage. However, for a premium product that can also be used as a backup productivity device, the Tab S3's 32GB of onboard storage feels a bit stingy. We would have preferred 64GB to start. Unfortunately, even though the Tab S3's performance is quite good, when you put it up against the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, it's clear that Apple's tablet still holds a considerable advantage. On Geekbench 4, which measures overall system performance, the iPad Pro scored 4,802, versus the Tab S3's mark of 3,765. The aging Pixel C was even farther behind, at 2,717. It was a similar story for graphics performance, where the 9.7-inch iPad Pro outperformed the Tab S3 on 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited Graphics test, scoring 32,494 versus 20,891 for Samsung's device. Still, the tablet average is still significantly lower, at 17,453. S Pen and Optional Keyboard: S Pen is sweet, keyboard not so much When you want the Tab S3 to be more than just a content-consumption device, you can pull out the included S Pen and transform the tablet into a top-notch sketching tablet. The Tab S3's pen features 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity, delivering the kind of precision that artists will appreciate. As with the stylus integration on other Samsung devices, you get a whole range of Air Commands that let you create notes, write memos on the screen, create shortcuts to your favorite apps or even make your very own GIFs. Too bad there's nowhere to dock the pen when it's not in use. If you want to go even further, you can pony up for the Tab S3's $130 optional folding keyboard, which features a built-in kickstand and a handy Pogo pin connector. That means you don't need to wait for a Bluetooth keyboard to slowly connect every time you want to type. Nor will you have to worry about one more thing to charge, since the keyboard draws the juice it needs from the tablet. The optional keyboard's single-position kickstand and lack of a hinged connector make the Tab S3 quite finicky to use when you don't have it set on either a desk or a table. As far as the typing experience goes, the keys have a pretty standard 65-gram actuation weight and a somewhat shallow, though pleasantly clicky, 1.1 millimeters of travel. Because of the 9.7-inch Tab S3's dimensions, though, the keys on the top and bottom rows are half the size as the letter keys, which are already pretty small. That makes touch typing at speed pretty difficult without a lot of adjustment time. Also, the keyboard's single-position kickstand and lack of a hinged connector make the tablet quite finicky to use when you don't have it set on either a desk or a table. Additionally, its keys aren't backlit, and while the "squircle"-shaped keys do a good job of imitating the Tab S3's home-screen icons, they aren't actually any better for typing than good ol' square keys. Camera: Good, but not quite Galaxy-class If you're the kind of person who takes a lot of photos with a tablet, you should probably re-evaluate your priorities (especially if you're the person two rows ahead of me at concerts who spends the whole show blocking my vision with a 9-inch device). However, considering the Galaxy S7's shooter is the best smartphone camera on the market right now, you might think Samsung's efforts to bring the best part of its flagship phones to the Tab S3 would translate to the tablet's camera. Sadly, that isn't the case, because after I compared a number of shots taken by the S3 and a Galaxy S7 Edge side by side, I found that the Tab S3's 13-megapixel rear camera wasn't on the same level as its smartphone counterpart. The most apparent difference is the Tab S3's more limited dynamic range. In a shot of a nearby bonsai tree, the Tab S3's rear cam underexposed the dirt and caused the colors on the leaves and colorful plastic soldiers to look significantly more muted than in the S7 Edge's image. Even in almost optimal conditions, the same thing happened again when I snapped a pic of some cookies. The S7's pic featured noticeably richer colors and better dynamic range. Plus, the Tab S3's shot showed that the camera had a hard time focusing, as much of the photo looked soft and blurry. The results are much closer than photos from the 9.7-inch iPad Pro's 12-MP rear cam, but I'd have to give the iPad a slight edge because its pics have a sharper focus and more saturated colors, even if the iPad's photo is a little dark. In front, the Tab S3's 5-MP cam snaps pics pretty similar to those from the S7's same-res shooter. Software and OS The Tab S3 comes with Android 7.0 that has been customized with Samsung's skin and UI treatment, so you get a relatively clean home screen with squircle-shaped icons. However, Samsung does not offer a theme app as it does for its phones, so if you want to customize the device's layout, you'll have to resort to third-party apps such as Nova Launcher. Preinstalled software includes Microsoft's Office suite for Android, a few apps for use with the the S Pen, and some items borrowed from Samsung's flagship phones, like Secure Folder. You can use that app to store sensitive information with its own password or fingerprint-locked partition. The Tab S3 also comes with Samsung's Flow app, which can be used to pair the Tab S3 to an Android phone, so you can see texts and notifications right on the tablet. Flow can also be used to automatically set up a mobile hotspot using the data connection from your phone, giving you internet access even when you're away from Wi-Fi.   Battery Life: Just OK With a time of 8 hours and 45 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test (continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi), the Tab S3's battery life is pretty mediocre. Our tablet category average is about 30 minutes longer, at 9:18, while the Tab S3's closest competitor, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, was considerably better, with a time of 10:53. MORE: 10 Tablets with the Longest Battery Life Because the S3's keyboard draws power from the tablet, keeping the two connected can have an impact on the S3's longevity. When we ran our standard battery test with the keyboard attached, we found that the Tab S3's battery lasted about an hour less, on average, with a time of 7:38. Bottom Line The Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 has a lot of stand-out features, including its superb AMOLED screen with support for HDR content, precise handwriting and drawing capabilities via the included S Pen, and gorgeous glass-and-metal design. But I'm not so sure the Tab S3 -- or any other tablet  -- is worth $600. That's a ton of money to spend on a device you use to stream Netflix and sketch notes. Yes, you could shell out another $130 for the Tab S3's fidgety folding keyboard, but now you're looking at a total price of $730, which gets dangerously close to the price of Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. If I had to choose between the Tab S3 or the Surface Pro 4 (which has a much faster CPU and quadruple the storage) as a real productivity device, I'd pick the Surface Pro 4 every time. It's not like the Tab S3 has been perfectly executed, either. Its battery life is just OK, and its camera is a far cry from those  on Samsung's flagship phones. The Galaxy Tab S3 is a true luxury device. It's something that almost everyone would love to have sitting pretty in their living room or kitchen, but even with all of its strong points, it's hard to justify a price tag that high.

 You'll have to pay at least $100 more for the red iPhone 7 Antonio Villas-Boas Mar. 22, 2017, 2:24 PM 11,942 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple announced a new red iPhone 7 with a matte metallic texture on Tuesday, and it looks gorgeous. YouTube/Marques Brownlee My colleague Rob Price thinks it's exactly the kind of break we need from the monotonous "metal body, available in silver/gold/black" and glass designs we've recently seen on many smartphones. Yet, there's a caveat to breaking away from that monotony, and it takes the form of a higher price tag. The Special Edition (Product) RED iPhone 7 starts at $750, and the red iPhone 7 Plus at $870, both of which are at least $100 more than the base price of the other iPhone 7 models (with the exception of the jet black color). That's because the red iPhone 7 is only available in the pricier 128GB and 256GB options. It's not available in the cheaper 32GB option, which costs $650 for the iPhone 7 and $770 for the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple This isn't the first time Apple limited a certain color option to more expensive iPhone models. When it released the jet black iPhone 7 last year, arguably the most desirable new color option at the time, it also announced that it was only available in the 128GB and 256GB options. That made the Jet Black iPhone 7 inherently more expensive than the other color options, which is still the case today. For many, 128GB of storage is overkill, especially when cloud storage and cloud services are becoming more and more prominent. Think Google Photos for free unlimited photo storage, or Spotify for music streaming. The need to store photos and music locally on your phone, two of the biggest storage hogs you could have on your phone, is diminishing. At the same time, limiting the most desirable colors, including the red model, to the more expensive 128GB and 256GB options adds to its "Special Edition" vibe. The red iPhone 7 models will be available to buy on Friday, March 24. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Mello Jr. Mar 22, 2017 10:44 AM PT Apple on Tuesday announced an iPad update, a red iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and a new video-editing app for iOS. The iPad upgrade has a 9.7-inch, 2048 x 1536-pixel Retina display with 264 pixels per inch, and Apple's A9 64-bit processor. The unit will come in silver, gold and space gray with a starting price of US$329 for 32 gigabytes of storage and WiFi-only support. It will cost $459 for a 32-GB unit with WiFi and cellular support. As with prior models, the battery life for the new iPad is 10 hours. It has an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera and 1.2-MP front-facing FaceTime unit. The new iPad is available for order on Mach 24 from Apple's website and will be in Apple Stores next week. With the latest upgrade, Apple's iPad lineup looks like this: iPad Pro 12.9 inch ($799); iPad Pro 9.7 inch ($599); iPad 9.7 inch ($329) and iPad mini 4 ($399). Not Quite an Air Replacement Although the latest iPad replaces the iPad Air 2 in Apple's tablet lineup, it doesn't quite supplant it. "It falls somewhere between a new device and the old device," said Carolina Milanesi, a principal analyst at Creative Strategies. "They upgraded the most important thing on the device -- the processor," she told TechNewsWorld. "Not only will the performance be better, but other components, like the camera, will be snappier." Pricing is also an outstanding feature of the new iPad, Milanesi said, noting that "$329 for a 9.7-inch device is very aggressive." Prying Old iPads from Users' Paws Attractive pricing may tempt some iPad owners to upgrade their old hardware. "The replacement cycle for iPads is getting really long," said Mikako Kitagawa, a principal research analyst with Gartner. "If you have a 3- or 4-year-old iPad, you may want this upgrade." The pricing also could attract some new users into the Apple universe. "They're going to stretch the iPad's market into the mid-range tablet market," Kitagawa told TechNewsWorld. Competitive pressure also may play a role in Apple's new entry-level tablet pricing. "It's an interesting strategic move for Apple," said Rhoda Alexander, director of tablet and notebook research at IHS Markit. "They've held that $499 introductory price on the 9.7 for seven years now," she told TechNewsWorld. "That price is way above the competition, so this is a realigning of the product to bring it to a more competitive price point. The lower price point for the iPad could gin up some additional iPad sales, "but not as much as many believe," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. "The biggest challenge to large tablets are Windows two-in-one laptops and touch Chromebooks," he told TechNewsWorld. A Red iPhone Apple introduced red versions of its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus to celebrate the company's 10-year partnership with (RED), an organization that funds programs to help prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to unborn babies. Apple customers can contribute to the Global Fund to fight AIDS with iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition. A portion of the sales of the RED iPhone will go to the organization, to which Apple has contributed more than $130 million during the partnership. Slated for availability in Apple Stores on Friday, the RED iPhone pricing will start at $749 for a 128-GB model. Video Editing With Clips Apple also announced Clips, a new video-editing app. The software is designed to combine photos, video and music without timelines or complicated tools. Real-time filters, emoji and other effects available in Clips can add fun to any photo or video. Its LiveTitles feature lets you use your voice to create animated titles and captions. As you speak, titles appear on the screen perfectly synced to your speech. You can edit titles with a tap. Comic book filters are included, as well as support for speech bubbles and shapes. You can use the software to create full-screen posters with animated backgrounds too. Dozens of music soundtracks are available for the content you create with the app. What's more, the app automatically trims them to fit your production. Available in April, Clips runs on iOS 10.3 and is compatible with the iPhone 5s or later, all iPad Air and Pro models, the iPad mini 2 and above, and the iPod touch 6th-generation model. John P.

Re: Apple Unveils Budget-Friendly iPad, Dresses iPhone in Red jescott418Posted 2017-03-23 iPad sales dropped a significant amount and holiday sales were nothing close to positive. Apple releasing something new and cheaper means they finally are desperate about improving iPad sales. But whenever Apple does this, they alienate another line such as the iPad Mini in this case. Two things define why Apple went this direction with the iPad. One is that the iPad Pro lack of sales proves that the iPad is not thought of as a primary device and that people won't spend that much on a secondary device. Two, the iPad is part of what drives Apple profits, that is the App store and getting a cheaper iPad into more hands would mean more app sales. This may also mean down the road Apple could address slowing Mac sales with a new cheaper Macbook to spur on sales for Mac's. I didn't see much fanfare about ...

On Tuesday, March 21, 2017, Apple cut prices on two iPad models and introduced red iPhones, but the company held back on updating its higher-end iPad Pro tablets. (Apple via AP)More NEW YORK (AP) — Apple is cutting prices on two iPad models and introducing red iPhones, but the company held back on updating its higher-end iPad Pro tablets. A much-speculated 10.5-inch iPad Pro didn't materialize, nor did new versions of existing sizes in the Pro lineup, which is aimed at businesses and creative professionals. The new devices are mostly refreshes of existing models. Apple unveiled them through press releases Tuesday rather than a staged event, as it typically does for bigger product releases. The iPad updates come as the tablet market continues to decline, after a few years of rapid growth. According to IDC, tablet shipments fell 20 percent to 53 million worldwide in the final three months of 2016, compared with the same period in 2015. THE NEW LINEUP The iPad Air 2 is replaced by a new model simply called the iPad. It retains a 9.7-inch screen, but gains a little weight and thickness. The display is brighter and the processor faster. Its price starts at $329 for 32 gigabytes of storage, down from $399. The standard-size iPad is now cheaper than the smaller Mini model. The 7.9-inch iPad Mini 4 now comes with 128 gigabytes of storage starting at $399, rather than $499 before. Apple is eliminating the 32-gigabyte model, which used to sell for $399. Nothing else is changing. Apple is also releasing a red edition of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus; for each phone sold, Apple is donating an unspecified amount to HIV and AIDS programs. And Apple is doubling the storage on the smaller iPhone SE while keeping the $399 starting price. The new iPad Mini 4 is available right away, while the standard-size iPad comes out next week, with orders to begin Friday. The new iPhone SE comes out Friday, while the red iPhones are expected by the end of the month, with advance orders beginning Friday. THE MISSING DEVICE IDC analyst Jorge Vela had high hopes for a 10.5-inch iPad. He said such a size might have offered room for a better keyboard, compared with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and it wouldn't have been as bulky as the 12.9-inch version. And Apple typically sparks consumer interest when it has new sizes and designs, Vela said, as seen by a jump in sales following the introduction of larger iPhones in 2014 (iPhone sales have since dropped.) Vela said a 10.5-inch version might have been enough for existing iPad owners to upgrade. A 10.5-inch version may still come this year, closer to the holiday shopping season, along with updates to existing Pro sizes. Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said Tuesday's announcement makes it "even clearer that there are two very distinct iPad tiers now — the iPad Pro and the basic iPads. The iPad Pros will likely continue to get all the best new features, while the basic iPad will get occasional updates and new features a little later than the Pros, lagging a generation or two behind." The processor in the new standard-size iPad, for instance, is akin to what's in the iPhone 6S from 2015. The Mini's processor is even older. DOWN BUT NOT OUT In the last three months of 2016, iPhones generated 10 times the revenue as iPads. Unit sales of iPads fell 19 percent from the previous year. Yet Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed optimism because many people were buying iPads for the first time, indicating that the market had yet to reach saturation, the point at which everyone who wants a particular product already has one. Dawson agrees that the number of tablet owners is still growing, even if overall sales are declining because people aren't upgrading often. He said the new $329 price for the 9.7-inch iPad should help spur sales. New 9.7-inch models have previously cost at least $499. Far from holding a clearance sale, Vela said Apple is merely taking advantage of lower prices for older components. And Apple might be able to preserve higher profit margins by pushing people into a model with four times the storage, or 128 gigabytes; the extra storage costs Apple far less than the extra $100 that model sells for, Vela said. CHALLENGERS Apple remains the market leader, accounting for about a quarter of all tablets shipped in the fourth quarter, according to IDC. Samsung beat Apple to a tablet announcement by nearly a month, though Samsung's Android-based Galaxy Tab S3 doesn't actually start selling until this Friday, for $600. Read More Vela doesn't consider it a serious threat to Apple. Even though the Tab S3 is more in line with iPad Pros in quality, Vela said people tend to buy Samsung tablets as media-consumption devices, something they can do with the cheaper iPads. Samsung also has two Windows 10 tablets coming. Called the Galaxy Book, the Windows devices are more likely to challenge Microsoft's Surface than iPads. Microsoft is due for a refresh of its Surface Pro tablet, last updated in October 2015. ___ AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson contributed to this report.

It's tasteful. It's uninspired. It's dull. After years of experimentation on materials, size, and design, smartphone companies have largely reached a mundane equilibrium. A metal body, available in silver/gold/black, a 5-ish-inch screen, maybe make it available in two sizes — done. The result is a parade of identikit devices with little to distinguish them. Apple is finally doing something new Apple has been one of the worst offenders, its gloriously plastic iPhone 5c not withstanding. But on Tuesday, it did something different: It launched a red iPhone. The device, an iPhone 7, is part of Apple's long-running partnership with the (RED) organization, with money from each sale going towards its HIV/AIDS research and relief efforts. (In China, the red iPhone is expected to sell particularly well, given the color's association with luck — but the device is on sale in Western markets, too.) In photos and videos, the device looks striking — and the initial response has been highly positive.

But if you take a look at Google Trends, the searches for "red iphone" far outstrip "new ipad." More anecdotally, more than 115,000 people read Business Insider's story on the new iPhone — versus less than 70,000 for our piece on the new iPads. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Google trends red iphone new ipad march 2017 Google Trends Gold isn't 'high-end' — it's out-of-date The design language that Apple, Samsung and the rest employ — that elegant gold devices are synonymous with premium quality — is tired and stale. Even lower-end devices, like Motorola's Moto G, are now aping the aesthetic, coming equipped with metal bodies and "luxury" color schemes. There's no soul. © Provided by Business Insider Inc product red iphone box Apple But the public response to the red iPhone shows that the world is crying out for more interesting phones, and it looks like smartphone makers are just starting to wake up to this. Leaked renders show the new Samsung S8 coming in lilac (albeit in a subtle, desaturated tone), and other rumored shades include blue and pink. Huawei's premium P10 device is available in green and blue, as well as the usual gold-black-silver-white suspects. These are baby steps, but welcome ones. There's a near-infinite variety of fashions, clothes, and accessories, to meet all tastes, so there's no reason people looking for a decent smartphone should be boxed into choosing between three wearisome shades of metal. In short: "Premium" needn't be synonymous with boring. Smartphone companies need to rediscover their sense of fun.

Tim Cook said yesterday it was in celebration of ten years’ partnership with the charity, and the PRODUCT(RED) branding was prominent on the homepage of its websites around the world – except in China, that is … As TechCrunch notes, Apple’s Chinese website omits all mention of the link to the charity. This isn’t a language thing – the Taiwanese site has the same PRODUCT(RED) branding as the rest of the world – but the site suggests this is instead a political decision by Apple. Its theory is that Apple doesn’t want to jeopardise its somewhat delicate relationship with the Chinese government by getting embroiled in what is a controversial topic in the country. There is reason to support this theory. China has been criticized in many quarters for failing to adequately respond to a growing AIDS crisis in the country. It’s a great-looking phone — my wife wants one now, even though our contracts don’t come up until this autumn when newer models are expected. But it sure would be nice if Tim Cook showed Beijing the same courage of his convictions as he does Washington.

Smartphones got us there, AI will take us further. by Walt Mossberg@waltmossberg Mar 22, 2017, 10:28am EDT tweet share Linkedin Amazon Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, executive editor at The Verge and editor at large of Recode. It’s often hard to remember that the personal computing era is still quite young. It only dates from 1977, with the arrival of the first mass-market PCs. These were the first computing devices meant for individuals that weren’t kits, had screens and keyboards, and could actually do something useful, like word processing, game play or, eventually, spreadsheets. The best known of these, the Apple II, which remained on the market in various forms until 1993, will have its 40th anniversary in June. That makes mass-market personal computing younger than the Super Bowl, Starbucks and Disneyland. You can trace a pretty straight line from these first machines to the laptop, tablet or smartphone you’re using right now. They are all personal computers, with the smartphone being the most used today. Those 1977 models (which included entries from Commodore and Tandy) are also the forebears of the Web, Facebook, Google and pretty much whatever else you’re using on whatever digital device is at hand. The information “appliance” But, almost right from the start, and right through the 1990s and even the early 2000s, the quest was on, at least among some, for computing devices to become “appliances,” or “information appliances” — that is, dead simple to use, without training or the need for a manual. I know: The push for greater ease of use was a defining principle of my own tech column in the Wall Street Journal, which launched in 1991 and continued for 22 years. Of course, the standard for this “appliance” level of ease of use changed over time. The bar was pretty low in 1977 when, according to Wikipedia, the then-influential Byte magazine said the Apple II “may be the first product to fully qualify as the ‘appliance computer’ ... a completed system which is purchased off the retail shelf, taken home, plugged in and used.” This despite the fact that it used a command-line interface, needed an audio cassette recorder to store its apps and data, and took plenty of effort to master. For many years, even as users became more sophisticated, personal computers took too much effort to use without problem-solving, keeping alive the yearning for greater simplicity. Microsoft’s dominant Windows platform, in particular, was a home for all manner of bugs and problems that required IT people to straighten out. Of course, a significant minority of people enjoyed solving these problems and loved to hack and modify PCs. But not mainstream users. Even Apple’s Macs, which were generally much simpler and more secure, got more buggy and fell behind as the company faltered in the 1990s and didn’t hit their current stride for years thereafter. During that era, I tested many digital devices that claimed to be appliances, a few of which were even mildly successful. I reviewed one of them as late as 2005, a device called the Pepper Pad, which was kind of what an iPad might have been with worse designers and an even higher base price. I wasn’t crazy about it. Only the Palm Pilot — and its descendant, the Treo — came close to the dream, but they were limited and lacked large platform ecosystems. (Despite its popularity, the BlackBerry for too long was largely an enterprise-focused email terminal with few apps.) The iPhone changed everything In 2007, everything changed with the iPhone. As crippled as that first model now seems, with its lack of apps and glacial cellular connectivity, the iPhone was a practical, useful, self-contained computer a child could understand. It was an information appliance. And it became even more so with the advent of the App Store the next year. Today, it seems boring to many tech fans, but the iPhone broke through the last barrier that allowed everybody to do a wide range of tasks on a speedy computer. And that was followed up in 2008 by Android. It took years to sand off the rough edges and get the hardware right, but Android devices added qualities the iPhone lacked: They sold for less and allowed for lots of customization. Then came the iPad in 2010, to add a large screen and more PC-like apps to the iPhone template. By the 2010s, almost everybody in the developed world, it seemed, had a powerful digital device that took little or no special skills or training to use. So, are we done with the quest for the perfect information appliance? Nope. The next stage We’ve already begun the next stage. You might call it the quest for the Starship Enterprise computer — the one that you can just talk to when you need information, or to get a task done, to be entertained or to record a moment. It will require perfect conversational ability, sensors of every kind and limitless storage, prodigious, always-learning artificial intelligence, access to almost infinite personal data and knowledge about nearly everything. These are all huge steps to take, and they will all require massive investment and more than a few failed first attempts. But every major computer company is pursuing this goal, in one form or another, as are researchers and smaller companies as yet unknown to us. So far, we see only the glimmers of this future in things like Siri, Alexa, Cortana and the Google Assistant. These voice-activated “assistants” often live on existing laptops, smartphones and tablets. They also now come in their own hardware, notably the Amazon Echo and the Google Home device. But, even from today’s vantage point, we all know they are very crude. When I asked Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos last year if we were in the first inning of the quest for these artificially intelligent, conversational devices, he said it was even earlier than that: “it might even be the first guy’s up at bat.” I suspect that today’s mass-market AI software and hardware will, in only 10 years or so, look as primitive and quaint as the Apple II does now. And when we get all of that figured out? Well, some other perfect information appliance will still be waiting, just out of reach.

Today we're learning that TPK has made a strategic move in order to better compete for Apple's business.   Today we learn that TPK Holding has reached agreement with its rival O-Film to invest in each other, develop new technologies together and share customers as the sector consolidates.   Freddie Liu, TPK's chief financial officer, told reporters that "We are absolutely complementary for each other, as 90% of our revenue comes from American and European customers while 90% of O-film's customers are from China."   Liu said O-film will pay 1.81 billion New Taiwan dollars ($59.42 million) for a 5.46% stake in his company via a private placement, and TPK will acquire a 0.4% to 0.5% stake in the Chinese company for roughly NT$900 million either in the open market or via a private placement.   The two companies will form a joint venture to create next-generation technologies and share their customer bases, according to Liu. TPK generated about 50% of its sales of NT$89.21 billion for all of 2016 from Apple. Its second-largest customer is Microsoft, which accounts for 20% of the company's revenue.   O-film, on the other hand, supplies to mostly Chinese brands such as Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and others. The Shenzhen-based company also offers camera and finger print modules for electronic devices.   O-film Chairman Ricky Tsai Rongjun said in a statement that the partnership between the two companies is a "win-win strategy," and they will work together to foster businesses in new areas of the automotive sector, augmented reality, virtual reality, and other connect devices as well as in the mature mobile devices market.   The two companies will run independently without participating in each other's operations and having a seat on each other's board, TPK's Liu said.   Still, O-film will become the second largest shareholder of TPK Holding and the Chinese company will own a 51% stake in the new joint venture when the deal is completed.   Boyce Fan, senior research manager at Taipei-based research company WitsView, said the two companies would complement each other, and the tie-up may put pressure on Taipei-listed F-GIS, TPK's rival for Apple orders and a subsidiary of key iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry, known as Foxconn Technology Group. .   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Published on March 22, 2017. The red iPhones on Apple's China website Credit: www.apple.com/cn Most Popular Apple is selling red iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models to raise money for the Global Fund to fight HIV and AIDS. In mainland China, oddly, the company's website makes no mention of the cause. The new products are just presented as special edition red iPhones. Tay Xiaohan of IDC noticed the discrepancy and tweeted about it. She remarked that AIDS is a sensitive topic in China, and asked whether "Apple may be worried that this message will not resonate well with consumers?" Ms. Tay, senior market analyst with IDC's Asia/Pacific client devices group, posted a photo of Apple's mainland China product site next to a shot from its website in Taiwan. Unlike the mainland's web page, Taiwan's site bears the branding of Product Red, which contributes to the Global Fund. A spokeswoman for Apple Inc. did not respond to an email seeking comment. It wasn't clear whether there might be other complexities, perhaps related to working with a charity from outside China. Ad Age checked with a business consultant and a lawyer, and neither were aware of any specific legal issue on that front. Apple has had a partnership with Red for a decade, as CEO Tim Cook pointed out in a news release this week. Deborah Dugan, Red's CEO, said in the release that Apple is the world's largest corporate donor to the Global Fund, contributing more than $130 million in its partnership with Red. Red, founded in 2006, says it donates 100% of all money raised to Global Fund grants on HIV and AIDS that "provide testing, counseling, treatment and prevention programs with a specific focus on eliminating transmission of the virus from moms to their babies." It's possible Apple wants to steer clear of any topics that authorities in China might find sensitive. In December, Apple removed apps from The New York Times from its app store in China; it said it was complying with a request from authorities there. Last year, Apple itself faced censorship in China when authorities closed down its iBooks store and iTunes Movies there. China has fueled massive growth for Apple, but times have been more difficult lately. Apple was the No. 4 smartphone vendor by shipments in mainland China in the fourth quarter, after local players Oppo, Huawei and Vivo, according to IDC, which noted that 2016 was the first time Apple saw a year-on-year decline in mainland China. Despite that, IDC says it "does not believe Chinese vendors have actually eaten away Apple's market share. Most Apple users are expected to be holding out for the new iPhone that will be launched this year, and that will help the brand to see a growth in 2017." Underlining Apple's commitment to China, the company's second-biggest market, Mr. Cook just visited the country, and Apple announced plans for two more research centers in China, in addition to two that were announced already.

By Rex Crum / March 22, 2017 at 10:38 AM It’s no secret that Apple has a track record of making hit products. The Mac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad, all of these have, at some point, been the standard-bearer for their particular industry. Apple still sells a crazy amount of stuff. But like any company, what it makes eventually reaches a saturation point and it needs to find something new to keep the business going. Finding hit products isn’t easy. Which is why Apple has pinned some of its hopes on the Apple Watch. However, Apple doesn’t disclose sales figures for the Apple Watch and thus, we are left to wonder just how well the gadget is selling. While the Apple Watch gets a good amount of attention, there is another product Apple makes that might also end up having a big impact on the company’s future. In fact, it could end up being more important than the Apple Watch: AirPods. That’s an argument put forth by analyst Doug Clinton, of Loup Ventures, a research firm that focuses on consumer technology, artificial intelligence and virtual reality technologies. Clinton is a co-founder of Loup, along with other former fellow Piper Jaffray analysts Andrew Murphy and Gene Munster, who is known for his longtime coverage of Apple at Piper Jaffray. Clinton said in research note that he believes AirPods will end up being a bigger product for Apple than the Apple Watch for several reasons, including: AirPods being “a natural extension of Siri,” Apple’s voice-command technology. “As voice assistants become capable of having deeper two-way conversations to convey more information to users, AirPods could replace a meaningful amount of interaction with the phone itself,” Clinton said. Medical data. Clinton noted that Apple recently filed a patent for more advanced earbuds that are capable of tracking data such as a person’s heart rate and temperature. Security. Clinton said NEC has created a technology that uses sound waves bouncing off a person’s ear canal to identify that individual. This “persistent or semi-persistent authentication” could be a main requirement of future augmented reality and artificial intelligence applications. Clinton said it will take some time for the importance of AirPods to surpass that of the Apple Watch, but by next year, he estimates that Apple will sell 20 million AirPods compared to 12 million Apple Watches. And by 2020, revenue from AirPods could surpass that of the Apple Watch as the anticipated health and security features “make AirPods a must have accessory that the Watch can’t match.” He does not mention that Apple took away the headphone jack from its new iPhones, which could be a factor in AirPods’ popularity.

Apple must know the issues but does not do enough to warn users. No ear buds stay comfortably in my ears anyway, and regular headphones are not convenient or fashionable enough to wear in public. A third option has no good designs yet. I would like to see better designs that use bone induction and “open ear/air” phones that stay in place while somehow not being ugly. I’ll stick with speakers and regular headphones at safer volumes. 57 and my hearing is much better than my peers. tjwolf Neither Airpods nor the regular earbuds “close off” the ear canal. So they’re already what you want when you say you want “open ear/air”. Brewdog There is one major problem about the Apple Watch the analysts never seem to mention. The market for it is limited to iPhone users because you need one for it to work. Not all iPhone users will buy the Watch, so you will never have more sales than that fraction of iPhone users. Not the way to go when you are trying for The Next Big Thing. AirPods don’t exactly have that same limitation, but if you don’t have a device with Siri, they just become very expensive Bluetooth earbuds. tjwolf You make no sense. If, as you argue, we have no idea how popular the Watch is, then how can you know whether bar is low? tjwolf As I posted in another forum, I see AirPods as the first wearable in Apple’s AR linked iPhone evolution. The next step will be glasses. And, unlike the ones we’ve seen from Google and a more recent headset called R-8 (forgot the startup that’s trying to sell them), Apple will not try and cram an entire computer into glasses – they’ll simply put enough in them to handle display output and camera input and receive/transmit those respectively from/to the iPhone using a low-energy protocol (e.g. Bluetooth 4.0). The iPhone handles the AR creation, the general networking, storage, etc. That’s the only way to make glasses people will actually want to wear.         Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Will AirPods end up being bigger for Apple than the Apple… Amazon ‘ripping consumers off’ by tricking them… Elon Musk unhappy with Trump’s NASA bill Sexual assault on Facebook Live: Girl, 15, allegedly… AT&T halts its advertising on YouTube over content…     Archives Archives Select Month March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital   About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2017 Bay Area News Group.

Apple designed the Safari Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari. Safari Technology Preview release 26 includes fixes and improvements for Web API, CSS, Rendering, Web Inspector, WebDriver, and WebCrypto. Today's update also includes a WebGPU prototype, accessible from the Experimental Features menu. The Safari Technology Preview update is available through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store to anyone who has downloaded the browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari Technology Preview website. Apple's aim with Safari Technology Preview is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. Safari Technology Preview can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.

At work we've intranet running on sharepoint and the latest versions of Safari runs very slow. I've installed Chrome and that one is as fast as Safari used to be. I've installed the developer preview of Safari but that one stalls too. I hoped I could give feedback on Safari to Apple, but for that you've to have a developer ID. Sometimes Apple can be so frustrating :confused: If it makes you happy, I've already reported it for you.

As of now, web graphics could go through APIs like WebGL, but with WebGPU the intent is to bring an API more similar to Metal/Vulkan/DX12 to the web interface. It'll be implemented as a cross platform abstraction layer for the underlying technologies like Vulkan, Metal and DX12, so a site using WebGPU would send Metal calls to the Mac, and DX12 or Vulkan calls to Windows, versus OpenGL calls using WebGL.

Progress: iOS 6, iOS 7, iOS 9 and iOS 10. Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Although it got off to a rocky start, Apple's iOS 10 software has been out for a full day now and the consensus seems to be that its many changes are for the better. But, just like every other time (remember when iOS 9 made your camera roll crazy, or iOS 8 had all your Apple devices ringing every time you got a phone call?), one of Apple's improvements has touched a nerve with users that want things to change but not too much. The new lock screen in iOS 10 is designed so you can turn on the display by simply picking up your device, and you'll see important information and notifications at a glance. If you want to actively use your phone you now press the home button, meaning the iconic 'slide to unlock' has been retired. Taken on its own the new way makes sense, and if you give it a chance you'll probably save some time by not having to open specific apps to get quick info all the time. Still, Apple has trained its long-term users to wake the screen with the power or home button and then swipe a digit across the screen to unlock. It's a motion many people perform unthinkingly a hundred times a day, and that kind of muscle memory is tough to overcome. How to go back to the old way Of course some people gave up swiping a long time ago. If you have a device with Touch ID and you're used to just resting your thumb or finger on the home button to unlock, there's some good news. Head to Settings > General > Accessibility > Home Button and you'll find an option to turn on 'Rest Finger to Open'. Now unlocking your phone with Touch ID works exactly how it did in iOS 9. If you don't have or don't like Touch ID then there's no way to go back, as iOS 10 has no option to return 'slide to unlock'. You'll need to wake the screen by hitting a button (or by raising the phone if you have a 6s or later and 'Raise to Wake' turned on), then you'll have to press the home button and enter your passcode. Benefits of the new way The main reason Apple has put a new roadblock in the way of opening the phone is because it wants to push the functionality of its shiny new lock screen. You now get chunky notifications on the lock screen that you can hard tap to interact with (for example to reply to a message or cancel an Uber), without needing to open the phone and go to a specific app. If you have an older phone with no 3D Touch you'll swipe left on the notification instead. From the lock screen you can also swipe left to take you straight to your camera, or swipe right to take you to the new customisable widgets screen, which you can set up to give you snippets of information from your apps at a glance. This is why 'slide to unlock' had to die. Finally, a light tap of the Touch ID when you're looking at your lock screen is now used to make sure it's you before you access any personal data. Of course if you reinstated 'Rest Finger to Open' as above you'll blast through to your home screen every time and won't be able to make use of any of these features. If you don't use Touch ID at all (and at this point it should be clear that Apple really, really wants you to), you'll once again be entering passcodes.

By Lucian Constantin Romania Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 22, 2017 10:05 AM PT Credit: Magdalena Petrova More like this Russian government agents among those charged for massive Yahoo hack Inside the Russian hack of Yahoo: How they did it A Look at the Worst Security Snafus of 2012 -- So Far Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key A group of hackers is threatening to wipe data from millions of Apple devices in two weeks if the company doesn’t pay them $150,000. The group, which calls itself Turkish Crime Family, claims to have login credentials for more than 627 million icloud.com, me.com and mac.com email addresses. These are email domains that Apple has allowed for users creating iCloud accounts over the years. Even though the Turkish Crime Family hasn't been in the media spotlight before, its members claim that they've been involved in selling stolen online databases in private circles for the past few years. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] The group said via email that it has had a database of about 519 million iCloud credentials for some time, but did not attempt to sell it until now. The interest for such accounts on the black market has been low due to security measures Apple has put in place in recent years, it said. Since announcing its plan to wipe devices associated with iCloud accounts, the group claimed that other hackers have stepped forward and shared additional account credentials with them, putting the current number it holds at over 627 million. According to the hackers, over 220 million of these credentials have been verified to work and provide access to iCloud accounts that don't have security measures like two-factor authentication turned on. This was determined by testing the credentials using automated scripts and a very large number of proxy servers to avoid getting banned by Apple, the hackers said. Initially the group asked Apple for the equivalent of $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum cryptocurrency. The ransom value has been raised to $150,000 and the group intends to increase it further if Apple doesn't pay in three days. News website Motherboard reported seeing alleged emails between the hackers and Apple in which a member of the company's security team said that the company does not plan to reward cybercriminals for breaking the law and that the communications have been archived and sent to the authorities. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the absence of payment, the group plans to launch an automated attack on April 7 that would log into iCloud accounts and wipe their contents and the devices associated with them. "We are doing this because we can and mainly to spread awareness for Karim Baratov and Kerem Albayrak, which both are being detained for the Yahoo hack and one of them is most probably facing heavy sentencing in America," a representative for the group said via email. "Kerem Albayrak on the other hand is being accused of listing the database for sale online." The representative said that the group's members are originally from Istanbul, Turkey, but that they now "rep" Green Lanes, an area in North London. Karim Baratov, a Canadian national, was indicted last week for allegedly hacking into email accounts at various email providers at the request of two officers from the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB. The same indictment accuses the two FSB officers and a Russian hacker for breaking into Yahoo's infrastructure and gaining access to over 500 million Yahoo accounts. The Turkish Crime Family's claims haven't been confirmed by Apple so far, but someone posted a video on YouTube showing some of the leaked credentials being used to access iCloud accounts. The group claims that the person who posted the video is not one of their members, but that he had access to one of the servers hosting their database, which is how he managed to get the credentials and record the video. The video shows usernames and passwords in plain text, even though Apple most likely doesn't store passwords in plain text in its database. This would be a very bad security practice and one that serious websites have avoided for many years. However, it is possible that these passwords were stolen as part of other breaches or cracked from stolen cryptographic hashes and then matched to iCloud accounts due to password reuse practices. Most passwords shown in the video are not complex enough to withstand brute-force attacks. If Apple does confirm the group's claims, it could force password resets for its entire iCloud user base just to be on the safe side. Until then, concerned users can change their passwords on their own and turn on the iCloud two-factor authentication feature.

Here's what you missed. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Mar 22, 2017 at 12:06PM As you might have heard, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just dropped some new products. The company, opting to announce the updates in a series of press releases on Tuesday, unveiled new versions of its iPhone and iPad, as well as a new app. Here's a quick overview of the products and what they mean for Apple's business. Special edition (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 While the most drastic update in terms of exterior appearance, Apple's new special addition (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 is essentially the same as the existing iPhone 7, except for its color and the exclusion of the base 64 GB storage tier. Like the jet black version of the iPhone 7, the new red iPhone is only available in 128 GB and 256 GB storage options. (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. As it does with all (PRODUCT)RED devices it has released over the 10 years it's participated in this initiative, Apple is contributing a portion of proceeds from sales of its special edition iPhone to the Global Fund, which is aimed at bringing "the world a step closer to an AIDS-free generation," according to the company.  Even after the donation to the Global Fund, this could serve as a slight catalyst for iPhone sales. In the past, the introduction of new iPhone colors has helped demand for the devices. Released about six months after the iPhone 7's launch, a new color could reinvigorate some consumer interest in the device. But since it's virtually the same phone as the iPhone 7, investors shouldn't expect any incremental sales to be very meaningful. In another update to the iPhone lineup, Apple also doubled the storage options for its lower-cost iPhone SE from 16 GB and 64 GB to 32 GB to 128 GB. An aggressively priced iPad Apple also introduced a cheaper 9.7-inch iPad. Replacing its iPad Air 2, the new tablet -- simply called "iPad" -- is equipped with an improved A9 processor (the iPad Air 2 sported Apple's A8X chip), a brighter Retina display, and a higher storage capacity for the base version (32 GB versus 16 GB for the iPad Air 2). But what's perhaps most surprising is the new iPad's aggressive pricing. The entry-level version of the tablet starts at $329, down from a $399 for the iPad Air 2. Combining its improved specs and its lower price, the new iPad offers significantly more value than the previous iPad Air 2 and it has the potential to help give iPad sales a boost. Apple Clips app. Image source: Apple. Clips: An expressive photo and video app In a surprise move, Apple also announced an entirely new app called Clips. The video app helps users quickly make expressive videos on iPhone and iPad. The app is designed to create media well suited for social apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. In addition to these updates, it also launched some new accessories, including new Apple Watch band designs and new silicone and leather iPhone 7 case colors. Overall, none of Apple's updates were enough to substantially move the needle. But they should at least help the company create some incremental interest as the tech giant readies more extensive product updates in the future. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

The tech giant's shares have been tracking the Nasdaq's record highs — a good sign, according to McClellan. "When you see a disagreement between [Apple and the Nasdaq], you should look at what Apple's chart is saying," he said. "If there were a lower high in Apple and a higher high in the [Nasdaq 100], that's a big sign of trouble. We're not seeing that right now," he said. Still, investors are concerned about what a correction means for the Nasdaq since Apple is about 4 percent of the index, the editor of The McClellan Market Report said. For now, all signs point to an ordinary "garden variety" correction. "We're not seeing the sort of warning from Apple ... that would tell us big trouble was coming," he said.

The hackers who call themselves 'Turkish Crime Family' are demanding $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum, or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards. "I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing," one of the hackers told Motherboard. Screenshots of alleged messages between the group and Apple's security team were shared with the site, as was access to an email account purportedly used to communicate with Apple. The emails appear to show Apple asking for evidence of the hack. "Are you willing to share a sample of the data set?" The hackers also uploaded a video that allegedly shows them logging into stolen accounts including an elderly woman's iCloud account which contained backed-up photos and the ability to remotely wipe her device. The hackers claim Apple responded to the video saying, "We firstly kindly request you to remove the video that you have uploaded on your YouTube channel as it's seeking unwanted attention, second of all we would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law." Apple reportedly said archived communications with the hacker would be sent to the authorities. Now the group is threatening to reset a number of iCloud accounts and remotely wipe devices on April 7th, unless Apple meets their demand. In one email the hackers claim they have access to over 300 million accounts but another hacker claimed they had 559 million accounts. Motherboard was not able to verify this claim and they were not provided with access to any stolen accounts. While hackers have gained access to high profile iCloud accounts in the past, 300 - 559 million breached accounts would seem to demand a much higher ransom. Apple didn't respond to requests for comment. Read More Follow iClarified Comments (17) Add Comment iMillenial - 4 hours ago If they can pull this off, I will lick my own salty balls.

The group, which calls itself Turkish Crime Family, claims to have login credentials for more than 627 million icloud.com, me.com and mac.com email addresses. These are email domains that Apple has allowed for users creating iCloud accounts over the years. Even though the Turkish Crime Family hasn't been in the media spotlight before, its members claim that they've been involved in selling stolen online databases in private circles for the past few years. The group said via email that it has had a database of about 519 million iCloud credentials for some time, but did not attempt to sell it until now. The interest for such accounts on the black market has been low due to security measures Apple has put in place in recent years, it said. Since announcing its plan to wipe devices associated with iCloud accounts, the group claimed that other hackers have stepped forward and shared additional account credentials with them, putting the current number it holds at over 627 million. According to the hackers, over 220 million of these credentials have been verified to work and provide access to iCloud accounts that don't have security measures like two-factor authentication turned on. This was determined by testing the credentials using automated scripts and a very large number of proxy servers to avoid getting banned by Apple, the hackers said. Initially the group asked Apple for the equivalent of $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum cryptocurrency. The ransom value has been raised to $150,000 and the group intends to increase it further if Apple doesn't pay in three days. News website Motherboard reported seeing alleged emails between the hackers and Apple in which a member of the company's security team said that the company does not plan to reward cybercriminals for breaking the law and that the communications have been archived and sent to the authorities. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the absence of payment, the group plans to launch an automated attack on April 7 that would log into iCloud accounts and wipe their contents and the devices associated with them. "We are doing this because we can and mainly to spread awareness for Karim Baratov and Kerem Albayrak, which both are being detained for the Yahoo hack and one of them is most probably facing heavy sentencing in America," a representative for the group said via email. "Kerem Albayrak on the other hand is being accused of listing the database for sale online." The representative said that the group's members are originally from Istanbul, Turkey, but that they now "rep" Green Lanes, an area in North London. Karim Baratov, a Canadian national, was indicted last week for allegedly hacking into email accounts at various email providers at the request of two officers from the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB. The same indictment accuses the two FSB officers and a Russian hacker for breaking into Yahoo's infrastructure and gaining access to over 500 million Yahoo accounts. The Turkish Crime Family's claims haven't been confirmed by Apple so far, but someone posted a video on YouTube showing some of the leaked credentials being used to access iCloud accounts. The group claims that the person who posted the video is not one of their members, but that he had access to one of the servers hosting their database, which is how he managed to get the credentials and record the video. The video shows usernames and passwords in plain text, even though Apple most likely doesn't store passwords in plain text in its database. This would be a very bad security practice and one that serious websites have avoided for many years. However, it is possible that these passwords were stolen as part of other breaches or cracked from stolen cryptographic hashes and then matched to iCloud accounts due to password reuse practices. Most passwords shown in the video are not complex enough to withstand brute-force attacks. If Apple does confirm the group's claims, it could force password resets for its entire iCloud user base just to be on the safe side. Until then, concerned users can change their passwords on their own and turn on the iCloud two-factor authentication feature. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Mar 22, 2017 at 10:40AM For several months, rumors about potential new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad models have circulated widely. Most of the pundits expected Apple to unveil these new models at a press event sometime in March. Thus, many Apple-watchers were surprised to see two-thirds of the month go by without any announcement from the tech giant about a product event. The answer to this little mystery became clear this week. Apple made several product announcements on Tuesday, including launching a new (and cheaper) 9.7-inch iPad model. However, it did so without holding any kind of launch event. A new iPad is arriving soon Apple's newest iPad model -- which the company is simply calling "iPad" -- is essentially a minor upgrade of the iPad Air 2. Apple first released the iPad Air 2 in late 2014, and for the past year it has functioned as Apple's entry-level full-size iPad, with a starting price of $399. The new model will keep the popular 9.7-inch screen size. It offers a somewhat more powerful processor -- the A9 -- compared with the iPad Air 2's A8X chip. That said, this is still a full generation behind the speedy A10 processor found in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. By and large, the new iPad doesn't have major technical improvements over the iPad Air 2. The iPad family is getting a new middle member. Image source: Apple. Instead, Apple is becoming more aggressive on pricing. The new iPad will have a starting price of just $329. The iPad Air 2 was occasionally available at a lower price -- some stores offered the 32GB Wi-Fi model for less than $300 on Black Friday last year -- but Apple never reduced its suggested retail price below $399. The lower price and modest performance upgrades may finally persuade some price-sensitive customers to replace their aging iPads. The new model will be available to order on Friday, March 24. It should start reaching customers' hands (in the U.S. and more than 20 international markets) next week. Apple makes some other tweaks In addition to launching the new 9.7-inch iPad, Apple made several other announcements on Tuesday. First, Apple is dropping the 32GB option for the iPad Mini 4 but reducing the price of the 128GB version by $100. As a result, the iPad Mini 4 still has a starting price of $399, but that now includes four times as much storage as before. In a similar vein, Apple is doubling the storage at all price points for the iPhone SE. The entry-level $399 version will now have 32GB of storage (up from 16GB) while the $499 variant will have 128GB of storage (up from 64GB). Apple also introduced a new red version of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as part of its long-standing partnership with (RED), an AIDS-fighting organization. Like the jet-black versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the new PRODUCT(RED) Special Edition won't have the lower-tier 32GB storage option, so the starting price will be $749. Lastly, Apple unveiled some new software on Tuesday. It has created a new app called Clips that's designed to make it easy to create videos on an iPhone or iPad. Apple also released versions of its Swift Playgrounds coding app in five new (and important) languages: simplified Chinese, French, German, Japanese, and Latin-American Spanish. New iPad Pro models still needed Considering what Apple actually announced on Tuesday, it's not surprising that it chose to skip holding a launch event. Every Apple "special event" stimulates a lot of interest, and none of this week's announcements were significant enough to justify that kind of hype. If nothing else, Apple would have needed to roll out new iPad Pros to justify hosting a special event this month. However, either because of supply limitations or other business considerations, the new iPad Pro models have apparently been delayed until May or June. (That lines up -- roughly speaking -- with Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which runs June 5-9 this year.) The next-generation iPad Pro tablets may not be ready until as late as June. Image source: Apple. While the new, lower-priced iPad could lead to better unit sales results for the iPad lineup, it will also drive the next downward move in the iPad average selling price. As a result, it isn't likely to spark a return to meaningful revenue growth for the iPad product line. To get iPad revenue growing again, Apple needs to launch high-end models with compelling features that consumers are willing to pay a premium for. Investors can only hope the next-generation iPad Pro models will be equal to that task. However, based on the iPad's recent track record, investors shouldn't hold their breath.

Let’s Talk iOS 179: Not just a virtual or augmented reality The top stories of the week on iDB The best smart scales   skip to main content skip to main menu     Hackers tying to extort Apple over dubious claims, threatening to remotely wipe iOS devices By Christian Zibreg, Mar 22, 2017 Tweet 13 Comments As reported Tuesday by Motherboard, hackers that go under the code-name “Turkish Crime Family” have allegedly obtained, through unknown means, access to hundreds of millions of Apple email accounts, including iCloud inboxes with email addresses on @icloud and @me domains. They’re threatening to remotely wipe iOS devices unless Apple pays a laughable ransom. It’s notable that iCloud has never been hacked into directly and other reasons make this story hard to swallow. They’re demanding that Apple pay a ransom by April 7 in the form of: Either $75,000 in cryptocurrencies Bitcoin or Ethereum; Or $100,000 in iTunes Gift Cards. If the Cupertino company does not comply with the request, the group says it’s going to reset the accounts and effectively wipe all data on the associated Apple devices. Trying to apply pressure from the media to coerce payment from Apple, one of the hackers said: “I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing.” The group originally shared a YouTube video allegedly proving they did hack into an elderly woman’s iCloud account. The video also demonstrated the ability to remotely wipe the devices, which is trivial when you have access to the underlying Apple IDs. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube It was subsequently removed after a member of Apple’s security team turned down the ransom and requested that the video be taken offline. Here’s what an unnamed member of Apple’s security team apparently wrote back to the hackers a week ago: We firstly kindly request you to remove the video that you have uploaded on your YouTube channel as it’s seeking unwanted attention. Second of all, we would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law. The alleged Apple team member warned the group that archived communications with them will be sent to the authorities. The Cupertino company had not publicly commented on the situation at the time of this writing, its usual modus operandi. This is a laughable story, in my personal opinion. Firstly, there are the inconsistencies. The hackers originally said they held 300 million accounts for ransom. The figure later changed to 559 million accounts. Importantly, they did not provide Motherboard with a data cache of the supposedly stolen iCloud accounts to verify the claims. The only piece of evidence they provided came in the form of alleged screenshots (images are easily faked, mind you) of the purported emails between the group and members of Apple’s security team. “Motherboard only saw a screenshot of this message, and not the original,” states the article. For what it’s worth, the group did gave Motherboard temporary access to an email account allegedly used for communicating with Apple as proof. The same email account was featured in the now-removed YouTube video. If you had access to 300 million iCloud accounts, would you request only $75,000? It’s safe to assume that some of the claimed accounts would have Apple’s two-factor authentication feature turned on. The problem is, Apple’s two-factor authentication servers have never been hacked directly on a mass scale. Leaks of compromising photos of celebrities from iCloud accounts? That was just smart social engineering. I mean, you look at me with a straight face and tell me they compromised hundreds of millions of iCloud accounts belonging to unknown users via social engineering alone. The laughable request for iTunes Gift Cards is also notable here. You don’t just issue serious threat like this and ask for a small amount of money while potentially giving Apple ample time to fix any vulnerabilities in iCloud systems. If I were “Turkish Crime Family,” I’d first take ten million accounts offline so that Apple took me seriously before trying to extort the company, not for a paltry $75,000 but for a seven-figure sum. On the other hand, the reason they asked for a small amount of money could be hope that Apple would pay quickly and quietly. TUTORIAL: How to protect your Apple ID with Two-Factor Authentication As Seb commented, start asking for millions and you run the risk of Apple looking more deeply into it, potentially contacting the FBI (case in point: Apple’s aggressive reaction to the stolen iPhone 4 prototype in 2010). I’m not sure why Motherboard deemed this newsworthy and reliable enough to publish, but I’m not buying this story at all. Are you? And should Apple cave in and pay, just in case?

If you start asking for millions, then you have the risk of Apple looking more deeply into it, contacting FBI, etc. Basically, lots of time and energy going into this. If you ask for a small amount, you’re hoping Apple will say “let’s pay quick and keep this quiet.” Now asking for $100k worth of iTunes gift card is just plain ridiculous. Likeliness these hackers really have something: low. Likeliness they’re trying to take Apple for a ride: pretty high.

If they can prove that they can hack into Apple, why do they need the money to buy stuff from Apple? I guess they could sell the gift cards, but wouldn’t Apple just deactivate the gift cards that they give to them? Also if these hackers are legitimate, I can see a reason why the number of accounts have changed : over time they have the potential to hack into more accounts but why not just hold the ransom at 300 million ? It still does not add up. Digitalfeind iTunes gift cards can be sold. Whether digital or physical. Many99 I find it funny on how he says it “I just want my money” nova12 I’m guessing 90% of iDB is too young to know what I’m talking about when I say I WANT MY TWO DOLLARS. Iskren Donev I know this would never happen, but I would love it if Apple decided to screw these guys over – give them the gift cards, wait until some cards are redeemed, then block all cards and finally use the redeemed cards to track the “crime family” down. Digitalfeind They want gift cards to sell. Buying from iTunes or the AppStore is nothing. $100,000 worth of gift cards can be sold for around $80,000. Iskren Donev I assume that they would sell them off. However Apple can still follow the thread from the end user who activates the gift card to the seller, to their seller and so on until they get to the hackers. Michael Okay iCloud was never hacked but people are stupid enough to open emails containing keyloggers, so this is how they got the accounts Stephen Hedger if you have 300 million accounts then why not buy apps with them or music! its a scare tactic that apple are laughing at. If they genuinely had this “power” then they would have wiped 1 million and said look what we can do. That would cause concern. why interests me is why go to apple? you could sell all that info to some dodgy chinese or russian hacking gang and get millions! Ricky Williams I wouldn’t quickly dismiss that they have access to those accounts for the simple reason that there are a lot of gullible, I would use another word, users out there. Emails asking for Apple ID and password are the norm and with the large number of Apple users. Well it is possible to find enough people silly enough to click the link and enter their credentials. The rest of the story though throws a lot of shade. It gives Apple ample time to do a reset on all iCloud accounts “for the security of our users”.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology What we’ll likely see at Samsung’s Galaxy S8 launch event Emily Ferron 4 pictures Samsung is expected to reveal the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus on March 29. Here's what we expect to see from the new flagships.View gallery - 4 images Samsung normally unveils its Galaxy smartphone flagships at the Mobile World Congress, but this year, the Korean technology giant has opted for an Apple-style standalone reveal event instead. Here's what we (think we) know so far about the Unpacked event on March 29 that will show off two new flagships, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus. Since Samsung is doing damage control from the ill-fated Note 7, and Apple is expected to go big with this year's 10th anniversary iPhone, it looks like the S8 series will have some ambitious specs and features. We also think we'll get more information about the latest iteration of the Samsung Gear VR mobile virtual reality headset. Keep in mind that these expectations are based on leaks and rumors. While they come from sources with solid track records (and have combined to paint a consistent picture), very little of the following information has been confirmed by Samsung. A big, nearly bezel-free display The Galaxy S8's crowning feature will be a large Super AMOLED display that covers most of the front side of the device. Like the S7 edge, which had curved edges, the S8 should have rounded edges that curve around the front edges of the phone. Signs point to two sizes – one with a 5.8-inch display (the Galaxy S8), and one with a 6.2-inch display (the Galaxy S8 Plus). Both should have 18:9 aspect ratios (more oblong than the standard 16:9), like the LG G6. Sick of Ads? Join more than 500 New Atlas Plus subscribers who read our newsletter and website without ads. It's just US$19 a year.More Information Last year's Galaxy S7 has a flat front, while the larger S7 edge has rounded edges and a curved display(Credit: Will Shanklin/New Atlas) With the display stretching nearly from edge to edge, it makes sense that there will be fewer physical buttons. The home, back and app buttons will be onscreen at the bottom of the display; one rumor pointed to the navigation bar (but not necessarily the entire screen) having pressure sensitivity similar to Apple's 3D Touch technology, which differentiates your navigation based on how long and hard you tap the screen. Earlier indications suggested that the fingerprint sensor would be built into the onscreen home button, but it appears things did not pan out that way. The latest leaks show a back-mounted fingerprint sensor. On the inside: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, 4 GB of RAM It should be no surprise that the US version of the S8 series will contain Qualcomm's newest mobile processor, the Snapdragon 835. After all, Samsung helped develop the new chips' 10-nanometer standard, which is smaller and lighter than previous processors and it also follows the trend established in nearly every American-variant Galaxy flagship. However, Samsung should still continue to use its own Exynos series of processors as well. In previous years, big markets like the US and Japan received Qualcomm-branded chips, while other markets received Exynos processors. There seems to be an international variance on the amount of RAM included as well. Most of the devices will include 4 GB of RAM, but it looks China will see a 6 GB option. A virtual assistant named Bixby Samsung has confirmed that the S8 will receive a new and improved virtual assistant distinguished from the unimpressive S Voice protocol it has used in the past. The assistant's name is "Bixby" – a single word eponym to match the likes of Siri, Alexa or Cortana. Some rumors indicate that Bixby could have some extra features compared to other virtual assistants, based on European trademarks for features like "Bixby Reminder," "Bixby Pay" and "Bixby Vision." Injong Rhee, Samsung's head of R&D, confirmed that the Galaxy S8 will have a Bixby-activating side button for easy access. Bixby's creators also claim that it is better at conversing with you (in natural, unrehearsed language) than competing assistants. They imagine a future where Bixby is integrated into all Samsung products, citing that voice control is an impending reality for not only phones, but all smart home accessories. Considering that Google is rolling out Google Assistant to eligible Marshmallow and Nougat-running Androids, we're also unsure exactly how the competing voice control ecosystem will be presented in the new Samsung phones. Will S8 users have access to both Google Assistant and Bixby? We'll have to wait to March 29 to learn more, and get our hands on the phones to test Samsung's claims for ourselves. Improvement in video recording, selfies Cameras are a major differentiator between smartphones, and premium flagships are particularly competitive. The S8 camera is shaping up to have a 12 MP rear camera, which is less than some other flagships, but resolution alone does not a quality camera make. It is also expected to have improved video features, such as the capability of taking video at a rate of 1000 frames per second. The front camera will be upped to 8 MP, and will have autofocus for quicker, sharper selfies. Advanced biometric sensing In addition to the back-mounted fingerprint sensor, the S8 series is expected to have the Note 7's iris scanning capabilities as well as face detection, though it remains to be seen exactly which features will incorporate biometric-driven shortcuts. They could be used to unlock the phone, for example, but some sources indicate that facial recognition could be used to approve mobile payments as well. In our time with the Galaxy Note 7, before it was recalled, we found the iris scanning to be little more than a tech demo or niche use case, as it was much less convenient to aim the camera at your face (and hope you aren't outdoors, where it didn't work well) than to simply rest your finger on a sensor. Price and release date for the new Gear VR Samsung has incrementally improved its Gear VR headset each year, alongside its mobile flagships. At the Mobile World Congress, the company announced it would add a wand-like controller similar to that of the Google Daydream. We hope that Samsung will confirm a price and release date for the mobile VR headset alongside the S8 series unveiling. We'll be on the ground in NYC next week to see if Samsung has any surprises left after a bevy of leaks. To stoke your excitement, the event teaser is below.

Apple's (AAPL) wireless earbuds will be a more important product to the company than its smartwatch, a venture capital firm said in a report Wednesday. Apple's AirPods will be a bigger deal than the Apple Watch because they are a more natural extension of the iPhone, Douglas Clinton, a managing partner with venture capital firm Loup Ventures, said in a report. "After using AirPods for the past month, the Loup Ventures team is addicted," Clinton said. "We think AirPods are going to be a bigger product for Apple than the Watch." AirPods are designed to be more than just wireless earbuds for listening to music streamed from the iPhone or making calls, he notes. They provide a simpler, more natural way to connect with Apple's voice assistant app Siri. "We view AirPods as a natural extension of Siri that will encourage people to rely more on the voice assistant," he said. "By contrast, using Siri on the Apple Watch is less natural because it requires you to hold it up to your face. Additionally, the (watch) screen is so small that interaction with it and information conveyed by it is not that much richer than an AI (artificial intelligence) voice-based interface." Clinton described AirPods as an AI-first product built for Siri. Siri competes with Amazon.com's (AMZN) Alexa, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Assistant, Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana and other virtual digital assistants. IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 84, meaning it has outperformed 84% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup. Apple's AirPods went on sale Dec. 13. In addition to a better way to use Siri, AirPods could soon track medical data and provide biometric identification, Clinton said. "The core feature of Apple Watch is fitness tracking including step tracking and heart rate monitoring; however, we believe the ear offers similar, if not better, opportunity to track health data," he said. AirPods also could replace the Touch ID fingerprint security app on iPhones, Clinton said. He noted that Japanese IT firm NEC has developed technology that can verify identity by bouncing sound waves off the ear canal. "One advantage of this approach is persistent or semi-persistent authentication vs. a point authentication via fingerprint," Clinton said. "We believe the ear-based biometric approach will be a fundamental requirement for AR (augmented reality) and AI interfaces of the future where there won't be a convenient place to read a fingerprint or enter a password." He expects Apple to sell about 8 million to 10 million AirPods in calendar 2017, compared with 10 million Apple Watch units. Next year, he forecasts Apple selling over 20 million AirPods vs. 12 million Apple smartwatches. "Given the higher ASP (average selling price) on Apple Watch of around $450, vs. $159 (for AirPods), the company will have to sell about three times as many AirPods as Watches for revenue to be roughly equivalent. We believe this could happen by 2020 as the health and security features make AirPods a must-have accessory that the Watch can't match." Apple stock rose 1.1% to 141.42 on the stock market today, retaking a 141.12 buy point It hit a record high of 142.80 on Tuesday.

Apple Clips makes viral video editing simple. (Apple Images) (Apple Image) Could this be a plot twist in Act Three? While we were all watching Facebook’s attempts to take on newly-public Snapchat, Apple was building its own app that could challenge the social media darling, albeit in a more roundabout way. Today, Apple announced the coming of Clips, an app that leverages the company’s voice recognition and video editing smarts to make it easy for users to create shareable little videos. And although the app doesn’t directly compete with Snapchat, it could help bolster the attempts of Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram to compete with the ephemeral chat app. Clips allows users to combine video snippets, photos, and music to create content tailor-made for social networks and communication tools, like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Vimeo, and of course, Apple Messages. Like Snapchat, users can add filters, effects, emojis, and stickers. (Apple Image) But the most novel and interesting thing about Clips is a feature called Live Titles. It uses speech-to-text technology to create animated captions when a user speaks while recording in the app. The captions sync with the recording and appear as the subject of the video speaks each word. If for example, you wanted to make a video demonstrating how to make a grilled cheese, you could narrate the steps and have them display on as animated captions while showing off your chef skills. These animated captions aren’t new — you’ll often see them on videos from viral content producers like BuzzFeed — but Clips allows ordinary people to create similar content without elaborate editing. Animated captions are particularly useful for getting engagement on Facebook or Instagram, where users often scroll through their timeline without playing the sound on videos. The app also includes a library of music clips that automatically adjust to fit the length of a video when added. In short, the app is perfect for amateur YouTube or Instagram stars. The Clips announcement is part of a news dump from Apple today that includes dropping the price of its 9.7 inch iPad to $329, updating the tablet’s processor and Retina display, and rolling out new crimson-colored iPhones. The special edition red iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is part of a 10-year partnership between Apple and (RED), a non-profit dedicated to fighting the spread of AIDS. The red phones are available March 24 starting at $749 but it’s not clear how much of the proceeds will go toward AIDS research. As for Clips, it will be available on iOS for free beginning in April. The app is compatible with the iPhone 5s and later models, the upgraded iPad, and all iPad Air and iPad Pro models.

In fact, now it's more expensive to buy an Apple tablet.

(AAPL) Gets the Edge With Another Galaxy S8 Leak Recent Posts: AMD Confirms It: Ryzen CPUs Are Locking Up PCs The New Apple Inc. iPad Strategy Is Sneakier Than You Think Apple Inc. Launches New Red iPhone 7, New iPad View All Posts Yesterday, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a new iPad — called simply “iPad” — that replaces the iPad Air 2 in its line-up. On the surface, it sounds like a solid upgrade, with a faster CPU than the aging Air 2 and a $70 price drop. Source: Apple Look deeper, though, and AAPL’s consumer tablet strategy is a little more calculating than “faster and cheaper.” New iPad is Faster Than iPad Air 2, But … Apple’s aging iPad Air 2 was released in 2014 and powered by the A8X chip. While blazing fast at the time of its release, it’s getting a little pokey now, especially with processor-intensive apps like games. The new iPad that Apple announced on March 21 is equipped with the A9 CPU, which first showed up in the iPhone 6S in 2015. According to AAPL, the A9 represented a significant 70% processing boost and 90% graphics improvement over its previous generation chip. So the iPad should see a considerable performance improvement over the iPad Air 2 it replaces. However, a closer look at the specs show that the new iPad is actually thicker and heavier than the model it replaces. Considering the big deal that Apple typically makes about its tablets getting thinner with every generation, an upgrade that means going from 6.1mm thick and 0.96 pounds to 7.5mm thick and 1.03 pounds might be off-putting. Especially for those consumers who have upgraded every year to ensure they have the best iPad, watching each new purchase get progressively thinner and lighter. More problematic than the size is the display. The new iPad has a high resolution Retina display, but it loses the lamination and anti-reflective coating the iPad Air 2 featured. This is a step backward and as The Verge points out, for those who use a tablet primarily to read or watch movies, the old iPad Air 2 with its superior display is going to offer a better user experience. New iPad is Cheaper Than iPad Air 2, But… Competitors like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have hammered at consumer tablet prices. Apple is setting the entry price for its full-sized, new iPad at $329. That’s considerably less than the $399 iPad Air 2 it replaces, although still pretty far from Amazon’s $49.99 Fire Tablet. However, the new iPad actually has the effect of raising the minimum amount needed to buy a new iPad from Apple. How does this math work?

That’s the threat being laid down by a hacker or hackers who claim to have access to as many as 300 million iCloud and Apple email accounts. The hackers, who call themselves “Turkish Crime Family,” want Apple to pay a ransom of $75,000 to $100,000 in exchange for not deleting the contents of the accounts. “I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing,” one of the hackers told Motherboard, the Vice Media online magazine. So far, Apple has told the hackers to take a hike — telling them in an email seen by Motherboard that the Cupertino, Calif., company does not “reward cyber criminals for breaking the law.” The hackers are threatening to hit delete on April 7. The group doesn’t want the ransom in good old American greenbacks — perhaps knowing it would be too easy to trace. They want either $75,000 in bitcoin or ethereum, another increasingly popular crypto-currency, or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards. To prove they actually could carry out such a hack, the group uploaded a YouTube video of them allegedly logging into some of the stolen accounts, Motherboard reported. The hacker appears to access an elderly woman’s iCloud account, which includes backed-up photos, and the ability to remotely wipe the device. Apple did not reply to multiple attempts by Motherboard to get comment.

Its name is Clips and it features a unique design for combining video clips, photos and music into great-looking videos. Now the final video you can share it with your friend on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. Also you can send it through the Messages app. But, what Clips offers to the users? Apple Clips lets users create “multi-clip videos on iPhone or iPad without timelines, tracks or complicated editing tools”. To use it you just touch and hold a single button to shoot live video and photos, or add them from the Photo Library. Then magic happens! You can add artistic filters, speech bubbles, shapes or emoji. Also you can add full-screen posters with animated backgrounds and customizable text. And you can put music to your video. In addition Clips introduce Live Titles where users can add animated captions and titles using just their voice. The captions are generated automatically as you speak, and appear on screen perfectly synced with the user’s voice. Live Titles support 36 different languages. And the most important aspect of Clips is the fact that you can share your videos on the most popular social media platforms. Also when you share your content with friends in Messages, Clips can suggest who to share with based on the people who appear in the video, and the people a user shares with most often. Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Apps Product Marketing, said about the app: “Clips gives iPhone and iPad users a new way to express themselves through video, and it’s incredibly easy to use.” “The effects, filters and amazing new Live Titles we’ve designed for Clips let anyone make great-looking, easily sharable videos with just a few taps.” If you have an iOS device and you want to try out Apple’s new app you have to wait until the beginning of April. It will available for free on the App Store. It will compatible with iPhone 5s and later, the new 9.7-inch iPad, all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, iPad mini 2 and later, and iPod touch 6th generation. Also the devices must be running iOS 10.3. So what do you think? Does Apple created a Snapchat-like app or the company wanted to create an application to make our videos more colorful and fun?

New iPad (2017) vs iPad Pro 9.7-inch: What's the difference? by Sean Keach 22 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments New iPad 2017 vs iPad Pro 2016: Apple isn’t shy about launching 9.7-inch tablets, but which of its latest slates is the best? Apple dropped a surprise announcement on us in March, revealing a brand new 9.7-inch iPad as its first major product launch of the year. The tablet is the effective successor to the iPad Air 2, but it's arguably facing more competition from Apple's existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Both tablets are slick and powerful, but which one is right for you? I've rounded up the key differences between the two devices, so you can work out how you want to spend your money. In this article, I’ll answer the following questions: How do the designs differ? How do the new iPad and iPad Pro specs compare? Which tablet is better value for money? Should you buy the new iPad or the iPad Pro?Alternatively, scroll down to the bottom of this page for a summarised version of this article. New iPad 2017 Related: iPad Pro 2 New iPad (2017) vs 9.7-inch iPad Pro Design: What’s the difference? The good news is that both devices look largely identical, with the same approximate form factor, and Apple’s unmistakeable aluminium unibody iPad aesthetic. All the usual buttons (Touch ID, volume controls etc.) don the front and sides, and there’s a camera on the front and back of both tablets. The key differences are minor. For instance, the new iPad is marginally heavier than the iPad Pro, weighing in at 469 grams (or 478g for cellular), compared to the iPad Pro’s 437 grams (or 444g for cellular). iPad Pro The new iPad is also 1.4mm thicker than the iPad Pro, which may be down to the larger battery. The screen panel on the new iPad is also slightly different, as it doesn’t have anti-reflective coating, nor does it support a wide colour gamut. The new iPad’s display also lacks True Tone support – that’s the feature that dynamically adjusts your screen’s colour balance based on data from the ambient light sensor. We will know more about what sort of difference this makes when we review the new iPad. It's also worth noting that the iPad Pro has a solid line-up of accessories, including the Apple Pencil (£99) and the Smart Keyboard (£149), which connects through the Smart Connector – a feature not included in the new iPad. If you're looking for a tablet to replace that old laptop, the iPad Pro is the better pick. New iPad (2017) vs 9.7-inch iPad Pro Specs: Which tablet is the most powerful? Both tablets are on fairly equal footing when it comes to the display; they use the same(-ish) 9.7-inch panel with an identical screen resolution of 2,048 x 1,536 pixels. That works out at a respectable 264ppi, and should offer a crisp, clear image at normal viewing distances. But when it comes to raw specs, the new iPad starts to fall behind. For instance, the new iPad uses a slower Apple A9 chip than the Apple A9X chip found in the iPad Pro. The A9X is an evolution of the iPhone 6S’s A9 processor, and runs at a faster 2.16-2.26GHz clock speed (compared to the A9’s 1.85GHz). The A9X chip also features a more powerful 12-core variant of the PowerVR Series7XT GT7600 GPU, which means you'll get better performance while gaming from the iPad Pro. New iPad 2017 The camera setup on the new iPad is also far less impressive than what we’ve seen from the iPad Pro. For a start, you’re getting a smaller 8-megapixel image resolution from the main, rear-mounted camera on the new iPad, while the iPad Pro gets a higher-resolution 12-megapixel camera. It’s important to note that this simply means the iPad Pro takes bigger pictures, but not necessarily better pictures. Where the real difference lies is in the aperture; the iPad Pro uses a wide f/2.2 aperture for the main camera, which trumps the f/2.4 aperture on the new iPad’s camera. Aperture describes the size of hole that allows light into your lens; the lower the number, the bigger the hole, and thus more light reaching your lens. Having a wider aperture should make the iPad Pro more versatile than the new iPad in terms of photography. Still, both these apertures are narrow when compared to high-end phones. It’s a similar story with the secondary camera – what Apple calls the ‘FaceTime’ selfie cam. The new iPad offers a dinky 1.2-megapixel image and an aperture of f/2.2, compared to the 5-megapixel (f/2.2) shooter on the iPad Pro. This resolution disparity means your selfies and video calling will be much more limited in terms of the maximum detail possible on the new iPad. Still, 1.2-megapixels is enough to get video calling done, so don’t let this put you off buying a new iPad – the iPad Air 2 has the same setup, for reference. iPad Pro There’s not much else in the way of difference between the devices. Although the new iPad has a slightly larger battery, it offers the same 10-hour battery life as the iPad Pro. And both tablets feature Touch ID fingerprint sensors, Lightning ports, and models with optional cellular connectivity. The only other real difference is that while the new iPad only comes in 32GB and 128GB variants, there’s an additional 256GB model with the iPad Pro. For a full spec comparison, check out the table below: New iPad (2017) iPad Pro (2016) Screen 9.7 inches 9.7 inches Display Resolution 2,048 x 1,536 pixels (264ppi) 2,048 x 1,536 pixels (264ppi) Dimensions 240 x 169.5 x 7.5mm 240 x 169.5 x 6.1mm Weight 469 / 478 grams 437 / 444 grams Chipset Apple A9 Apple A9X RAM TBC 2GB Storage 32GB / 128GB 32GB / 128GB / 256GB Primary Camera 8 megapixels, f/2.4 12 megapixels, f/2.2 Secondary Camera 1.2 megapixels, f/2.2 5 megapixels, f/2.2 Connectivity Wi-Fi (LTE optional) Wi-Fi (LTE optional) Charging Cable Lightning Lightning Fingerprint Scanner Touch ID Touch ID Battery 32.4Wh (10-hour life) 27.9WH (10-hour life) Colours Space Grey, Silver, Gold Space Grey, Silver, Gold, Rose Gold Related: Best tablets New iPad (2017) vs 9.7-inch iPad Pro Price: Which tablet is better value for money? So, is the new iPad good value for money when compared against the similarly-sized iPad Pro? Well, the new iPad will retail from a budget-friendly £339/$329, while the iPad Pro costs a far more hefty £549/$599. So if you have a hard budget of £400 or less then there’s only one real choice. New iPad 2017 However, it’s clear that the new iPad isn’t as hardware-capable as the iPad Pro when it comes to the screen, the processor performance, or the camera, which may put off those looking for the bleeding edge of specs. Regarding value, it’s hard to justify spending £500+ on a tablet, so you’ll really only want to be picking up the Pro model if you’re going to be using it all the time. The iPad Pro range is intended for people who want to get work done, while the new iPad is almost certainly being targeted at people who just want a tablet for the occasional Netflix binge on a train. We know that the iPad Pro is a good tablet, and the new iPad is probably going to be decent enough too, considering it’s using tried-and-tested components and software. So rather than thinking “which is better value?”, ask yourself if you’re willing to spend an extra £200 for the improvements that the iPad Pro offers. iPad Pro New iPad (2017) vs 9.7-inch iPad Pro Summary: What’s the difference? Here’s a brief overview of the key differences between the new iPad (2017) and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Design: Both iPads look largely the same, although the new iPad is marginally thicker and heavier. It also has a slightly less impressive display panel. You also get an extra colour option: Rose Gold. Specs: The iPad Pro is undoubtedly the superior tablet, featuring a faster processor, more storage options, and better cameras. Price: Apple’s new iPad is a relative steal at £339/$329, while the more powerful iPad Pro will set you back £549/$599. Value: If you’re looking for productivity, the iPad Pro is the best choice, but you’ll have to consider whether it’s worth paying an additional £200 for the improved hardware and design based on your own budget.

With the release of iTunes 12.6, users renting a movie from iTunes are no longer restricted to watching the whole thing on the device they initially rented it on. Could this be the beginning of Apple actually listening to its users? When it comes to watching movies and television shows online, people now value choice above all else. The average person wants to watch what they want, when they want, and will choose their services and platforms accordingly Netflix vs. Hulu vs. Amazon Prime: Which Should You Choose? Netflix vs. Hulu vs. Amazon Prime: Which Should You Choose? It has been years since we've compared heavy-hitting streaming services, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. And with changes in pricing, content, quality, and interface, we thought it was time to revisit the topic. Read More . If one platform puts unnecessary restrictions on its users, they will simply go elsewhere. Which may be why, after nine long years, Apple is finally loosening its grip on iTunes movie rentals. Yes, Apple has ceded control of one small aspect of iTunes. Making iTunes More User-Friendly Up to now, once you had started watching a movie on one device, you had to finish watching that movie on the same device. According to AppleInsider, there was a workaround enabling you to initiate a transfer or stream to Apple TV, but it was a pain in the proverbial posterior. Now, Apple has released iTunes 12.6, and included in the update is a feature called, “Rent once, watch anywhere”. This lets you watch iTunes movie rentals on any device running iOS 10.3 or an Apple TV running tvOS 10.2. Both of which are expected to launch out of beta in the next few days. Once you have installed iTunes 12.6 and updated your iPhone or iPad to iOS 10.3 you should be able to start watching a movie on one device, but finish watching it on another. Which is something Apple probably should have made possible from day one. Easing the Frustrations of iTunes Users This is a small but significant change which should ease the frustration felt by anyone who has ever rented a movie from iTunes. Restricting viewing to one device is a big no-no in this day and age, when video content is available on demand The Best Sites to Watch TV on Your Computer Over the Internet The Best Sites to Watch TV on Your Computer Over the Internet There are a host of different ways of watching TV on your computer over the internet these days.

When customers upgrade their iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV, IT administrators using Jamf Pro (formerly Casper Suite) or Jamf Now (formerly Bushel) can be confident their management workflows will be uninterrupted. Committed to helping organizations succeed with Apple, Jamf has offered zero-day support for all Apple releases for over a decade, ensuring customers can take advantage of new Apple technology as it becomes available. Jamf Pro Supports Operating Systems' New Functionality In addition to version compatibility, Jamf Pro, a solution designed specifically for professional Apple administrators, supports the new functionality launched for macOS, iOS and tvOS. This includes new security capabilities and configuration management for devices, additional managed restrictions, a new version of Apple's Classroom app, making it easier to set up ad-hoc classrooms, and substantial new device management capabilities for Apple TV, including zero-touch setup, configuration and app distribution. Apple TV With New Management Capabilities Will Transform Experiences "For the first time, businesses and schools can set up and manage Apple TV just like they do iPhone or iPad, which means they can not only mass deploy Apple TV with ease, but create a seamless and interconnected experience between Apple devices," said Dave Alampi, vice president of product management and marketing, Jamf. "And, the desire to make Apple TV management more turnkey is there. In a recent survey of 959 IT admins on Jamf Nation, 97 percent reported Apple TV devices in their environment, with 35 percent saying they have 50-plus TVs. When asked about Apple TV growth, 44 percent of respondents are planning to add more Apple TV devices in the next year." "We imagined teachers being able to display any historic picture, map or other educational content on a classroom display with the simple command of their voice," said Blair Anderson, technology manager, Shawnee Heights School District in Tecumseh, Kansas. "That's why we deployed fourth generation Apple TV devices to every classroom and conference room in the district. Being able to use Jamf Pro to manage our entire ecosystem of Apple products, including Mac, iPad and Apple TV, lets us transform, yet supervise, the total learning experience for students and help improve teacher effectiveness." "As usual, Apple's new functionality for iOS, macOS and tvOS coupled with Jamf's zero-day support will help organizations empower people with technology that puts the user first," said Dean Hager, CEO, Jamf. "Specifically, the new management support for Apple TV opens up tremendous potential for transformation in education, healthcare, hospitality and boardrooms around the world. We have only seen the beginning of what life looks like in a world of network connected things. I look forward to the automation we can help organizations achieve by supporting future Apple innovations the day they become available."

An app developer just looked at the codes in the pre-release versions of iOS 10.3 and found indications that the rumored iOS device could be launched by the Cupertino giant soon.  On Wednesday, app developer Steve Troughton-Smith shared on Twitter what he found when he examined the codes in the iOS 10.3 betas. While the developer did not specifically said that he found codes for a 10.5-inch iPad, he claimed that he is now “reasonably convinced” that Apple could be launching a new iOS device with “screen refresh rate higher than 60Hz.” According to 9To5Mac, Troughton-Smith’s discovery gives credence to a Bloomberg report published last year claiming that Apple could be launching a 10.5-inch iPad with faster display technology. At present, the iPad Pro accepts input at 240 hertz from the Apple Pencil though the display Apple is using cannot really update that quickly. Thus, it really makes sense that Apple could be bumping up the refresh rates of the screen it is using for a new iOS device.  Although saying that frame rates for a new device could be higher than 60Hz is quite far from the 240Hz rate of the Apple Pencil, an upgrade from the current iPad’s less than 60 to 30 frames would already mean a more responsive and lifelike experience when drawing on the display using the writing peripheral. This is the very reason Apple Insider cited as to why Samsung’s biggest rival could be pursuing higher screen refresh rates for its new iOS device.  Apart from ensuring better response time to the Apple Pencil, the higher frame rates is also being linked to Apple’s desire to take advantage of augmented reality and virtual reality technologies with its new products. The faster response times would help make the AR and VR experience on the device more enjoyable and less headache-inducing.  Just this Tuesday, Apple dropped a bombshell by introducing its budget-friendly 9.7-inch iPad as the replacement of the iPad Air 2. The low-end iPad houses Apple’s A9 processor and slightly dated specs and features. It does not come with support for the Apple Pencil as well. Given that the long-rumored 9.7-inch iPad came true this week, there is now more reason to believe that the rumored 10.5-inch flagship iPad and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro could also be introduced soon. Sources are even saying that the two could be unveiled at a special event Apple is planning to hold next month.  The codes in the pre-release versions of iOS 10.3 seem to indicate that Apple is launching a 10.5-inch iPad soon.

The wording in the release notes isn’t specific, but hints at the ability to simply stream a rented movie on any device linked to the Apple ID that rented it. Previously users have always had to actually transfer the rented file from one device to another and could only view it on one device at a time. And while the Apple TV has been able to stream a downloaded movie rental from a user’s computer, it wouldn’t appear in the “Movies” app (like it would if it had been rented on the Apple TV directly), but as a movie in the “Computers” app that is used to access the computer’s regular iTunes library. The iTunes update—combined with the imminent release of a new iPad this Friday—has led to speculation that Apple will release iOS 10.3 and tvOS 10.2 in the next few days to enable this new feature.

The hackers have demanded either $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards or $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum to delete the data they claim to have stolen. One hacker provided unverified screenshots of email exchanges with Apple security and access to an email account used to communicate directly with Apple. In one email, a member of Apple’s security team asked, “Are you willing to share a sample of the data set?” The hackers then uploaded a YouTube video of them accessing an elderly woman’s iCloud, prompting Apple to allegedly request that the video be taken down and inform the hackers the company was contacting authorities. The hackers are now threatening to reset a series of iCloud accounts on April 7 if their demands aren’t met, but their story does have some inconsistencies. While in one of the email exchanges a hacker claims to have access to over “300 million Apple email accounts,” another placed that number at 559 million. They also haven’t provided any of the stolen iCloud accounts to verify the claim, meaning the one shown in the video could have been obtained through other means. Apple declined multiple requests for comment.

Top News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Thursday March 23, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Not much new as Apple announces price cuts AP  Thursday, March 23, 2017, 12:02 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ NEW YORK -- Apple is cutting prices on two iPad models and introducing red iPhones, but the company held back on updating its higher-end iPad Pro tablets. A much-speculated 10.5-inch iPad Pro didn't materialize, nor did new versions of existing sizes in the Pro lineup, which is aimed at businesses and creative professionals. The new devices are mostly refreshes of existing models. Apple unveiled them through press releases Tuesday rather than a staged event, as it typically does for bigger product releases. The iPad updates come as the tablet market continues to decline, after a few years of rapid growth. According to IDC, tablet shipments fell 20 percent to 53 million worldwide in the final three months of 2016, compared with the same period in 2015. The New Lineup The iPad Air 2 is replaced by a new model simply called the iPad. It retains a 9.7-inch screen, but gains a little weight and thickness. The display is brighter and the processor faster. Its price starts at US$329 for 32 gigabytes of storage, down from US$399. The standard-size iPad is now cheaper than the smaller Mini model. The 7.9-inch iPad Mini 4 now comes with 128 gigabytes of storage starting at US$399, rather than US$499 before. Apple is eliminating the 32-gigabyte model, which used to sell for US$399. Nothing else is changing. Apple is also releasing a red edition of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus; for each phone sold, Apple is donating an unspecified amount to HIV and AIDS programs. And Apple is doubling the storage on the smaller iPhone SE while keeping the US$399 starting price. The new iPad Mini 4 is available right away, while the standard-size iPad comes out next week, with orders to begin Friday. The new iPhone SE comes out Friday, while the red iPhones are expected by the end of the month, with advance orders beginning Friday. The Missing Device IDC analyst Jorge Vela had high hopes for a 10.5-inch iPad. He said such a size might have offered room for a better keyboard, compared with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and it wouldn't have been as bulky as the 12.9-inch version. And Apple typically sparks consumer interest when it has new sizes and designs, Vela said, as seen by a jump in sales following the introduction of larger iPhones in 2014 (iPhone sales have since dropped.) Vela said a 10.5-inch version might have been enough for existing iPad owners to upgrade. A 10.5-inch version may still come this year, closer to the holiday shopping season, along with updates to existing Pro sizes. Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said Tuesday's announcement makes it "even clearer that there are two very distinct iPad tiers now — the iPad Pro and the basic iPads. The iPad Pros will likely continue to get all the best new features, while the basic iPad will get occasional updates and new features a little later than the Pros, lagging a generation or two behind." The processor in the new standard-size iPad, for instance, is akin to what's in the iPhone 6S from 2015. The Mini's processor is even older. 1|2|Next Page>> NEXT ARTICLE Slow coal-plant growth helps climate: report Facebook Twitter Google+ Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Starbucks price hikes brew up storm 2 McDonald's Taiwan in final stage of transfer to local owner: report 3 Now that the US is out, Beijing authorities may be interested in attending TPP talks 4 Why can't young people stay in a job? 5 New highs for US stocks; Dow win streak longest since 1987 6 Reports of TSMC's US plant rattle Taiwan 7 Invest in Taiwan, President Tsai urges Taiwanese businesses in N.

CORRECTING and REPLACING GRAPHIC Apple’s iPhone 6s Topped List of Best-Selling Smartphones for 2016, IHS Markit Says Most-shipped smartphones globally in 2016.

Source: IHS Markit Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail CORRECTION...by IHS Markit March 22, 2017 11:17 AM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Please replace the graphic with the accompanying corrected graphic. The release reads: APPLE’S IPHONE 6S TOPPED LIST OF BEST-SELLING SMARTPHONES FOR 2016, IHS MARKIT SAYS In terms of shipments, the iPhone 6s from Apple bested all competitors for sales in 2016, according to new analysis from IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO), a world leader in critical information, analytics and solutions. If looking at the fourth quarter alone, the new iPhone 7 was the 2016 best-seller, followed by iPhone 7 Plus, based on research from the IHS Markit Smartphone Shipment Database, which tracks quarterly shipment data for more than 350 smartphone models. Apple again has demonstrated that its new iPhones integrate enough innovations and new features to drive sales and remain successful in the market. The company is also capable of selling older devices for an extended period of time. For instance, the year-old iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were both among the most-shipped models in 2016. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and S7 ranked fifth and ninth, respectively. Sales of these two devices have outperformed their immediate predecessors, S6 and S6 Edge: the combined shipments of S7 and S7 Edge in 2016 were 10 million higher than S6 and S6 Edge over the same period. The Note 7 recall has left S7 and S7 Edge, released in March 2016, the best flagships in the premium line-up of Samsung. Since then, the market has seen a series of premium smartphones by other companies. Samsung’s ability to drive the sales of older premium devices was impressive. Aggressive promotions, which included bundling with Gear VR, helped sales of S7 and S7 Edge. Samsung claimed five spots out of the top 10 most-shipped smartphones in 2016. Excluding the aforementioned S7 and S7 Edge, the remaining three models all belong to the mid-tier J series. The company has seen shipment unit gains in the mid to low-tier segment, relative to 2015, due to growth in emerging markets. Huawei, the third largest smartphone maker after Apple and Samsung, did not have any models in the top 10 most-shipped smartphones in 2016. Similar to Samsung, Huawei continues to address multiple smartphone pricing segments – either with its own Huawei-branded handsets or with those of its sub-brand, Honor. In the premium segment, Huawei’s P9 was among its own top five most-shipped smartphone models in 2016, performing better than previous flagships. Chinese manufacturer OPPO had one model on the top ten ranking. In 2016, OPPO posted growth of 109 percent in smartphone shipments to become the fourth largest smartphone maker in terms of unit shipment, up from the seventh spot in 2015. Unlike Huawei, OPPO has a smaller product portfolio and operates in fewer markets, with more than 80 percent of the company’s 2016 shipments within its home market of China.

Apple aims to sell premium products at high margins to upmarket demographics. The company had shown almost no interest in more affordable products pitched to those on tighter budgets. But Apple has long recognized that you need a way of building your long-term customer base, and one good way to do that is to get them when they’re young. Apple has made considerable efforts over the years to get its computers into schools and colleges, and to make them more affordable to students through its education discount. The MacBook Air line too has been priced at a level where it is just about affordable for those who would otherwise buy cheaper Windows laptops – again, in no small part because Apple wants to attract younger buyers whose lifetime value to the company will be substantial. But as one analyst recently observed, there is now evidence that Apple is aiming to offer lower pricing across a broader range of products. Yesterday’s announcement of a low-cost 9.7-inch iPad was a good example of that new approach … Anker braided Lightning cables Neil Cybart wrote a week ago that Apple is pricing some of its products at a surprisingly inexpensive level, and gave AirPods as an example. As Apple pushes deeper into luxury brand territory, the company is making its products more accessible through lower pricing. At $159, Apple is underpricing AirPods […] It is very difficult to find a pair of wireless headphones priced lower than AirPods. In the run-up to Apple unveiling AirPods this past September, the wireless headphone market consisted of the following players [with all but one of the eight products priced at $199 plus]. Cybart went on to write that, on like-for-like basis, the Apple Watch’s starting price of $269 also makes it one of the cheaper wearables available, comparing it to competing products ranging from $275 to $599. (There are of course many cheaper smartwatches that don’t compare in quality or functionality.) The Above Avalon writer suggests a few different theories for what might be behind this. It could all be designed to sell more of Apple’s primary product, the iPhone. It might be simply to take advantage of Apple’s bulk-buying power to make money from lower-priced products. Or it could be a desire to transition from a premium brand into a truly mass-market one, with luxury products only one element of its business. AirPods and Apple Watch pricing demonstrate how Apple is looking to own not only the premium segment of the wearables market, but rather the entire market. While I don’t think Apple has any desire to own the entire market – both Tim Cook and Steve Jobs before him have always been clear that Apple aims to make the best products possible, and is not willing to compromise the user experience to hit particular price-points – I do think Cybart is right that what the company does want to do is bring new customers into the Apple ecosystem. And – just as it did with the MacBook Air – providing a more affordable entry point is the most effective way to do that. Yesterday’s iPad launch provides good evidence for that view. The iPad model it launched isn’t a great one. As we noted yesterday, in some ways it’s a little worse than the iPad Air 2 that previously served as the entry point for those who wanted something larger than an iPad mini. But it’s still a good one. You get something which, while a little thicker than its predecessor, is still very portable. You get a Retina display, decent cameras front and back, Touch ID and an A9 processor. And most important of all in terms of attracting new customers into the ecosystem, you get a 9.7-inch iPad for as little as $329. That’s a price that is going to get the attention of anyone looking for something better than the cheapest disposable Android tablets. It’s also important to remember that while 9to5Mac readers naturally gravitate toward the latest and greatest models, we are not representative of the tablet market as a whole. We’re not even representative of the iPad market. Localytics yesterday reported that both iPad Pro models combined – the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models – amount to just 8% of all iPads in use. That’s in large part, of course, because the Pro models are still relatively new and people hold onto their iPads for far longer than they do iPhones, so you’d expect to see a lot of older models still in use. But it’s still worth bearing in mind that just because an iPad isn’t exciting doesn’t mean it isn’t appealing to a lot of people. Then there’s the iPhone SE. Sure, some of us bought it because we prefer the size and design, but it’s undeniably the case that many bought it because it’s the most affordable way to buy a new iPhone. Apple yesterday made its cheapest iPhone even more appealing by doubling the storage capacity. So no, I don’t think Apple has any desire to turn itself into a true mass-market company, covering all price levels from budget devices to luxury ones, but I do think it wants to bring more people into the Apple World. Its pricing of AirPods, the Apple Watch, the iPhone SE and now the new 9.7-inch iPad are evidence of that – and of a willingness to have some lower-margin products in order to allow new customers to experience the Apple ecosystem. Once locked in, a proportion of those new customers will later buy the more expensive products the company really wants to sell. Some of those initially attracted by the affordability of the MacBook Air will later end up buying one of the eye-wateringly expensive MacBook Pro models. Some iPhone SE buyers will later pay the rumored $1000-ish price of the iPhone 8. And some brought in by that $329 iPad will at some point upgrade to an iPad Pro. Do you agree? Is Apple engaged in a deliberate strategy of having more affordable routes into the ecosystem in the hope that people will move up the price ladder later on? Or do one of the alternative explanations apply? Please take part in our poll and share your thoughts in the comments.

When customers upgrade their iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV, IT administrators using Jamf Pro (formerly Casper Suite) or Jamf Now (formerly Bushel) can be confident their management workflows will be uninterrupted. Committed to helping organizations succeed with Apple, Jamf has offered zero-day support for all Apple releases for over a decade, ensuring customers can take advantage of new Apple technology as it becomes available. Jamf Pro Supports Operating Systems' New Functionality In addition to version compatibility, Jamf Pro, a solution designed specifically for professional Apple administrators, supports the new functionality launched for macOS, iOS and tvOS. This includes new security capabilities and configuration management for devices, additional managed restrictions, a new version of Apple's Classroom app, making it easier to set up ad-hoc classrooms, and substantial new device management capabilities for Apple TV, including zero-touch setup, configuration and app distribution. Apple TV With New Management Capabilities Will Transform Experiences "For the first time, businesses and schools can set up and manage Apple TV just like they do iPhone or iPad, which means they can not only mass deploy Apple TV with ease, but create a seamless and interconnected experience between Apple devices," said Dave Alampi, vice president of product management and marketing, Jamf. "And, the desire to make Apple TV management more turnkey is there. In a recent survey of 959 IT admins on Jamf Nation, 97 percent reported Apple TV devices in their environment, with 35 percent saying they have 50-plus TVs. When asked about Apple TV growth, 44 percent of respondents are planning to add more Apple TV devices in the next year." "We imagined teachers being able to display any historic picture, map or other educational content on a classroom display with the simple command of their voice," said Blair Anderson, technology manager, Shawnee Heights School District in Tecumseh, Kansas. "That's why we deployed fourth generation Apple TV devices to every classroom and conference room in the district. Being able to use Jamf Pro to manage our entire ecosystem of Apple products, including Mac, iPad and Apple TV, lets us transform, yet supervise, the total learning experience for students and help improve teacher effectiveness." "As usual, Apple's new functionality for iOS, macOS and tvOS coupled with Jamf's zero-day support will help organizations empower people with technology that puts the user first," said Dean Hager, CEO, Jamf. "Specifically, the new management support for Apple TV opens up tremendous potential for transformation in education, healthcare, hospitality and boardrooms around the world. We have only seen the beginning of what life looks like in a world of network connected things. I look forward to the automation we can help organizations achieve by supporting future Apple innovations the day they become available." About Jamf Since 2002, Jamf has been solely focused on helping organizations succeed with Apple. Jamf is committed to enabling IT to empower end users and bring the legendary Apple experience to businesses, education and government organizations via its Jamf Pro and Jamf Now produces, and the 42,000+ member Jamf Nation Community.

Senior executives of iPhone maker Apple today held detailed deliberations on their demands related to duty concession with officials of the finance ministry. The meeting assumes significance as the revenue department has rejected the demands of the US-based technology major. According to sources, the duty wish-list was discussed at the meeting, which was attended by key executives of the company. Apple India has sought concessions, including duty exemption on manufacturing and repair units, components, capital equipment. It also sought relaxations for consumables for smartphone manufacturing and service or repair for 15 years as it plans to set up a manufacturing unit in India. These concessions would help the company get component makers to set up units in the country as it cannot source inputs locally. India is gradually becoming a smartphone manufacturing hub, and there is a feeling that giving concession to a particular company could be difficult for the government. In a communication to the government, the Cupertino-based technology major has asked for incentives from the Department of Revenue and Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeITy). Apple also wants relaxation in the mandated 30 per cent local sourcing of components. It is also keen on reduction in Customs duties on completely-knocked-down and semi-knocked-down units of devices that are to be assembled in the country. In January, Apple had indicated to the government that it is ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones in India, but wants fiscal concessions, including Customs duty waiver on import of components. The company sells its products through Apple-owned retail stores in countries like China, Germany, the US, the UK and France, among others. It has no wholly-owned store in India and sells its products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro.

Hackers identifying themselves as "Turkish Crime Family" are threatening to wipe hundreds of millions of Apple users' devices, including back-up files stored on the Cloud, if Apple doesn't pay a ransom of at least $75,000, reports Motherboard. The hackers say they have access to as many as 559 million iCloud and Apple accounts—this claim is unverified, though a YouTube video reportedly shows them logging into one account—and will remotely erase all data on April 7 if they don't receive $75,000 in a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards. If the ransom is paid, the hackers say they will delete their list of accounts. However, screenshots of email communications provided to Motherboard suggest Apple is not about to give in. "We do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law," an email from Apple reads, according to a screenshot, which also shows Apple telling the hackers that their messages will be turned over to authorities. Motherboard reports it was also given access to an email account the hackers claim to have used to communicate with Apple's security team but Motherboard couldn't confirm that emails received by that account were authentic. Apple has not commented.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   16% Hilarious 12% Intriguing 8% Depressing 3% Brilliant 41% Scary 20% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 52 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Popular on Newser Family of Teen Who Drank Liquid Meth at Border Gets $1M 1 Inmate Left to Die as Broken Neck Ignored for Days 2 Mother of 3 Found After Disappearing 11 Years Ago 3 Question From Teenage Boy Leaves Gorsuch Speechless 4 Scientists Issue Dire Warning on Christ's Tomb 5 Wall Street Journal Delivers Blistering Trump Editorial 6 Family of 5 Wiped Out in Highway Wreck 7 Other Stories On Our Radar Here's What We Know About the London Terror Attack Cheerleaders Posted Nude Pics of a Teammate Online, and Their Coach's Reaction Was Sickening The Surprising Reason People Don't Believe in Climate Change, According to Science Dozens of People Watched Teen Girl Get Raped on FB Live and Did Nothing To Stop It Partner Links Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 52 comments akguppy 6 hours, 2 minutes ago $75K, that's chicken feed, or Turkey feed.

The self-styled "Turkish Crime Family" are threatening to remotely wipe data from those millions of Apple devices unless Apple pays it $75,000 in crypto-currency or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards before a 7 April deadline. Evidence of the supposed breach is far from conclusive (the hackers provided screenshots of alleged emails between the group and members of Apple's security team to Motherboard) leaving security watchers sceptical about the alleged breach. Several researchers are speculating that the whole thing might be an elaborate bluff. Lee Munson, security researcher at Comparitech.com, commented: "Whether the group has the means to do as it claims is debatable – supposed correspondence with Apple and a YouTube video showing the takeover of an account may well have been faked – but what is not up for debate is Apple’s resolve to not pay a ransom to make the group back down. "While Apple’s stance that it will 'not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law' is the right one to take, I cannot help but wonder if the option to pay $100,000 in iTunes gift cards, rather than $75,000 in untraceable crypto-currency, could have been explored in association with law enforcement," he added. Any one of several possible causes might have hypothetically have given rise to the supposed mega-breach. Password re-use by consumers whose credentials were exposed by problems at third-party sites would be the most likely possibility. Other (less likely) scenarios include vulnerabilities in Apple's infrastructure or breach of third-party tool or organisation. David Kennerley, director of threat research at Webroot, commented: "The big question for Apple is what procedures are in place to prevent the destructive action threatened by the hackers? Without a full understanding of what the hackers really have, the true quantity and how they came by it, everything thereafter can only be a best-guess scenario." Chris Doman, security researcher at SIEM vendor AlienVault, added: "The attackers do seem desperate for publicity. Yesterday a Twitter account (turkcrimefamily) and Website (turkishcrimefamily[.]org) were created in their name, and today they claimed 'The number of Apple credentials have increased from 519m to 627m, we are convinced it will keep growing until 7 April 2017'. "Apple has some of the best security people in the business, and it seems hard to believe they would have lost control of hundreds of millions of accounts. The attackers may have taken control of a small number of accounts, through everyday iCloud phishing attacks, and used that as 'evidence' to justify their more outlandish claims. "Apple users should be suspicious of any unexpected messages from Apple asking them to enter their credentials," he added. ® Tips and corrections 35 Comments More from The Register Phishing: Another thing we can blame on Brexit Attacks up 33 per cent across the five most-targeted industries 14 Comments Phishing tackle ships data catch to net sharks DIY-phishing code advertised YouTube have predictable by-products 6 Comments FBI says NY judge went too far in ruling the FBI went too far in forcing Apple to unlock iPhone More Inception than legal argument at this point 55 Comments Autocomplete a novel phishing hole for Chrome, Safari crims Hidden forms capture LastPass autofill 17 Comments Instagram phishing apps pulled from Google Play But not before they were downloaded 1.5 million times 13 Comments Apple fans take iPhone unlock protest to FBI HQ Rallies in support of world's richest company will be held in 40 cities around the world 62 Comments Whitepapers Penn State enhances research computing with Red Hat cloud Infrastructure On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, a bronze statue of the Nittany Lion proudly stands guard.

Startups Games Makers Tech Games Hardware Software Features Women Blog Events How to Opinion Competitions Forum Press office Talk to us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Join us on Google+ Subscribe with RSS By Brendyn Lotz on 22nd March · General · News Refreshed iPad, Red iPhone and more storage for the iPhone SE incoming There are a few new Apple products on the way, but they aren’t technically new. The iPad, iPhone 7 and iPhone SE have all been given a makeover of sorts. The new iPad is a 9.7inch tablet that will boast an A9 processor and a brighter Retina display.It houses an 8MP snapper at the rear and an “HD” FaceTime camera at the front. All of this is powered by a battery that should last 10 hours according to Apple. The new iPad will be available for order from 24th March in the US and will cost $329 (~R4173) but expect it to cost a bit more when it lands in SA. Advert The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are also getting a refresh that’s just a lick of paint. Sales of the special edition of the iPhone 7 nicknamed (Product) Red will see Apple contributing to Red, the HIV/AIDS charity started by Bono. It’s unclear at this stage whether this red iPhone 7 will be available in South Africa but we will update this story when we find out. Finally, and perhaps the best Apple related news we’ve heard today, is that the firm is scrapping the 16GB iPhone SE. The smaller iPhone will now be available in 32GB and 128GB iterations. The 64GB has also been scrapped for those interested. These are all very small and some would say pointless upgrades, but perhaps the new iPad might help Apple regain some popularity in the market. In 2016 Apple reported a 19% decline in iPad sales year-on-year which translates into a decline of $1.5 billion in revenue year-on-year. Perhaps a cheaper tablet is the key to making the iPad profitable again. Here’s hoping, for Apple’s sake at least. Like this story? Share it!

Written by Jean-Louis Gassée Editor, Monday Note March 22, 2017 OS ain't your thing. (Reuters/Denis Balibouse) Share Written by Jean-Louis Gassée Editor, Monday Note March 22, 2017 Nick Hayek wants Swatch to roll out its own smartwatch OS rather than use Android Wear. This is a grave mistake that shows little understanding of smartwatch success factors and of competitive software engineering cultures and their ecosystems. Lebanese-born and Europe-schooled, Nicolas Hayek père was a genius. In 1983, two venerable but mortally ailing Swiss watch industry companies, ASUAG and SSIH, called Hayek to their bedside to perform the last rites and liquidations. The companies had been unable to withstand competition from Japanese quartz watch manufacturers such as Seiko, Casio, and Citizen. It was the humane thing to do. But rather than pull the plug, Hayek demonstrated his unique combination of management, technology, and marketing savvy by making a counter-intuitive decision: In the middle of the “quartz crisis,” Hayek refused to give up on traditional mechanical designs. He merged the two entities and adopted a project from subsidiary ETA SA, whose CEO, Ernst Thomke, and two engineers, Elmar Mock and Jacques Müller, had come up with a simplified mechanical design that used only 51 pieces when 150 was considered the minimum. Thus the Swatch was born. Hayek found investors for the merged company, placed himself at the helm, took the new company private, and, in 1986, renamed it Société de Microélectronique et d’Horlogerie (SMH). SMH wasn’t just a company, it was a Swiss federation of parts manufacturers, component engineers, watch assembly companies, and brand organizations (Omega, Blancpain, Bréguet). Under Hayek’s leadership, the conglomerate arose from its sickbed and manufactured the Swatch in numbers that repelled the Japanese invasion. A less precise mechanical watch had beaten the ultra-precise quartz time pieces. Swatches were fun, inexpensive, European, and fashionable. They were a kind of costume jewelry that was constantly iterated, they possessed the soul that the Japanese watches lacked. Showing a keen understanding of his wide range of customers, Hayek also revived articles of mechanical pride such as the delightfully complicated Bréguet wristwatches. Such was the impact of the simplified mechanical watch in the conglomerate’s success that, in 1998, SMH was renamed Swatch Group. It is now a federation of more than 70 companies: (Provided by author) I had the opportunity to meet Nicolas Hayek in the late nineties. Energetic and hard-spoken, he proudly wore two watches, one of which the original Swatch with its blue plastic band. He passed away in 2010 at the age of 82. The Hayek family has maintained bloodline control of the Swatch dynasty. His daughter Nayla chairs the Swatch AG Board, his son Georges Nicolas (a.k.a. Nick) is the CEO, and grandson Marc is also on the Extended Group Management Board and CEO of Jaquet Droz and other group brands. But succeeding a man such as Nicholas Hayek isn’t easy. This was never more apparent than when, in 2013, Hayek fils publicly pooh-poohed smart watches: Personally, I don’t believe it’s the next revolution…Replacing an iPhone with an interactive terminal on your wrist is difficult. You can’t have an immense display. (A contemporaneous and not entirely laudatory Monday Note comment can be found here.) His skepticism may have stemmed from Swatch’s short-lived flirtation with Microsoft’s SPOT (Smart Personal Objects Technology) platform in 2004–2005. The SPOT-powered Swatches quickly disappeared with the platform. Much has happened since Nick Hayek’s infelicitous words. On Sept. 9, 2014, Apple unveiled its smartwatch. The global span of the event and imprimatur of fashion world luminaries created heightened expectations. But Apple’s diffident refusal to release unit and revenue numbers after the device started shipping in April 2015 provoked critics to label the Apple Watch a disappointment, even as competing smartwatches weren’t doing so well. In Sept. 2016, the Watch Series 2 was announced, concurrent with improvements and a price reduction for the earlier model (now starting at $269). Perhaps more important, the fashion and luxury angles were replaced by an accent on health and fitness, highlighted by the Apple Watch Nike+. Apple still refuses to release Watch numbers, but the device is estimated to have had a successful Holidays quarter. The Canalys research firm (all caveats hereby stipulated) pegs unit sales at six million for the quarter with a revenue of $2.6 billion—that’s 80% of the total smartwatch market. Apple CEO Tim Cook, known for the reliability of his public statements, calls sales growth “off the charts.” If the numbers are accurate, Apple has become the second largest watchmaker by revenue, right behind Rolex. In the meantime, the Swiss watch industry continues its decline (from the very precise Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (FH)): (Provided by author) A look at the 2016 annual report for the Swatch Group shows an even more accentuated revenue decline; they lost 10.6% last year: (Provided by author) This leads us to Nick Hayek’s latest pronouncement: In collaboration with with renowned Swiss research institute CSEM, Swatch will write its own smartwatch OS [as always, edits and emphasis are mine]: [CSEM and Swatch are working to] launch an ecosystem for connected objects by the end of 2018 [that will] offer absolute data protection and ultra-low energy consumption and [will] not need regular updates. Hmmm… Allow me to play angel’s advocate for a moment and imagine what Nick Hayek sees and wants to achieve. The ultra-low energy consumption part might be connected to the recent CSEM announcement of the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip (5M transistors on a 5mm2 chip) that they created in collaboration with the Swatch Group: It is—first and foremost—the smallest Bluetooth chip on the market. The ultra-miniaturization of electronic components is crucial for the densification of functions in portable electronic devices and for the Internet of Things. It has the lowest energy consumption—compared to its competitors—for different scenarios of use, thus increasing the autonomy of connected objects, an essential factor in this field. Its high-speed start-up capability is unparalleled, which makes it possible to improve the reactivity and the lifetime of, for example, electronic beacons. Indeed, extremely low power Bluetooth connections would open up a universe of opportunities for connected objects. But I have to return to form and wonder about the wisdom of the SwatchOS project. First, we have to question this umpteenth evocation of a bright Internet of Thins (IoT) future. The competing cries for openness and privacy demand the participation of strong ecosystem players—companies that are able to (slowly) grow and enforce standards that are technically competent and secure. Does Swatch have the resources to be a leader in this cause? Swatch Group net 2016 sales were about $7.5 billion, net income a modest 7.9% of sales, and its cash position about $1.1 billion. (I’ve used a 1 CHF = $1 exchange rate.) Second, anybody can write an operating system (yeah, I know…), but it’s a much more difficult task when the creator declares that the OS won’t need regular updates. This is extremely bizarre. What about bugs fixes, security updates, more/better functionality? Third, what about third-party applications? Creating an operating system is one thing; building an ecosystem of developers around it is a much more difficult task. Does Swatch assume there won’t be any third-party apps, that only Swatch can write code for Smart Swatches? Lastly, the “end of 2018” time frame. Assuming the project stays on schedule (it always does, of course), Apple will have launched two new Watch models and countless watchOS updates by the 2018 Holiday quarter. Android Wear will also go through major iterations with its hardware partners. Nick Hayek’s father triumphed against Japanese quartz watch makers by playing on his own turf. Trying to defeat the established smartwatch players by playing their game won’t work. Is there something in Swatch Group’s culture that predisposes it to be competitive with Google and Apple software engineers? Just as Nokia should have embraced Android in 2010, riding on its proven combination of design, supply chain, and carrier distribution prowess to keep a leading role in the smartphone revolution, Swatch could use its native—but circumscribed—cultural and technical skills to create beautiful, fun smartwatches…that run on Google’s software. But just like Nokia’s culture and success prevented it from seizing the Android moment, similar factors will keep Swatch from being a powerful player in the smartwatch world.

IT Career Roadmap: It takes a village... Why Apple dropped iPad’s price to... 11 Steps Attackers Took to Crack Target Show More Apple this week is releasing its most affordable iPad to date. The refreshed 9.7-inch iPad, which packs a Retina screen and Apple’s A9 chip in a device that effectively replaces the iPad Air 2, is priced at $329 with 32GB of storage. The $70 price drop makes the entry-level iPad more competitive, particularly among schools that can now snag the tablet for under $300 at educational pricing. Businesses that are motivated by price and don’t require more advanced features in the iPad Pro will also be giving the iPad another look as a result of these changes, according to Avi Greengart, research director at GlobalData. [ Related: Is Google pushing Apple out of the U.S. classrooms? ] “This doesn’t seem specific to enterprise,” Greengart says. “If anything, it seems more oriented to education where there’s been a massive influx of Chromebooks into the mix.” Google’s Chrome OS powers almost six out of 10 computing devices shipped to K-12 schools in the United States last year, according to a recent report from research firm Futuresource Consulting. Although Apple has been positioning its iPad Pro line for business professionals, there are many lines of business, such as checkout terminals, customer-service kiosks and various applications in hospitality, that don’t need those more expensive features, according to Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. “Overall, it is a good move from Apple to try and get users to upgrade older models and continue to drive first-time buyer adoption,” she says. “For enterprises this is the form factor of choice.” [ Related: First Look: New Apple iPad, red iPhone and iWatch gear ] Apple is simplifying iPad naming scheme The new entry-level tablet from Apple, simply called “iPad,” also represents a branding shift for Apple’s product line. “It was pretty complicated plus the naming scheme was very un-Apple,” Greengart says. “There’s no more Air. This is just the iPad. The iPad and the iPad Pro makes a lot of sense… it’s clear both in pricing and positioning.” By downsizing on the variants of the iPad, which was first introduced almost seven years ago, Apple is making it easier for consumers to find what they want and what serves their needs, according to Milanesi. “What is interesting, however, is that the experience you get from any of the devices is not compromised,” she says. “This is not something many vendors do. You always feel there is a trade off, but not with iPhone or iPad mostly because you are running the latest OS and have access to the same ecosystem.” [ Related: iPad Pro, iPad, and iPad mini 4: What are the differences? ] One hang-up in Apple’s iPad streamlining effort -- the iPad mini 4 -- got a storage bump from 32GB to 128GB but the internal components lag behind the new 9.7-inch iPad and the $399 price tag remains unchanged. In other product news, Apple discontinued the iPad mini 2 and doubled the storage capacity of the entry-level iPhone SE from 16GB to 32GB. Apple also continued to expand and reinvigorate its PRODUCT(RED) lineup of devices with a bright red aluminum version of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Finally, Apple expanded the lineup of bands available for Apple Watch with a series of new striped woven nylon, Nike Sport and Apple Watch Hermes bands. [ Related: New Apple Watch buyers face limited band selection ] Clips, a video-editing app for social sharing One of the more interesting moves from Apple this week came in the form of Clips, a new iOS app that helps users edit video clips, photos and music to create videos for sharing on social networks. While the videos created by Clips look strikingly similar to “stories” on Snapchat and Instagram, Apple is focused on simplifying the creation process for its users instead of launching a new social platform. “Clips is about content not social,” Milanesi says. Apple is staying close to what it knows -- creating and editing content -- and letting users share that media on any platform of their choice, she says. By taking a creator-centric approach to social content, Apple could also increase device usage and overall loyalty to the iOS platform, according to Milanesi. “In a way, if the engagement of creating the content moves to Clips [users] are leaving Snapchat and the rest to merely be the delivery mechanism.” Still, the move is new from Apple, which has usually embedded these types of features into the camera app. The company also could have introduced Clips as a feature within iMessage, but it decided to create a standalone app for video editing that is less complex, and perhaps attractive to more iOS users, than other video-editing apps. Apple says Clips will be available in the App Store next month. “It feels more like a need in the market for an Apple-sanctioned, so to speak, app for video editing that is simpler and more consumer oriented than something like iMovie,” Greengart says. “It’s positioned as a social-oriented video editing app rather than a technical video editing app or a trimming tool.” To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter.

According to the IFPI Global Music Report, 2016 saw a jaw-dropping 93% increase in Americans using services such as Spotify and music streaming revenues increase by 45.2%. Thanks to streaming, digital has now overtaken physical sales. But with all this change happening, it seems that the traditional labels - Universal, Sony and Warner music groups (aka 'the big three') - are slow to react. Big three take note: streaming providers are challenging your dominance and are prepared to take you on. It doesn't have to be do or die though; there is another option, namely for the newcomers to work alongside the established elite. Collaboration seems by far the best option when you consider the positives. For the labels, the big three will want access to something that they currently don't have; unique data. It's well-known that Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal have been collating users' listening habits, locations and much more for years, with the addition of Amazon Music Unlimited from last year. The wealth of information music streaming services have is something of which the big three can only dream. Next, the labels will want assurance that their content will not only be better targeted based on consumer behaviour, but will actually be consumed in the first place. With 20 million subscribers on Apple Music and over 100 million on Spotify - 50 million of which are premium users - it's safe to say that the streaming services are not short when it comes to consumer demand. What's in it for Spotify and Apple? The most obvious is the ability to offer exclusive content. Streaming platforms are in a constant race to sign artists to exclusive deals, in the belief that such content encourages users to subscribe to their services. For example, Kanye West's Tidal exclusive 'The Life of Pablo' certainly proved the point, leading to subscriptions more than doubling on the platform from around 1 million to 2.5 million in the nine days after its release. However, exclusives are causing huge issues across the industry, especially when it comes to Spotify. In 2016, there were two prolific cases of the Swedish streaming service punishing artists that secured an Apple Music exclusive. Both Katy Perry and Frank Ocean witnessed Spotify's wrath, seeing their new tracks omitted from Spotify's biggest playlists; Today's Top Hits and New Music Friday, both of which have well over 10 million followers. Whilst it didn't affect the success of Frank Ocean's 'Blond', experts say it did contribute to the flop that was Katy Perry's comeback single and US Olympic team anthem 'Rise'. Of course there is no one magic solution, however there are a couple that I think are viable. Rather than exclusives secured by individual artist, we could see exclusives secured by each label roster instead. This would keep streaming services from attacking artists for securing exclusives elsewhere, as they would have a fair distribution of exclusive content throughout the year. This could cut down on these forms of punishment, leading to greater revenue for both the platforms and the labels. Another potential solution lies in Apple and Spotify moving from acting like broadcasters to becoming publishers too. Last year for example, Spotify launched its Spotify Sessions: Singles, a new singles section with exclusive covers of popular songs by an artist accompanying a new version of their own hit. Whilst not completely Spotify's own content, the fact it's branded to the point of exclusivity appeals to the platform, labels, artists and consumers all round. Content such as this provides the platform with exclusives to attract new and existing subscribers, in turn providing a wider pool of listeners to engage with the content, delivering bigger profits for labels and artists alike. This all is just the beginning, as both Apple Music and Spotify have recently announced a move into the realms of Netflix by creating original video content. With series focusing on individual artists, from short documentaries to seeing two artists collaborating on their music, it seems the music services are aiming to become the MTVs of the streaming age. Not to mention we haven't even touched the sleeping giant Amazon and the power they could wield by adding music content to their prime memberships. The financial advantage is clear. The stronger the collaboration, the better for artists, labels, platforms and, most importantly, consumers, but watch this space!

Paul Rubens (CIO (US)) 23 March, 2017 00:28 - - - - print email Comments "AI is the new UI" may be a cliché now, but back in 2011 when Apple first released Siri the capability to control a mobile device by talking to it through an intelligent assistant was revolutionary. Granted, Siri wasn't as smart as HAL in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey or Eddy, the shipboard computer in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but it made enough of an impact on consumer technology to spawn a stream of similar intelligent assistants. Siri was soon followed by Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana, and Google's Assistant. And these will likely be joined soon by many others, including Samsung's Bixby, which is based on technology Samsung acquired when it bought Viv, a company founded by the people behind Siri. And just as the iPhone took off when Apple opened it up to third-party app makers, the key to the success of these intelligent assistants may well be the ability for third-party developers to access them and employ them as a user interface to their applications. [ Why Google’s Sergey Brin changed his tune on AI ] It's an idea that's not been lost on the technology companies behind these assistants. Here’s a look at how the ‘big four’ assistants — Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant — are being used now, where they differ, and what comes next. Alexa Amazon has been particularly successful in driving third-party adoption of Alexa. The company first made its Alexa Skills Kit available to developers in June 2015, and six months later over 130 skills were available. (Skills, in Amazon parlance, are applications that can be accessed on one of Amazon's Echo devices using Alexa as the user interface.) Since then, the development of Alexa skills has exploded. By September 2016 over 3,000 were availabe, and in February 2017 Amazon announced that the number of skills had burst through the 10,000 mark. That means over 10,000 applications use Alexa as their user interface. Perhaps more significant is the availability of Alexa Voice Service (AVS). Released in 2015, AVS allows manufacturers to build Alexa into connected products that have a microphone and speaker. Chinese manufacturer Tongfang has announced plans to integrate Alexa into its Seiki, Westinghouse and Element Electronics smart TVs using a microphone built into the remote controls, enabling owners to use Alexa to carry out actions such as searching channel listings and managing the TV settings. [ 3 ways AI assistants improve enterprise productivity ] Chinese phone manufacturer Huawei has also announced plans to build Alexa into its Mate 9 smartphone, and car makers such as Ford are planning to build Alexa into their vehicles to enable drivers to carry out actions such as playing music or setting destinations on the navigation system. Ford owners will also be able to use specially developed skills on Echo devices to carry out functions on their cars such as activating remote start or locking and unlocking doors. When it comes to voice-enabling third-party devices, James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, says that Amazon has a huge advantage over its rivals. That's because it has been working on Alexa for two years, and it can draw on its experiences with its AWS cloud. "If you are working on a washing machine then any problems have probably already been solved, Alexa has been tested, and someone may already have deployed it for that use," he says. "Amazon has realized that for Alexa to be deployed like this then it has to handle the cloud, security and so on, and it has learned how to do that from AWS. Apple doesn't have that." Of course, both Microsoft and Google do have experience running large-scale clouds, and technically there is probably not a big difference between their intelligent assistant technologies, McQuivey says. Companies' decisions about which to adopt could therefore hinge on more strategic considerations, like whether Amazon could become a direct competitor to them or if they want to align themselves with Google or Microsoft. Siri Despite being the first in this wave of intelligent assistants, Apple has been slow to offer Siri as a user interface to third-party applications; it's only with the release of iOS 10 and SiriKit that it has been possible for external developers to build software that can be controlled by Siri. Even so, the possibilities are severely limited compared to what developers can do with the Alexa Skills Kit. SiriKit can be used to build apps only in a particular set of “domains” with specific “intents.” For example, a messaging app can register to support the Messages domain and the intent to send a message. Siri then handles all of the user interaction, including the voice and natural language recognition and getting information. As well as messaging, apps can be built that support the following domains: ride booking, photo search, payments, VoIP calling, workouts, and adjusting the climate controls and radio settings in CarPlay apps. But that's all. Of all these intelligent assistants, Siri stands out as the exception because it is confined to devices made by Apple. And although that means that it is the most widely distributed, it is by no means the most commonly used. "A high percentage of Apple users say that they have used Siri once, but they don't use it often," says McQuivey. "By contrast, one third of Echo users use Alexa multiple times per day, and another third use it once a day," he adds. Cortana Microsoft's Cortana is different from Siri or Alexa in that it is a multi-platform intelligent assistant. It first started out on Microsoft's mobile platform and is now available as an app on iOS and Android, as well as on Windows 10 and Microsoft's Xbox game platform.  It's a strategy that Microsoft calls making Cortana “unbound,” which the company explains — in an apparent dig at Apple — means that it is "tied to you, not to any one platform or device." Microsoft is also developing a Skills Kit for Cortana that will allow developers to take bots created with the Microsoft Bot Framework and publish them to Cortana as a new skill. In addition, developers will be able to repurpose code from existing Alexa skills to create Cortana skills, and they will be able to integrate their web services as skills. Taking another page from the Amazon playbook, Microsoft has also announced a Cortana Devices software development kit (SDK), which will allow OEMs and ODMs to put Cortana into all kinds of products from cars to televisions to mobile devices, and even an Echo-like connected speaker, which audio equipment manufacturer Harman Kardon plans to release later this year. Cortana will also work on the IoT Core edition of Windows 10, offering the possibility of IoT devices that can be controlled using Cortana as the user interface. Assistant Google is slightly behind the curve when it comes to intelligent assistants. Google Assistant  appeared on the scene only within the last few months — in the Google Home device that was launched in November 2016, the Pixel smartphone launched in October 2016 and the Allo messaging app launched in September 2016. And it was only in December 2016 that Google launched its Actions on Google program, allowing developers to use Google Assistant to work as a user interface for Google Home skills. It's also promised an Embedded Google Assistant SDK that will allow other hardware makers to embed Assistant in their products. Beyond the big four There are other companies also developing general intelligent assistants that may be made available to product makers of all sorts. For example, audio recognition and cognition company SoundHound has launched a platform called Houndify that includes large-scale speech recognition and natural language understanding, connections to various data providers to access different types of information, and the capability to add custom phrases and queries. Once a product is integrated with Houndify the company promises that it will instantly understand a wide variety of questions and commands in the same way that Alexa or Cortana can. The difference is that rather than making a feature of having Alexa or Cortana in their product, manufacturers will be able to use Houndify as an ‘own brand’ intelligent assistant.  As well as Android and iOS SDKs the company has also made SDKs available for C++, Web, Python, Java, and C#. Looking forward How widespread will the use of intelligent assistants as a user interface to applications become? It seems unlikely they will replace the keyboard and mouse for desktop applications in the foreseeable future. But for applications you need to acces while driving or walking, or applications running on mobile devices or devices with no screens — such as many IoT devices — an intelligent assistant seems to make perfect sense.  What will be interesting to see play out is whether having an intelligent assistant, such as Alexa, becomes a selling point for products, or whether an own-brand solution such as Houndify ends up being all that users demand. [ How to really customize your Alexa Flash Briefing ] On that question, McQuivey says that the answer will depend on the type of product under consideration. For a television, for example, he says that the use case has been established: People talk to their televisions to find programs and to control the television itself. For that reason, consumers are unlikely to care if the voice interface is provided by Alexa, Cortana, Assistant or an own-brand solution. But for other types of devices McQuivey says that consumers will want interoperability: At the start of a laundry session you might want to ask the washing machine to turn off the central heating, or turn on the oven. In that case, you would want to buy a washing machine that uses the same voice assistant as their heating system or oven. Today that's likely to be Alexa, but in theory Cortana and Assistant could catch up very quickly, says McQuivey. Of course, Apple is the master of creating an ecosystem of products that interoperate, but Siri can be used only in Apple's closed ecosystem. That means that unless Apple branches out into domestic appliances and other household devices, Siri is unlikely to become an important user interface for the future.

Both OS versions are still in beta testing. Since “rent once, watch anywhere” is a thing for the Mac now, it’s a safe bet Apple is close to the official release of iOS 10.3 and tvOS 10.2. Apple isn’t saying when they’ll transition out of beta, but we’re guessing that’s no more than about a week away. iTunes 12.6 is a free update available through Apple’s App Store app on the Mac.

For a moment there, I thought I might have missed that update. As for ‘rent once…’, I feel that this is a welcomed, long overdue feature, and am not sure why it took this long to harmonise the movie rental experience across the system. March 22, 2017 at 10:23 EDT AM Lee Dronick March 22, 2017 Well I would prefer that they cleaned up iTunes, and iOS Music, before adding new features. March 22, 2017 at 10:33 EDT AM Appleman March 22, 2017 iTunes is a looser app these days. Starting a movie stream from iTunes to an AppleTV 4th gen looses connection continually. The search function is non-existent on the AppleTV OS for you Library shows. Tim Cook needs to take iTunes away from Eddy “Useless” Cue like he did for the App store.

Meet Marian Hill, the Most Shazam'd Band in America Pennsylvania duo are reaping the rewards of a gravity-defying Apple ad Marian Hill have a hit with "Down." Credit: Miller Mobley By Maura Johnston 23 hours ago More News Watch Marian Hill Play Three Sax-y Songs Off 'Sway' 10 New Artists You Need to Know Now How Apple Music, Tidal Exclusives Are Reshaping Music Industry All Stories There is no artist that users of the song-identification app Shazam want to know more about than Pennsylvania-born duo Marian Hill. "Down," a moody selection from their 2016 debut Act One, was featured in an ad for Apple's wireless earphones AirPods that premiered in January, featuring Los Angeles street dancer Lil Buck taking to the air. The pairing of the eye-catching Apple spot with the track – a spare duet between a simple piano line and Samantha Gongol's smoke-plume voice that explodes into a stuttering beat –  led to people using the service to figure out what they were listening to. Two months after the ad's debut, "Down" still leads the Shazam chart ahead of pop heavy-hitters like Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars – and it's starting to catch fire at pop radio as well. Rolling Stone caught up with Gongol and producer Jeremy Lloyd to talk about their unique road to success. Related 10 New Artists You Need to Know Now Marian Hill, H.E.R., Vindata, Sigrid and more You've known each other for many years now – when did you first bond over music? Jeremy Lloyd: We'd been singing in choirs for a long time, but I remember a time in high school when Sam was like, "Hey, are you writing songs? What is that like? How do you do that?" Samantha Gongol: I don't remember that specifically, but I'm sure I said something similar. We met in middle school, but it was really high school when we started to embark on separate musical projects, and then also come together to talk about it. What kind of music was that? Gongol: Bad singer-songwriter music. Lloyd: We stayed in touch throughout college. When we were home on break, we'd catch up, and the way [we] would catch up was playing each other music we'd been working on. That turned into writing together. It was pretty natural and easy. It was just that. It wasn't like a super-close friendship. It was a very regular, normal, comfortable friendship. Then, when we wrote [the 2015 track] "Whisky" together, we realized we were on to something. How does [saxophonist] Steve Davit come into the mix? How did you first meet him and collaborate with him? Lloyd: We've been good friends since seventh or eighth grade. He's always been a really close friend and an amazing musician. When Sam and I were ready to figure out what the Marian Hill live show looked like, he already had backed us one time. I'd been like, "Hey, could you just, like, improvise a bunch of stuff, record it and send it to me so I can chop it up?" … Every now and then, we go into the studio and record solos or he'll send me more stuff to chop up and mess around with. He's mostly involved in the live part of the process, but he's also a seriously dope sample guy. People love Steve. We were playing in Kansas City at the Midland Theater and he got a loud cheer – tons of people chanting his name. Marian Hill performing at Bonnaroo 2016. Daniel DeSlover/Zuma How do you bring these songs into a live setting? Lloyd: I'm a real believer in playing as much as possible I can of those [sound] chops, so I've made a setup for myself over the years where I've got drum pads and keys … and some knobs. I'm basically constantly busy. I like to play each element as it's introduced. Gongol: We create this music in the comfort and safety of the studio. So something that I think will go well live doesn't always hit in the same way; the audience latches on to other moments that maybe we didn't anticipate. The more that I perform, the more I sing my parts a little bit differently. It's one of my favorite parts [about being in a band], but it's definitely the scariest, too. What was it like when you first saw the commercial? Gongol: I actually saw the commercial for the first time with my parents in a hotel room after we played Fallon. That was really, really cool. It's just so beautiful – they nailed our aesthetic. Apple's an iconic brand. We grew up watching those commercials. And [knowing that] artists have had incredible careers after [being featured in Apple ads] was really exciting to me. What would you say has been your biggest challenge over the past year? Lloyd: Now that things are picking up so much, it's figuring out a balance in life between the gigs and the touring and the traveling we need to do and writing music – which is the reason that all of this stuff is happening. But having time for my friends and my family is a vital part of my mental health and well-being. As things have gotten busier, negotiating that balance has been an interesting task. Gongol: For me, the biggest challenge is keeping my head down and enjoying the moment, and letting myself be happy with one success. I think it's easy to get caught up in little things and little frustrations. It's important to just take a step back and relax. What about your biggest triumph? Lloyd: Being Shazam's Number One in America, that's a serious triumph. That's what you want people to feel when they hear your music for the first time: "What is it? I need to know what it is so I can hear it again."

However, all mentions to the charity seems to have been removed on Apple’s Chinese website, TechCrunch reports. It’s worth noting that this isn’t a language issue — the Taiwanese site has the same PRODUCT(RED) branding as the rest of the world — but instead may be a political decision by Apple. The theory is that Apple doesn’t want to jeopardize its relationship with the Chinese government by endorsing a controversial topic in the country. Transmission through sex has been rising exponentially, exposing which groups the UN report regards as the 21st century’s most vulnerable: “widespread lack of knowledge and protective life skills, huge internal labour migration, underprivileged minority communities, relative poverty, youth, and gender inequity” […] Health officials say there are plenty of problems in China’s approach to AIDS. There are frequent reports of police crack-downs on local NGOs involved in AIDS prevention. There have also been reports of police using the presence of a condom in a sex worker’s handbag to justify detention. This has been partially blamed on policy incoordination, and contradictions and conflicts between laws and regulations. In addition, there are concerns that provincial governments have enough autonomy to sometimes stall the implementation of central government-set guidelines and some officials say there has been a reluctance from many state-owned companies to get involved in AIDS programs. China has been criticized for a long time now due to its failure to respond to the growing AIDS issue within the country.

But Android-powered slates have come a long way since the clunkier models of five years ago, back when Android apps didn't even work smoothly on a larger screen. Enter Samsung's $599.99 Galaxy Tab S3, which recently became available for preorder. With its high price, stylus support, and powerful processor, Samsung is gunning for Apple's $599 iPad Pro and other similar high-end tablets. Samsung's new gadget has a brilliantly vibrant screen and includes the company's S Pen stylus in the box, unlike Apple which charges an extra $99 for the Apple Pencil. But the iPad Pro has a few benefits over Samsung's tablet that could persuade some buyers, especially iPhone owners, particularly when it comes to power and battery. After using the Tab S3 alongside the 9.7-inch iPad Pro for the past few days, here's a closer look at how they compare. One of the most noticeable differences between Samsung's Tab S3 and the iPad Pro is the way their screens look. The Tab S3 supports HDR video playback and, like many other Samsung gadgets, includes a Super AMOLED screen. These displays typically produce deeper blacks and better contrast than other display types. Apple, by comparison, uses LED display technology for the iPad Pro.

That's not to say the iPad Pro has a dull screen, but Samsung's is exceptionally vivid and much brighter. Samsung is pushing its new tablet as being ideal for entertainment, and the Tab S3's screen is sure to please those who frequently stream video and browse photos on their mobile device. Still, in my experience, the iPad Pro offered clearer and richer audio that packed more bass than Samsung's, even though both slates have four speakers. But that impressive screen may come at the cost of battery life. When using the Tab S3 and iPad Pro side-by-side over the course of a day, Samsung's battery had reached 58% while the iPad Pro's was at 73% after roughly five and a half hours of usage. Regardless, that's still plenty of juice to get you through a several daily commutes or a long flight. Both Apple and Samsung are also touting their tablets as productivity machines and have created keyboard and stylus accessories with this in mind. The Tab S3 comes with the S Pen, the same stylus that was introduced with the company's Note smartphones, and Samsung sells a compatible keyboard case for $129.99. Apple, meanwhile charges $99 for its Apple Pencil stylus and $149 for a keyboard case designed to work with the iPad Pro. This alone makes the Tab S3 a better value than the iPad: a 32GB Samsung tablet with the S Pen and keyboard costs $749, while a 32GB iPad Pro with an Apple Smart Keyboard Cover and Apple Pencil costs about $847. Plus. the Tab S3 includes a microSD card slot for adding more storage space, whereas the iPad does not. In practice, both the Apple Pencil and S Pen worked smoothly when jotting down notes and sketching doodles. I rarely find myself drawing and coloring, but I generally preferred Samsung's S Pen because it's better equipped for more practical use cases. I could, for example, translate text to another language in real time just by hovering the tip of the S Pen over a word or phrase. It's also possible to save a snippet of text from an article or create a GIF from a video simply by using the S Pen to draw a lasso around the area you'd like to extract. The Apple Pencil lacks such capabilities. I also much preferred Samsung's keyboard case over Apple's: the keys were much deeper and sturdier, making it easier to type quickly without making mistakes. It's a bit bulkier than the iPad Pro's keyboard when being used as a standard case, but it's worth the tradeoff. To truly be better than your smartphone at certain tasks, like working or web browsing, tablet software needs to take advantage of that larger screen. Both Apple and Samsung do this by offering the ability to view more than one app on screen at the same time. I found it easier to jump between apps on the iPad's split screen mode, but Samsung's allows for more flexibility. Both tablets are plenty powerful: whether I was playing games with demanding graphics, browsing the web, or editing photos, neither tablet showed signs of stuttering. I did notice, however, that when applying special effects to images using the app Prisma, the iPad processed pictures considerably faster than Samsung's tablet every time. So which tablet should you buy? The answer boils down to which one best suits your needs. Samsung surpasses Apple when it comes to screen quality, overall value, and how well its stylus and keyboard accessories work. But Apple's tablet performed slightly faster, offered better audio, and appeared to have a longer lasting battery. The decision will likely also depend on whether Android or iOS is more convenient for you. For iPhone owners, the ability to log in with your Apple ID and quickly download apps that you've already purchased, or continue iMessage threads you've started on your phone, may outweigh the benefits of a brighter, more colorful screen and a handy stylus. But Android owners and even iPhone owners that are impartial to Apple should strongly consider the Tab S3.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Patently Apple: General Notice | Main | Apple Partner TPK makes Strategic Move to Strengthen Position with Apple over Foxconn's Subsidiary GIS » March 22, 2017 Samsung Preparing for the Switch to OLED Tablets while Apple is now testing OLED iPads for the Future   Just as Apple was launching their new economical 9.7" iPad with its stunning 2048x1536 resolution Retina display, Samsung wanted to get the news out that they're preparing their switch to OLED for tablets and noting that Apple is now testing for future OLED iPads.   According to a new report published today, Samsung Display is planning to start using OLEDs for tablets' displays over LCDs. It is going to gradually reduce supply of LCDs for tablets and increase supply amount of OLEDs. It is predicted that Samsung Display will ultimately use OLEDs for entire tablets' displays. Samsung Electronics has decided to use OLEDs for tablets and laptops that will be released this year. OLED tablets are likely to roll out sometime in the second half of the year.   Yet an industry analyst stated that "It will be hard for Samsung Display to aggressively increase amount of supply of OLED panels for tablets and laptops as supply of 5 and 6-inch OLED panels for Smartphones is very tight as Samsung Display starts to supply OLED panels to Apple for its iPhones sometime during first half of this year."   The report further noted that Apple is also considering using OLEDs for its iPads. There are signs that Apple is also considering the use of OLED panels for its iPads. It is heard that Apple is internally verifying performance and quality of OLEDs that will be used for tablets. When these OLEDs pass standards, there is a possibility that Apple will use OLEDs for iPads.   It was interesting to learn that Samsung Display supplied about more than 20 million LCD panels to Apple in first quarter of last year. However during first quarter of this year, it is going to supply about 600,000 panels which is only about 3% of panels that were supplied in last first quarter.   Market research company IHS also noted that the market is estimating that Samsung Display's supplies to Apple will be further reduced to a level between 300,000 and 400,000 during second half of this year.   Samsung Display has been increasing output of OLEDs for tablets and laptops since January. While it was producing 20 million to 25 million OLEDs per month during second half of last year, now it is producing about 30 million OLEDs per month after January. Both Lenovo and HP have put out 2-in-1 laptops that are equipped with OLED panels and the trend will spread across the industry over the next two years.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

That’s because the G6 will feature a mobile payments system all its own, putting it in a position to compete with Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. LG says this mobile payment service will go live in Korea this June, but so far that’s really all the company has shared about this new G6 feature. This means that, for now, there’s no word on whether or not LG’s mobile payments system will ever leave Korea. Given that mobile payments solutions from Apple, Google, and Samsung have had quite some time to gain a user base over here in the US, LG could very well decide to keep this launch limited to a small number of regions. READ MORE: LG G6 hands-onStill, if it wants to really ramp up competition with Samsung and Apple, we could see a US launch before long. Reuters reports that LG’s mobile payment system will use magnetic secure transmission instead of NFC, making it compatible with a much larger number of card readers since it can mimic a card swipe and doesn’t require an NFC chip to be present. Android Pay and Apple Pay, on the other hand, rely on NFC, which means that LG might be able to pull some market share away from those two in regions where NFC readers aren’t as widespread. Samsung Pay, on the other hand, uses both NFC and MST, perhaps making it LG’s largest mobile payment competitor from a support standpoint. It’ll be interesting to see what LG decides to do with mobile payments after this launches in June. While LG’s decision to use MST might be beneficial for it in the long run, we have a hard time imagining that even more fragmentation is a good thing for the mobile payments space. Would you use LG’s mobile payments system, or would you stick with what you’ve got? Head down to the comments section and let us know!

The ransom demanded by the hackers reportedly stands at $75,000 in Bitcoin, or alternately $100,000 in iTunes gift cards. Conditions have been presented to Apple, specifying that if terms were not satisfied before the 7th of April, the accounts would be reset to the factory state, remotely removing all existing data. Known as the ‘Turkish Crime Family’, the group has been inconsistent with the number of stolen accounts it says it has at its disposal, figures have included 200 million, 300 million and 559 million according to reports from Motherboard. David Kennerley, Director of Threat Research at Webroot said: “If this is proven to be a legitimate breach the consequences for Apple and its millions of users would be far reaching.  There’s a lot of questions that need to be answered such as, do these hackers really have access to the data they claim? How did they get hold of such a large amount of data? Was it a vulnerability in Apple’s infrastructure or breach of third-party tool or organisation? Or does the fault lie with good old password re-usage between sites and apps from a consumer side?” The world will be watching the industry giant eagerly to see how it deals with the breach if it is true, and if it matches the scale indicated by other reports. At a time when cyber-crime has never been so ubiquitous, what is happening to Apple is a global concern for businesses. “The big question for Apple is what procedures are in place to prevent the destructive action threatened by the hackers? Without a full understanding of what the hackers really have, the true quantity and how they came by it, everything thereafter can only be a best-guess scenario,” said Kennerley. READ MORE: Abta data breach: Tens of thousands of holidaymakers hit in massive cyber attack This instance is also a further example of the growing use of ransomware within the new cyber landscape, and the reputation of big brand, organisation and company names are on the line. Dan Sloshberg, cyber resilience expert at Mimecast, said: “Ransom attacks are the most popular method used by cyber criminals today. Perpetrators have simply become too good at it and quietly paying attackers off in the event that networks are breached is quickly becoming the norm and only emboldens them further. An effective cyber resilience plan should involve stronger methods of prevention and third-party archives to get businesses back on their feet if something still gets through.” Tags Apple bitcoin breach Cybersecurity hackers Homepage News List Previous ArticleBanks, fintechs must learn to get along in order to survive regulation - report Next ArticlePowering the Internet of Things with Apache Hadoop: Four Customer Use Cases Most read 1 in 4 believe robots would make better politicians Hannah Williams 22nd March 2017 Snapchat IPO gives a glimpse into the power of software James Nunns 21st March 2017 New Gmail Phishing scam trawling for unsuspecting users Tom Ball 17th March 2017 iOS 11 Screenshot Alerts – Rumoured Apple iPhone update probably untrue Joe Clark 17th March 2017 IBM, Lloyds £1.3bn IT outsourcing deal to see 1900 staff moved to Big Blue Ellie Burns 13th March 2017 Best Android Smartwatch: Top 5 Tom Ball 11th March 2017 More hardware issues for the Google Pixel prompts several recalls Joe Clark 10th March 2017 Latest White Papers How Intel IT’s Integrated Analytics Platform Helps Sales and Marketing By Intel Le stockage de demain By Kaminario Overcome the Attacker Advantage with McAfee Endpoint Security By Intel Editor’s Pick Tech sector hailed as UK economy success story with boom in jobs, salaries & investment Ellie Burns 22nd March 2017 Automate DevOps so you can focus on a security-first culture James Nunns 21st March 2017 Samsung points finger at technology issues for UKs low productivity Tom Ball 21st March 2017 CeBit 2017: The key tech driving this year’s fair in Hannover Joe Clark 21st March 2017 What to expect from CeBIT 2017: From 5G to AI & IoT Joe Clark 17th March 2017 Related News SailPoint President: There is no perimeter anymore, defence must start from within Tom Ball 23rd March 2017 New Gmail Phishing scam trawling for unsuspecting users Tom Ball 17th March 2017 Abta data breach: Tens of thousands of holidaymakers hit in massive cyber attack Tom Ball 16th March 2017 Latest in 4th Revolution Enterprise IT New Windows dev kit delivers mixed reality apps to developers Hannah Williams 2nd March 2017 4th Revolution The Reality of the AI Revolution Ellie Burns 28th February 2017 4th Revolution Autonomous cars and drones – Ford looks into the future with ‘City of Tomorrow’ Joe Clark 27th February 2017 Latest in Analysis Productivity and profit: Is your mobility strategy mature enough?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Shutterstock Apple just killed funding for Andy Rubin’s iPhone killer Chris Smith @chris_writes March 21st, 2017 at 11:18 AM Share Tweet The man responsible for the rise of Android hasn’t been a Google employee in years. But Andy Rubin is still passionate about the smartphone business, and he’s currently working on an Android-based iPhone killer that’s supposed to launch this spring. However, before it has a chance to challenge the iPhone 8 and all the high-end Android smartphones out there, Essential Products must deal with a huge setback. The company just lost $100 million in funding, and it looks like Apple is to blame. Don't Miss: Full Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ specs revealed in latest leak In a report on the matter, The Wall Street Journal explains that SoftBank Group just scrapped a $100 million investment in Essential just as final contracts were being drawn up. People familiar with the deal say that’s a stage at which venture deals are rarely abandoned. Apple is apparently to blame for SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son’s decision to back out of the deal. Apple didn’t actively seek to block the Essential deal, the report says, But Son’s increasingly close relationship with Apple is apparently the main thing that made him reconsider the deal. Apple pledged a $1 billion investment in SoftBank’s $100 billion tech investment Vision Fund, which made Son rethink his interest in backing a competing smartphone company. SoftBank contributed $25 billion to the fund, with the Saudi Arabian government committing another $45 billion. Other tech companies including Qualcomm and Foxconn are also investors in Vision Fund. Son’s now-canceled deal would have valued Essential at $1 billion. Rubin’s company also lost a huge marketing push from SoftBank that would have run alongside the company’s first smartphone launch. Rubin’s company, which hired at least seven former Apple employees including the former lead architect of the iPad Jason Keats, is yet to announce its phone. The Journal reports that the high-end handset will run Android and will have “sleek styling.” The unnamed device will supposedly feature “a suite of home-automation products,” and will cost about as much as a new iPhone.

By Corazon Victorino On 03/22/17 AT 9:36 AM Close Apple introduced a couple of new products on Tuesday. And clearly, the launch of the Special Edition Red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the new 9.7-inch iPad and the brand new bands for the Apple Watch overshadowed the Cupertino giant’s new software releases and updates, including version 12.6 of the iTunes media player and mobile device management app.  iTunes 12.6 comes with a new feature called “Rent once, watch anywhere.” This feature is the highlight of the latest iTunes version, since it gives users the freedom to rent media content from the iTunes Store and view it anywhere with use of any supported device.  This means users who rented a movie on the Apple TV may now view the film on their iPhones or iPads, making it easier for them to watch iTunes content no matter what device they have at hand, as per 9To5Mac. Apple’s iTunes app previously restricted users from accessing borrowed content using multiple devices. Thus, it was not possible for one to start viewing content on their PC or Apple TV and continue or finish watching the same content on another supported device, like the iPhone. The one-device-only playback restriction did not allow rented media content on a certain device to appear in the iTunes library, so users couldn’t just easily pick it up with a different device from there. With the new feature, Apple Insider says Samsung’s biggest rival is accommodating consumers who have multiple devices.  Alongside the release of iTunes 12.6 is the change in Apple’s policy on rentals, so users can make the most out of the “Rent once, watch anywhere” feature. While the limit to playback time is still in place, the new feature gives users enough flexibility to efficiently access the rental service using any supported device they have. The only thing that will keep users from using the new feature for now is the fact that it requires iOS 10.3 and tvOS 10.2 to work. Both updates are already in the later stages of beta testing, so fans can expect them to arrive really soon, according to Phone Arena.  Apart from the new “Rent once, watch anywhere” feature, iTunes 12.6 is also revealed to bring with it minor app and performance improvements. For users who have yet to update their iTunes app to version 12.6, they can get this update by clicking Check for Updates in the iTunes File menu. Once the update is downloaded, it will automatically proceed with the installation.  Apple is rolling out a new version of its iTunes media player and mobile device management application.

Presumably they have a few birthdays coming up.  The group is giving Apple until 7 April to cough up, and although it told Motherboard that it has access to over 300 million @iCloud and @me email accounts, a Twitter account allegedly belonging to the group claims that, if the deadline is not met, 200 million devices will be wiped (below).  What's more, another self-proclaimed member of the Turkish Crime Family reportedly said that they had access to 559 million email accounts.  200 Million iCloud accounts will be factory reset on April 7 2017 — Turkish Crime Family (@turkcrimefamily) March 21, 2017 "I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing," a member of so-called Turkish Crime Family told the website.  While the hackers' story isn't exactly consistent, Motherboard has seen a YouTube video allegedly published by the hackers, which shows them logging into some of the stolen accounts. "The hacker appears to access an elderly woman's iCloud account, which includes backed-up photos, and the ability to remotely wipe the device," the report notes.  The publication was also provided screenshots of alleged emails between the group and members of Apple's security team.  During its conversation with the self-styled hackers, Apple points out that while it has abug bounty program, its policy goes against rewarding 'cyber criminals' with any compensation. "We firstly kindly request you to remove the video that you have uploaded on your YouTube channel as it's seeking unwanted attention, second of all we would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law," it says.  In a statement provided to Forbes, however, Apple has trashed the hackers claims. "There have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems including iCloud and Apple ID," the spokesperson said. "The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services. µ Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   Topics Security Apple cloud computing Mobile Security INQ Latest Half of Android devices are still not getting security patches But Google is working with vendors to make it easier Security 23 March 2017 Super Mario Run for Android is now available at Google Play Plumber finally clears blockage Games 23 March 2017 Apple acquires IFTTT rival Workflow and makes it free Deal hints at deep automation in iOS Applications 23 March 2017 'Windows 10 has a keylogger' story is back, three years after we first broke it Yeah.

Explore more:  apple video video content AR Apple Launches New Creative Video App 'Clips' to Showcase Video Potential March 22, 2017 Andrew Hutchinson Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Apple is investing heavily in augmented reality (AR) - and that Apple CEO Tim Cook is so high on AR’s potential that he’s likened it to the ubiquity of the smartphone. “At some point, [Cook] said last year, we will all "have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you." But in order to capitalize on this potential, Apple’s going to need to introduce new devices and tools to give users a way to use these new AR functions. Bloomberg notes that Apple’s working on several AR products - including “digital spectacles that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and beam content - movies, maps and more - to the wearer”. And this week, we’ve seen another step in this direction, with Apple announcing a new iOS video editing app called ‘Clips'. Clips enables users to create custom video clips which they can adorn with various graphics and overlays, similar to Snapchat. As explained by Apple: “The app features a unique design for combining video clips, photos and music into great-looking videos to share with friends through the Messages app, or on Instagram, Facebook and other popular social networks.” So rather than trying to go head-to-head with the social giants, Clips is more of a complimentary tool, a means for Apple to tap into the popularity of such options without creating their own social network. But that being the case, Clips would also seem to have less potential – without the engagement of a social network, Clips is only reliant on downloads as a measure to monetize, if that’s what Apple was aiming to do. But then again, that may not be the end goal – Clips may just be a way for Apple to highlight the potential of their hardware, and offer more tools to lead into their augmented reality functions. Imagine, for example, if Apple started to introduce more advanced tools into Clips that caught on amongst younger audiences. That could become a reason why they might want to buy an iOS device over Android. It’s unlikely, you’d think, that Clips would reach that level, but given their aforementioned bets on AR, maybe this is the test vehicle they need to showcase their capabilities. One of Clips’ big features out of the gate is something Apple’s calling ‘Live Titles’: “Live Titles is a breakthrough feature that lets users create animated captions and titles using just their voice. Fun effects including comic book filters, speech bubbles, shapes and full-screen animated posters help bring out the personality in videos made with Clips.” These are the sorts of elements Clips will enable Apple to showcase, next level tools beyond those available on Facebook or Snapchat. “Captions are generated automatically as a user speaks, and appear on screen perfectly synced with the user’s voice. Users can mix and match different styles, and tap any title to adjust text and punctuation, or even add inline emoji. Live Titles supports 36 different languages.” In addition, Clips has “dozens of music soundtracks to choose from, and they automatically adjust to match the length of a video.” And when you share Clips via message, Clips will also suggest who to share your videos with, based on who appears in your video. It’s an interesting move by Apple – maybe not game-changing, and it’s not really a competitor for Snapchat and Facebook, as such, but it moves in line with user trends around video and creative tools, and gives Apple a way in to showcase their capacity in this regard. There’s definitely potential there, and it could be a great accompaniment for your video process.  Author Information Andrew Hutchinson @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

The finance ministry has refused to concede the demand for slashing Customs duties on completely-knocked-down and semi-knocked-down units of devices that are to be assembled in India. However, on the same day the company’s primary assembler, Taiwan-based Foxconn, sought support for exporting mobile phones. It also reiterated its demand for removing Customs duties on imported components. The company’s Managing Director and Country Head Josh Foulger on Tuesday raised the issues after meeting Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, sources said. Apple, as well as Foxconn, seeks the removal of import duties on inward shipments of components that will go into the iPhone. The demand, which reached the finance ministry, was for duty exemption both before the goods and services tax regime and after it came into existence. With the fine print of the goods and services tax regime yet to be decided upon, the finance ministry had refused the demand, sources said. Apple has ruled out the option of locally sourcing the components that form its products, arguing that high technology and precision parts are not available in the country. On that note, it had sought exemption from the mandatory local sourcing of inputs for its products. In January, executives of Apple, led by Senior Vice-President (Operations) Priya Balasubramaniam, had apprised an inter-ministerial panel of their intentions to set up manufacturing units in the country, provided their demands for concessions were met. While the government is yet to take a call on the company’s proposal, the inter-ministerial panel, which is examining the list of concession demands, is set to meet soon, according to a senior government official. Officials of the revenue department, department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) and the Union ministries of electronics and information technology and environment, which constitute the inter-ministerial panel, had registered their disapproval with the DIPP over Apple receiving special treatment. They have warned that this could create an unfair playing field or give rise to demands by other companies for retroactive measures by the government. Another Taiwan-based partner for Apple, Winstron Corporation, has initiated plans to start assembling the iPhone SE model in Bengaluru. It is one among the few original design manufacturers Apple employs to build its iPhones. The company has won contracts abroad to manufacture lower-cost iPhone 5c, 5s, and SE devices, while larger partners such as Foxconn have handled the production of flagship iPhone models. The iPhone SE, launched in March 2016, was seen as Apple’s weapon to win in emerging markets. However, the device saw slow sales in India after being priced at close to Rs 40,000, in a market where seven out of 10 smartphones sold cost less than Rs 10,000. Nearly 45 per cent of Apple’s iPhone sales revenue are accounted for by models like the iPhone 5s, which cost less than Rs 20,000 on popular online retail channels in the country.

Smartphones got us there, AI will take us further by Walt Mossberg@waltmossberg Mar 22, 2017, 9:00am EDT share tweet Linkedin Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Recode. It’s often hard to remember that the personal computing era is still quite young. It only dates from 1977, with the arrival of the first mass-market PCs. These were the first computing devices meant for individuals that weren’t kits, had screens and keyboards, and could actually do something useful, like word processing, game play, or, eventually, spreadsheets. The best known of these, the Apple II, which remained on the market in various forms until 1993, will have its 40th anniversary in June. That makes mass-market personal computing younger than the Super Bowl, Starbucks, and Disneyland. The Apple II is about to be 40 years old You can trace a pretty straight line from these first machines to the laptop, tablet or smartphone you’re using right now. They are all personal computers, with the smartphone being the most used today. Those 1977 models (which included entries from Commodore and Tandy) are also the forebears of the web, Facebook, Google, and pretty much whatever else you’re using on whatever digital device is at hand. The information “appliance” But almost right from the start, and right through the 1990s and even the early 2000s, the quest was on, at least among some, for computing devices to become “appliances” or “information appliances” — that is, dead-simple to use, without training or the need for a manual. I know: the push for greater ease of use was a defining principle of my own tech column in The Wall Street Journal, which launched in 1991 and continued for 22 years. Of course, the standard for this “appliance”-level of ease of use changed over time. The bar was pretty low in 1977, when, according to Wikipedia, the then-influential Byte magazine said the Apple II "may be the first product to fully qualify as the 'appliance computer' ... a completed system which is purchased off the retail shelf, taken home, plugged in and used." This, despite the fact that it used a command-line interface, needed an audio cassette recorder to store its apps and data, and took plenty of effort to master. For many years, even as users became more sophisticated, personal computers took too much effort to use without problem-solving, keeping alive the yearning for greater simplicity. Microsoft’s dominant Windows platform, in particular, was a home for all manner of bugs and problems that required IT people to straighten out. Of course, a significant minority of people enjoyed solving these problems and loved to hack and modify PCs. But not mainstream users. Even Apple’s Macs, which were generally much simpler and more secure, got more buggy and fell behind as the company faltered in the 1990s, and didn’t hit their current stride for years thereafter. During that era, I tested many digital devices that claimed to be appliances, a few of which were even mildly successful. I reviewed one of them as late as 2005, a device called the Pepper Pad, which was kind of what an iPad might have been with worse designers and an even higher base price. I wasn’t crazy about it. Only the Palm Pilot, and its descendant, the Treo, came close to the dream, but they were limited and lacked large platform ecosystems. (Despite its popularity, the BlackBerry for too long was largely an enterprise-focused email terminal with few apps.) The iPhone changed everything In 2007, everything changed with the iPhone. As crippled as that first model now seems, with its lack of apps and glacial cellular connectivity, the iPhone was a practical, useful, self-contained computer a child could understand. It was an information appliance. And it became even more so with the advent of the App Store the next year. Today, it seems boring to many tech fans, but the iPhone broke through the last barrier that allowed everybody to do a wide range of tasks on a speedy computer. And that was followed up in 2008 by Android. It took years to sand off the rough edges and get the hardware right, but Android devices added qualities the iPhone lacked: they sold for less and allowed for lots of customization. Are we done looking for the perfect information appliance? Nope Then came the iPad in 2010, to add a large screen and more PC-like apps to the iPhone template. By the 2010s, almost everybody in the developed world, it seemed, had a powerful digital device that took little or no special skills or training to use. So, are we done with the quest for the perfect information appliance? Nope. The next stage We’ve already begun the next stage. You might call it the quest for the Starship Enterprise computer — the one that you can just talk to when you need information, or to get a task done, to be entertained or to record a moment. It will require perfect conversational ability, sensors of every kind and limitless storage, prodigious, always-learning artificial intelligence, access to almost infinite personal data, and knowledge about nearly everything. These are all huge steps to take, and they will all require massive investment and more than a few failed first attempts. But every major computer company is pursuing this goal, in one form or another, as are researchers and smaller companies unknown to us yet. So far, we see only the glimmers of this future in things like Siri, Alexa, Cortana, and the Google Assistant. These voice-activated “assistants” often live on existing laptops, smartphones, and tablets. They also now come in their own hardware, notably the Amazon Echo and the Google Home device. But, even from today’s vantage point, we all know they are very crude. When I asked Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos last year if we were in the first inning of the quest for these artificially intelligent, conversational devices, he said it was even earlier than that: “It might even be the first guy’s up at bat.” I suspect that today’s mass-market AI software and hardware will, in only 10 years or so, look as primitive and quaint as the Apple II does now. And when they get all of that figured out? Well, some other perfect information appliance will still be waiting, just out of reach.

At a Glance Arq Macworld Rating Learn more on Haystack Software There have never been so many options to clone, backup, and archive data from your Mac. And there have never been so few options for local networked backup. With Apple’s Time Machine and Time Capsule eating the heart out of the basic backup market for connected and networked archives, and several competing cloud-hosted services owning flat-rate unlimited storage, it’s hard for any developer to compete. Code42’s CrashPlan and Econ Technologies’ ChronoSync are players in the game. CrashPlan offers a single software client that can copy data to a connected volume, a LAN-hosted volume, a friend’s Internet-reachable drive, or its own for-fee cloud service that has an unlimited storage option. ChronoSync is a ridiculously full-featured clone, mirror, and sync package that works with local and network-mounted drives (including Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices), and also with Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) and Google Cloud Storage, as well as via SFTP (Secure FTP). However, CrashPlan’s home flavor relies on Java after promises years ago to migrate to native software as the firm has done for its business customers. The software is funky and inconsistent, as I’ve found on two different Macs (though it runs fine on others in my family’s network). And it uses a proprietary format for archiving. ChronoSync is a fantastic option, but so deeply and comprehensively fleshed out, I’m afraid that it requires a relatively high amount of sophistication to use it well. I’ve spent many hours with it and have mastered it, but it’s too high a burden for more casual users. This is where Arq comes in—and stands out. The affordably priced backup software ($50) is native, more reliable and easier to use than CrashPlan, more focused on backups and simpler than ChronoSync, and has a unique twist: it can back up data to Amazon’s consumer-focused Amazon Cloud Drive service. Amazon’s data hosting costs a flat $60 a year for unlimited storage, making it competitive with Backblaze, CrashPlan, and other hosted services. Arq can also back up to Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive, which some people may already be paying for, and which don’t charge for moving data in and out. While ChronoSync can archive to cloud services, it currently works only with those that charge for data transferred and data stored. I ran Arq through its paces with several cloud storage services, local storage, and networked storage. (Arq also comes in a native Windows version, which I didn’t test, but has feature parity.) A basic backup with accessible options Arq is closest to Backblaze, or even Apple’s long-ago Backups app, in terms of reducing complexity and focusing on documents. For straightforward backups with a history of revisions, Arq requires just selecting folders and one or more destinations. You can dig in a little deeper to exclude certain directories or kinds of files or customize a backup schedule and other parameters by destination. I’d say Time Machine is even simpler, but Time Machine offers effectively no options, and Apple’s built-in archiver is meant to offer a complete restoration of a disk as well as the ability to select older versions of modified files. Arq is not a cloner: you’ll want to use Time Machine, SuperDuper, Carbon Carbon Cloner, or the cloning mode in ChronoSync for that purpose. In the simplest setup, you follow these steps: Set up a backup destination (see “Choose backup destinations,” below). Choose a password that you carefully store somewhere (more on that in “Encryption,” below). Agree to a prompt to back up your Home folder. Walk away. It then just runs hourly indefinitely. Arq stores incremental backups, uploading only changed chunks of files, and can restore by reassembling pieces across time that relate to the version you want. This is a common strategy. You can change the interval and times of day when a backup runs or set it to run only on a manual request. You aren’t limited to your Home folder: you can backup any folder you select, although because of its approach in backing up, I’d recommend avoiding system files, which is true of many backup programs that don’t perform a full clone operation. When it adds your Home folder, Arq excludes the same files and locations as Time Machine. But you can configure your own exclusions by unchecking files and folders in a browser list. You can also use one or more matching conditions for file/folder names as well regular expressions used on the full file path. As you add folders by destination, they appear in a simple list at left under Configure Backups. Beneath that, there’s a corresponding set of entries for Restore Files. Each backup appears under a folder for both Configure and Restore showing the backup dates. Restoration needs an upgrade Restoring files is a little chunkier than backing up, and more sophisticated software often has better options to assemble a set of items to retrieve. With Arq, you either drill down through a source to a folder to a given date-and-time backup, and then browse a folder and file hierarchy, or you can search across all backups. In search results, Arq only shows a file path, like /Users/Home/billg/Documents/dog1.jpg instead of a more friendly icon-based hierarchy, and it doesn’t reveal from which backup each file or folder comes in the list. IDG Browsing backups works better than searching for files, but you can’t make multiple selections, among other awkwardness. If you browse through a given backup set from a destination, Arq labels folders and files changed, added, or deleted since the last backup, and labels all files with the last modified date, whether they were modified or not. However, when you search, the only information shows is the date and time of the backup of which the result is part, and the backup source isn’t identified, either. This is sub-par. IDG The search results for checking backups doesn’t provide enough information to choose among different versions. While Arq’s selection options are frankly just about as clunky and frustrating as most other backup client software, its biggest flaw is that you can only select one file or folder at a time, either for dragging to the Finder (where it restores in the place you dragged) or using the Restore button, which offers to overwrite or restore into a separate folder in the original location from which files were backed up. IDG The overwrite dialog for restoring files doesn’t fully explain all the outcomes. Even that overwrite/write-alongside option is confusing: the dialog offers Do Not Overwrite, Cancel, and Overwrite, while the text explains that Arq is “downloading and replacing only the modified and missing files with the files from the backup.” That’s only true with Overwrite; click Do Not Overwrite, and Arq puts the entire selection in a folder in that nested location. This is good behavior, but explained poorly. Arq desperately needs multiple selections and non-contiguous ones, as well as other ways to retrieve files besides dragging and overwriting. Other software and services have varying approaches that make it easier to get to the right place at the right time. It’s primarily for a failure to have richer and more robust restore options that I gave Arq four mice instead of five. Choose backup destinations Beyond simplicity, Arq’s best point is supporting so many different kinds of backup destinations. As noted at the outset, it works with conventional cloud-storage offerings, Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage, which effectively charge for data transfer and then lease you storage on a per-gigabyte monthly pro-rated basis. But Arq also connects with Amazon Cloud Drive (unlimited storage for $60 a year), paid tiers of Dropbox (1TB, 2TB, and unlimited flavors from $8.25 to $20 per month), Google Drive (1TB for $10 a month), and Microsoft OneDrive (1TB for $6 a month). Many people through work or for personal use already have a cloud subscription, and Arq lets you leverage what you’re already paying instead of adding another monthly or yearly fee on top. Arq can also connect to any server that supports SFTP (Secure FTP), a long-available secured file-transfer protocol built on top of SSH (Secure Shell) for remote server access. It’s part of macOS’s Remote Access service in the Sharing system preference pane. And Arq can back up to any folder or volume you can select through a standard dialog box, which includes NAS devices and other Macs over AFP or SMB. This diversity of options and the ability to work with Amazon Cloud Drive puts Arq above the pack. While many hosted backup services cost between $4 to $6 month per computer for unlimited storage, they control all remote access to your files, and all of them only back up to their own data stores. IDG Arq provides access and cost insight into usage-based cloud-storage options. Arq has some nice subtleties in how you work with destination cloud services, letting you choose among different tiers of Amazon and Google’s usage-based storage services that are priced based on how frequently you might need to retrieve the data. Arq puts a friendly interface particularly in front of Amazon Glacier, an appropriately named “cold storage” service that’s meant for essentially long-term reliable storage of data you may never need to retrieve. Retrieval costs with Glacier vary, too, and Arq lets you select among three options. IDG Every destination can have settings for frequency and time of day set, as well as a data or cost budget and thinning interval. And in what is a fantastic option for managing storage limits and costs, you can set a backup budget in storage size or cost: Arq will cull pieces of files related to older versions when you exceed the budget, but will also ensure it has one complete backup, even if it goes over that total. The monetary cost appears for backup methods that charge in units and for which Arq can calculate storage costs; otherwise, you see storage a limit. You can set an interval during which to enforce the budget and perform a manual cull. A common scenario is when you have large files that you modify frequently enough and that use a data storage format that ripples changes throughout. A 100MB file could balloon to occupy tens of gigabytes or more over time if you don’t cull past versions. You can also set a global preference in Arq > Preferences > Advanced labeled “Thin backups from hourly to daily to weekly.” On each backup, Arq retains no more than one backup per week per file, one month worth of daily backups, and one day of hourly backups. With a budget enabled, that culling also happens in reverse order from weekly to daily to hourly to stay within the budget. IDG Arq can avoid backing up to certain Wi-Fi networks (and certain network interfaces, not shown). On the throughput side, it’s hard to provide a precise answer. I have gigabit Internet, and was able to see 100 Mbps to 200 Mbps throughput for uploading files to top-tier cloud destinations, which is impressive given the degree of scanning and encryption involved. Amazon Cloud Backup was about a tenth as fast as Amazon S3, which is not a surprise given the market for each service. For locally connected storage, I seemed to max out at 100 Mbps over USB 3.0 to a hard drive, which is far below the drive’s top rate. (You can set a network throttle in preferences, and tell Arq to use only certain network interfaces and Wi-Fi networks, too.) Arq’s one flaw in backup locations is that it doesn’t store credentials (all the login information) separately from destinations. If you’re using different kinds of storage at Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, or different folders for SFTP, you have to go through the login process each time. That could be simplified with a credentials manager, used by file-transfer software like Transmit and Arq quasi-competitor ChronoSync. I suspect, however, most Arq users aren’t using lots of locations at the same service. And the pain is one time: once set up, you don’t have to repeat it. Encryption Several hosted backup services let you “own” your encryption keys, but some of those transmit the keys (in a secure fashion) to their servers, which handle part of the encryption or decryption process for backing up and restoring. Not controlling your keys or having them transmitted to a server for any reason puts your data security at risk from hackers, vandals, and governments (your own and others). It’s a set of tradeoffs. (I wrote extensively about these tradeoffs in September 2016.) All data is encrypted by Arq before it leaves your computer or before it’s stored locally in a folder using standard encryption elements, similar to the git version-control system. (You can read the full details.) It seems well conceived to me. You pick a passphrase each time you start using a destination. The passphrase can be identical across all your destinations or re-used across some or all. The app generates random keys for encryption for each destination, and then encrypts those keys using your passphrase, which is transformed through an algorithm into an encryption key. That encrypted file with the destination keys is stored with the backup. IDG You set your own passphrase for each destination’s encryption keys.

A hacker or group of hackers is threatening to wipe up to 200 million iCloud and other Apple email accounts unless paid a hefty ransom by Apple. According to Motherboard, hackers identifying themselves as ‘Turkish Crime Family’ have threatened to wipe the accounts unless they receive $75,000 worth of the crypto-currencies Bitcoin or Ethereum or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards. The hackers provided Motherboard with evidence of communication between themselves and Apple’s security team, including screenshots of alleged emails and a YouTube video of them seemingly logging into some of the accounts they are threatening to wipe. A screenshot of email communication (not the actual mail itself) between Apple’s security team and the hackers, provided to Motherboard, read: "We firstly kindly request you to remove the video that you have uploaded on your YouTube channel as it's seeking unwanted attention, second of all we would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law. Advertisement Motherboard claim that there were inconsistencies in some of the claims made by the hackers, including the number of accounts they had access to, and that the hackers have threatened to wipe the accounts by April 7 if Apple don’t answer their ransom demands.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple’s ‘Teardrop’ Design For The iPhone 8 Will Resemble The iPhone 2G, Claim Korean Sources By Ramish Zafar Mar 20, 2017 15Shares Share Tweet Submit When compared to the Galaxy S8, Apple’s iPhone 8 isn’t that frequent in its rumor mill appearances. Given that a good six months are left until the device is launched, the leaks will speed up in the coming months. Not that we don’t have a lot of information on the device already. Apple will celebrate its iconic smartphone’s tenth anniversary with a lot of overdue upgrades. Today, we’ve got some details for the design of the iPhone 8. The Apple iPhone 8 Will Feature a ‘Teardrop’ Design, Claims Leak Out of Korea Out of all the places, today, we’ve got a Korean leak for the iPhone 8. Korean firm Samsung, Apple’s top smartphone rival will launch the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in a week or so. The pair will feature a lot of upgrades, which will also make it to the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8, like the Galaxy S8 will feature a curved screen, with drastically small top and bottom bezels. Given the display’s nature, you’ll see side bezels completely removed as well, marking for a nice design win. Related Could Apple Reveal an Accessory That Transforms Both iPhone and iPad Into a Functional Notebook? Speaking of design, publication ETNews claims to have more information on the matter. The smartphone will give us a glimpse of the past. The original iPhone, launched in 2007, featured a sloping back. The four edges of the device’s rear met the screen, marking for a ‘teardrop’ approach, which also suits ergonomics. The iPhone 8 will now follow a similar approach. Advertisement Glass also gets a mention for the iPhone 8. According to the publication’s sources, “Apple adopted a three-dimensional (D) glass material on the back case of the iPhone 8 (tentative name). This 3D glass case makes curves around the top, bottom, left and right edges. The edge curve is said to be more gentle and rounded than the existing metal case edges“. Apple will introduce wireless charging on the iPhone, for which glass will make for a much better material choice as compared to aluminum. Talking about the front, don’t expect the iPhone 8 to completely resemble Samsung’s ‘Edged’ Galaxy S and Note devices. Rather, sources speculate a 2.5D display for the device. For the iPhone 8, its display won’t completely curve to the sides. Rather, the slope will be just enough to remove bezels and a seamless transition to the back. Apple’s known for its design prowess and stakes are high this year. Let’s hope the company delivers.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Mar 22, 2017 at 8:29AM With Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares currently trading at all-time highs, a question that has been indubitably nagging every Apple shareholder (myself included) is: How much further can shares run? While Apple remains cheap by traditional valuation metrics, it's relatively more expensive; shares have jumped 20% in the past three months alone, even as they still trade at a meaningful discount to the S&P 500. It's tough to imagine a $735 billion company growing even further, but Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi thinks it's quite possible (via Tech Trader Daily). Word on the Street Bernstein reiterated its outperform rating earlier this week, while boosting its price target from $140 to $160. For those keeping score at home, $160 would translate into a market cap of nearly $840 billion. There are a few main themes that underpin Sacconaghi's bullishness. Apple Store in Palo Alto. Image source: Apple. First of all is the increasing likelihood of some sort of repatriation holiday under the Trump administration. If such an event were to occur, Apple could bring back a mountain of money at favorable tax rates to 1. fund capital returns, 2. pay down debt that has been funding most of said capital returns to date, and 3. throw a massive party. If Apple were to go all out with share repurchases and buy back 10% of all outstanding shares, shares could potentially even be worth as much as $170, in Sacconaghi's view. The cost to buy back 10% of shares would be an incredible $74 billion, which is about a third of the $230 billion that Apple currently holds overseas. There are a few different forms that a repatriation holiday could take, so the devil will be in the details. As accretive as Apple's share repurchase program has been thus far, buying back 10% of shares outstanding would be massively accretive. The Mac maker has ambitious plans to double its services business by 2020, and as services become an increasingly important part of the business, some multiple expansion is warranted given the higher profitability and scalability of services. There are several routes that Apple can take to get there, but it's clear that this is a top strategic priority for the company. Recent concerns around gross margin also appear to be fading away, according to Sacconaghi. And of course, who can forget the upcoming 10th-generation iPhone that has the potential to spur a huge upgrade cycle. Considering the current rumors around a $1,000 OLED iPhone, Apple could enjoy quite a bit of revenue upside based on the pricing alone, even before factoring in unit growth. Hopefully, the iPhone maker delivers on both fronts, which could trigger a wave of upward earnings revisions. Even though Apple continues to push into uncharted territory, there are numerous reasons why the rally could still have legs. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple announces updated iPad Air, iPad mini units, will go on sale this Friday Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, March 22nd, 2017, 05:19 Category: Hardware, iPad, News, Processors, retail The new iPads were announced today. And it looks like there’s some good stuff coming your way at a decent price. Apple has bolstered the low end of its iPad lineup and discontinued the iPad Air 2. In its place is a new model that looks exactly the same, with a 9.7-inch retina screen, Touch ID, 32GB or 128GB of storage, and the same color choices (silver, gold, and space gray). The tablet sports an A9 processor identical to the one found in the iPhone 6s and the usual 10-hour battery. That’s a relatively small upgrade over the 8X chip that was in the iPad Air 2, but the price for the entry-level iPad has dropped from $399 to $299, which was once the price of the iPad mini. For an additional $100, you can quadruple the storage to 128GB. As always, the cellular version of the iPad retails for another $130. The new entry-level iPad doesn’t feature the Smart Connector or Apple Pencil support, but there’s still some nifty stuff there. Apple also released its fourth-gen iPad mini. The 7.8-inch tablet is the only model that doesn’t feature 32GB of storage. The company has discontinued the iPad mini 2, and the mini 4 now comes with just one storage option, 128GB, for the same price of $399. The fourth-gen iPad mini still features the two-year-old A8 processor and it looks like the unit will be phased out within a year or so. Apple’s iPad lineup now looks like this: at the low end, there’s the 32GB $329 9.7-inch iPad, followed by the $399 128GB mini. Then there’s the $599 9.7-inch 32GB iPad Pro, and the $799 12.9-inch Pro with 32 GB of storage. The new iPads will go on sale Friday, March 24 in the U.S. and more the 20 countries. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

CORRECTING and REPLACING GRAPHIC Apple’s iPhone 6s Topped List of Best-Selling Smartphones for 2016, IHS Markit Says Most-shipped smartphones globally in 2016. Source: IHS Markit Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Most-shipped smartphones globally in 2016. Source: IHS Markit Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail CORRECTION...by IHS Markit March 22, 2017 11:17 AM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Please replace the graphic with the accompanying corrected graphic. The release reads: APPLE’S IPHONE 6S TOPPED LIST OF BEST-SELLING SMARTPHONES FOR 2016, IHS MARKIT SAYS In terms of shipments, the iPhone 6s from Apple bested all competitors for sales in 2016, according to new analysis from IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO), a world leader in critical information, analytics and solutions. If looking at the fourth quarter alone, the new iPhone 7 was the 2016 best-seller, followed by iPhone 7 Plus, based on research from the IHS Markit Smartphone Shipment Database, which tracks quarterly shipment data for more than 350 smartphone models. Apple again has demonstrated that its new iPhones integrate enough innovations and new features to drive sales and remain successful in the market. The company is also capable of selling older devices for an extended period of time. For instance, the year-old iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were both among the most-shipped models in 2016. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and S7 ranked fifth and ninth, respectively. Sales of these two devices have outperformed their immediate predecessors, S6 and S6 Edge: the combined shipments of S7 and S7 Edge in 2016 were 10 million higher than S6 and S6 Edge over the same period. The Note 7 recall has left S7 and S7 Edge, released in March 2016, the best flagships in the premium line-up of Samsung. Since then, the market has seen a series of premium smartphones by other companies. Samsung’s ability to drive the sales of older premium devices was impressive. Aggressive promotions, which included bundling with Gear VR, helped sales of S7 and S7 Edge. Samsung claimed five spots out of the top 10 most-shipped smartphones in 2016. Excluding the aforementioned S7 and S7 Edge, the remaining three models all belong to the mid-tier J series. The company has seen shipment unit gains in the mid to low-tier segment, relative to 2015, due to growth in emerging markets. Huawei, the third largest smartphone maker after Apple and Samsung, did not have any models in the top 10 most-shipped smartphones in 2016. Similar to Samsung, Huawei continues to address multiple smartphone pricing segments – either with its own Huawei-branded handsets or with those of its sub-brand, Honor. In the premium segment, Huawei’s P9 was among its own top five most-shipped smartphone models in 2016, performing better than previous flagships. Chinese manufacturer OPPO had one model on the top ten ranking. In 2016, OPPO posted growth of 109 percent in smartphone shipments to become the fourth largest smartphone maker in terms of unit shipment, up from the seventh spot in 2015. Unlike Huawei, OPPO has a smaller product portfolio and operates in fewer markets, with more than 80 percent of the company’s 2016 shipments within its home market of China.

The two major tech companies are mainly known for competing in the mobile operating system department, well it doesn’t end there. Apple and Google are also battling each other in the smartphone industry with their iPhone and Nexus smartphone offerings. Even though Google has parted ways with its Nexus brand, the most memorable fight between Apple and Google has taken place in 2013. Apple launched its highly popular iPhone 5S and Google teamed up with LG and launched Nexus 5. The two smartphones have been going at each other ever since. Today we’re going to pin the two against each other in the hardware department and see which one truly has the upper hand. Without any further ado, let’s jump into it. Apple iPhone 5S vs Google Nexus 5: Hardware Power The Cupertino based tech giant is known for installing its own-made processors on all of its products. Therefore, iPhone 5S is fueled by a dual-core Apple A7 chipset. The processor has been clocked at 1.3GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based) and it’s coupled with an PowerVR G6430 quad-core graphics processing unit. Additionally, iPhone 5’s processor is also paired with 1GB of DDR3 RAM. These hardware parts make iPhone 5S highly popular to this day. On the other hand, we have the LG-made Nexus 5. Even though LG is the manufacturer behind Nexus 5, Google has decided to go with one of Qualcomm’s highly impressive quad-core Snapdragon 800 chipsets. The processor clocks at 2.3GHz Krait 400 and it is paired with an Adreno 330 graphics processing unit alongside 2GB of RAM. Apple iPhone 5S vs Google Nexus 5: Final Thoughts Considering the fact that both smartphones have been launched in 2013, they are quite impressive. Although Google’s smartphone is a tad more powerful than iPhone 5S. With that big said, we have to give it to Nexus 5 because it sports a faster processor and a larger amount of RAM. In fact, Nexus 5 is still being used as a daily driver today despite its age, and all of this is thanks to its impressive hardware performance.

Apple is one of the biggest tech manufacturers in the world and it also has the largest fan base in the industry. This is why it’s completely understandable why the internet is buzzing with rumors about the company’s upcoming products. The Cupertino based tech giant is known for always unveiling its devices in the nick of time without any announcement but this time, we got lucky and Apple’s supply chain started leaking out information. As everyone knows already, Apple is preparing to refresh its iPhone smartphone offering this year but that’s not all. The Cupertino based tech giant is also preparing four brand new iPad Pro 2 models that are going to be unveiled during 2017. Even though there will be four iPad models, the most anticipated one is the 10.5 inch one. Today we’re going to go together over everything we know about iPad Pro 2 10.5 inch’s specs. Apple iPad Pro 2 10.5 inch: Display and Accessories The reason why the entire world is highly anticipating Apple’s devices is because the company is said to equip them with an innovative edge-to-edge display. This is why iPad Pro 2 10.5 inch will be able to feature the same display size as iPad Pro 2 9.7 inch. The fact that Apple has managed to shrunk down the top and bottom bezels will also make the upcoming tablet look very sleek. In terms of accessories, iPad Pro 2 10.5 inch will more than surely support Apple’s Smart Keyboard. We can be sure of this because Apple’s iPad Pro lineup has been marketed as being capable of replacing a laptop therefore a keyboard is quite necessary. Apple iPad Pro 2 10.5 inch: Hardware Power When it comes to hardware power, Apple takes matters into its own hands and develops its own chipsets. The entire iPad Pro 2 lineup is expected to be powered by the company’s own A10X processor that’s going to offer the same hardware power as iPhone 7’s A10 chipset. What’s interesting is that Apple seems to always install “X” chipset series on its tablets. Nonetheless, we can be sure that this year is going to be a good one for Apple fans.

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. The tech industry seems to be ruled by Samsung and Apple. The two companies clash against each other on a daily basis and this has been going on for a couple of years now. When it comes to sales, Samsung has the upper hand but that’s mostly because Samsung has launched a wider range of devices along the years. There’s another reason though, Samsung’s devices seem to have a longer expiration date in comparison with what Apple’s products. A great example of that would be none other than 2014’s Galaxy Tab S 10.5 inch. The aforementioned tablet is still being used to this day despite its age. Thanks to the fact that Samsung has equipped it with impressive specs, Galaxy Tab S 10.5 inch is than capable of providing owners with stable performances but how well does it fare against one of Apple’s latest iPad Pro? Let’s find out. Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 inch vs Apple iPad Pro 9.7 inch: Display As its name implies, Samsung’s tablet ships with a 10.5 inch panel. The display uses Super AMOLED technology and it presents a large pixel resolution of 2560 x 1600. Even better, the display ships with an impressive pixel density of 288 ppi. On the other hand, we have the 2016 iPad Pro 9.7 inch model. Apple has fitted the 9.7 inch panel with IPS LCD technology that’s able of putting up a pixel resolution of 1536 x 2048 and pixel density of 264 ppi. Surprisingly, even though Galaxy Tab S 10.5 inch was launched in 2014 it still presents a higher pixel resolution than iPad Pro 9.7 inch. Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 inch vs Apple iPad Pro 9.7 inch: Hardware Power The South Korean tech giant has equipped the tablet with its own made Exynos 5-core 5420 chipset. The processor has been clocked at 1.9GHz and it is coupled with an ARM Mali-T628 MP6 graphics processing unit alongside 3GB of RAM. Apple has also equipped iPad Pro 9.7 inch with its own A9X chipset. This processor is significantly faster clocking in at 2.2GHz. In addition, Apple has also paired the chipset with a PowerVR Series 7XT graphics processing unit and 2GB of RAM. Although Galaxy Tab S 10.5 inch is impressive when it comes to hardware power, we have to give it to Apple in this category. The Cupertino based tech giant has managed to create one of its fastest processors yet and this is why iPad Pro 9.7 inch wins this brief comparison.

Reuters/Fabian Bimmer Augmented Reality (AR) seems to be the next big thing in the smartphone industry. There are reports that Apple is working on an AR headset to connect to iPhone 8. Moreover, Samsung may also implement AR features in its upcoming flagship Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. Apple CEO Tim Cook believes that AR will keep his company at the top and may someday even supplant the iPhone. Bringing AR to the masses would be an incredible strategy on Apple’s part to keep the next generation wedded to the company and its technology. The company has already reportedly set up a team with some of the most-talented experts in the tech field. These people have been instrumental in the success of Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets. The Cupertino tech giant has also acquired several small tech firms that work with AR hardware, VR software and 3D gaming. A Bloomberg report states that the company is working on several AR products that can connect wirelessly to an iPhone and beam content to the wearer. AR may come sooner to iPhone than expected. AR is still a niche offering than a mainstream product. The technology is less-intrusive and is easier to sell, believes the iPhone-maker. Much like the Apple Watch, the AR glasses being developed by Apple will have to be tethered to the iPhone. However, if the technology has to be popular, the company must bring a great deal of content from day one. The battery life of the products must also be excellent. Apple Watch somewhere failed to connect with the masses. With Cook hinting at AR being a core technology for the company, numerous tech experts and analysts are now speculating how Apple will use this technology in all its products. Meanwhile, Samsung has recently teased fans with a video ad for the Galaxy S8 handset where it shows animated dots moving through seven holes and finally stopping at the eighth. It also shows a guy standing by the window, who starts walking towards a door. The moment he opens the door, it leads him to space with planets in the vicinity and flying astronauts. The ad has lead fans to believe that Samsung could be offering the VR headset with the Galaxy S8 smartphones.

The tech giant issued a news release announcing the new product, a departure from its usual large-scale event preceding product releases. In the release, Apple noted that the new iPad, which will be available to order beginning Friday, March 24, will come in silver, gold, and space grey colours, and start at $329 for the 32GB Wi-Fi-only model and $459 for the 32GB Wi-Fi and cellular model. In addition, the new iPad features the Apple-designed A9 processor chip and a retina display with more than 3.1 million pixels. "iPad is the world's most popular tablet. Customers love the large, 9.7-inch display for everything from watching TV and movies, to surfing the web, making FaceTime calls, and enjoying photos, and now it is even more affordable," Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Philip Schiller said in a news release. "New customers and anyone looking to upgrade will love this new iPad for use at home, in school, and for work." The new iPad replaces the iPad Air 2, a 9.7-inch tablet that hasn't seen a refresh since October 2014. Since then, Apple has unveiled 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions of the iPad Pro and refreshed the 7.9-inch iPad Mini line. Apple also announced it would be offering its iPhone 7 in a red special edition to benefit HIV/AIDS programs through its partnership with (RED).

The new iPad replaces the older iPad Air 2 which had not been updated for a couple of years now.

There may not be as much choice as smartphones when it comes to tablets, but there are still a number of decisions to be made if you're in the market for one. If you are reading this feature it is likely you have already decided on the platform, disregarding Android and Windows for iOS, and you are now trying to figure out what size iPad is the right one for you and which one fits into how much you want to spend. Apple offers a number of iPad options - iPad mini 4, new iPad 9.7, iPad Pro 9.7 and the iPad Pro 12.9. The tablets range from 7.9-inch displays to 12.9-inches in size. The iPad mini 2 and iPad Air 2 have been officially discontinued by Apple, but are still widely available, so we've included them all so you can see the differences between them and decide which is the right one for you and your budget. Quick summary The iPad mini 2 is for those who want a small Apple tablet but don't have the cash to splash on the newest model. If you are happy to sacrifice the latest specs and features, the iPad mini 2 gives you iOS on a budget. It has officially been discontinued by Apple as of March 2017, but it's still widely available. The iPad mini 4 is for those who want a small Apple tablet with many of the latest specs and features. You'll need a little more cash for the iPad mini 4 but you get a few extra features, like Touch ID, and a more powerful device. The iPad Air 2 has now been discontinued and replaced by the new iPad 9.7. About the only reason to buy the iPad Air 2 is if you can find it significantly cheaper than the new iPad.  The new iPad 9.7 replaces the iPad Air 2, offering much the same design, but slightly uprated specs. It's launch price is cheaper too and it's cheaper than the iPad Pro, so if you want a big iPad but aren't fussed by the Pencil support, this is the model to pick. The iPad Pro 9.7 is Apple's most powerful and feature-rich tablet yet. It is the iPad for those that want all the features of the larger iPad Pro but in a smaller and more compact format, along with some additional extras no other iPad offers. The iPad Pro is the largest and most expensive iPad available, as well as one of the most powerful. It is for those that want to do more on their tablet than just watching movies and browsing the web, and for those that not only have the budget to warrant this model but also the desire for something bigger than the 9.7-inch model. Apple Apple iPad mini 2 Dimensions: 200 x 134.7 x 7.5mm, 331g Display: 7.9-inches, 2048 x 1536 (326ppi)  Storage: 32GB (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi & Cellular) Battery: Up to 10 hours Colours: Silver, Space Grey Price: Buy it from £264 on Amazon UK, or $249 on Amazon US The iPad mini 2 is the cheapest way to get your hands on an Apple tablet as it is now a few years old and has been succeeded by the iPad mini 4. It is the smallest iPad available, though not the slimmest or lightest. The iPad mini 2 was discontinued in March 2017, but it's still widely available. The iPad mini 2 comes in silver and space grey colour options so you miss out on the gold option and there are also a couple of other things lacking, such as Touch ID and Apple Pay, as well as an anti-reflective coating on the display. There is also no slo-mo video capability or burst mode. The A7 chip and M7 motion coprocessor sit under the hood and you'll find a 1.2-megapixel front camera, coupled with a 5-megapixel rear camera, the latter of which is a slight downgrade from the iPad mini 4. Apple iPad mini 2 review Apple Apple iPad mini 4 Dimensions: 203.2 x 134.8 x 6.1mm, 298.8g Display: 7.9-inches, 2048 x 1536 (326ppi) Storage: 128GB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular) Battery: Up to 10 hours Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold Price (RRP): From £419 to £549, buy it from £342 on Amazon UK, or $408 on Amazon US The iPad mini 4 is the newer and more expensive addition to the small iPad club. It is ever so slightly larger than the iPad mini 2, but it is slimmer and lighter and although it has the same size and resolution display, you get the addition of a fully laminated screen and an anti-reflective coating. There is a newer, faster chip powering the iPad mini 4 with the A8 processor and M8 motion coprocessor on board, as well as the addition of an 128GB storage option and gold finish. Officially, Apple only offers 128GB storage now, although older models are available at lower storage levels. In terms of other extras, Touch ID is included on the iPad mini 4, as is Apple Pay compatibility, burst mode and slo-mo video. The only other difference to the older iPad mini 2 is the bump to an 8-megapixel rear camera. Apple iPad mini 4 review Best iPad mini cases: Protect your 7.9-inch Apple tablet Apple Apple iPad Air 2 Dimensions: 240 x 169.5 x 6.1mm, 437g Display: 9.7-inches, 2048 x 1536 (264ppi) Storage: 32GB, 128GB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular) Battery: Up to 10 hours Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold Price: Buy it from £378 on Amazon UK, or $419 on Amazon US The iPad Air 2 has now been discontinued, replaced with the cheaper and slightly more powerful new iPad 9.7. There is still stock of the iPad Air around, but check the prices carefully - the new iPad might be the cheaper option. A faster A8X and M8 motion coprocessor sits under the hood than the smaller iPad mini 4, but you get the same colour options as the iPad mini 4, as well as the same cameras and features. Touch ID, Apple Pay, burst mode, slo-mo video and the fully laminated display with anti-reflective coating are all therefore present on the iPad Air 2, but you miss out on Apple Pencil compatibility, a True Tone display, higher resolution cameras and stereo speakers, all of which are found on the newer 9.7-inch iPad Pro model.  Apple iPad Air 2 review Apple Apple iPad  Dimensions: 240 x 169.5 x 7.5mm, 469g Display: 9.7-inches, 2048 x 1536 (264ppi) Storage: 32GB, 128GB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular) Battery: Up to 10 hours Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold Price (RRP): From £339 to £559 The new iPad replaces the iPad Air 2 and is simply called iPad. It sticks to much the same design as the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Pro, although it's slightly thicker and that's probably down to the fact that it doesn't have a fully laminated display and it doesn't offer the anti-reflective coating. This probably also accounts for the lower pricing than the old iPad Air 2. It offers the same display size and resolution, however, but also steps up to the A9 chip, giving a speed boost over the iPad Air 2, but still a step below the iPad Pro models. The new Apple iPad's biggest selling point might be its pricing however: at £339 for the Wi-Fi 32GB model, it's now the cheapest iPad model that Apple offers. It goes on sale on 24 March 2017. We'll bring you a full review once it goes on sale. Apple Apple iPad Pro 9.7 Dimensions: 240 x 169.5 x 6.1mm, 437g Display: 9.7-inches, 2048 x 1536 (264ppi), True Tone Storage: 32GB, 128GB, 256GB (Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi & Cellular) Battery: Up to 10 hours Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold, Rose Gold Price (RRP): From £549 to £849, buy it from £529 on Amazon UK, or $510 on Amazon US The iPad Pro 9.7 is exactly the same size as the iPad Air 2 and it offers the same size display and resolution too, meaning the same pixel density. It does add a couple of new technologies to the mix however, including a True Tone and wide colour gamut display, as well as Apple Pencil compatibility. The iPad Pro 9.7 takes its design cues from the larger iPad Pro, meaning you'll get the Smart Connector and four-speaker setup with this device. It also adds the option of a rose gold finish and a 256GB storage option. As you might expect, the iPad Pro 9.7 has the latest A9X processor under its hood like the larger iPad Pro, but it also significantly improves the camera experience compared to the iPad Air 2 with a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front camera, both of which offer flash. Apple iPad Pro 9.7 review Apple iPad Pro 9.7 vs iPad Pro 12.9: What's the difference? Best iPad Pro 9.7 cases: Protect your new Apple tablet Apple Apple iPad Pro 12.9 Dimensions: 305.7 x 220.6 x 6.9mm, 713g Display: 12.9-inches, 2732 x 2048 (264ppi) Storage: 32GB, 128GB, 256GB (Wi-Fi) or 128GB, 256GB (Wi-Fi & Cellular) Battery: Up to 10 hours Colours: Silver, Space Grey, Gold Price (RRP): From £729 to £1029, buy it from £662 on Amazon UK, or $624 on Amazon US The iPad Pro marked a new tablet territory for Apple with its 12.9-inch display. It will be far too big for some but for others, it will be the tablet they were waiting for. The display technology is the same as the iPad mini 4 and iPad Air 2 meaning it doesn't offer the True Tone and wide colour gamut screen of the iPad Pro 9.7. You'll also find the same cameras and other features such as Touch ID and Apple Pay compatibility as the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4 so it also misses out on the higher resolution cameras found in the iPad Pro 9.7. The iPad Pro has a faster processor than all the other iPads available, except its newer, smaller brother, with the A9X and M9 combination under the hood. It is also compatible with the Apple Pencil and it will offer a range of software features, including Adobe, that the other iPads, again except the newer, smaller model, don't.

(AAPL) Gets the Edge With Another Galaxy S8 Leak By Scutify Mar 21, 2017 8:59 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. There's an epic battle brewing for the title of Best Smartphone of 2017. The favorite at this point is Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 10th-anniversary iPhone 8, due out in September. It's going up against the Galaxy S8 from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), the company's first big release since the botched Galaxy Note 7. But Samsung can't seem to keep its forthcoming flagship under wraps. The latest Galaxy S8 leak reveals the new smartphone in all three launch colors, plus its pricing. Source: Evan Blass/Twitter Galaxy S8 Leak Shows Colors, Price After the last Galaxy S8 leak from Sunday, we now know the available colors of Samsung's next smartphone, as well as the launch price. Evan Blass took to his Twitter account to post images of the Galaxy S8 in Black Sky, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver. And how much will consumers have to shell out for the hot new phone? Blass says the Galaxy S8 will start at 799€, while the larger Galaxy S8+ will retail for 899€ and up. In U.S. dollars, that's approximately $859 and $1075, respectively. The new DeX docking station for the smartphones will reportedly go for 150€, or about $161. Samsung Even Leaked Its Own Smartphone Details Samsung has had a tough time keeping the lid on its newest flagship smartphone. In fact, at this point there's not much we don't know about it. But, this isn't because of shadowy supply chain sources like the ones AAPL has had to deal with while trying to keep the iPhone 8 under wraps. Rather, more than a few Galaxy S8 leaks have included actual detailed photographs of the smartphone and its key features, videos, slip-ups from carriers who will be selling the phone, and even Samsung itself. It was Samsung that accidentally posted on its own website that the new AI assistant on the Galaxy S8 will be named Bixby, and that Bixby will integrate with a new Samsung Pay Mini service. Other key Galaxy S8 leak details to date include: Launch date of Mar. 29 in New York, worldwide starting April 21 Minimal front bezels Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 835 and Samsung Exynos 8895 CPUs 5.8-inch Quad HD+ Super AMOLED display (6.2-inch for Galaxy S8+) Virtual on-screen Home Button replaces physical button Fingerprint scanner on the back Iris scanner USB-C, wireless charging 3.5mm headphone jack Next Page Does the Latest Galaxy S8 Leak Help AAPL? The more AAPL knows in advance about what will be its primary competition in the battle for best smartphone this year, the better. The latest Galaxy S8 leak provides some seemingly useful information, in particular the price. There's been a lot of complaining about the suggestion that AAPL might launch the new iPhone 8 at a starting price of $1,000 or more - a huge jump over the usual $649 base for an iPhone. If Samsung charges in excess of $1,000 for the Galaxy S8+, that will take some pressure off Apple. An $859 Galaxy S8 may be even better news. If AAPL keeps its traditional pricing model for the iPhone 7s - its "regular" smartphone release for 2017 - a new Apple iPhone would slide in with a $200 price advantage over the Samsung competition. Why I Sold Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock (And You Should, Too) Apple also could choose to mess with Samsung's release timing. With the Galaxy S8 launch on Mar. 29 and release on Apr. 21, Apple could hold its own big product event in that same time frame (something it's actually expected to do). Doing so would surely take some of the spotlight off the Galaxy S8 during what's sure to be a critical launch window. Of course, the more information AAPL has about its competitor early on, the more time management has to fine-tune the iPhone 8 prior to release. Galaxy S8 leaks already show a near-bezel-free smartphone with Iris scanning, wireless charging, no physical Home button, a very powerful CPU and an all-new AI-powered personal assistant. In other words, the iPhone 7s is going to face competition that outclasses it in many respects, while many of the expected iPhone 8 features are already going to be available from the competition. Perhaps it's time for AAPL designers and engineers to double down on the iPhone 8 finishing touches. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

 Modern smartphones are incredibly boring — and Apple's new red iPhone proves it Rob Price Mar. 22, 2017, 10:06 AM 31,078 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ooooh. Shiny. Apple A plague has infected the modern smartphone industry: monotony. Take a stroll through the aisles of a mobile-phone retailer and you'll see an endless stream of brushed aluminum, gleaming glass, and muted shades of gold and silver. It's tasteful. It's uninspired. It's dull. After years of experimentation with materials, sizes, and designs, smartphone companies have largely reached a mundane equilibrium: a metal body, available in silver/gold/black, a 5-ish-inch screen, maybe make it available in two sizes — done. The result is a parade of devices with little distinguishing them. Apple is finally doing something new Apple has been one of the worst offenders, its gloriously plastic iPhone 5C notwithstanding. But on Tuesday, it did something different. It launched a red iPhone. The device, an iPhone 7, is part of Apple's long-running partnership with the (RED) organization, and money from each sale will go toward the organization's HIV/AIDS research and relief efforts. (In China, the red iPhone is expected to sell particularly well, given the color's association with luck, but the device is on sale in Western markets, too.) In photos and videos, the device looks striking — and the initial response has been highly positive. Product (RED) iPhone looking 🔥😍 pic.twitter.com/k08O1K0jyh — ㅤ (@drugvisuals) March 22, 2017 Man that red iPhone something serious 😩 — issa devil (@JAYY_GOLDEN) March 22, 2017 The device was announced at the same time as a new, cheaper iPad. But if you look at Google Trends, the searches for "red iPhone" far outstrip "new iPad." More anecdotally, more than 115,000 people read Business Insider's story about the new iPhone, fewer than the 70,000 who read our piece about the new iPads. The red line is Google searches for "red iPhone," while the blue line is "new iPad." Google Trends Gold isn't 'high-end' — it's out of date The design language that Apple, Samsung, and the rest employ — that elegant gold devices are synonymous with premium quality — is tired and stale. Even lower-end devices, like Motorola's Moto G, are aping the aesthetic, coming equipped with metal bodies and "luxury" color schemes. There's no soul. Apple But the public response to the red iPhone shows that the world is crying out for more interesting phones, and it looks as though smartphone makers are waking up to this. Leaked renders show a Samsung Galaxy S8 in lilac — albeit a subtle, desaturated tone — and other rumored shades include blue and pink. Huawei's premium P10 device is available in green and blue, as well as the usual gold/black/silver/white suspects. These are baby steps, but welcome ones. There's a near-infinite variety of fashions, clothes, and accessories to meet all tastes, so there's no reason people looking for a decent smartphone should be boxed into choosing one of three wearisome shades of metal. In short, "premium" needn't be synonymous with boring. Smartphone companies need to rediscover their sense of fun. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

CORRECTING and REPLACING GRAPHIC Apple’s iPhone 6s Topped List of Best-Selling Smartphones for 2016, IHS Markit Says Most-shipped smartphones globally in 2016. Source: IHS Markit Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Most-shipped smartphones globally in 2016. Source: IHS Markit Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail CORRECTION...by IHS Markit March 22, 2017 11:17 AM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Please replace the graphic with the accompanying corrected graphic. The release reads: APPLE’S IPHONE 6S TOPPED LIST OF BEST-SELLING SMARTPHONES FOR 2016, IHS MARKIT SAYS In terms of shipments, the iPhone 6s from Apple bested all competitors for sales in 2016, according to new analysis from IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO), a world leader in critical information, analytics and solutions. If looking at the fourth quarter alone, the new iPhone 7 was the 2016 best-seller, followed by iPhone 7 Plus, based on research from the IHS Markit Smartphone Shipment Database, which tracks quarterly shipment data for more than 350 smartphone models. Apple again has demonstrated that its new iPhones integrate enough innovations and new features to drive sales and remain successful in the market. The company is also capable of selling older devices for an extended period of time. For instance, the year-old iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were both among the most-shipped models in 2016. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and S7 ranked fifth and ninth, respectively. Sales of these two devices have outperformed their immediate predecessors, S6 and S6 Edge: the combined shipments of S7 and S7 Edge in 2016 were 10 million higher than S6 and S6 Edge over the same period. The Note 7 recall has left S7 and S7 Edge, released in March 2016, the best flagships in the premium line-up of Samsung. Since then, the market has seen a series of premium smartphones by other companies. Samsung’s ability to drive the sales of older premium devices was impressive. Aggressive promotions, which included bundling with Gear VR, helped sales of S7 and S7 Edge. Samsung claimed five spots out of the top 10 most-shipped smartphones in 2016. Excluding the aforementioned S7 and S7 Edge, the remaining three models all belong to the mid-tier J series. The company has seen shipment unit gains in the mid to low-tier segment, relative to 2015, due to growth in emerging markets. Huawei, the third largest smartphone maker after Apple and Samsung, did not have any models in the top 10 most-shipped smartphones in 2016. Similar to Samsung, Huawei continues to address multiple smartphone pricing segments – either with its own Huawei-branded handsets or with those of its sub-brand, Honor. In the premium segment, Huawei’s P9 was among its own top five most-shipped smartphone models in 2016, performing better than previous flagships. Chinese manufacturer OPPO had one model on the top ten ranking. In 2016, OPPO posted growth of 109 percent in smartphone shipments to become the fourth largest smartphone maker in terms of unit shipment, up from the seventh spot in 2015. Unlike Huawei, OPPO has a smaller product portfolio and operates in fewer markets, with more than 80 percent of the company’s 2016 shipments within its home market of China. About IHS Markit (www.ihsmarkit.com) IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO) is a world leader in critical information, analytics and expertise for the major industries and markets that drive economies worldwide.

The sleek, well-designed phones often have some of the most cutting-edge features it's possible to get on a smartphone. And Samsung is getting ready to reveal the next in the series - the Galaxy S8 - at an event next week. Taking place in New York on March 29, gadget fans will finally get to see the phone in full after months of leaks and wild speculation. The new Galaxy S8 will go toe-to-toe with Apple's iPhone 7 and is likely to feature some big changes from last year's S7 and S7 edge. Read More Apple launches new iPad tablet - and you can order it TODAY (Photo: Twitter/Evan Blass) As is common with tech manufacturers now, when the S8 does arrive it will likely do so in two different sizes. Early indicators suggest that we'll see a 5.1-inch and a 5.5-inch model. What's not clear is whether or not Samsung will introduce an 'edge' version of the new phone with a curved screen. It has taken this approach with both the S7 and the S6 in the last two years. The South Korean company is also only starting to recover from the disastrous global recall and cancellation of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. And then there's the small matter of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus that are currently proving a hit with fans, despite the controversial decision to remove the headphone jack. Read More Google Pixel 2 CONFIRMED by smartphone boss - and it's coming later this year The Samsung Galaxy S7 was a big hit in early 2016 (Photo: Samsung) Whilst Apple appears to refine and strip down its phones, Samsung appears to be going the other way. If the current crop of internet rumours are to be believed, the company will be throwing everything it has into its next blower. So, what do we know so far? We've collected all the latest whisperings right here and will continue to update this piece as we learn more. Latest news Samsung's next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8 , will come with a new artificially intelligent personal assistant called Bixby. Like Apple's Siri, Bixby responds to spoken commands, allowing users to control their phones with their voices alone. However, Samsung claims that Bixby offers a "deeper experience" than other voice agents or assistants in the market. Read More Samsung Galaxy S8 will come with a new Siri-like personal assistant called Bixby Samsung Galaxy S7 edge at The World Mobile Congress at the Fira Gran Via Complex (Photo: Miquel Benitez/REX/Shutterstock) Firstly, when using a Bixby-enabled application, Samsung's personal assistant can support almost every task that the application is capable of performing - so you don't have to remember which features work with voice command and which don't. Secondly, you can call upon Bixby at any time and it will understand the current context and state of the application, allowing you to continue what you're doing without interruption. The Samsung Galaxy S8 will come with a dedicated Bixby button on the side of the device, which you can press to call up the virtual assistant. To begin with, only a subset of pre-installed applications will be Bixby-enabled, but this set will continue to expand over time. Release date Rather than reveal the phone at Mobile World Congress as in previous years, Samsung is hosting its own event on March 29. The event is called Samsung Unpacked and it is widely expected to be the official unveiling of the Galaxy S8. Read More Mobile World Congress 2017: The biggest announcements from this year's smartphone mega-show Samsung's Unpacked invitation (Photo: Samsung) The teaser image for the event showed the outline of a phone and the line "unbox your phone". Samsung confirmed it will be streaming the event live over its website. Price As with Apple's iPhones, the Samsung Galaxy handsets have more or less plateaued when it comes to price. The current 32GB S7 comes in at £569 whilst the slightly larger S7 edge is £639. It's unlikely that Samsung's new phones will deviate too far from this kind of pricing. So you better start saving. Read More iPhone 7 vs Galaxy S7: Which smartphone is best when Apple and Samsung go toe-to-toe? The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge aren't cheap What could change things is if Samsung decides to offer multiple storage options. At the moment you can only get the S7 with 32GB of storage. If Samsung opts to increase this to 64GB or even 128GB the price could increase also. However, the company could also keep the storage space as it is and instead include the capacity of the microSD card slot. Design Posted to Twitter by serial leaker Evan Blass, an image appears to show a marketing photo of the Samsung Galaxy S8 face-on. It reveals the gigantic front screen and the lack of a physical home button - two prominent rumours that have circulated for months. Samsung upgrades the Gear VR with a controller for virtual reality pointing and shooting Much has been made of the S8's display and, as this picture shows, it appears to take up the entire front of the device with hugely reduced bezels on the top and bottom of the phone. The curving screen appears to have been carried over from the Galaxy S7. It also shows the phone's lock screen and redesigned clock face. The power button can be clearly seen on the side of the phone. Perhaps in an effort to rescue something from the doomed Galaxy 7 Note, Samsung could be planning to put an edge-to-edge display in the new S8. Read More Samsung Galaxy S8 owners will be able to use their FACE to pay for things (Photo: Getty) That's the message coming from tech site Droid-Life, which claims the new S8 will come in two sizes and won't feature any bezels. Samsung will release a 5.7-inch model and a whopping 6.2-inch model - which makes it practically a tablet in our eyes. What's more, the site is claiming Samsung will ditch the home button - something that has always been a feature of Galaxy phones. "With the removal of the home button, it should be expected that we might see on-screen buttons, instead of Samsung’s long-standing capacitive keys," claims the site. Samsung is also reportedly planning to put a pair of stereo speakers on the forthcoming Galaxy S8 flagship phone - something Apple did with the iPhone 7. The news comes from gadget site Fone Arena, which alleges that the new blower might also sport branding from audio company HARMAN. "According to our sources this dual speaker technology will have a branding, like the HTC’s Boomsound," wrote the site. "It could also come with HARMAN branding, and powered by technology from HARMAN that it recently agreed to acquire for about $8.0 billion." Specs Aside from the aforementioned 4K screen, there are a few rumours circulating about what kind of power the S8 may have under the bonnet. Samsung's cameras have been exceptionally good recently, but the proliferation of dual-lens snappers from the likes of Apple, Huawei and LG may inspire it to follow suit. According to tech site Trusted Reviews , Samsung is indeed planning to include dual-lens cameras in its next phone. Read More Samsung to start selling second-hand Galaxy S7 smartphones 'on the cheap' An exploded Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (Photo: MEN) A recent leak, reported on by the gadget site Pocket Lint , seems to have a clear picture of the S8's specs. It says the new phone will pack in 6GB of RAM and a 30-megapixel camera. There will also be a 4,200mAh battery which - providing it doesn't explode - should easily see the phone through 24 hours of solid usage. A report on Samsung-watching site SamMobile hit on the fact that the S8 may include an Exynos 8895 processor coupled with a Mali-G71 GPU. According to the site, that means the new phone will be up to 1.8 times more powerful than the already-impressive Galaxy S7.

The reason? Samsung's pushing heavily into virtual reality and having a powerful screen resolution means you can use the phone in VR headsets like the Samsung Galaxy Gear and Google Daydream VR. No headphone jack It's being rumoured that Samsung will follow Apple's lead and ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack on the Samsung Galaxy S8. If true, it would force users to adopt wireless headphones or, potentially, use a USB Type-C compatible pair, if that's what the new handset uses for charging. The latter is what Samsung fan site SamMobile believes will be the case when the Galaxy S8 is unveiled at Mobile World Congress in 2017. Galaxy S8 leaks suggest Samsung is planning to copy one of the iPhone 7's best features (Photo: REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji) By ditching the port, the company could make the phone sturdier and likely improve waterproofing while keeping the casing slim. But it's also likely to irk a huge number of people who rely on the old-fashioned analogue connection. Apple wasn't the first major manufacturer to remove the headphone jack, but the decision caused the biggest stir when the iPhone 7 was unveiled. Third-party manufacturers have raced to offer wireless headphones and phone cases to resolve the issue. Amid rumours that Samsung is planning to follow Apple's lead and remove the headphone jack on the Galaxy S8, some sources are now claiming that Samsung will launch a pair of lightweight bluetooth earbuds – similar in design and functionality to Apple's AirPods. Samsung already offers a pair of wireless earbuds, called the Gear IconX, which track your physical activity, have enough internal storage for around 1,000 music tracks and include a small touchpad to control music playback.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady iTunes 12.6 out the door, now includes “rent once, watch anywhere” feature Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, March 22nd, 2017, 05:14 Category: iOS, iTunes, News, Software, TvOS This could come in handy. Apple on Tuesday released iTunes 12.6, complete with a new “rent once, watch anywhere” movie rental and playback feature. The new addition, according to Apple, allows you to rent a movie on one device and watch it on another device. Previously, it was possible to rent from iPhone, for example, then be restricted to that device to finish playback. The new ‘watch anywhere’ feature for rentals appears to require iOS 10.3 and tvOS 10.2 however, although iOS is currently in developer and public beta and tvOS is only available in developer beta previews. Both software updates are likely coming soon for all users based on previous beta cycles as well as this iTunes release. Apple still enforces a time limit on watching rental movies. iTunes 12.6 requires Mac OS X 10.9.5 or later to run and can be downloaded and installed from the Mac App Store. If you’ve tried the new version and have any feedback to offer, please let us know in the comments.

Better Read This By Curt Cartier March 22, 2017 5:02 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Hackers have moved on from celebrities and important types to everyday peeps like you and me to steal stuff. Because they can. Don’t let them. A group of hackers called the Turkish Crime Family managed to get a list of at least 300 million people’s iCloud passwords. Cameron Spencer They’re threatening Apple that they’re going to log into those accounts and remotely wipe the data on ALL of their iPhones on April 7th…unless Apple pays them a ransom. They want either $75,000 in Bitcoin or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards. They say if Apple pays up, they’ll delete the list…..but it’s a tricky spot for Apple. $100K is insignificant to a company that big…but once you start negotiating with hackers and blackmailers, it sets a very dangerous precedent. So what should YOU do? One, you should back up anything that’s important from your phone ASAP, especially photos. Two, change your iCloud password. And three, hope that either the hackers are bluffing or Apple figures out how to protect you so this just winds up being a false alarm.

Apple said the new edition commemorates its 10-year partnership with Red, a global organization that helps fights AIDS. The special edition iPhones, which feature a red aluminum body, will come in 128GB and 256GB models starting at $749. The red phones will be available in stores and online starting Friday for an unspecified "limited" time." Apple said it would donate a portion of sales from the 1Phone 7 Red to the AIDS organization, but did not elaborate. The company said it has contributed more than $130 million as part of its partnership with Red. The company also unveiled a new 9.7-inch iPad Tuesday, featuring a "brighter" Retina display, which will start at $329 for a 32GB model. Apple also announced "Clips" -- a new  app that lets users create videos designed to share on social networks like Facebook and Instagram.

A much-speculated 10.5-inch iPad Pro didn’t materialize, nor did new versions of existing sizes in the Pro lineup, which is aimed at businesses and creative professionals. The new devices are mostly refreshes of existing models. Apple unveiled them through press releases Tuesday rather than a staged event, as it typically does for bigger product releases. The iPad updates come as the tablet market continues to decline, after a few years of rapid growth. According to IDC, tablet shipments fell 20 percent to 53 million worldwide in the final three months of 2016, compared with the same period in 2015. THE NEW LINEUP The iPad Air 2 is replaced by a new model simply called the iPad. It retains a 9.7-inch screen, but gains a little weight and thickness. The display is brighter and the processor faster. Its price starts at $329 for 32 gigabytes of storage, down from $399. The standard-size iPad is now cheaper than the smaller Mini model. The 7.9-inch iPad Mini 4 now comes with 128 gigabytes of storage starting at $399, rather than $499 before. Apple is eliminating the 32-gigabyte model, which used to sell for $399. Nothing else is changing. Apple is also releasing a red edition of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus; for each phone sold, Apple is donating an unspecified amount to HIV and AIDS programs. And Apple is doubling the storage on the smaller iPhone SE while keeping the $399 starting price. The new iPad Mini 4 is available right away, while the standard-size iPad comes out next week, with orders to begin Friday. The new iPhone SE comes out Friday, while the red iPhones are expected by the end of the month, with advance orders beginning Friday. THE MISSING DEVICE IDC analyst Jorge Vela had high hopes for a 10.5-inch iPad. He said such a size might have offered room for a better keyboard, compared with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and it wouldn’t have been as bulky as the 12.9-inch version. And Apple typically sparks consumer interest when it has new sizes and designs, Vela said, as seen by a jump in sales following the introduction of larger iPhones in 2014 (iPhone sales have since dropped.) Vela said a 10.5-inch version might have been enough for existing iPad owners to upgrade. A 10.5-inch version may still come this year, closer to the holiday shopping season, along with updates to existing Pro sizes. Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said Tuesday’s announcement makes it “even clearer that there are two very distinct iPad tiers now — the iPad Pro and the basic iPads. The iPad Pros will likely continue to get all the best new features, while the basic iPad will get occasional updates and new features a little later than the Pros, lagging a generation or two behind.” The processor in the new standard-size iPad, for instance, is akin to what’s in the iPhone 6S from 2015. The Mini’s processor is even older. DOWN BUT NOT OUT In the last three months of 2016, iPhones generated 10 times the revenue as iPads. Unit sales of iPads fell 19 percent from the previous year. Yet Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed optimism because many people were buying iPads for the first time, indicating that the market had yet to reach saturation, the point at which everyone who wants a particular product already has one. Dawson agrees that the number of tablet owners is still growing, even if overall sales are declining because people aren’t upgrading often. He said the new $329 price for the 9.7-inch iPad should help spur sales. New 9.7-inch models have previously cost at least $499. Far from holding a clearance sale, Vela said Apple is merely taking advantage of lower prices for older components. And Apple might be able to preserve higher profit margins by pushing people into a model with four times the storage, or 128 gigabytes; the extra storage costs Apple far less than the extra $100 that model sells for, Vela said. CHALLENGERS Apple remains the market leader, accounting for about a quarter of all tablets shipped in the fourth quarter, according to IDC. Samsung beat Apple to a tablet announcement by nearly a month, though Samsung’s Android-based Galaxy Tab S3 doesn’t actually start selling until this Friday, for $600. Vela doesn’t consider it a serious threat to Apple. Even though the Tab S3 is more in line with iPad Pros in quality, Vela said people tend to buy Samsung tablets as media-consumption devices, something they can do with the cheaper iPads. Samsung also has two Windows 10 tablets coming. Called the Galaxy Book, the Windows devices are more likely to challenge Microsoft’s Surface than iPads. Microsoft is due for a refresh of its Surface Pro tablet, last updated in October 2015. ——— AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson contributed to this report.     Tags: apple, ipads, model, iphone, sales, tablet, Other stories from today: Trump health care speedbump tanks stocks Apple cuts prices on iPads, releases red iPhones Wells Fargo: ATMs will take phone codes, not just cards     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   Does the federal government provide sufficient support for the middle class?

But with a premium iPhone Pro rumoured, this sense of egalitarianism no longer applies Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Contact author @alexhern Wednesday 22 March 2017 08.02 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 22 March 2017 10.38 EDT For the past decade, Apple’s philosophy has been summed up by an Andy Warhol line about Coca-Cola. “What’s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest,” Warhol wrote in his 1975 autobiography. “You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the president drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking.” Apple’s mobile product lines, like the iPhone and iPad, have suggested that it wants to make the Coca-Cola of the technological world. Not for Apple the vast segmented portfolios of the likes of Samsung. Instead, it has generally had an incredibly simple offer: the best phone or tablet it can make, or, for the more price-conscious, the best phone or tablet it could make last year. It’s more than just a matter of principle, of course. On the one hand, it’s a question of branding: every phone with the Apple logo on it was once (in its opinion) the best phone in the world. No one need be ashamed of carrying an iPhone, and that’s the way Apple wants it to stay. On the other hand, the sheer economics matter. Apple gains incredible economies of scale from making the vast majority of its devices in the same basic way – so much so, in fact, that it has occasionally faced diseconomies of scale, being limited by the total capacity of its providers. By shipping last year’s devices, the company can also steadily increase its profit margin, ironing out the niggles in the production process for a second year running. That philosophy has been coming under increasing pressure in the last couple of years, however. Apple faces opposing pressures at opposite ends of its line. For more price-sensitive customers, the cost of building a “good enough” phone continues to drop, and even though Apple has never been one to chase the genuine budget market, it wants to grow its user base just like any other company. At the other end, though, the introduction of the iPhone Plus has shown that the company’s more dedicated customers are willing to pay extremely high prices for the latest and greatest. In other words, the company is tired of making Coca-Cola. It wants to start selling Champagne, something that can absorb a near-infinite increase in price at the top end, while still maintaining a luxury image for anyone able to afford it. How can Apple carry on selling increasingly expensive gear to the top end of the market, without losing its chance to expand at the bottom? Facebook Twitter Pinterest The iPhone 5C became the first Apple device to be introduced with an explicitly budget aim and appearance. Photograph: REX/ZUMA First, Apple began introducing increasing segmentation in its product lines. First the iPad mini blurred lines as to what the “best” iPad was in any given year; then the iPhone 5C became the first Apple device to be introduced with an explicitly budget aim and appearance, and the SE followed the same pattern. Those devices all offered something to the budget conscious buyer, but Apple’s Coca-Cola offering remained, largely, intact. Now, though, the new plan is really breaking through. On Tuesday, Apple introduced the new iPad, a replacement for the iPad Air 2. If you thought that tablet had already been replaced, you aren’t alone. When the smaller of the two iPad Pros was introduced, many assumed that that tablet was to all intent and purposes the iPad Air 3 – the name change to Pro, rather than Air 3, being a branding push to better justify the £100 increase in price. The new iPad challenges that analysis. It is a cheap device, but it doesn’t look pitched at the budget-conscious: instead, everything about it, from the name itself to the advertising push, says that this is the new mainstream device, with the iPad Pro occupying a top tier for those who want only the best. In other words, for the first time, the Coca-Cola you drink and the Coca-Cola the president drinks might be different. But market segmentation seems on its way and there’s another area where Apple has signalled this is exactly the direction it wants to take: wearables. The Apple Watch was launched with two orders of magnitude difference in prices between the cheapest aluminium watch and the most expensive gold one. That discrepancy has been dialled down a bit – the new Apple Watch Edition is made of ceramic, and costs “only” $1,200 (£962) – but when it comes to devices that can double up as jewellery, of a sort, Apple knows that its richest customers are willing to pay. The real revelation will probably come this September. That’s when we’re expecting to see new iPhones, and the rumour mill suggests that we could be in for the biggest change in strategy the company has seen in decades: the introduction of an “iPhone Pro”. That device, it is rumoured, is likely to come with radical design upgrades: a bezel-free display, and maybe a fingerprint reader hidden under the screen, while the new vanilla iPhones will not. But the pricing of the Pro will likely match its ambition, potentially breaking $1,000 for the first time. The iconic phone will no longer be one model fits all, but clearly aimed at two tiers. “All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good”, Warhol’s musing concludes. “Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it.” For Apple, as for Coca-Cola, that was a powerful thing to be able to claim. “The President has a better iPhone than you because we couldn’t work out a neater way to charge him $1,000 without losing your custom” doesn’t quite capture the imagination in the same way.

Update: Some are suggesting the move may be because recent changes in the law prevent businesses selling products which use a charity branding to help drive sales. If this theory is correct, this could also mean that red iPhones sold in China will not raise money for (RED). Apple’s announcement of a red iPhone 7/Plus yesterday wasn’t just notable for the introduction of a mid-cycle color option, but also because it represented the company’s greatest ever support for the AIDS-fighting charity (RED). Tim Cook said yesterday it was in celebration of ten years’ partnership with the charity, and the PRODUCT(RED) branding was prominent on the homepage of its websites around the world – except in China, that is … Anker braided Lightning cables As TechCrunch notes, Apple’s Chinese website omits all mention of the link to the charity. This isn’t a language thing – the Taiwanese site has the same PRODUCT(RED) branding as the rest of the world – but the site suggests this is instead a political decision by Apple. Its theory is that Apple doesn’t want to jeopardise its somewhat delicate relationship with the Chinese government by getting embroiled in what is a controversial topic in the country. There is reason to support this theory. China has been criticized in many quarters for failing to adequately respond to a growing AIDS crisis in the country. Transmission through sex has been rising exponentially, exposing which groups the UN report regards as the 21st century’s most vulnerable: “widespread lack of knowledge and protective life skills, huge internal labour migration, underprivileged minority communities, relative poverty, youth, and gender inequity” […] Health officials say there are plenty of problems in China’s approach to AIDS. There are frequent reports of police crack-downs on local NGOs involved in AIDS prevention. There have also been reports of police using the presence of a condom in a sex worker’s handbag to justify detention. This has been partially blamed on policy incoordination, and contradictions and conflicts between laws and regulations. In addition, there are concerns that provincial governments have enough autonomy to sometimes stall the implementation of central government-set guidelines and some officials say there has been a reluctance from many state-owned companies to get involved in AIDS programs. But if Apple is seeking to maintain a low profile in the country on AIDS-related issues, it’s a relatively new stance. As Engadget’s Chinese editor-in-chief Richard Lai observed, Apple China posted a press release about its support for (RED) just a few months ago. Apple did not respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. The charity (RED) was created in 2006 with the aim of ending AIDS in one generation. Apple has been a long-time supporter of the charity, with a PRODUCT(RED) iPod raising widespread awareness of the charity, and many other products since. The company turns its Apple Store logos red each year on World AIDS Day. Ben Lovejoy @benlovejoy Ben Lovejoy is a British technology writer and EU Editor for 9to5Mac.
