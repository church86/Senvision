 The iPhone 8 will likely have wireless charging — but that could make it prone to overheating Kif Leswing Feb. 9, 2017, 1:07 PM 73,545 facebook linkedin twitter email print A fan's concept drawing of the iPhone 8, based on current rumors.YouTube/ConceptsiPhone All three iPhones expected to launch later this year will have wireless charging, according to a new forecast by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Apple is expected to release three new iPhones in the fall — one premium model with a better screen using OLED technology, and two iterative improvements to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. All three will have glass casing and wireless charging, according to Kuo's note, which was seen by Business Insider. Apple may be concerned that the new iPhones may overheat more than older phones, according to the research. Glass casing and wireless charging are "unfavorable to thermal system operation," Kuo says. From the note: "Adoption of glass casing & wireless charging unfavorable to thermal system operation for three new 2017F iPhone models; bigger impact on OLED model. The thermal system becomes less efficient with glass casing, as compared to metal casing used previously. Furthermore, wireless charging increases handset temperature. "While we don't expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation; this is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D Touch sensor in OLED iPhone." Kuo says the premium phone would have more overheating issues than the other two, and that Apple might have to add an insulating graphite sheet to prevent it from malfunctioning. That sheet and other tech changes could raise the price that Apple pays for the 3D Touch module for the new OLED iPhone by as much as 50%. The research note distributed to clients focuses on some of the parts that Apple buys from suppliers to make its screens and features like 3D Touch work. "We believe OLED iPhone will provide a better 3D Touch user experience on the back of the new design," Kuo wrote. Because of this, Kuo advises clients to expect shares of the Apple suppliers General Interface Solution and TPK Holding Company to outperform. The cost of cutting edge parts may be one reason the premium OLED iPhone could cost over $1,000, according to a recent report. Here's what we're expecting from the iPhone 8: A 5.8-inch OLED screen. Wireless charging. Sides made of "forged stainless steel" and a back made of glass. The home button and fingerprint sensor built into and under an edge-to-edge screen. A double-lens camera, like on the iPhone 7 Plus. New 3D-sensing technology enabling "some form of facial/gesture recognition." A launch date in the fall — likely in September, as usual.

Photography by Nic Lehoux courtesy of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson Bohlin Cywinski Jackson (BCJ), the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania-founded architectural practice best known for its iconic designs for Apple stores in New York City, France, and Japan, has completed four new dwellings at High Meadow, the Fallingwater Institute’s home base for its summer residency program. The architecture, artist, and design residency to study the Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece quickly outgrew the its original structure, a 1960s cabin with four bedrooms located on a historic farm adjacent to Fallingwater. The resulting plan, designed by the firm’s Pittsburgh studio, doubled the property’s capacity by way of simple wooden cabin-like “portals” that frame views of the surrounding landscape. The entrance is made up of a central screened porch that joins the existing building with the new construction and also acts as a communal dining and outdoor gathering space. The horizontal screen, made of Norway Spruce harvested and milled on site, extends along a walkway that leads to the four individual dwellings. Perched above the ground on a network of “nimble” steel columns, the High Meadow residency includes minimal decoration and furniture, with each abode containing just a desk, closet, bathroom, and two twin beds. The newly expanded Fallingwater Institute will reopen this spring for its second season of increased operation. High Meadow received the 2016 AIA Pennsylvania Silver Medal, the highest honor given by the Institute's Pennsylvania chapter. Take a look below.

More videos Apple appeals EU tax ruling Apple has launched a legal challenge to a record $US14 billion EU tax demand, arguing that EU regulators ignored tax experts and corporate law, and deliberately picked a method to maximise the penalty. Recall that in August Apple was ordered by repay €13 billion in taxes and interest after European Commission found the software giant's Irish tax structure was "illegal under EU state aid rules".  This week Margrethe Vestager, a Danish politician, who is currently serving as the European Commissioner for Competition and took on the Apple case last year, said that regardless of what Trump does ("whatever US tax reform they may pass is, of course, for them") the ruling stands. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link US President Donald Trump would give multinationals a special tax break if they brought profits to be taxed back to the US. Photo: Bloomberg "What is important for us is ... if any company or group of companies gets selective advantages by member states and thereby unlevelling (sic) the playing field." But what if other countries might want a share of the tax owed? Advertisement As Vestager noted a her statement after the decision last year: "It may be that not all the unpaid taxes are due in Ireland. Other countries, in the EU or elsewhere, can look at our investigation." She continues: "If they conclude that Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries instead of Ireland, they could require Apple to pay more tax locally. That would reduce the amount to be paid back to Ireland." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition, says the ruling against Apple stands. Photo: AP This leads to Trump's tax plan. He wants some of the $2.5 trillion profits that Fortune 500 companies hold offshore to be brought back to the US. To do this, Trump has proposed giving them a special one-off 10 per cent rate on their offshore earnings rather than taxing them at the full 35 per cent US corporate tax rate. A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a non-profit, non-partisan think tank that works on state and federal tax policy issues, suggests Apple could gain a $US48.1 billion ($62.9 billion) tax break because of Trump's proposal. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.  Photo: AP   "Under current rules, Apple should pay $67.3 billion in taxes when its $216 billion in earnings being held offshore are repatriated," the report says, noting the calculation is based on the estimated 3.8 per cent tax rate the company has paid to other governments on its offshore earnings. Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion. ITEP report Ordinarily Apple would be subject to a 31.2 per cent tax on these earnings upon repatriation. But under Trump's planned repatriation of 10 per cent, it would allow the company to pay just $19.2 billion, representing a $48.1 billion tax break compared to the $67.3 billion it would otherwise owe. No wonder Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.  But it is not just Apple that stands to gain from the proposed tax holiday. The ITEP report examines the benefit to the 10 companies with the most money offshore – Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Citigroup, Amgen, Qualcomm, Gilead Sciences, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, and Bank of America. The report suggests  that Trump's plan would allow US companies to collectively pay an estimated $206 billion in taxes on their $2.5 trillion in offshore earnings, rather than the roughly $720 billion that they would owe if these earnings were subject to the statutory corporate tax rate. "In other words, Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion," it says. Rather than rewarding tax avoidance for a short-term revenue boost, the report calls on lawmakers to pursue legislation that would require companies to pay the full $720 billion they owe on their unrepatriated earnings. Meanwhile in Australia the Australian Taxation Office, equipped with tougher anti-avoidance laws, has been investigating a number of multinationals over their tax structures. Apple is among a number of technology companies currently under audit by ATO over its transfer pricing structures. According to its latest accounts filed with the corporate regulator ASIC, Apple's Australian revenue fell $296 million, or 3 per cent, to hit $7.5 billion in 2016. Its profit fell $119 million, or 97 per cent, to $3.6 million, which was largely due to an increase in the company's reported tax expense. Apple paid $128 million in income tax ($69.8 million related to FY2016) and there was an adjustment of $58.3 million relating to prior years.  The tech giant's local tax bill has fluctuated over the years, but is up from $85 million in 2015 and $80.3 million in 2014. 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Apple has hired Tim Twerdahl, the former head of Amazon's Fire TV unit, in an effort to revive its struggling Apple TV business, which has been losing market share to rival streaming content services. Twerdahl joined Apple this month as vice president in charge of product marketing for Apple TV, and the company shifted the unit's former head to a post responsible for negotiating content deals, according to a Bloomberg report. Amazon hired Twerdahl in 2013 as general manager of the Amazon Fire unit. Twerdahl previously was a vice president for smartwatch developer WIMM Labs. He spent almost two years at Roku, where he was vice president for consumer products. Twerdahl reports to Greg Joswiak, vice president in charge of marketing the iPhone, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. Pete Distad, vice president of product marketing at Apple, now is negotiating content agreements under SVP Eddie Cue, who leads that effort. After a promising beginning, Apple TV rapidly began losing share to rival streaming devices, according to data eMarketer released last fall. Apple TV is projected to grow from 20.5 million users in 2016 to just 25.8 million by 2020. During the same period, Google Chromecast is expected to almost double it user base from 30.6 million in 2016 to 59.6 million by 2020. Amazon Fire TV is projected to grow from 28 million users to 54.6 million by 2020, and Roku is projected to expand from 29.9 million users in 2016 to 45.9 million by 2020. Content Poor Apple last fall announced a new television app designed to give users a unified experience for accessing content on an Apple TV, iPad or iPhone. The release included a new tune-in with Siri feature that allows users to access live news and sports feeds. For Apple, the content ship largely has sailed. The company fell behind its rivals by negotiating itself out of potential deals with studios, and it fell behind streaming platforms at Amazon and Netflix in terms of developing original programming. "Apple's entry into home video was completely botched," remarked Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "It waited until the market had been pretty much defined by others, then came in with an overpriced product with substandard content," he told the E-Commerce Times. Consumers shied away from Apple TV because it fell far behind its rivals in terms of a value proposition, Jude said. It then attempted to sell video content through the iTunes model, which didn't work well. "Consumers will accept a high price if they get a premium level of content," he noted. "That means that Apple will need to provide live-streaming video from the usual sources, plus invest in unique content that users want." CBS Interactive, for example, is developing a new Star Trek series for its own streaming-content business, which will help draw cord-cutting customers who are willing to pay a monthly fee for that service. "The networks were wary of having an iTunes for TV proposition on their hands," said Tim Mulligan, senior analyst at Midia Research. "iTunes worked because Steve Jobs was able to persuade the major record labels, and content IP was highly concentrated," he told the E-Commerce Times. Lessons Lost Television is a highly fragmented business, Mulligan observed. Networks don't want to repeat the same mistakes made by the music industry, which eventually gave Apple so much power that it became the de facto most powerful music distributor. Pay TV companies put a great deal of pressure on the television networks through their carriage deals to make things more difficult in terms of providing content to video disruptors, he pointed out. What Apple has been trying to accomplish is to develop value-added content on top of its core Apple Music business, which is fighting to compete with rival streaming service Spotify, said Dan Cryan, director of broadband and digital media at IHS. Apple has been working for more than a year on Vital Signs, a series starring Dr. Dre, Cryan told the E-Commerce Times. Dre is the iconic producer and hip hop artist who, along with partner Jimmy Iovine, launched headset maker Beats by Dr. Dre in 2006. They sold the firm to Apple in 2014. David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey. He has written for Reuters, Bloomberg, Crain's New York Business and The New York Times.

Re: Can Former Amazon Fire TV Exec Save Apple TV From Itself? jescott418Posted 2017-02-10 Apple is clueless at being competitive. It introduced a reasonable Apple TV box but failed at providing more third party content. It wanted to hog all the revenue. Then it introduced a more expensive model but never fixed that nagging content issue. Again, because Apple wants that chunk of the pie. Chromecast is cheap, Amazon TV is cheap and both beat Apple in content options. As someone who jumped on Apple TV early then abandoned for Roku. I don't think Apple knows how to compete, it believes it has enough Apple flock to buy into its products and it's finding out those buyers are looking for more value. Can a former Amazon Fire executive fix Apple TV? Only if he can convince Apple it needs fixing.

The delay, noticed first by MacRumors this afternoon, extends the wait for the Apple-certified monitor from two weeks, while LG continues to work on a shielding fix for future models to help cut down on electromagnetic interference. The 4K version of the device is still readily available, with a shipping estimate of about two to three days. The issue was first pointed out by Apple-dedicated news sites and early owners of the display late last month. At the time, 9to5Mac received confirmation from LG that the nearly $1,000 peripheral becomes unusable when located within two feet of a router. This was a problem specific to the UltraFine 5K model and not any other LG monitor, including the 4K version in the same product family. The problem should be fixed thanks to “enhanced shielding” in future models sold. LG says. The company is also currently retrofitting existing models on a case-by-case basis, and owners affected by the interference problem need to contact LG to get the process rolling. - Via: MacRumors - Source: Apple.com Next Up In Circuit Breaker First photo of Magic Leap prototype leaks The LG Watch Sport and Watch Style are now available to order I really love this little USB-C laptop wall charger Fine, professionals, you can have a curved display, but it’s not going to look cool Android’s convenient Instant Tethering is now rolling out to Pixel and Nexus devices This might be the logo for Samsung’s Bixby AI assistant Now Trending Congressman is righteously booed after dodging a young girl’s simple question about science Android’s convenient Instant Tethering is now rolling out to Pixel and Nexus devices This Article has a component height of 5.

Samsung legal battle goes back to its roots A federal appeals court says it's up to a district court to decide if there should be a damages retrial in the long-running patent case. Tech Industry by Shara Tibken February 7, 2017 1:41 PM PST @sharatibken An appeals court has ordered Apple v. Samsung back to a lower court in San Jose, California. Shara Tibken/CNET Apple v. Samsung Electronics is headed back to where it all began: district court in San Jose, California. A federal appeals court on Tuesday ordered that the long-running patent dispute be sent back to a lower court. That lower court, where the trials originally took place, will decide whether to hold another damages retrial or what other recourse to take. "We look forward to making our case at the district court and prevailing on behalf of all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace," Samsung said in a statement. Apple didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Apple and Samsung have been battling over patents since 2012, and a question about how much money could be owed for infringing design patents made it all the way to the Supreme Court in late 2016. In December, the Supreme Court said in a unanimous opinion that damages for design patent infringement can be based only on the part of the device that infringed the patents, not necessarily on the entire product. Samsung wins in Supreme Court battle against Apple The ruling says that Samsung doesn't have to pay all its profits from sales of devices based on copied designs. by Lexy Savvides 1:14 Close Drag That ruling reshapes the value of designs, and how much one company has to pay for copying the look of a competitor's product. Before the ruling, the law said an award could be collected on the entire profits of an infringing device. In this case, that's the $399 million Samsung paid Apple late last year. The Supreme Court didn't give guidance on how damages should be decided, though, and now an appeals court isn't weighing in, either. With Tuesday's ruling, the US court of appeals for the federal circuit has punted the case back to district court for the Northern District of California. See also Samsung scores unanimous Supreme Court win over Apple Supreme Court grills Apple, Samsung over value of design patents CNET's full coverage of Apple vs. Samsung "Trial courts are well suited for this type of analysis, so it makes sense that the Federal Circuit -- rather than create a procedure from whole-cloth -- would like to see how the trial court approaches the problem," said Case Collard, a partner at law firm Dorsey & Whitney. Apple had asked for the appeals court to uphold the earlier damages ruling because Samsung never showed an "article of manufacture" to be anything other than an entire phone. Samsung, meanwhile, wanted the case sent back to district court for a new damages trial. Instead, the federal circuit said it will be up to the district court to decide if a new trial is needed. "On remand, the trial court should consider the parties' arguments in light of the trial record and determine what additional proceedings, if any, are needed," it said. "If the court determines that a new damages trial is necessary, it will have the opportunity to set forth a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture for purposes of [Section 289 of the Patent Act of 1952] and to apply that test to this case."

Includes W1 chip for fast, seamless connection with iOS devices. Excellent wireless range. Cons No auto power-down or sleep mode. Sculpted sound signature not for audio purists. Bottom Line The BeatsX Bluetooth earphones from Beats deliver strong audio performance and excellent wireless connectivity, aided by Apple's W1 chip. By Tim Gideon Beats continues to update its lineup of wireless earphones with new models that utilize Apple's W1 chip. The BeatsX are collar band-style in-ears that use Apple's W1 chip for seamless, quick pairing with iOS devices, as well as improved wireless connectivity. Most of the Beats products we test offer solid, if very sculpted, audio performance, and the BeatsX earphones are no exception. The difference here is that the deep bass and sculpted, bright highs come at a reasonable $149.95. For the price, the BeatsX are worthy of our Editors' Choice award for wireless earphones. //Compare Similar Products Compare JBL Reflect Mini BT   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Bose SoundSport Wireless   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Skullcandy Method Wireless   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Beats Powerbeats3 Wireless   %displayPrice%%seller% see it B&O Play Beoplay H5   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Bose QuietControl 30   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Jaybird X3   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Design The collar band-style BeatsX earphones are available in white or black models (with blue and gray models coming in the near future). The design features a flat, linguini-esque cable that becomes a little more rigid in the section that loosely clasps around the back of your neck. The earpieces are magnetic—they snap together when not in your ears. Two identically sized and shaped inline compartments are situated at the open point in the collar that rests at the front of your neck, just below where the cabling ascends to your ears. The left compartment houses a Lightning charging port (another perk of the Apple-Beats partnership), while the right side houses the power/pairing button, which includes a status LED. On the left side, at roughly chin level, there's an inline microphone and remote control. The remote has a central button that controls playback, call management, track navigation, and voice commands; the two outer buttons are dedicated volume controls that work together with the master volume on iOS devices. The mic offers decent intelligibility, but it's not as clear as the iPhone's. I also found that the mic tended to tap against my face or brush against my facial hair, creating a somewhat annoying rustling sound, but this is more of a mic placement issue than a comment on the mic itself. The BeatsX will be a joy to use for most iOS device owners—particularly those with multiple devices. The W1 chip means it can seamlessly connect between devices that are signed into your iCloud account. And connecting is very quick—there's no need to go to your Bluetooth menu. An onscreen prompt appears immediately when the earphones are on and close enough to your device—one tap and you're connected. If you don't use iCloud, no worries—it only adds one (very quick) step when you switch between iOS devices. And if you're interested in the BeatsX but don't have an Apple device, no worries—the earphones function as regular a regular Bluetooth with all other mobile audio devices. Another perk of the W1 chip, is its improved connectivity. The BeatsX stayed paired through closed doors and walls, and well beyond the traditional 30-or-so feet of Bluetooth range. This is a perk that also disappears without an iOS devices to connect with, but the earphones operate within the standard Bluetooth range with non-iOS devices just fine. You get three standard-shaped pairs of silicone eartips in various sizes, one flange-style pair, two pairs of fins that fasten on the eartips for a more stable fit, a rubber carrying pouch (that oddly doesn't close—there's no zipper, button, or magnet), and a Lightning-to-USB cable. I actually found the fit for my ears more stable (and the in-canal seal stronger) without the fins on, but all ears are different. Beats estimates battery life to be roughly 8 hours, but your results will vary based on your volume levels. Beats also claims that charging the earphones for a mere five minutes nets you two hours of battery life. That's excellent news, considering it's easy to leave them on accidentally, and they never power down automatically, even after long periods of inactivity. The lack of auto power-down or even a sleep mode seems like a design oversight. Performance It's possible to have the BeatsX in your ear canals fairly securely, but not quite fully pressed in place, and this will make a tremendous difference in the audio performance. If the earphones sound tinny and thin, chances are you need to tap them in a bit further or grab a different pair of eartips. When firmly place, the earphones deliver a solid, rich bass response. On tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife's "Silent Shout," you get laudable thunder that doesn't distort at top, unwise listening levels. At moderate volumes, the bass still sounds powerful, but is balanced out by plenty of sculpting in the highs, as well. See How We Test Headphones Bill Callahan's "Drover," a track with less deep bass in the mix, gives us better idea of how much bass is added to the equation when the track doesn't really call for it. The drums on this track can sound unnatural and overly heavy on seriously bass-boosted earphones, but Beats does a nice job of boosting the lows without things veering into ridiculous territory. Sure, there's more low-end here than there would be through a flat response pair of earphones, but the lows are dialed up in a reasonable, responsible manner. The drums, therefore, are powerful without sounding comically huge, and Callahan's baritone vocals get a pleasant richness in the low-mids, but things never get muddy. This is in part due to the very sculpted high-mids and highs—the vocals get a crackling treble edge and the guitar's attack has a clear, precise contour to it. On Jay-Z and Kanye West's "No Church in the Wild," the kick drum loop receives enough high-mid presence to stay sharp and slice through the layers of the mix, though we've heard this track sound slightly more crisp before. The drum loop's sustain gets a touch of added low-mid and low frequency thump, and the sub-bass synth hits that punctuate the beat receive plenty of deep low frequency presence, but again, not nearly as much as we often hear from competing in-ears. All three vocal performances are delivered front and center—they don't compete with the lows for the spotlight, and they sound clear and crisp without any sense of added sibilance or harshness in the high-mids. Orchestral tracks, like the opening scene in John Adams' The Gospel According to the Other Mary, also sound vibrant and rich. There's a boosted bass response bringing out the lower register instrumentation, for sure, but it's nothing over-the-top. The higher register vocals, brass, and strings own the spotlight, delivered with a pleasant clarity and brightness that also benefits here and there from the added punches of low-end when they appear in the mix. Purists will call this a very sculpted sound, but most listeners will appreciate the added richness and vibrance, regardless of how accurate the sound signature is. Conclusions Of all the earphones and headphones we've tested with the W1 chip thus far, the BeatsX are our favorite. You get all the benefits of the chip, along with a secure fit and a refreshingly reasonable price (for Beats, that is). But mainly, it's the balanced sound signature that wins us over, with rich bass levels matched by solid clarity in the highs. If you want the W1 chip without the collar band design, consider the Beats Powerbeats3 Wireless. If you don't mind the collar band but want to spend far less money, the Skullcandy Method Wireless is a solid option. We're also fans of the neckband-style JBL Reflect Mini BT and Bose SoundSport Wireless. At $150, though, the BeatsX offer powerful audio performance enhanced by strong wireless connectivity, and earn our Editors' Choice award.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Accessories Image Source: Reddit No, Apple didn’t just fix its dongle problem with a miraculous new connector Chris Smith @chris_writes February 7th, 2017 at 7:45 AM Share Tweet It takes a lot of courage to make changes that customers may like, and Apple is one prime example of that. The company is planning a wireless future for its devices, but that road is paved with lots and dongles and adapters that are needed to bridge the past to said future. The best examples in that regard are the iPhone 7 which lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack and the 2016 MacBook Pro which lacks any ports but USB-C connectors. A report on Monday hinted that Apple may be working on a new type of connector for iPhone accessories that would be thinner than USB-C and Lightning ports, the Ultra Accessory Connector or UAC. It turns out that’s not the case. Don't Miss: 250,000 smartphones light up the night in massive anti-corruption protests in Romania Documentation shared with Made for iPhone (MFI) partners seen by 9to5Mac reveals the UAC is an 8-pin connector that measures 2.05 x 4.84mm at the tip. The connector might be used by some accessory makers instead of USB-C or Lightning ports, to save space, but won’t be found in future iPhones or Mac. A second report in Ars Technica explains that the UAC connector that will be used in MFi accessories already exists. It’s called Ultra Mini Connector by Mitsumi, while Nikon calls it UC-E6. Apple confirmed to Ars that it’s adding the port to the MFi program at the request of licensees, not because it’s looking to adopt a new kind of connector for the accessories made for iPhone and Mac. Apple’s specs for UAC indicate that the new connector will be used for headphones, 9to5Mac said in its original report. Apple will let manufacturers create Lightning to UAC, USB-A to UAC, and 3.5mm to UAC, adaptors. Yes, that means you might need even more dongles for future iPhone accessories. In other words, Apple is far from fixing its dongle hell problem.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The iPhone 7s and 7s Plus May Offer Something Cool After All Philip Michaels Senior Editor Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)February 9, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Most everyone agrees that when Apple trots out new iPhones later this year, there will be three of them — an iPhone 8, which will feature an edge-to-edge OLED screen among other fantastic features, along with new versions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus that will feature modest (and, therefore, less fantastic) improvements over the current models. But one leading analyst thinks the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus should sport at least one significant improvement over their predecessors. Credit: ConceptsiPhone (YouTube)The latest research note from analyst KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo forecasts wireless charging for all three iPhones, according to MacRumors which got its hands on the note. Kuo's pronouncements about Apple's plans tend to carry more weight, as he's developed a reputation for being spot-on with his reports about future iPhone features. Credit: ConceptsiPhone (YouTube)More MORE: Here's the Most Shocking iPhone 8 Rumor Yet If that's the case here, the addition of wireless charging is a big deal for iPhone fans. That's a feature found in leading Android devices that's currently missing from the iPhone lineup. Expanding it to all the new iPhone models and not just the high-end iPhone 8 would be a welcome move by Apple, particularly since reports have the price tag on that cutting-edge iPhone approaching $1,000. Kuo's new note has some explanation for why the iPhone 8 may turn out to be so pricey. MacRumors reports that Kuo expects the iPhone 8 to a new 3D Touch module that would deal with the increased heat from wireless charging in an OLED-equipped phone. That new module will cost Apple more to get its hands on, which could wind up pushing up the price of that particular iPhone model. Wireless charging won't be the only change to the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus models (if that's what Apple winds up calling them). Last year, Kuo predicted a move to an all-glass design for the iPhone, and as MacRumors noted at the time, that change is expected to apply to the entire lineup. You should also expect faster performance and improved cameras. People have been predicting that Apple would adopt wireless charging for its 2017 phones as early as a year ago. That rumor picked up steam after reports that Apple was switching to the all-glass design, which is friendly to wireless charging, as well as reports that parts suppliers were signing on to provide Apple with the components needed to support the feature. The latest reports have the iPhone supporting a more conventional form of wireless charging, in which you place your phone on a charging pad, instead of over-the-air charging — at least for this year's models.

More videos Apple appeals EU tax ruling Apple has launched a legal challenge to a record $US14 billion EU tax demand, arguing that EU regulators ignored tax experts and corporate law, and deliberately picked a method to maximise the penalty. Recall that in August Apple was ordered by repay €13 billion in taxes and interest after European Commission found the software giant's Irish tax structure was "illegal under EU state aid rules".  This week Margrethe Vestager, a Danish politician, who is currently serving as the European Commissioner for Competition and took on the Apple case last year, said that regardless of what Trump does ("whatever US tax reform they may pass is, of course, for them") the ruling stands. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link US President Donald Trump would give multinationals a special tax break if they brought profits to be taxed back to the US. Photo: Bloomberg "What is important for us is ... if any company or group of companies gets selective advantages by member states and thereby unlevelling (sic) the playing field." But what if other countries might want a share of the tax owed? Advertisement As Vestager noted a her statement after the decision last year: "It may be that not all the unpaid taxes are due in Ireland. Other countries, in the EU or elsewhere, can look at our investigation." She continues: "If they conclude that Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries instead of Ireland, they could require Apple to pay more tax locally. That would reduce the amount to be paid back to Ireland." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition, says the ruling against Apple stands. Photo: AP This leads to Trump's tax plan. He wants some of the $2.5 trillion profits that Fortune 500 companies hold offshore to be brought back to the US. To do this, Trump has proposed giving them a special one-off 10 per cent rate on their offshore earnings rather than taxing them at the full 35 per cent US corporate tax rate. A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a non-profit, non-partisan think tank that works on state and federal tax policy issues, suggests Apple could gain a $US48.1 billion ($62.9 billion) tax break because of Trump's proposal. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.  Photo: AP   "Under current rules, Apple should pay $67.3 billion in taxes when its $216 billion in earnings being held offshore are repatriated," the report says, noting the calculation is based on the estimated 3.8 per cent tax rate the company has paid to other governments on its offshore earnings. Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion. ITEP report Ordinarily Apple would be subject to a 31.2 per cent tax on these earnings upon repatriation. But under Trump's planned repatriation of 10 per cent, it would allow the company to pay just $19.2 billion, representing a $48.1 billion tax break compared to the $67.3 billion it would otherwise owe. No wonder Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.  But it is not just Apple that stands to gain from the proposed tax holiday. The ITEP report examines the benefit to the 10 companies with the most money offshore – Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Citigroup, Amgen, Qualcomm, Gilead Sciences, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, and Bank of America. The report suggests  that Trump's plan would allow US companies to collectively pay an estimated $206 billion in taxes on their $2.5 trillion in offshore earnings, rather than the roughly $720 billion that they would owe if these earnings were subject to the statutory corporate tax rate. "In other words, Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion," it says. Rather than rewarding tax avoidance for a short-term revenue boost, the report calls on lawmakers to pursue legislation that would require companies to pay the full $720 billion they owe on their unrepatriated earnings. Meanwhile in Australia the Australian Taxation Office, equipped with tougher anti-avoidance laws, has been investigating a number of multinationals over their tax structures. Apple is among a number of technology companies currently under audit by ATO over its transfer pricing structures. According to its latest accounts filed with the corporate regulator ASIC, Apple's Australian revenue fell $296 million, or 3 per cent, to hit $7.5 billion in 2016. Its profit fell $119 million, or 97 per cent, to $3.6 million, which was largely due to an increase in the company's reported tax expense. Apple paid $128 million in income tax ($69.8 million related to FY2016) and there was an adjustment of $58.3 million relating to prior years.  The tech giant's local tax bill has fluctuated over the years, but is up from $85 million in 2015 and $80.3 million in 2014. 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile The iPhone 8 Will Feature Optical Fingerprint Recognition Claims Chinese Source By Ramish Zafar Feb 8, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Ah the iPhone 8. Apple’s flagship smartphone for 2017 is a regular feature of the rumor mill, even though its due in September. The iPhone turns 10 this year folks and Apple’s going to come out all guns blazing. OLED will finally, finally make it on the lineup and we’re likely to see some new materials thrown in the mix as well. Our sources in China are benevolent today and have provided some more details for the iPhone 8. Take a look below to find out more. The Apple iPhone 8 Will Feature Advanced Fingerprint Recognition Claims Source As we started covering leaks in 2017, the Samsung Galaxy S8 was the center of attention. Samsung’s device for this year is rumored to have a lot of amazing features. The most impressive of these was fingerprint recognition for the device. Sources claimed that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will feature a fingerprint sensor that’s hidden under the device’s screen. However, as time elapsed, fresh rumors elaborated that Samsung will simply shift the sensor onto the device’s back. If you’re looking for optical fingerprint recognition, Apple’s got you covered. Our sources from China now claim that the iPhone 8 will come with the feature. Two companies are expected to release optical fingerprint recognition hardware this year. This, in turn will make it on the iPhone 8 if the Chinese microblogging sphere Weibo is taken at its word. The feature has been rumored for the iPhone for quite a while. Advertisement According to the source, the iPhone 8 will not feature any buttons on its front facade, just like the upcoming Samsung flagship. However, unlike the S8, the device will be able to recognize your fingerprint on the front facade. This will provide Apple with a lot of room on the device’s front and make for a very good looking iPhone. Combine this with the implementation of OLED on the iPhone 8 and we’re sure that your eyes won’t get tired of looking at that large screen. Flagships for 2017 will be all rounders. Not only is the iPhone 8 rumored with the aforementioned display, but the device will also be powered with a 10nm processor, potentially the Apple A11. Cupertino made the jump to quad core with the A10 Fusion last year and when we combine its hardware/software integration with the benefits of 10nm, the expected performance will be off the charts. There’s a lot of time until the iPhone 8 is launched so more details will surface. Till then, stay tuned and let us know what you think in the comments section below. We’ll keep you updated.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor Apple’s iPhone 8 Will Feature A Unique, All-In-One UAC Adapter Suggests Rumor By Ramish Zafar Feb 8, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit The iPhone 8 is a regular feature of the rumor mill. This is despite the fact that the device will be launched in September. Apple will introduce a lot of upgrades this year, the biggest of which will be OLED displays. Company fans and industry watchers have pleaded for the display for quite a while. Now, we’ve got some more details for the iPhone 8. Take a look below to find out more. Apple Will Introduce An All New UAC Adapter Using Lightning Compatibility On The iPhone 8 A lot of big rumors have surfaced for the iPhone 8. An edge to edge display, optical fingerprint recognition, bezel free display, a glass build and other details paint a positive picture for the device. Combine these aesthetics with the much awaited upgrade to 10nm processors and you’ll see how Apple plans to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its biggest product to date. The iPhone’s hit a few rough patches in its history, the latest of which is Apple’s decision to remove the 3.5mm earphone jack on the device. To compensate, Apple paired the device with a lightning to 3.5mm adapter, for all those users unwilling to upgrade to wireless earphones. However, it’s a rather clunky approach for the iPhone. The smartphone is after all, built around notions of seamless functionality. Advertisement This year, with the iPhone 8 Apple will overcome this drawback as well, if our Chinese friends are correct. Sources claim that the iPhone 8 will feature a new UAC adapter. Through this, the smartphone will feature USB Type-C, Type-A, lightning, 3.5mm and other interfaces. It’s a good concept which will refine the iPhone’s connectivity a lot. Apple’s caught in a bit of a rut with regards to ports this year. The latest MacBook Pros feature very few ports, drawing outcries from a lot of folks out there. iPhone 8 Set to Smash Previous Record Sales Held by the iPhone 6 A UAC adapter will eliminate the need for any other connectors for the iPhone and save users some hard earned cash as well. Not to mention that it’ll transform another vital smartphone accessory, the adapter. The iPhone 8 is seeing some big rumors folks. The device will be a complete overhaul of the lineup if rumors turn true. There’s a lot of time left until September. More information will surface in the coming months. Till then, stay tuned and let us know what you think in the comments section below. We’ll keep you updated on the latest in the meantime.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple’s AirPods And Other Headphones Will Convert Into Speakers Through This Patent By Ramish Zafar Feb 8, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple made a controversial decision with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus last year. Cupertino removed the 3.5mm earphone jack on the device, and launched the Apple AirPods. They were its first wireless earphone and an expensive accessory to pair with the iPhone. Now, looks like the company’s got some more plans for them. It’s been granted some new patents and you can take a look at them below. Apple Granted Patent Which Will Convert AirPods Into Speakers At Will The acquisition of Beats allowed Apple to focus on the one area it has always loved. Music. The company’s foray in mobile was led by the iPod way back in 2003. With Beats, Apple is able manufacture a whole array of accessories that suit both average and professional users. Today’s patent will make up for some good ear/headphones as well. It’ll allow users to convert their AirPods or other audio peripherals into speakers at will, in a 2 for 1 combination. Such mechanisms are already present in the company’s current products. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus for example can play music through their ear speakers. The feature works when the device is in landscape mode and saves the need to add extra speaker grilles on the device. The patent we’re talking about, No. 9,565,490 for “Dual mode headphones and methods for constructing the same” will achieve this using on ear, over the ear or in ear headphone configurations. Advertisement Apple will achieve this by adding new proximity sensors. To illustrate with over the ear standard headphones, when the user is wearing then, the sensor on board won’t let the built-in speaker amplifier function. As soon as this position is changed, the amplifier will kick in and play speaker quality outputs. The AirPods already feature motion and proximity sensors but can prove too small to inculcate decent amplifiers. Other iterations of the technology will allow users to manually activate the speaker functionality, secondary ports and more. The patent was filed in 2011, so Apple’s had a lot of time to work on this. It looked serious when the iPhone’s earphone jack was eliminated so such devices can materialize in the future. Imagine if they feature on the iPhone 8 launch. It’ll be the cherry on top for sure. Thoughts? Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned for the latest. We’ll keep you updated.

Many thought the machine was overpriced and underpowered. Andy Vandervell from Trusted Reviews was disappointed after the announcement. “Lately, Apple seems to be in a habit of making everything very inconvenient. From removing the 3.5mm headphone jack in the iPhone to replacing every port on the new MacBook Pro with a USB Type C. Now I need an adaptor for my hard drives, phone charger and SD cards. It’s a pain in the arse, especially the loss of the SD card slot.” Many have complained about the price of the new MacBook Pro. [Image by Daryl Deino] The writer added that not only is the price too high, but the new MacBook Pro actually is a symbolic advertisement for the old one. Jacob Kastrenakes of the Verge certainly had mixed feelings about Apple’s latest high-end notebook as well. “I may come off sounding quite critical of the new MacBook Pro, but the truth is that I really do like it. The hardware is incredible, macOS is a joy to use, and I don’t want to give up this screen and keyboard. It’s a fantastic laptop on build alone. But everywhere I look, it feels like this incarnation of the MacBook Pro is shooting for a future it can’t quite reach.” Kastrenakes adds that in terms of combining thinness with power, battery life, and ports people use, the Pro isn’t quite there — but it’s close. He also thinks the device is overpriced. To be sure, there have been some great reviews as well. Trusted Reviews revisited the 13-inch version after battery issues were fixed and gave Apple’s device four-and-a-half stars. CNET gave the 15-inch version four stars. And judging by sales, it seems as if the naysayers have been proven wrong. According to PC World, shipments of the Pro have helped Apple stop their decline in the laptop market. The shipments don’t prove that the MacBook Pro is a blockbuster, but show that the device is selling far more than people thought it would, especially when Consumer Reports unleashed an anti-Christmas gift for Apple on Dec. 22. “Apple launched a new series of MacBook Pro laptops this fall, and Consumer Reports’ labs have just finished evaluating them. The laptops did very well in measures of display quality and performance, but in terms of battery life, we found that the models varied dramatically from one trial to another.” The article added that tests revealed as little as 3.5 hours of battery life, and as a result, the new MacBook Pro series became the first not to receive recommended ratings from Consumer Reports. Immediately afterwards, many critics called foul play and even accused Consumer Reports of providing “fake news.” However, a couple weeks later, Consumer Reports changed its tune. Consumer Reports gave the new MacBook Pro a thumbs up after Apple provided a software update. [Image by Daryl Deino] “Consumer Reports has now finished retesting the battery life on Apple’s new MacBook Pro laptops, and our results show that a software update released by Apple on January 9 fixed problems we’d encountered in earlier testing,” the publication revealed and added that with the updated software, all three MacBook Pros performed exceptionally well with one model even running 18.75 hours on a charge. There is some good news if you own the new MacBook Pro and belong to the Microsoft Insider program. According to CNET, Microsoft has released a beta version of Microsoft Office with Touch Bar support. Otherwise, Touch Bar support should come during the first half of 2017. Do you own any of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar devices? If so, what are your thoughts? Let us know in the comments section.

The banks demanded access to the NFC hardware in the iPhone to be able to offer competing contactless mobile payments services. Apple refused and the banks went to court. Although draft rulings indicate that the court will rule in favour of Apple, the final decision will be announced in March. Today, Apple continues to lay on the criticism accusing the Australian banks for attempting to ‘delay or even block’ the Apple Pay rollout. Apple claims that the opposition it faced to launch Apple Pay hurts consumers and merchants that want to use the technology. The crux of the dispute is that the banks want access to the NFC components to offer alternative mobile payments services which Apple says would undermine security and simplicity of the iPhone. The banks are — of course — worried about ceding too much control to one company and refute Apple’s complaints. They say that the case has never been about preventing Apple Pay from coming to Australia but it ‘has always been about providing real choice and real competition for consumers and facilitating innovation and investment in the digital wallet functionality available to Australians’. Although the big banks are still holdouts, Apple Pay is supported by American Express and many credit unions in Australia. Worldwide, Apple Pay adoption continues to grow. On its earnings call, the company announced that transaction volume is up 500% year-over-year and the number of users tripled. Apple Pay is available on all the iPhones it currently sells. With the iPhone 7, Apple made a special version of the hardware just for Japan to support the FeliCa standard. Apple Pay also launched on the Mac last year with the new MacBook Pro and integrated Touch ID sensor.

Specifically, tvOS 10.2 beta includes these changes: Accelerated Scrolling support for UIKit and TVMLKit apps Device Enrollment Program support Expanded Mobile Device Management support Support for the VideoToolbox framework While tvOS 10.2 doesn’t include any flashy new features, Apple has been steadily improving the platform with new video features including the new TV app and Single Sign-on. Here’s how Apple describes the TV app that was introduced in December: Watching TV has quickly become all about apps. And now, with the new TV app, you have one place to access shows and movies from multiple video apps — in one unified experience. The TV app lets you see all the movies and shows you’re watching. Find upcoming episodes. Get recommendations for new things to watch. See your entire iTunes video collection. You can even start watching a movie or show directly from the TV app. All without switching between individual apps. Single Sign-on is a separate feature introduced in December that lets users easily authenticate with a supported TV provider once then access paid video apps that support the feature. tvOS 10.2 beta is only available for registered developers. Public beta versions of iOS and macOS are available, but tvoOS and watchOS betas are only available through Apple’s developer program.

Called the Ultra Accessory Connector, or UAC, it’s a smaller connector type that could (though likely won’t) come to products and/or accessories down the line. Even if it doesn’t are you satisfied with Apple’s current “transition” environment with dongle add-ons everywhere? Take Our Poll Apple’s current product lineup has been accused of being somewhat fragmented in terms of connectivity. On the iPhone 7, you have Lightning port and no headphone jack. While, on the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro, you have exclusively USB-C and a headphone jack. This means that the wired headphones you use on your iPhone, you can’t use on your Mac. Unless, of course, you use an adapter…or 2. Furthermore, the switch to USB-C altogether on Mac has frustrated some users, though others have made the change without hassle. A poll we ran centered specifically on the USB-C switch last December found a little more than half of readers reporting they made the switch without hassle, while 25 percent claimed it was a big deal. Taking a step back further, however, makes the situation more interesting. You have Apple promoting a new headphone standard on iPhone that can’t be used with the latest Macs. While you have the company promoting a new connectivity standard on Mac that the iPhone doesn’t use. Apple’s obvious goal in terms of the headphone situation is wireless, as evident by its new AirPods and W1 efforts. Personally, I don’t find the current fragmentation of connectivity options across Apple’s product lineup to be too frustrating. The biggest frustration for me is the lack of a Lightning port on the Mac, but if Apple is in fact planning to move away from Lightning, whether to USB-C or UAC, it’s a move that makes sense in retrospect. In my ideal world, everything would use USB-C and every pair of headphones on the market would be wireless. Obviously, we’re a long way from that being the case, but I think that is also Apple’s goal and we’re slowly moving towards it. What do you think? Is the current dongle-centric Apple product lineup causing you frustration? Or will it be worth it? Let us know in the comments and poll below.

MacRumors obtained a note from the reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who writes that Apple is developing wireless charging features for three iPhones to be released in 2017. Kuo doesn’t say exactly how Apple plans to implement wireless charging. The company already uses wireless charging for the Apple Watch, so it’s very possible we’ll end up seeing something similar to that — it’s the kind of wireless charging we’ve seen on Android phones for years.

MARKETING The 4 Most Crucial Lessons to Learn from Apple's Ad Campaigns Learn what makes Apple's advertising campaigns so effective. By Dan Scalco Dan Scalco is the founder and director of growth at Digitalux, a digital marketing agency located in Hoboken, New Jersey. Throughout his career, he has helped hundreds of businesses save time, increase leads, and maximize sales. @DanScalco Founder and director of growth, Digitalux@DanScalco WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement When talking about good advertising strategies, it's rare that Apple won't come up. They've helmed some of the most creative ad campaigns of all time, and any entrepreneur stands to learn a ton just by observing how they market their products. While their specific ad strategies have changed over the years, there are four qualities that seem to form the backbone of their campaigns. These four lessons stand out as particularly helpful to business owners looking to take their marketing a cut above the rest. 1) Keep It Clean When it comes to effective advertising, less can be so much more. Many companies feel that they need to maximize their impact by producing ads chocked full of graphics and copy. But notice that Apple's ads are always pristinely clean. By using simple, unobtrusive fonts and making ample use of negative space, they draw the eye of their potential clients right to their product, which is where it belongs. While the product is also elegantly clean, it stands out among the negative space. This clean style that Apple perfected is so effective that it's become pretty ubiquitous. Even Microsoft, Apple's longstanding rival, is not above copying Apple's clean aesthetic to stay in the game. Cut out all the fluff so that the people can get at the product. 2) Keep It Simple Apple's copy is simple, but inspiring. The company doesn't feel the need to put its technical specifications under the spotlight. Instead, they deliver succinct, provocative tags that spark the imagination of the user. Their copy is easily digestible. It doesn't overwhelm the reader. Apple doesn't "innovate technological solutions", they "Think Different". The difference between these two approaches is critical. The first tries to impress you with a bunch of technical jargon that will likely just leave you frustrated. It's a big mark of insecurity. The other approach, already confident that its product is impressive, puts copy in front of you that engages your imagination, creating a bond between you and the brand. While this simple style is synonymous with Apple, you'll find it in tons of successful ad campaigns--maybe the father of which was the "Think Small" campaign, launched to break the VW Beetle into the American market in 1959. 3) Keep It Real This point should almost go without saying, all the great marketing in the world won't save you if your brand and product aren't where they ought to be. Apple's ad campaigns are great, but they're supporting what's already a great product. And that is the ultimate foundation of Apple's success. As another example, take the mattress company Casper. They've gotten a lot of attention for their ad campaigns and celebrity endorsements, but what's keeping them going is that they have a solid product to offer that's innovative, well reviewed, and meeting the needs of their market. Elegant, effective marketing should be nothing more than a reflection of an elegant, effective product. People loved Apple's "Get a Mac" ad campaign, but part of that was because it rang true: Apple's UX was lightyears ahead of its competition, and that's a big part of why people related to the "I'm a Mac" guy. In other words, don't try to get your advertising to save a sub-par product. Your ads should be showing off what is already great and exciting. 4) Keep It Light Apple's ads are also funny and light--breezy in a way that suggests the confidence and familiarity of an old friend. To advertise the iPhone 7's water resistance, for example, they wrote that the 7 not only "makes a splash" but "takes a splash" too. Obviously, humor like this isn't going to win any comedy awards, but in a way, that's also the point: this is the kind of advertising that's clever without calling attention to itself. Again, it's a matter of confidence: Apple is confident enough in its product that it doesn't need to take itself so seriously. The home security company Nest, which Google bought in 2014 for $3.2 billion, also gets this principle. In advertising its home security camera, Nest doesn't wow you off the bat with the camera's specs. Instead, it slips you a clever and effective tag-- "Even the bad guys will stop and stare". The lesson here is clear: if you actually believe in what you're selling, don't scream for attention. And at the same time, leave somberness and sobriety to public service announcements: your customers want to have fun.

Opinion | 06 Feb 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (38) What Apple Can Learn from Airwalk by Josh Centers When I was a teenager in the 1990s, Airwalk shoes were all the rage. They were a mandatory accessory for grunge-oriented youths, along with plaid shirts and corduroy pants. The company was founded in 1986, and in its heyday in the 1990s, it had grown to be the third-largest sneaker brand, behind only Nike and Adidas. Today’s teens have undoubtedly never even heard of Airwalk sneakers, which are now found on the bargain rack at Payless Shoesource. What happened? Wait, this is TidBITS, not a fashion magazine, so why am I talking about shoes? Keep reading. I’m about to tell you a story that may sound chillingly familiar. Airwalk began as a niche shoe for professional skateboarders. Skating legend Tony Hawk (who starred in an eponymous video game that ran on the Mac, along with many other platforms) was one of their first customers, and actually suggested the name. Much of Airwalk’s early popularity was due to getting input from skaters to create superior skateboarding shoes that wouldn’t cause blisters or crashes. Airwalk had a healthy business, but it didn’t hit the big time until it hired advertising firm Lambesis to run an ultra-chic, counter-cultural ad campaign. As Malcolm Gladwell wrote in “The Tipping Point,” Airwalk was a $16 million company in 1993. In 1994, it was a $44 million company. In 1995, it was a $150 million company. To satisfy the vast influx of teenage customers while keeping skateboarders and boutique shops happy, Airwalk developed a two-tier strategy. It sold cheaper, consumer-grade shoes to mainstream retailers like Footlocker while continuing to provide pricier, professional-grade shoes to boutique shops. But Airwalk’s success didn’t last. The company’s troubles began in 1997 as production problems led to limited back-to-school supplies. Meanwhile, its lineup had become stale, with few new models. Worst of all, Airwalk abandoned its professional line of shoes. Serious skaters dropped Airwalk, causing the brand to lose its cachet with teens, and it wasn’t long before Airwalk’s time in the sun was over. A smallish company exploding due to quality products and a hip ad campaign. A product line that split into both consumer and professional tiers to provide different price points and features. A company that was later plagued by production problems, stagnant product designs, and ignoring its professional market. Does that sound like another company you can think of? Airwalk might have skated along for a while with its old designs and made peace with retailers, but abandoning its key market of hardcore skaters was what drove it into market irrelevance. In terms of managing supply chains and industrial design, Apple has a pair of superstars in Tim Cook and Jony Ive (to the extent Ive is still involved in product design, anyway). And Apple no longer worries about disappointing retailers, having opened hundreds of its own stores. More concerning is how Apple is treating its professional users. Let’s itemize a few of the ways Apple has moved away from the professional market over the past five years: Killing the Xserve Dumbing down Final Cut Pro with Final Cut Pro X Replacing the pro app Aperture with the consumer-level Photos Increasing burdensome restrictions on Mac App Store apps Releasing a new Mac Pro without internal expandability Failing to update that Mac Pro for over 3 years Delaying updates to the MacBook Pro line for nearly 18 months Releasing a new MacBook Pro that has drawn criticism from professionals Showing a lack of support for automation by eliminating the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies We’re not alone in saying that Apple is now the iPhone company (see “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac,” 21 November 2016). That’s where most of its profit comes from, and so that’s where most of its resources go. Fair enough. But, here’s the thing: the Mac and the capabilities it provides to professionals are the foundation of that iPhone business. Die-hard Mac users kept Apple afloat in the dark years before the iPod and then iPhone. And even now, regardless of all other professional uses of the Mac, developers need Xcode on the Mac to create iOS apps. Apple still has many things in its favor: $241 billion in cash, massive profits every quarter, one of the most popular brands in the world, and nearly 500 successful retail stores. And it might seem odd to criticize Apple now, especially when the company just broke a quarterly record with the most iPhone and Mac sales ever (helped by new iPhone and MacBook Pro models, plus the holiday shopping season, see “Apple Sees Apparent Return to Growth with Q1 2017’s Record Results,” 31 January 2017). But as we saw with Airwalk, things could go downhill fast if professional users were to leave the platform, taking with them all the people and organizations they currently keep loyal to Apple products. I don’t want to be too hard on Apple. The company is still incredibly strong and is doing better in some areas where it has been weak. By many accounts, Final Cut Pro X has improved greatly since its initial release, and some professional movie makers are giving it a chance. App Store review times are plummeting, and Apple is planning to allow developers to respond directly to App Store reviews. Swift is an exciting new programming language with a bright future, and it’s suitable for both compiled apps and scripts. You might argue that Apple and Airwalk aren’t comparable. For instance, although it may have gotten its start providing athletic shoes, Airwalk ultimately became a fashion company. But isn’t Apple similar in many respects? Apple opened its doors with the Apple I hobby kit, and by the mid-2000s, the iPod and its white earbuds were fashion mainstays. The Apple Watch is clearly intended to be a fashion item today. Even the MacBook, with its prominent usage in coffee shops, airports, and other public places, makes its own fashion statement. Despite these similarities, Apple is a much, much larger company than Airwalk ever was. Plus, Apple is making so much money and has so much cash that it can afford many more missteps than a plucky young footwear company. Perhaps most important, Apple can learn from the example of companies like Airwalk that fell from grace after losing sight of their most influential users. Here’s hoping Apple realizes the danger of diverting too much attention away from the Mac and its professional users.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 10:37 Josh, I was thinking about this over the weekend, but came to a different conclusion. Relying on fashion is not the winning strategy for a company that is this large. Nor is relying on what used to sell - gizmos. I am an Apple computer/phone/watch/TV user. I'll probably buy AirPods. But as a stock holder, I don't want Apple to stay there. I want Apple to move into healthcare and financial services and be willing to abandon computer power users along the way. Shoes are a great analogy, they move to a diminishing market. I want Apple to thrive, and I think it is time to move out of the diminishing phone and computers business and into services. If I could delegate Apple resources, I'd put some of the best folks they have on healthcare and finance. What does that make the phone and Mac? Loss leaders in 2020. Important to have but not the future of the company. So I guess that I am hoping Apple does the reverse of your last paragraph. Thanks for letting me think aloud, Peter Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 There's a lot to be said for Apple and services, but it's a matter of convincing the right people to write up their thoughts for us. :-) I think Apple is making some smart moves in the healthcare and IT spaces, especially with its IBM partnership. But as someone who uses Apple computers professionally, I don't want to see Apple become like IBM, moving entirely out of the end-user market to focus on back-end stuff. The iPhone is still by far Apple's largest revenue source, and the Mac users who create things for it are the backbone of that market. Reply David   2017-02-06 10:38 The day that a teen puts a poster of Marco Arment on the wall of their bedroom is the day that I will believe that the professionals you're talking about with regards to Apple are comparable to Tony Hawk. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 Ha! Teens may not idolize developers, but they certainly enjoy the apps they produce, including maybe some of Marco's. You could argue that Snapchat today is what skateboarding was 20+ years ago, though that's sort of a lousy analogy. Another way to think about this is: imagine walking into a coffee shop and instead of MacBooks, everyone was working on Surface Pro tablets. Given enough scale, that'd certainly have a network effect. Something Gladwell describes in his book, which I didn't go into in the article, is how trends develop. You first have what he calls innovators, oddballs who do new things. Then you have other groups who translate those things for the masses, like mavens and connectors. My point is, to put it in Gladwell speak, if those innovators drop Apple for another platform, over time that could trickle down to the masses and quickly eat away Apple's bottom line. Reply David   2017-02-06 17:54 They may enjoy the apps, but I doubt that 1 in 100 of them know the name of the developer who wrote it. And that breaks the link between "I have to wear what Tony Hawk is wearing" and "I have to code on what Marco Arment is coding on." I can equally imagine -- in the coffee shop analogy -- the teens being horrified that the "old people" are using the same thing they are, and fleeing Apple en masse. Finally, I don't find Gladwell's arguments particularly convincing. He seems to me to regularly take a small part of a social science finding (10,000 hours of practice, eg) and blow it up into a much larger and simpler conclusion, one that makes a good pop-sci headline but doesn't really tells us much about the real world. The narrative at the moment seems to be that Apple is neglecting pros and that's going to cost them, but what I've mostly seen is a range of strained arguments about why it's going to cost them, ranging from possibly plausible to pretty outlandish. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:34 I agree about Gladwell, which is why I didn't go too much into his theories in the article. However, outside of the linked interview, his book was the best source for the Airwalk story. The problem with arguments in favor of the professional markets is that there are a lot of intangibles there. In the case of Airwalk, it likely made total sense to dump the pro skater market for consumers — I'm sure they made far, far more money from Foot Locker than local skate shops. However, that turned out to be an enormous mistake, one that wouldn't appear on any spreadsheet. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:44 I think I'd like to see more than an anecdote before I buy into a narrative that is highly convenient for the people telling and reading it. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:44 One might say the same thing about your arguments. There's a whole truckload of wishful thinking there. Just from a local perspective, the predominant healthcare provider in my area, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, has excellent computerized records and services. They work on Windows PCs, not Macs. Other medical professionals use tablets, though they're not iPads, because they have to link with their non-Apple computer systems. Which is to say, without a Mac backbone, medical providers are not going to be using Apple products and services. Sure there are some highly visible Macs on some popular medical TV shows, but again, those are the Macs you so blithely dismiss. Great product placement, by the way. As Josh says, Macs are at the core of Apple's business. Without the Mac, the iPhone is just another gadget, here today, gone tomorrow. You know, like the iPad. And without the Mac, there will be no Apple products in medicine. As for financial whatever, all Apple does now is provide an access point via Apple Pay for consumers to the real financial service providers. They don't actually provide any of those financial services, nor are they likely to do so. Though they make a tidy profit with every Apple Pay transaction. You want to buy a Mac on credit through Apple you'll be using a Barclaycard, one of the highest interest rate charge cards on the planet, to whom Apple is only an intermediate business. In other words, I don't think your ambitions for Apple growth are grounded in anything like reality. As for shoes being a diminishing market, what planet are you living on? As large third-world countries like China, Mexico and India grow more prosperous, shoes will continue to be a growth industry. Just like iPhones. Which is why Apple is working so hard to break into the Indian market with lower price, recycled iPhones. That's where the growth is for them—and for Nike. The iPhone is the primary driver for the App Store, Apple's most prosperous service niche. And the App Store sells apps. And apps for the App Store are developed on Macs. Without the Mac there would be no apps and no App Store and, for all practical purposes, no iPhone. And no Apple. While Microsoft's Surface PCs are not yet a dominant product, Microsoft is clearly thinking long term, hence their huge investment in product placement in the NFL. The Surface Studio is coming out this year and will eventually, I presume to predict, make a significant dent in Apple's base among design professionals. Unless, as Josh hopes, Apple begins to take their professional base seriously once again. If I were twenty years younger I would certainly take the Surface Pro seriously. I share Josh's hope, but I don't share his optimism. If the new MacBook Pro is Apple's idea of a professional computer, with only 16GB of RAM, they've lost their way big time. They've taken their obsession with thin well past the point of diminishing returns. In the meantime, Tim Cook is good at blowing smoke at financial analysts, but as has been pointed out elsewhere in this issue of TidBITS, Apple's record first quarter was a week longer than the same quarter last year. In other words, Cook is using accounting gimmicks to draw a false equivalency between the two. Adjusted for that extra week, Apple's sales and profits are far less rosy than Cook would have us believe. At best they are flat, year over year. Is Apple making lots of money right now? Sure. Even with no growth they're still a rich company with money to burn. But they don't appear to be burning any of it on serious R&D. Like, perhaps, a touch interface for the macOS that can compete with Microsoft. iOS does touch just fine. But Cook refuses to acknowledge the need for it in OS X. Apple is riding high right now. But there's an old expression, what goes up must come down. Put another way, in business if you're not growing, you're dying. Implicit in Josh's argument is the proposition that Apple may have reached the peak of it's growth and success. They won't fail overnight, but that doesn't mean they're not failing. If Tim Cook is not aware of that, as he seems not to be, then Apple will be going downhill from now on. There may be a blip of success here and there, but that won't halt the downward momentum. Tim Cook is a nice guy and Steve Jobs was a jerk. Still, some might say the biggest difference between them is the vision thing. Steve had it. Tim does not. But I think the biggest difference between them is that Steve Jobs would not tolerate mediocrity. Time Cook seems to tolerate it all to well. Thanks David for giving me a jumping off point for my rant. I would have made it anyway, but you gave me a convenient place to start. I agree with Josh's premise, but I'm more skeptical than he is. Josh is politely suggesting that Apple needs to return it's attention to the Mac and the wide range of professional users who depend on it. Unlike Josh, however, I feel no need to be polite. Tim Cook needs to wake the f*ck up. Reply David   2017-02-07 22:37 You're certainly welcome. None of what you said was in response to my actual points, enough that I was wondering if there was another David in the thread. Apparently not. If you'd like to engage with my actual arguments, you're welcome to do that, too. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-09 20:19 The PC 'enthusiast' market (broad term, basically power users of yore) is the only growth/margin market in the PC business. Apple are leaving money on the table by not addressing the enthusiast. Reply Zac Imboden   2017-02-06 15:06 What a thoughtful and well-written analysis. Regarding Peter Meyer's comments, I understand that Apple has it's own unique needs. What I would add is that what may be good for Apple (i.e. corporate expansion, diversification) may not be good for end users, specifically Mac users. I wish Apple to succeed as a company only as far as it concerns how they can continue to meet my needs and not theirs, my needs, not as a content revenue stream, an iPhone user, an iPad user, but as a MAC user. It appears to me that there is no longer any strong financial incentive for Apple to support and innovate their computer hardware and software as that segment continues to shrink in comparison to phone and content revenue. Continuing to complain about ridiculous mistakes in design and implementation and continuing to beg Apple to innovate and improve in the areas which matter the most to Mac users are losing propositions in the long run. If Apple wanted to do a great service to its various "niches", in my un-expert opinion, it would spin off the Mac and its system software and core apps into a separate company and let that company focus and innovate to meet the needs of its "niche" of Mac computer users at its own pace and peril. I'm not a investment guru, so I leave the financial merits of spin-offs for others. From an end-user endpoint, it seems to be the only way to get someone to pay closer attention to the very specific needs of computer users. Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:39 I think that would be courting the death of the Mac, honestly. As I argued in my other comment, the halo effect runs the other way - more people are buying Macs because they have used and liked Apple's consumer products. I think the main reason Macs have been bucking the overall decline in the computer industry is because they have Apple's strength in the consumer market to support them. If you cut the link there, you cut the main driving force for Mac market growth. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:19 Thanks for the kind words, Zac. However, I disagree with Apple spinning off the Mac. Tight integration with other Apple devices is still one of the Mac's strengths, and a spin-off would threaten that. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:20 I agree that the popularity of the iPhone and other Apple products helps drive Mac adoption. No argument there, and I think that's also still an important market for Apple. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:49 If Apple could value the Mac well enough to spin it off, they could value it enough to develop it internally. The problem is Apple doesn't seem to care one way or the other. Reply Derek Roff   2017-02-06 18:17 While Peter's suggestion that Apple get out of the hardware business strikes fear into my heart, I think it also misses Josh's key message. Why should a prudent investor like Peter assume that Apple can compete effectively in Services? This is an area where Apple has no particular expertise, and no intrinsic advantages. There are dozens of companies who understand Services better than Apple, and have both a deeper background and more agility. Airwalk survived as a fashion company, barely, and Apple might survive as an also-ran Services company, but as Josh indicates, this looks like the path to obscurity. Apple is a significant force in Services at the moment, because they are rich from hardware sales, and incredibly well known, from their integrated hardware, software, and lifestyle sales. Tossing all that out is, as Josh says, a losing strategy. Apple will not make its investors richer by proclaiming, "Think Conventionally". Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:30 Sigh. Another day, another 'Apple is doomed because they aren't catering to Important Users Like Me' article. The glaring flaw in this example is that it argues that people are drawn to Apple's consumer products because of the popularity of their computers among the elite - the halo effect. But if anything, the halo effect has run in the opposite direction, and has since the heyday of the iPod. People are buying Apple's consumer products, like the experience, and buying Macs to go with them. I've argued this before: Apple has, from the very first Apple ][, *always* catered to the ordinary user above the elite. When 'personal' computers were bulky S100 boxes that needed a separate dumb terminal and the arcane C/PM OS, Apple released a cute, streamlined all-in-one that hooked to a TV and booted into BASIC. When IBM introduced the designed-for-cubicles PC, Apple introduced the novice-user-friendly Mac. When smartphones were geeky tools, Apple released the iPhone. That's who they are. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-06 18:44 So you're saying that none of your less-technical family, friends, or clients buy Apple hardware because of your recommendations? In my experience, most people who know they don't have the technical chops to make an informed decision buy based on social influence. Reply David   2017-02-06 21:27 Are his family & friends a sufficient sample to generalize? Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-07 04:51 Actually, seriously, yes. I've been asked for advice on *which* Mac to buy, but everyone I know who bought Mac in the last year decided to go that route on their own. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:11 This is a discussion, not a research study. :-) Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:10 I obviously don't know the specifics, but unless you're well known for being platform agnostic, I doubt people would ask you for advice on other platforms. Your social influence to recommend Apple products is likely well known. Lots of people ask me for my opinions about what to buy, but they're always aware that I know Apple technology. But the article's point is that if you'd said, "Apple's hardware is stagnating and you'd be throwing money away if you didn't look at an Android phone or Windows PC" would those people ignore you and still buy Apple gear? In other words, if you as a tech influencer switched away from Apple gear, how many people would go with you eventually, purely because of your influence? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:22 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed. I can't count how many times I've written here something to the effect of "Apple is far from doomed." However, I do think shirking the professional market is an enormous mistake. Nor would I want Apple to drop or lose focus of its massively successful consumer line. The professional and consumer sides of Apple help build its strong ecosystem. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:50 2 people would go with me. Which would reduce Apple customers for the last quarter from 96 million people to 95,999,998. Even if there were 50,000 tech influencers who took 2 people with them, it would reduce Apple's customers from 96 million to 95,900,000 last quarter. (all numbers either approximate (customer numbers, people I influence) or made up (number of tech influencers)). Math done badly and on the fly. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:26 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed, either, though I'm more cynical on the subject that Josh is. For one thing, doomed is a vague and melodramatic term. If Apple fails to innovate and improve the Mac, then their base of support will be eroded over time because, as I said before, the Mac is the core of Apple's business. Without it Apple's other business interests would fail to flourish. And that's putting it mildly. In my opinion, without the Mac there is no Apple. But I don't see Apple killing the Mac. After all, it's still making money. What I see happening, as Josh points out in more polite terms, is that the Mac appears to be declining in importance for Apple. This doesn't spell doom, but it does spell stagnation. Meanwhile, Apple competitors continue to innovate. As an artist, the Surface Studio is the first Windows PC that has ever piqued my interest. If Apple continues to rest on it's laurels Microsoft is going to eat their lunch. Now that they are making good hardware, Microsoft is playing in the same ballpark with Apple. And, like macOS X 10.12.x, Windows 10 is a solid and accessible OS. And there are areas, like cloud services, where Microsoft far exceeds Apple's success. So do Google and Amazon. Services aren't going to save Apple's bacon. The Mac is the only thing that can do that, not because it makes the most money, but because it's central to the success of every other Apple venture. What I don't understand is why Tim Cook doesn't seem to know this. His desultory remarks about the future of the Mac are not encouraging. Another incremental update to the iMac or the Mac mini isn't going to get the job done. Nor are incremental improvements to the macOS. As I've said before, at the top of my wish list is a touch screen interface for the macOS. Without this it's very hard to see how Apple is going to keep up with the competition. Reply Christian Kaatmann   2017-02-06 19:21 The thing that Apple is certainly doing right now - seen from a user perspective - is that _all_ of their systems are much more reliable now than they used to be. I very rarely have to reboot, if one app crashes the rest of the system carries on unperturbed, I can go seamlessly from my Mac to my iPhone to iCloud on a windows machine without ever loosing a comma in the text I'm working on. It's like magic compared to not so many years ago. And Apple has got us all happily hooked on its services with iCloud at the centre. And I mean happily, thinking of the days back with Excel 1.04, swapping disks on my Mac SE or more recently trying to keep my iMac from crashing every time I switched from Mail to Word to Excel to ... Apple keeps a lot of customers happy and deeply dependent. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:31 That is a great point. Thank you! Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:23 Apple does enjoy tremendous lock-in, which certainly gives it staying power. iCloud is one of the weaker service bundles, but it's bolstered by the popularity of the hardware, which in turn benefits from iCloud lock-in. Not to mention dependence on iMessage. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:30 A quick addition if you don't mind. I am going to express my opinion, not fact. I don't think that Apple will abandon the larger Mac and phone and iPod markets (or TV or iPads.) I am looking at these devices as critically important. Not important as computing devices, but highly valuable as data devices. What is the difference? Computing takes place in a small fairly closed environment. Data is fed by and then feeds a larger system. (I think of the Mac Pro as being about computing, the iPad and Apple TV as being about data.) If I look at this as an investor, I see that data system as services with end point devices. The devices are either commodity products or are really sophisticated at handling data to and from the user. That data is the core of the future services. (Again, this is me as businessman, not as the guy who is really enjoying this MBP right now). Apple should, absolutely should, stay in the end point market and make exceptionally exciting devices like an iPhone so light that you need a lanyard to hold it in place. Those devices are data portals, and the real economic engine for what might be the most valuable company on the planet will be the data services. They actually might subsidize the hardware experiments that many of us love. For those hardware experiments, my credit card vibrates in anticipation. My business mind is looking for services in healthcare and automobiles. The hardware is what we know, the services that we do not yet know will be our future, just as the pocket computer once was. So much for me being quick. Josh, Adam, thank you! Reply Herb Bowie  2017-02-06 20:16 The analogy seems a bit contrived, and the conclusions a bit overblown. Part of what we have always loved and respected about Apple is its intent and ability to skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is. If we think about these issues from that perspective, we might make the following observations: 1. As device buses get increasingly powerful, and as the pace of technology change quickens, and as the desire for smaller computers increases, it will make sense for users to do "upgrades" by adding or swapping out peripherals, not through changes to the internals of their computers. 2. As SSD, memory, networks and microprocessors all get faster, the simple desire for ever bigger numbers -- faster chips, more RAM, etc. -- becomes less and less relevant for most users. 3. While Apple needs to provide core apps and services to make the average consumer happy, Apple's primary contribution to the larger app ecosystem is to make better tools for developers, not to make "Pro" level applications themselves. 4. As security becomes more and more of an issue, tight controls on the App store become increasingly important; however, third-party software suppliers still have the ability to deliver apps to their customers outside of the App store, so customers can have the best of both worlds. 5. As it becomes easier and easier to develop Mac applications, and as the Mac development tools grow stronger, and as the number of specialized apps continues to grow, it becomes ever harder to see why the Mac would need a special department for "Automation Technologies" for those few users who cannot find already developed solutions to their problems, yet who are also unable to develop new solutions themselves. So, yes, in all these cases, there are some short-term bumps in the road for many of us, and some more difficult issues for a few of us, but isn't this what we've always expected from Apple? Reply mike sanders  2017-02-06 21:53 Excellent response and a much more focussed overview, great respect to Josh but like so many "old" Apple users you still expect them to be a computer company which they no longer are. I have been a user since 1987 and an investor since the 2000s and have to say I am completely satisfied on both accounts. A very well run company which clearly knows where it is going just that it doesn't share it with us until the time is right. Have you seen the stock price today? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:25 Per your point on automation — I think Apple sees Swift as eventually overtaking AppleScript. That's fine with me, but Apple also needs to continue to create automation tools for professionals who aren't programmers. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:47 I agree. Unfortunately, Apple has a habit of dropping the ball on good ideas and technologies. For example, iWeb was overtaken by the competition because Apple lost interest in developing it. The same goes for Aperture. Now Apple Script and Automator are threatened with extinction, with no accessible replacement in sight. Apple Script and Automator enable the user to plug right into the OS and their applications. They are essentially programmable apps. Swift, on the other hand, is a programming language not an application. It's hard to imagine a third party developing a program with Swift that will have the broad capabilities of Apple's native apps. If history is any guide, apprehension is called for. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-02-07 00:35 You forgot bonehead moves like killing Apple Displays, AirPort, and now it looks like the iPad lines will be next. Possibly even the desktop Macs. Tim Cook needs to be canned. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:26 Indeed, I should have mentioned the loss of Apple displays and the apparent abandonment of AirPort routers. The latter is a thorn in my side at the moment, since my Express is on its last legs, and I'm distrustful of others on the market. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-08 01:06 Right you are. Both Apple Displays and Airport routers have been overtaken by the competition because Apple has apparently lost interest in supporting and improving them. This has the look of a tradition at Apple. Or a disability, like ADD. There was a time when third-party routers did not support the Mac with decent setup software. Airport routers solved that problem, though they tended to be less capable than the competition. They had the virtue of being simple. That time is past. Though various routers handle the matter differently, their setup software has improved. For instance, I can get into a Comcast router's built-in setup software with a simple URL, as I did with Linksys routers in the past. AT&T has always bumped me to a web site where I entered the appropriate information and the web site passed it to the router. This was particularly useful in the old days when routers and modem settings often got corrupted. If something went wrong, pop, there I was at the AT&T setup page. Nowadays routers are more reliable and such problems are rare—though not unheard of. Apple eventually improved the simple Airport Base Station by including a hard drive that interfaced easily with Time Machine—the Airport Time Capsule, an appropriate name at the time. And the Time Capsule has improved over the years with a space saving tower configuration and larger hard drives. Though you can still get the Airport Extreme which is a simple router without the hard drive. It's comparably priced with similar routers, except that you still need an external modem, which might be a disadvantage, unless you're used to setting up modems. That said, I don't know why Apple is apparently dropping their WiFi product line. They work perfectly well. Perhaps sales have declined as service providers now so often provide their own routers and independent modems are less common. Airport routers still require an external modem, which puts them behind the curve. I used to like a separate modem because they tended to fail more often that routers. But now I rent my router from Comcast and if it fails for any reason I just pop down to the Xfinity store and get a replacement. The same goes for AT&T. I haven't had occasion to set up an Airport router in years. Still, I don't think it's a good reason not to get a replacement Airport Express if your Airport Extreme orTime Capsule is still working OK. Current models have the fastest WiFi, 802.11ac, and they are still for sale on the Apple web site, as is the Airport Express. Replacing the Express seems to me to be simpler than regigering your entire system with a new router and a new repeater. But then if your router is also having issues, there are less expensive alternatives to the Airport, depending on your setup. Reply Jean-Pierre SMITH  2017-02-07 04:37 Great analogy and thinking, for the Mac platform. I liked the idea the combination of (1) techical brilliance, as seen by the recognised "experts" and (2) some hype (better call it "intelligent design") is a key factor of success for the Mac. Remove one of the two pillars and the structure collapses. To remember, I still have on my LC-475's screen saver (not used any more) the picture of a snail carrying on its back a rival PC's Intel CISC processor. These old macs used Motorola RISC processors, deemed faster by the "experts". You may have called to the bar Michelin, whose tyres for trucks (trucking fleets are the tyre equivalent to the Mac's "expert" users) are in demand for their durability (mileage), while car drivers don't measure mileage but simply benefit from it without knowing. Car tyres benefit directly from R&D invested in truck tyres just as the Mac for me [ordinary Joe] directly benefits from the Mac used, misused and challenged by its professional users (the "experts"). I am not so sure, though, the above analogy works for the iPhone, iPad and iWatch lines (is it still true that the iPhone for the Presidents is called "Blackberry"?). Thanks for the brain teaser. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-09 20:13 The PC 'enthusiast' market is the only one with growth. Sell the OS for $500 - restricted to 6 core+ (ie X99) motherboards, only from (a few) vetted vendors. No manufacturing costs. Pure profit once initial outlay of programming is covered.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Video: Apple Shares New Shot on iPhone 7 Ad Called ‘One Night’ By Uzair Ghani Feb 7, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has recently posted a brand new Shot on iPhone 7 ad called ‘One Night.’ The simplistic ad focuses on the smartphone’s low light camera performance. ‘One Night’ Focuses Strictly on iPhone 7’s Low Light Camera Performance The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus pack cameras which Apple isn’t shy to show off at all. In fact, ever since the device’s announcement, the company has been focusing a lot on the low light performance of its flagships. It even kicked off a brand new Shot on iPhone campaign focusing on the low light prowess of the handsets. Today, the company has released an ad, putting even more focus on what Apple has to offer. Check it out below. Advertisement The great low light performance of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus has been achieved by Apple after opting for a f/1.8 aperture lens. This allows the lens to let in more light onto the camera sensor, producing a much brighter image compared to previous iPhone devices. But of course, this doesn’t equate to just brighter images, this also means that the video you shoot in low light will look better too. It’s remarkable what Apple has managed to achieve in the camera department, and things will only get better as more and more iPhones are released every year. One Night is just one of the ads which Apple has released, and we are certain that more will come in due course. Besides, having sold more than 70 million iPhones in the previous quarter, Apple wouldn’t want to slow things down due to the lack of proper marketing. The camera on the iPhone has always been the company’s strongest selling point and focusing on newer features will only ensure that people remain hooked. Apple Reportedly Slowing Downloading Speeds on Its iPhone 7 Intentionally With the iPhone 8 due for release later this year, it will be interesting to see how Apple will improve its camera even further. There’s a possibility the company will take the dual camera lens system even further by improving Portrait mode even further. At the same time, there is a possibility the company might eventually allow setting the focus after the photo has been taken. There are a lot of possibilities to sift through, and we will leave the rest to your imagination.

(Net photo) More in Society WORD HAS IT... Indian Dining: Amazing Indian food Thesmart phone is the most sought after gadget. Blossoming romance is incomplete unless it is sealed with a gift of the latest smart phone. The smart phone has become a status symbol. In the words of Steve Jobs (RIP), co-founder and CEO of Apple: “It is not just a communication tool but a way of life.” But there is a flip side to the Smartphone craze.  It is ruining marriages and other inter-personal relations. So it’s still the same familiar story of ‘Man vs Machine.’ Hence, the smartphone has been described as “the electronic enemy of love.”  Today, these devices are playing the role of the ‘other man/woman’ in relationships. In other words, they are now responsible for snatching your spouse or partner away from you – maybe even your entire family! It’s pretty common walking into a restaurant and spotting a family out for dinner and, not a word exchanged all the while they are there because they are all engrossed with their phones. Even children as young as eight now have phones and very little time for just good old socialising, where you actually sit with someone and talk! A new national survey recently conducted in China blames ruined marriages and divided families squarely on the exponential rise in smartphone use in the country. The survey by the All China Women’s Federation (ACWF) found that 60 percent of married respondents complained about intrusion from the smartphone use in their relationship. Of course, this phenomenon is not unique to China alone, but with more than 500 million active smartphone users, it presents a good reference point. The havoc that the smartphone is visiting on marriages and relationships is only a continuation of the damage that ordinary cell phones and the internet had already orchestrated. Jerome Kajuga, the director of culture, social and human sciences UNESCO –Rwanda warns that phone addiction is a reality in marriage and relationships, especially for young couples and should be addressed. “I sometimes have problems with my wife when I spend too much time on my phone or TV screen and vice versa. Sometimes she’s busy working on a document when I want to talk to her but she doesn’t seem to have time for me and considering my age, my tolerance for this is lower than younger couples.” Kajuga describes the issue as a general problem in every family.  “For instance sometimes I have heard my daughter making or receiving a call from her room deep in the night. So I think for couples yes, it’s a huge challenge but also for the whole family, especially young people. I think that phones and social media should be regulated,” Kajuga says. The phones have children's apps that make learning more enjoyable. Observers say that by their very nature, smartphones were always bound to exacerbate an already worrying situation.  It has all these fancy apps you just have to make acquaintance with. But here’s the thing with smartphones, some people can’t go to bed without them; others check them the second daylight streams in through the curtain, and others even use them to keep an irritated baby calm! Jeanine Uwase, a married woman had to take matters into her own hands before her husband’s phone habits spiralled out of control. Uwase is convinced that her husband’s phone addiction was affecting not just their relationship and family life, but his overall life. The first thing she did was to talk her husband out of the habit of moving with a power bank, especially when going to church. The other measure she instituted was in the bedroom. “We decided that after a certain time, our phones would be switched off and if not, be left in the living room and the same applied for charging the phones. Even when I’m trying to sleep and the phone is charging in the bathroom or living room, I can still hear those beeps and message notifications and I can’t stand that.” She admits that she too is a culprit of phone addiction, though not at the same level as her partner; “It’s not easy to be in bed doing nothing when new tweets, new chats, new messages and status updates are jamming your phone!” James an employee with a telecom company says that apart from placing and receiving calls or texting, a smartphone holder has a whole lot more digital mobile devices at their disposal. There is a cache of Personal Digital Assistants on offer; events calendars, digital camera and digital video camera, media player, video games, and GPS navigation, he notes. Add to that other internet-enabled third-party software components like Soundcloud, Apple App Store and Google Play, and you have a device whose potential for social interruption has, in China at least, provoked the government’s concern and intervention. People are also listening to or watching audio music files, streaming YouTube videos, playing games, browsing the internet, using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, reading e-books and listening to podcasts, contributing in chat rooms, and watching films or television shows –all at the touch of a smartphone button.  What’s more, smartphones have entrenched the whole concept of the virtual office, with bosses now able to keep in touch with their employees round-the-clock. What this means is that employees increasingly have to work (or at least keep in touch with the employer) even outside of conventional working hours –checking and responding to mail, putting final touches to that report or presentation. According to the survey mentioned earlier, in January 2015, a woman in the city of Wuhan smashed her husband’s $500 smartphone because he had been so engrossed in social media after coming home from work that he had ignored their three-year-old daughter, local media reported. Burying his head in his smartphone, he barely exchanged ten words with his daughter on some days, she complained. Smartphones are used by very many people.  Status symbols At the launch of the first iPhone, a type of smartphone in 2007, Steve Jobs, co-founder and CEO of Apple computers made a profound, if not prophetic statement: “It is not just a communication tool but a way of life.” So what would one expect from something that has been described as a lifestyle –the words coming from the horse’s mouth itself? My own understanding of ‘lifestyle’ is that it’s those aspects of our lives that we take a little more personal than everything else, something of which we are regularly fond of or indulge in. As for the smartphone, it’s both a lifestyle and a status symbol –viewed by many as a statement of one’s social class and economic status. And status symbols have been around since the beginning of civilization. One of the earliest such objects to be viewed as a status symbol was gold, and to this day, some of the most iconic museums, buildings and other such places of heritage derive their appeal from their gold artefacts. There was a time when watches were status symbols, just like cars. But then, status symbols are usually defined by their exclusivity and limited availability, so with time, it was no longer enough to simply own a car –it had to be a sports car. Same with watches, as these now had to be Swiss-manufactured. The first phones, large enough to be compared to a brick or security guard’s baton in size were equally status symbols. Back then, it was all about whether you owned a phone or you did not. The mass proliferation of cheap phones inevitably pushed manufacturers like Apple into endless innovation, thereby raising the standards as to what kind of handset constituted a status symbol.  Today, the smartphone in all its variations has become the de facto status symbol of our time. So much so that a man out on a date with his wife or girlfriend is more likely to have their hands filled with smart gadgets as opposed to holding his partner’s hand or a wine glass or even better, pulling a seat for them. But do you want to know the implications of the smartphone as a status symbol? Well, the first is that it has been sought by people from all social classes and walks of life. While the genuinely rich want to show off their status, those that are not rich also aspire to be like the rich, or at least be viewed that way. So in poorer societies like ours, you can be sure that for every ten smartphone holders you encounter, perhaps a greater percentage acquired the gadget just to ‘look good’. Yes, smartphones give that semblance of equality, deceptive though it might be. What’s more, any half-butted attempt at borrowing or saving up will get you that iPhone 6, which is not the case with other loftier status toys like a mansion or that Toyota Rando Kuruza V8.   Are smartphones wrecking homes? Antoinette Niyongira If smartphones are not used properly, they can cause inconveniences. It may not make people cheat on each other, but it somehow ‘facilitates’ the vice. Misuse of smartphones can bring about disagreements, for instance, if you are having a conversation with your boyfriend and at the same time you are laughing at a joke on a WhatsApp group, he will feel disrespected and that can really destroy a relationship. Antoinette Niyongira, radio personality ****************************************************** Gilbert Kalawanga I wouldn’t call it a homewrecker, I think people just need to balance the time they spend on their phone and the time they put into their relationship. I don’t think smart phones spoil marriages or relationships. Gilbert Kalawanga, architect ****************************************************** Godfrey Neza We are in a busy and fast environment; a digital world where people are keen on what’s happening on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, the list is endless. This leaves you little to no time at all for your partner, and that’s how cheating and quarrels come up. Godfrey Neza, accountant ****************************************************** Felix Kayihura There are pros and cons considering the fact that smartphones also help with communication. And lovers can share anything but a phone, when going to take a bath, or sleep, they put passwords to avoid ‘trouble’. People are misusing smartphones and this is breaking up families. Felix Kayihura, lawyer ****************************************************** Aisha Kobusingye Smartphones are ruining relationships and this is mostly because people are failing to manage them. People are on social media all the time and they forget what their responsibilities are, so this is where marriages are failing. And there is the issue of WhatsApp where people share wayward stuff regardless of their marital status. Aisha Kobusingye, Businesswoman ****************************************************** Jules Tigana Actually, a smartphone is a tool that facilitates efficient communication and when used well for something productive such as business, it is a tool that can play a vital role to achieve different goals. But some couples use them for unproductive things like flirting and cheating, thus the fights. Jules Tigana, public servant ****************************************************** Thomas Muyombo I don’t think so; smartphones don’t use people, people use smartphones. Something can’t destroy you when it has no control over you. There are many things that can take your attention and destroy your relationship, like alcohol or even sports. Thomas Muyombo, musician ****************************************************** Anna Kaliza I believe that smartphones are affecting marriages today because people are too busy on their phones and are not giving each other attention. In the long run, couples don’t have intimacy, which is the most important thing in a marriage. Also, parents are busy on social media and do not pay attention to their kids, so they are not taught how to behave. They are likely to grow up picking up bad habits from other people.

Business Kohl's CTO: E-commerce may have hurt department stores, but tech also can help Ratnakar Lavu Kohl's CTO Ratnakar Lavu talks about how the department store is investing in technology to create more digitally-connected stores. Kohl's CTO Ratnakar Lavu talks about how the department store is investing in technology to create more digitally-connected stores. Lauren ZumbachContact ReporterChicago Tribune The rise of online shopping hasn't been kind to traditional department stores. It's Kohl's Chief Technology Officer Ratnakar Lavu's job to bring the retailer up to speed with how its customers shop today. Lavu worked in e-commerce at Macy's and was chief technology officer at Redbox Automated Retail before joining Kohl's in 2011. Today, he oversees an innovation team that's working on bringing the online and brick-and-mortar shopping experiences closer together, an initiative that involves employees at Kohl's Menomonee Falls, Wis., headquarters and at the company's digital center in Silicon Valley. At the National Retail Federation's trade show in New York, Lavu sat down with the Tribune to talk about how online shopping is changing customers' expectations, why you'll probably see Kohl's get into chatbots but not virtual reality (at least not yet), and how technology that's caused problems for retailers can also help solve them. Ratnakar Lavu Lauren Zumbach / Chicago Tribune Ratnakar Lavu, chief technology offider of Kohl's, seeks to bring the online and brick-and-mortar shopping experiences closer together. Ratnakar Lavu, chief technology offider of Kohl's, seeks to bring the online and brick-and-mortar shopping experiences closer together. (Lauren Zumbach / Chicago Tribune) The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: Bringing the department store to the 21st century sounds like a tall order. A: It is, but one great thing about Kohl's is we're determined to actually transform ourselves. We understand what we need to do, it's not like it's rocket science. We just need to continue to innovate and we have laid a great foundation to be able to do that. Q: So what do you need to do? A: We know that we have to elevate our experiences. With our digital businesses, we've done a lot of work over the last three to five years. We need to take that into the store. The other piece of this is we also need to transform how we do business. We need a lot more speed and agility in terms of what products to buy, how we buy them, how do we get them into the store and make them hyperlocal. And from a marketing standpoint, once we get the product there, how do we personalize the experience in terms of the message for the customer? That's what the customer is expecting. Suit Camp: Tribune executive Q&A sessionsRead more stories Q: Why do you think it's important to have part of the innovation team in Silicon Valley? A: We are very well connected as a company with the startup and innovation ecosystems that generally are driven from Silicon Valley. That enables us to see technology that we think is going to be game-changing or that we think companies like Apple and Google and others are pushing that will get customer adoption that we need to pay attention to. Q: Can you give me an example? A: When Apple did Apple Pay, they came to us and asked if we wanted to partner. We would never have had that conversation, if not for us being in the valley and being connected with Apple. Then we looked at the ecosystem and said, in addition to Apple Pay, can we bring our own payments to life? We worked with a small startup in the valley to bring Kohl's Pay to life. Those are things that would have been a little bit harder were we not in the valley. Q: What are some areas you're looking at in 2017? A: Our focus has shifted a little bit, in terms of how do we bring digital into the stores. Just like how we understand a website and mobile, how do we understand the physical store — how many people come in, what are they looking at, what is working or not working? Q: So if I were to walk into the Kohl's store of two to three years from now, what does that look like? A: We can tell you when you're doing research online that something is available in your local store, which should give you an incentive to go to the store to try it on. When you do make that trip, we want to make sure you're guaranteed it will be there and you have a great experience. The key is how do we make sure the customer doesn't feel like these are two separate channels. You should be able to take what's in the store and also say, "I want this (online) item you've recommended," and check out in a seamless way. Some gets shipped to your house, and some you take with you. It's a little bit harder work, but it can be done. Q: What's harder about it? A: Traditional (point of sale systems) have been very focused on just the in-store transactions. This year we're going to start rolling out a new POS system that will enable us to connect both store and online transactions. No one has done that well. Q: It has been a tough year for department stores, Kohl's included. How much do you think that's because of technology, and how much can be solved with technology? A: I think customers' expectations have changed because of the online experience. Findability is easier online. You search, you get an assortment, you get a product, you compare prices. The experience we offer is we have great products and we have it at great value. It's not a treasure hunt like a T.J. Maxx. When customers go to other retailers like that, they're already expecting a treasure hunt. Here, they're expecting us to have the right product at the right value and make it very easy for them to get. That is the transformation that we need to make, and I think we're well-positioned to do that. Q: How much of the innovation is focused on things you can do in next six months to a year and how much is more blue-sky? A: We don't have the wherewithal to do blue-sky innovation and spend tons of money like some other companies do. We look at innovation and say, is it right for our customer and what we want to do, and from a value standpoint does it create a high value quickly with low costs? Virtual reality is going to take off. Do we watch it? Yes, we do. But are we investing significantly? No. We think the adoption curve is going to be much longer and we want somebody else to figure it out and then we can leverage that. Chatbots (computer programs that use artificial intelligence to mimic conversation with a person) though, are things we're definitely looking at. One thing chatbots will do for us is we can automate a lot of the components that today we need people to answer, like "Where is my order?" There we see tremendous amount of value. We're actively working on it. Q: So you do think retail's problems are things technology can solve? A: The speed at which technology is evolving and what it can do today versus what it was able to do 10 years ago, there are a lot of solutions there where technology can help. With that said, can technology pick all the products for the customer? That's not going to happen. There's a lot of art and science in a lot of this, so what we want to do is augment art with science so we make better decisions. Q: Is it that technology can't do it yet, or ever? A: It can't do it yet. With the advent of (artificial intelligence) and how fast it's growing and what's coming, I think eventually, but not yet. lzumbach@chicagotribune.com Twitter @laurenzumbach Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune A Chicago lawyer's journey from mortgages to medical marijuana DuPage Medical Group CEO on growth: 'The sky's the limit' WeatherTech founder bets big on Super Bowl ads Sports Breaking Trending RedEye Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Advertising 38°

Via MacRumors, all three versions of the new iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) could potentially feature wireless charging abilities. In a note the site obtained from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Kuo said the iPhone is expected to include internal redesigns because wireless charging increases the temperature of the phone. It was not clear if the new iPhones will use long-range or inductive charging. “While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation,” Kuo said. “This is because FPCB is replaced with film, which is more sensitive to temperature change of the 3D touch sensor in OLED iPhone.

Apple is expected to release a 4.7-inch, 5-inch and 5.5 to 5.8-inch premium model of the iPhone 8. All three iPhones are expected to have an all-glass casing and the deluxe version of the phone is expected to include a wraparound display similar to Samsung’s high-end smartphones. The smartphone’s home button is also expected be converted from a physical button to a touch-sensitive inlay within the display. With the deluxe iPhone 8’s suite of redesigns and upgrades from past iPhones, analysts have speculated that the model could potentially retail for up to $1,000. And while Apple has yet to confirm its upgrade plans, past iPhones have traditionally hit shelves around September in the fall.

That’s the question being asked amid rumors of a super-premium price for the so-called iPhone 8 “Anniversary Edition”, expected to arrive later this year. Now believed to sit at the top of a three model pyramid, the flagship – also known by some as the “iPhone X”, in honor of the tenth anniversary of the smartphone – will spare no expense on the latest and greatest components and parts. In turn, you’ll have to spare no expense if you want to put one in your pocket. So far, the rumors have said that, as well as wireless charging – which is said to be coming to the regular next-gen iPhone too – the iPhone 8 “Anniversary Edition” will embrace glitzy materials, like a glass back panel and stainless steel edges. The display will switch, from LCD on the regular iPhone, to eye-pleasing OLED. That has advantages in power consumption and color saturation, but can also be thinner than LCD since it doesn’t require a separate backlight; Apple could, as a result fit in a bigger battery or make the whole thing slimmer. While $1,000 might sound like a lot, it’s doesn’t take much to get a current iPhone close to a four-figure price tag. If you want the maximum storage space – right now, 256 GB – in an iPhone 7 Plus, you’re looking at $969 unlocked. Even if you’re willing to sacrifice on screen size – and on the excellent twin camera the Plus alone has – the iPhone 7 will still set you back $849 in its max-storage configuration. Apple doesn’t break down iPhone sales by model, never mind which storage size is most popular. Nonetheless, clearly there’s a demand for the larger capacity models, especially as video recording quality hits 4K but Apple continues to hold out against memory card slots. Of course, $1,000 is likely to be only the starting price for the Anniversary Edition iPhone. It’s unclear at this stage whether there’ll be just one “flagship” configuration or, as per iPhone practice until now, Apple will have a variety of variants differentiated by storage. Would people pay $1,600+ for an “iPhone X” with 256 GB? The answer is probably yes. For a start, there’s the cachet. Just as we saw with the demand for the new Jet Black finish when Apple launched the iPhone 7, being able to flaunt what’s conspicuously the newest – and toughest to get hold of – hardware is important to many. Apple clearly understands this, given it limited the finish to only more expensive versions of the handset. Then there’s the appetite for “having what’s new” which can be an equally powerful motivator. Apple’s tick-tock upgrade cycle to “S” devices has been criticized by some as underwhelming every-other year, with evolutionary rather than revolutionary changes. The differences between the boundary-pushing “Anniversary Edition” iPhone and its potentially more pedestrian iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus counterparts could push a reasonable number of shoppers into opting for the cutting-edge device. Given what we’ve already heard about the “iPhone X” specifications, it’s hard to argue with that decision. The latest chatter is of a 5.8-inch screen, which would give it a bigger panel than on the iPhone 7 Plus. However, it could actually end up smaller in the hand, with talk that the home button is finally getting retired. Just as we’ve seen the physical home key evolve into the touch-sensitive pad on the latest iPhone, so the next phase of its evolution is said to be complete integration with the display itself. That would allow the lower bezel at least to be slimmed down, helping keep the new flagship iPhone trim. Touch-sensitivity for the buttons on the sides could also help there too, with space-consuming physical switches for volume, power, and silent mode tipped to be replaced with finger-sensing pads. It’s hard not to see this anniversary arriving at an opportune time for Apple. Things like switching to OLED from LCD, and doing away with physical buttons have been persistent rumors for some years now, but intent has always run up against practicality of scale. Switching every new iPhone over to OLED, or a cutting-edge touch panel with built-in home button functionality, may simply put too great a strain on the supply chain. Apple’s suppliers had enough trouble keeping up with iPhone 7 Plus demand last quarter, the company admitted; imagine how much more constrained it could get if relatively-niche components were required. Instead, price acts as a measuring gatekeeper. Apple gets to hoist its flagship iPhone X as the Next Big Thing in smartphones, early-adopters get to subsidize its premium parts, and the eye-watering price makes sure the company isn’t hammered by investors for failing to meet demand. The rest of us get a regular iPhone 7s or iPhone 7s Plus, and the priviedge of waiting for the bleeding-edge features to trickle down to more affordable fare.

More videos Apple appeals EU tax ruling Apple has launched a legal challenge to a record $US14 billion EU tax demand, arguing that EU regulators ignored tax experts and corporate law, and deliberately picked a method to maximise the penalty. Recall that in August Apple was ordered by repay €13 billion in taxes and interest after European Commission found the software giant's Irish tax structure was "illegal under EU state aid rules".  This week Margrethe Vestager, a Danish politician, who is currently serving as the European Commissioner for Competition and took on the Apple case last year, said that regardless of what Trump does ("whatever US tax reform they may pass is, of course, for them") the ruling stands. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link US President Donald Trump would give multinationals a special tax break if they brought profits to be taxed back to the US. Photo: Bloomberg "What is important for us is ... if any company or group of companies gets selective advantages by member states and thereby unlevelling (sic) the playing field." But what if other countries might want a share of the tax owed? Advertisement As Vestager noted a her statement after the decision last year: "It may be that not all the unpaid taxes are due in Ireland. Other countries, in the EU or elsewhere, can look at our investigation." She continues: "If they conclude that Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries instead of Ireland, they could require Apple to pay more tax locally. That would reduce the amount to be paid back to Ireland." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Competition, says the ruling against Apple stands. Photo: AP This leads to Trump's tax plan. He wants some of the $2.5 trillion profits that Fortune 500 companies hold offshore to be brought back to the US. To do this, Trump has proposed giving them a special one-off 10 per cent rate on their offshore earnings rather than taxing them at the full 35 per cent US corporate tax rate. A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a non-profit, non-partisan think tank that works on state and federal tax policy issues, suggests Apple could gain a $US48.1 billion ($62.9 billion) tax break because of Trump's proposal. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.  Photo: AP   "Under current rules, Apple should pay $67.3 billion in taxes when its $216 billion in earnings being held offshore are repatriated," the report says, noting the calculation is based on the estimated 3.8 per cent tax rate the company has paid to other governments on its offshore earnings. Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion. ITEP report Ordinarily Apple would be subject to a 31.2 per cent tax on these earnings upon repatriation. But under Trump's planned repatriation of 10 per cent, it would allow the company to pay just $19.2 billion, representing a $48.1 billion tax break compared to the $67.3 billion it would otherwise owe. No wonder Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year.  But it is not just Apple that stands to gain from the proposed tax holiday. The ITEP report examines the benefit to the 10 companies with the most money offshore – Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Citigroup, Amgen, Qualcomm, Gilead Sciences, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, and Bank of America. The report suggests  that Trump's plan would allow US companies to collectively pay an estimated $206 billion in taxes on their $2.5 trillion in offshore earnings, rather than the roughly $720 billion that they would owe if these earnings were subject to the statutory corporate tax rate. "In other words, Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion," it says. Rather than rewarding tax avoidance for a short-term revenue boost, the report calls on lawmakers to pursue legislation that would require companies to pay the full $720 billion they owe on their unrepatriated earnings. Meanwhile in Australia the Australian Taxation Office, equipped with tougher anti-avoidance laws, has been investigating a number of multinationals over their tax structures. Apple is among a number of technology companies currently under audit by ATO over its transfer pricing structures. According to its latest accounts filed with the corporate regulator ASIC, Apple's Australian revenue fell $296 million, or 3 per cent, to hit $7.5 billion in 2016. Its profit fell $119 million, or 97 per cent, to $3.6 million, which was largely due to an increase in the company's reported tax expense. Apple paid $128 million in income tax ($69.8 million related to FY2016) and there was an adjustment of $58.3 million relating to prior years.  The tech giant's local tax bill has fluctuated over the years, but is up from $85 million in 2015 and $80.3 million in 2014. 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Advertisement iPhone 8 rumors are starting to heat up as we push further away from the release of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. It’s still not clear if Apple will call the next iPhone the iPhone 7s or the iPhone 8 but rumors have outed several potential features for this year’s flagship. Among them, a brand new design that could look drastically different than the iPhone 7. The iPhone 8 hasn’t leaked but that hasn’t stopped artists from creating iPhone 8 concepts that bring iPhone 8 rumors to life. These iPhone 8 concepts aren’t from Apple itself but many of them are based on the leaks from the past few months. And because they are based on real credible leaks, they provide an early peek at what Apple’s next iPhone could look like. Advertisement While many iPhone 8 concepts are based in reality, other concepts imagine futuristic features that might not be on Apple’s radar and could be years away from landing on a real iPhone.

Apple has published a patent describing a flexible input-output display made of a mesh-shaped stretchy material with integrated sensors and haptic feedback. In addition to its own devices, the firm sees the technology being used for a range of applications, including smart clothing, smart windows, vehicles and furniture. Scroll down for video  Not only could this technology transform iPhones into iPads, but the firm sees it being used for a range of applications, including smart clothing, smart windows, vehicles and furniture HOW DOES IT WORK?  Apple could be building a flexible input-output display with integrated sensors and haptic feedback using a mesh-shaped stretchy material.  omponents like OLEDs, conductive trace materials and input mechanism would be arranged in a grid-like format. The firm would thin out or completely remove the underlying polymer substrate layer, which would leave a mesh-like structure covered with components. Apple believes that this arrangement is properly designed to handle deformations, like wrapping around a user's wrist without breaking in the process. The patent, titled 'Electronic Devices With Soft Input-Output Components' was filed in October 2016 and first spotted by Apple Insider. To enhance the flexibility, the patent describes arranging components like OLEDs, conductive trace materials and input mechanism in a grid-like format. And Apple has designed its own process that could bring the technology into the real world. The firm would thin out or completely remove the underlying polymer substrate layer, which would leave a mesh-like structure covered with components. Apple believes this specific arrangement is properly designed to handle deformations, like wrapping around a user's wrist without breaking in the process. Moreover, sensors such as 'touch sensors, force sensors, temperature sensors, accelerometers, and other sensors, and vibrators or other devices for providing haptic feedback' could be added to the design, which would eliminate the need for top bezels.

Share this article Share 14 shares Flexible devices are not a breakthrough, as Samsung revealed it was working on a phone that folds in two like a book. Dubbed 'Foldable Valley', the device is expected to take advantage of bendy plastic screens being developed by Samsung's display division.  The patent describes a system for building an input-output display with integrated sensors and haptic feedback using a mesh-shaped stretchy material The South Korean tech giant has previously said it will launch foldable devices in 2016 and trusted rumor blog SamMobile reported that anonymous sources claim the device is currently being tested in China in 2015. However, it is obvious that it was just hearsay - for now. The source, who claimed to have in-depth knowledge of the device, said it is being developed under the codename Project Valley.  And they added that two versions of the phone are being tested - one with a Snapdragon 620 processor and another with a Snapdragon 820. A new patent suggests Apple is working on a flexible display (pictured is an artist impression). It would be made with stretchable material, allow your iPhone to turn into an iPad Moreover, sensors such as 'touch sensors, force sensors, temperature sensors, accelerometers, and other sensors, and vibrators or other devices for providing haptic feedback' could be added to the design, which would eliminate the need for top bezels Elsewhere, the device is rumoured to have 3GB of RAM, a microSD card slot and a non-removable battery. Samsung told MailOnline it doesn't comment on rumour or speculation.   Samsung has been teasing bendable screens for years and at CES in 2013 revealed a flexible Oled screen called Youm. The firm said at the time it could make high-resolution screens on extremely thin plastic, instead of glass, so it could be bent without shattering. However, a notebook style phone would need to bend at a very sharp angle and would need to withstand considerable wear and tear, leading some commentators to suggest the rumour should be taken with a pinch of salt. Samsung was rumored to be working on a new handset that folds in two like a notebook. A screenshot from a conceptual video showing what the device may look like is pictured In 2014, LG showed off a working 18-inch Ultra HD screen (pictured) that uses a special film instead of plastic as backing to allow screen to be rolled into a tight tube for transport. At the time, it said it could make its debut in 2017 In 2014, LG showed off a working 18-inch Ultra HD screen that uses a special film instead of plastic as backing. This allowed the screen to be rolled into a tight tube for transport. At the time, the company said it could make its debut in 2017. In May 2016, it debuted a a concept ultra thin 'wallpaper TV' less than 1mm thick, and at four lbs (1.9kg) it is so light it can be attached to the wall using just magnets. At IFA, a demonstration showed an LG employee pulling the screen away from the wall and bending it, to prove it carries on working.

The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Stratoscale shows you how Nasuni CEO: ‘We’re going to liberate you from the bottleneck around your files’ IT teams put conversations to work with ChatOps Video Mingis on Tech: Hot tech skills 2017 Once upon a time, Silicon Valley’s top tech companies agreed not to poach employees from one another. In 2005, former Apple CEO Steve Jobs famously warned Google’s cofounder Sergey Brin, “If you hire a single one of these people, that means war.” Of course, that’s not the case now. (In fact, in 2015 Apple, Google, Adobe, Intel and others paid a $415 million settlement to engineers whose pay had been held down due to illegal anti-poaching arrangements.) In today’s job market, the best way to find talent is to take it from your competitors. Recruiting company Talentful recently published a new report exposing where tech’s top companies find their talent. Google, for example, hires most heavily from Microsoft and IBM. Facebook draws significant talent from Google, while Microsoft poaches from IBM and Amazon. Though there’s a lot of trading back and forth, some of the companies have taken more employees than they’ve had poached from them: 12,798 of Google’s employees came from other major tech companies. While Google has taken 4,151 of Microsoft’s staff, Microsoft has taken 896 in exchange. Amazon has swapped a few workers with eBay, giving up 152 employees and taking 218. Apple has poached more employees from Microsoft than anywhere else: 1,334 in total. They’re also keen on people from IBM and Intel. While IBM has taken more staff in total than Dell, they’re vulnerable to their rival's headhunting, having lost 2,302 of their employees to them, while taking 1,753. “There’s a huge amount of staff trading between companies,” a Talentful rep said. “And every time one company hires a staff member from another, they’re not just bringing in that person -- they’re bringing in their whole network. People like to work with familiar teams who know the way they work, and they end up bringing their colleagues with them.” But company politics, counteroffers and high emotions can complicate leaving an employer for a competitor. Stephany Samuels, senior VP of people strategy and IT recruiting company Mondo, offers some tips to help you make a graceful exit. Do resign in person. Although you may be ready to move on quickly, it’s courteous to have a conversation face-to-face instead of over the phone or via email, if possible, she says. Don’t bad-mouth the company you’re leaving. “While it might not have been the right place for you anymore, don’t paint a bad picture of the company. It can brew insecurity among your coworkers,” Samuels says. Do leave your manager ample time to replace you before you move on. “If they’ve treated you well, take that into account and give them the notice they’ll need to replace you -- or at least offset your workload while they find a replacement,” she says. Don’t burn bridges. “At the end of the day, it’s about your success and all of the hard work that brought you there,” Samuels says. “Offending employers or peers when leaving could come back to haunt you. We all know that networks are smaller than they feel.” Do participate in an exit interview with HR, Samuels says. “Companies appreciate candid and constructive feedback so they can improve and better engage and retain their current employees.” To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Cook said after meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday that he’s optimistic about the country’s prospects, noting that Apple is moving ahead with a new UK headquarters in London. Cook also met with London Mayor Sadiq Khan amid uncertainty about the impact that Britain’s decision to leave the 28-nation bloc will have on the U.K. economy. Cook says Apple is ”doubling down on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area and we’re leaving significant space there to expand.” He says ”we’re a big believer in the UK , we think you’ll be just fine … yes, there will be bumps in the road along the way, but the U.K.’s going to be fine.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov, who also discovered last November that Apple was storing iPhone call logs in iCloud, told Forbes that data stored in iCloud for syncing web browsing history and related data across iOS and macOS devices is actually retained in separate “tombstone” records even after browsing history entries have been “cleared” from Safari. Katalov indicated he came across the issue by accident when testing one of his company’s forensic tools to compare data extracted from an iPhone to the data from that iPhone’s linked iCloud account. According to Katalov, these records “stay in the cloud probably forever.” Forbes was also able to independently verify these claims using Safari 10.0.2 and Elcomsoft’s “Phone Breaker” tool, discovering nearly 7,000 “deleted” records going back for over a year. Records were accompanied by additional data such as the number of time a site had been visited as well as the date and time the item was deleted. Full terms of Google searches also appeared in the control panel of the Elcomsoft tool. An independent iOS forensics expert, who asked to remain anonymous, also validated these claims, discovering 125,203 records from their browsing history going back to the same date, even after the Safari caches had been cleared. Other deleted data retained by iCloud, such as Notes, appeared to only be retained for a much shorter period, generally less than 30 days. The report acknowledges that while it’s unclear why this data is being stored, the issue is likely a design issue having to do with the iCloud sync feature used to provide consistent Safari history data across all of a user’s iOS and macOS devices. It is normal for synchronization services to maintain deleted “tombstone” records to keep track of deleted data until those deletions have synchronized with all of the connected devices, however there doesn’t appear to be any obvious reason why data would need to be retained beyond this time frame. While Apple declined to officially comment on Elcomsoft’s findings, a source with knowledge of the matter told Forbes that Apple has been making it harder in recent Safari and iOS versions to track browsing history by turning URLs into hashes, although this step obviously wasn’t enough to prevent Elcomsoft’s tool from accessing this information in a clear form. The report also added an update that shortly after publication, Katalov and another source contacted Forbes and indicated that the old records were actually disappearing, suggesting that Apple has responded quickly to the revelation and is now removing the old data, although they have still not provided any official comment on the matter, and while the window of how much deleting browsing history is now being retained has been decreased, Elcomsoft indicates that two weeks’ worth of deleted data still appears to be retained.

Alongside incremental updates to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Fast Company‘s unnamed source says Apple will unveil a larger and more expensive device called the iPhone X. The company reportedly plans to sell the device at a higher price than the $1,309 unlocked 256GB iPhone 7 Plus on account of its edgeless OLED display. The display will reportedly cost Apple twice as much to manufacture as the LCD panels it uses in its current iPhone lineup. The source notes that Samsung is currently the only manufacturer that can meet Apple’s scale and quality requirements. There’s also the possibility the iPhone X may not feature any physical buttons at all; Apple is testing a prototype that not only ditches the home button, but that also includes touch-sensitive inlays along the side of the frame instead of physical buttons. The report also provides some insight into how Apple’s partnership with Lumentum may play out. The company’s 3D-sensing technology could find its way into the new iPhone, enabling features like better camera performance, improved facial recognition and some kind of augmented reality functionality.

I wonder what ignored user that is here already!? Twiddle Dee or Twiddle Dumb? Jealousy will get you nowhere. It’ll still outsell any crap Blackberry pushes. Rev0lver Who said anything about Blackberry except you? Sad. Also, look up the definition of ignore. Chug that haterade Of course he did because BlackBerry consumes his life …. and I assume he was talking about my comment… which wasn’t even an attack on Apple… basically just calling this article sorta stupid.. but he is “ignoring” us so he wouldn’t know… Chug that haterade And McDonald’s sells more burgers than Five Guys…. your point? Ps. Why do you keep saying “ignored user” because you aren’t ignoring us in the least bit… jay We will see a design change and maybe no more home button. If we even see wireless charging or at least fast charging. But apple manage to make it looks like they invented the phone again. Leif Shantz The all new $1800 iPhone 8…… To be priced at $1000-1200 on contract. Yup the sheep will buy anything with the Apple logo just because it gives themselves the impression of a upper class person! If I see an iPhone 8 in your hand. There’s a good chance that I’ll laugh at you….. Besides there are $800-1500 cheaper phones that can do a million things that a $1800 iPhone can’t do. eCLIPSE Stop wasting time writing articles for the sake of writing articles and getting web site add revenue. Jason It’s like buying a Ferrari, I get one of the fastest cars on the planet but I have to sacrifice fuel economy, back seats, can’t take it on normal streets because it’s low, and cup holders. Meanwhile I can get a Tesla for 1/3 the price, a car that’s just as fast, and has all the stuff you want from a big purchase. But Ferrari buyers will always buy a Ferrari. monkeymo fun fact only techies care about Teslas, for everyone else it just looks like another Hyundai on the street Jason And that’s why people buy Ferraris because they would rather buy a name than research other brands monkeymo Never got this argument, for who are you to decide that their purchase is lesser than your “rational” purchase. If you dont want a Tesla, (other comparative car) for argument sake, its not a rational purchase to make. You use cost as your deciding factor, but guess what when someone buys a Tesla ($150k or more on average here in Canada) money is not the determining factor anymore. Its the same with Android vs Iphones, they want it therefore its the rational purchase for that individual person. Jason That brings me to my follow up question, why do you (or people in general) want a iPhone? what features does it have that is the buying factor? monkeymo It just works for their needs, whats so hard to understand Jason Well things like that are hard to understand. With that statement what’s the difference between a $50 unlocked Walmart phone and a $1000+ iPhone, they both have data, touch screens, app stores, etc. So both will work with their needs but why spend that much? monkeymo Now you have a feature-set problem; I dont get why Android users always have to question why someone spent more for the “same Specs” I own pixel coulda bought a cheaper asian phone that does nearly the same, but i didnt want to, boom. And to be fair, iphones just work there is so much tinkering on androids to maintain their usability overtime that iphones just dont have to deal with. Jason “iphones just work” that’s feature I was wondering about. I can’t deny Android has a few more steps so if you want a phone right out of the box then yes go iPhone FTR_Part_deux All the bickering just to come to the conclusion that @monkeymo was trying to point out. Lol. Smh Rev0lver This may be the dumbest thing I’ve ever read on this site. Chug that haterade Are you including Shogun’s comments in that bucket? Rev0lver Fair enough. This is the stupidest, non-Shogun comment I’ve ever read on this site. Chug that haterade LMFAO… Rev0lver A Ferrari is much faster. The Tesla is quick but the Ferrari has a much higher top speed. A Ferrari is also a sports car that handles like a sports car. AppleBerrySandwich Sadly iPhone is no faster than a good Samsung or Pixel. J-Ro Apple does research and knows it can charge this much. They will not only sell more phones than ever before, they will also make more money due to the increase. Zee Did anyone actually expect Apple to lower the price? cantbanthisguy NO WAY!!! APPLE STUFF IS EXPENSIVE?!?!?!? TheCuddlyKoala Premium demands a price. AppleBerrySandwich There is premium and then there is Apple. I’m not an Apple hater at all – I have an iPad and my wife has an iPhone 6 but I have abandoned iPhone. Too expensive and restrictive. Company is going to premium themselves out of the market. Adderbox76 In other news; sometimes people wear hats. Garrett Cooper More expensive and larger? I was thinking the 10th anniversary would be when they’d launch a device that actually brings me back (since iPhone 4), but looking doubtful. Also, wonder how all touch sensitive buttons would work for case manufacturers? FTR_Part_deux Looking forward to its release. Smanny What kills me is the new AMOLED panel should only cost an additional $15, maybe $30 at most over top of their existing IPS panel. So now Apple can officially have the excuse to change an additional $120-$150 extra for the new iPhone 8. Thus making even more profit for its shareholders.

The Cupertino-based tech giant will be celebrating its 10-year anniversary with iPhone. Several rumours and speculations indicate that the upcoming smartphone will come equipped with premium features and a major design change. While no news regarding iPhone 8’s expected price has been revealed yet, a new report by Fast Company, which cited a source with knowledge of Apple’s plans suggests that the device could cost “north of $1000.” In the past, leaks regarding the smartphone have suggested that Apple plans on integrating an OLED display with the device. This particular feature is more expensive in comparison to other traditional LED displays. Other improvements in the smartphone include the storage feature, which may be pushed beyond 256GB. The report also describes the device as “something like a smooth black monolith, with few visual interruptions to its sleek design.” As far as the rumours regarding Apple’s plans to eliminate the home button is concerned, the report states that the Home button technology is still evolving as far as the company’s future plans are concerned. The source further claims that Apple is currently working with Lumentum to develop 3D sensing technology. There are high chances that the new technology will be used in the device. However, no further details were provided by the source.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Feb 9, 2017 at 2:59PM China has been the world's largest smartphone market for a few years now, underscoring how important the region is for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). But the Mac maker has hit a speed bump in the Middle Kingdom in recent quarters, largely thanks to intensifying competition from local, low-cost manufacturers. The company occasionally mentions growth rates for various geographical markets, but it doesn't disclose unit sales by region in detail. That leaves investors having to rely on third-party estimates, and the most recent ones don't look good. We're No. 5! We're No. 5! Market researcher Canalys released its estimates today for the Chinese smartphone market in 2016. Total unit volumes in China hit a fresh high of 476.5 million handsets, up 11%. Of that total, roughly 131.6 million units were shipped in the fourth quarter, a quarterly record that represents a third of the global market. The top four brands were all Chinese manufacturers; Apple came in at No. 5 amid declining unit volumes. Manufacturer 2016 Units Huawei 76.2 million Oppo 73.2 million Vivo 63.2 million Xiaomi 51.4 million Apple 43.8 million Data source: Canalys. Both Xiaomi and Apple saw double-digit declines from 2015 levels, with Xiaomi's units falling 21% and Apple's units down 18%. Oppo and Vivo exploded onto the scene in 2016; both companies sold fewer than 40 million units in 2015. Huawei strengthened its position in the tier-one and tier-two cities, according to Canalys analyst Jessie Ding. Oppo and Vivo are now looking to target those regions, while Huawei moves in on tier-three and tier-four cities. iPhone 7 with AirPods. Image source: Apple. While Apple has never aspired to be the largest vendor in any market by volumes, instead focusing on other things like customer satisfaction and profitability, that's still a discouraging directional trend at a time when Apple has been trying to reinvigorate investor confidence. The iPhone maker's decline in China is also significantly worse than its worldwide volumes; iPhone units fell 7% in 2016 to 215.4 million. If we look at it in absolute units, Canalys' numbers suggest that Apple sold 9.7 million less units in China in 2016, which is a large proportion of the 16.1 million unit decline in total iPhone units. China is becoming an increasingly tough market, and it's weighing on results. "A very, very difficult market" Last quarter, Greater China was the only geographical segment of Apple's five reportable segments that did not hit record levels. Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown. Apple's Greater China segment includes Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan. The weakness appears to be coming from Hong Kong and Taiwan, and revenue in mainland China was roughly flat with the record levels from a year ago. Here's CEO Tim Cook on the call: If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12% and about 4 points of that was currency related. So it's an 8-point decline in constant currency. And then within Greater China if you look at the [People's Republic of China], our revenue was flat year over year, and that was against the all-time record quarter. Cook also conceded that Hong Kong "remains a very, very difficult market." Evan Niu, CFA, owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Post your comment Comments (89) Ivan 09 February 2017 Apple iOS Rumors 2017 is a big year for Apple and its fans, as it marks the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone. Because of this, Apple fanboys and we tech media alike are excited to see what's coming. Some speculate that Apple will release a 4.7" iPhone 7s, a 5.5" iPhone 7s Plus and a 5.8" iPhone 8 (or, wait for it, iPhone X) with an OLED screen and specs straight out of some far-fetched wishlist. For starters rumor has it the iPhone X could have a button-free design with an edge-to-edge OLED screen with the home button somehow built in, no side buttons but instead touch-sensitive inlays and some 3D-sensing tech courtesy of Lumentum - perhaps face recognition or even augmented reality. And all of that brings us to the new bits of the puzzle we can add today. According to a source close to Apple's plans this new 10th anniversary iPhone could cost over $1000. For comparison's sake a maxed-out iPhone 7 Plus costs $969 in the US and a salty 1,119 in Europe. The source says the OLED panels are the main reason for the yet another price hike - their cost is double that of the current LCDs Apple uses.

If you think clearing your web browsing history on your iPhone or Mac is going to make your online habits permanently disappear, you’d be wrong. Very wrong. According to the CEO of Russian hacking tool creator Elcomsoft, Apple is storing Safari histories in the iCloud going back more than a year, possibly much longer, even where the user has asked for them to be wiped from memory. Elcomsoft chief Vladimir Katalov told FORBES the iPhone maker kept a separate iCloud record, titled “tombstone”, in which deleted web visits were stored, ostensibly for syncing across devices. Katalov told me he came across the issue “by accident” when he was looking through the Safari history on his own iPhone. When he took Elcomsoft’s Phone Breaker software to extract data from the linked iCloud account, he found “deleted” records going back a year. (Apple calls them “cleared” in Safari, not “deleted”). Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 132.12 -0.30 -0.23% “We have found that they stay in the cloud probably forever,” Katalov claimed. Your reporter tried clearing his Safari (version 10.0.2 on Mac OS X) history and then ran the Phone Breaker tool on his iCloud account. It returned nearly 7,000 “deleted” records going back to 27 November 2015. They were accompanied by a visit count as well as the date and time the history item was deleted. There were also Google searches, the full terms of which were visible in the Elcomsoft control panel. Fresh Safari activity that I hadn’t cleared was given the status ”actual”.© Elcomsoft’s Phone Breaker tool showing your reporter’s Google search history in Safari from 2016. Th... Elcomsoft iCloud search in Phone Breaker showing Safari web history FORBES also had an iOS forensics expert validate Katalov’s claims. The expert, who asked to remain anonymous, found the Elcomsoft Phone Breaker tool recovered 125,203 records from their browsing history going back to the same 2015 date, even though the Safari cache had been cleared. The expert also found Notes they’d supposedly deleted, but they only went back a short period, less than 30 days, indicating Apple was purging them regularly. It’s unclear just how or why Apple is storing cleared browsing history for such a long period. It would appear to be a design issue rather than anything suspicious, and is likely to do with the syncing mechanism between iOS, Mac OS X and Apple servers. Consumer cloud services like iCloud, by their nature, require records of delete requests to remain accessible for stretches of time, as users may have devices turned off that need to come alive again before they can sync and remove the browsing history. Apple’s oversight was not in keeping that feature running, according to the forensics expert, but in failing to properly hide the data from probing tools like Elcomsoft with encryption. Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said companies had to be very careful to follow best practice and delete users’ data when requested. “Overall, assuming this was a mistake, it’s a reminder that storing and retention of data is the default as a technical matter,” Stanley said. “Browsing history is a very sensitive set of data. It reveals people’s interests, concerns, worries and in many cases their every fleeting thought, as well as health information, information on their sexuality. “It’s vital that people are able to trust that they can be in control of that kind of information. It’s one reason we advise using search tools that don’t store your history.” There’s no evidence law enforcement has been able to access such data, if the feds even knew they could get it in the first place. And remote attacks by criminals would be difficult: Phone Breaker requires the hacker to have access to a target’s iCloud login credentials or an authentication token stored on the victim device. Katalov’s disclosure, ironically, will also lead to the imminent redundancy of the very Phone Breaker feature that came from his discovery, which only went live this morning. Not that he appears that bothered. “Money is not the main thing we work for,” said Katalov, in our email correspondence. “But we are still going good. There are enough features in our products that are quite useful for many customers, from consumers to law enforcement, that do not rely on vulnerabilities. And finally, quite a lot of research is in progress – we will always find something new.” Elcomsoft is best known not for aiding any law enforcement activity, but for a salacious episode in the history of Apple hacks: reports alleged it was used by snoops who stole celebrities’ nude pictures stored in the iCloud. The so-called “Fappening” attacks saw images belonging to the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton leaked online, and the perpetrators sentenced to prison. Apple in patch mode… and an easy fix Apple declined to comment on Elcomsoft’s findings. But a source with knowledge of the matter told me Apple has updated iOS and Safari to make it harder. Starting with Safari 9.1 and iOS 9.3, when users delete browsing history, the URLs are turned into hashes — that’s when plaintext is represented by a collection of digits and letters after being put through an algorithm. That goes some way to stopping any potential snoops looking at the data, though it hasn’t prevented Elcomsoft’s tool from grabbing the information from the latest versions of Safari. Expect Apple to continue plugging holes that Elcomsoft finds, though, as it has done with other recent public disclosures by Katalov. In cases such as this, the user won’t need to do a thing, as the fixes will be done on Apple’s servers. Nevertheless, as the Cupertino giant recommends, using the most recent software versions will keep customers’ safer from privacy invasions. In the meantime, it’s possible to turn Safari syncing off to avoid the problem altogether. Apple has a good guide about how to turn iCloud features on and off here. UPDATE Shortly after publication, FORBES was contacted by Katalov and another source, who claimed that their old records were disappearing. It appears, they said, that Apple is purging. There was no update from Apple, however. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

The phone is expected to be the first one in Apple’s lineup to ditch the home button, which has been present on every one of its devices since the first iPhone. But, according to a new report, the device might not only ditch the home button, it could also do away with all other physical buttons, including those for volume, power and the mute switch. The company is expected to replace the buttons with touch-sensitive ones placed inside the metal frame. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 132.12 -0.30 -0.23% In iPhone 8, the home button is likely to be a display-embedded one. Apple is expected to employ its pressure-sensing 3D Touch technology inside the button, so users would be navigating through the phone the way they did on previous iterations, but by applying pressure on the display and body rather than physically pressing a button. Fast Company reported Wednesday that the device will look like a single slab of glass since it would have no bezels or physical buttons. The report said the device will have a stainless steel frame in comparison to the iPhone 7’s aluminum one. It also stated citing sources that Apple has been working with smartphone components manufacturer Lumentum on employing iPhone 7’s 3D Touch technology throughout the upcoming device. Some such uses of the 3D Touch technology include user face recognition, camera imaging and augmented reality games. To support this technology, the device would need a bigger battery than the one already on the current iteration of the device.

In a teaser video posted online Wednesday, the Entertainment Software Association trade group said it would make 15,000 tickets available for members of the public to attend this year's trade show, scheduled for June in Los Angeles. The tickets, priced at $249, will go on sale at 9 a.m. Monday at the show's website. The first 1,000 will be sold for $149. The trade show is the highlight of the video-game industry's calendar, featuring announcements of new video-game titles and hardware. Attendance has traditionally been limited to the game industry and press, reflecting the show's roots as a forum for retail buyers to meet with game publishers to determine what to put on store shelves during the holiday season. But the show has skewed more toward media spectacle recently, with publishers and game-platform owners like Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation hosting giant events during the weeklong conference, which is held at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Some publishers have opted to leave the show floor entirely, avoiding the cost of a booth and E3's controls. Electronic Arts, the maker of the "Madden NFL" and "Battlefield" franchises, last year set up its own bit of rival Los Angeles programming outside the walls of E3, called "EA Play." Activision, maker of the world-beating "Call of Duty" games, also didn't have its own booth last year. E3 has experimented with tweaking the makeup of its show in recent years, adding a few thousand video-game internet streaming celebrities and other "influencers." The show last year also included a fan-focused event held near EA Play, though attendees to that event couldn't walk the show floor itself. This year's iteration of the trade show is scheduled for June 13-15. Major game publishers typically hold news conferences during the days before the show floor opens. © 2017 Seattle Times under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Toshiba Wants Out of Chip-Making Biz Next Article > Apple Reversed Its iPhone Slump. But What's Next? By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 01 2017 Apple has snapped out of the first sales slump in the iPhone's decade-long history, although the modest upturn doesn't mean that it has broken out of its innovation funk. If anything, the numbers Apple released Tuesday highlight the company's growing dependence on the iPhone, whose sales tower above Apple's other current offerings. The company hasn't managed to come up with another breakthrough product since its chief visionary, Steve Jobs, died in 2011. Meanwhile, Apple's rivals have been rolling out new products in other promising fields such as augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Apple currently trails in those areas, although many analysts believe the company may try to catch up with products featuring those trendy technologies later this year. No matter what's coming down the pike, the iPhone remains a huge moneymaker. Its success is the main reason Apple boasts a market value of $640 billion -- more than any other company. The iPhone is also driving the rapid growth of Apple's services division, which makes money from fixing devices, selling music streaming subscriptions and commissions on sales of mobile apps. Apple's services revenue surged 18 percent to $7.2 billion in the past quarter, putting it on pace generate enough annual revenue by itself to rank among the world's largest companies. iPhones on the Rise Again ... Barely But selling more iPhones has been getting tougher as more people hold on to older models for longer periods and competitors such as Samsung and Google entice customers with sleek devices running on Android software. The trend led to three consecutive quarters in which iPhone sales fell compared to the prior year, causing Apple's total revenue to sag as well. Apple bounced back in the quarter ending in December, buoyed by a positive response to the late September release of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. That device featured a better camera, which drew rave reviews, and no jack for headphones, which irked some consumers and befuddled others. Apple shipped 78.3 million iPhones in the latest quarter, a 5 percent increase compared to the previous year. It benefited from a year-end quarter consisting of 14 weeks, one more than the previous year period. If not for the calendar quirk, the iPhone sales slump might not have ended. Apple sold an average of 5.6 million iPhones per week in the latest quarter compare to 5.7 million iPhones per week in the previous year. The Cupertino, California, company also was helped by a recall of Samsung's Note 7 phones, which were plagued by battery fires. That problem drove some people switch to other models such as the iPhone. This Year's iPhone About 17 percent of all iPhones are now 7 models, according to Localytics, which tracks activity on mobile devices. Most of the rest are older iPhone 6 or iPhone 5 models. Apple could have sold more of the iPhone 7 Plus, which boasts a bigger screen and an extra camera, but the company misgauged demand and didn't make enough to meet customer demand, CEO Tim Cook said during a conference call. IPhone sales could slip yet again. Anticipation is building for the expected release of a 10th anniversary iPhone of some sort this summer or fall. Many smartphone owners could hold off until they get a good look at this year's iPhone, says Daniel Ives, a senior vice president for the mobile research firm Synchronoss Technologies. "It's like a drum roll while everyone waits for the curtains to roll back to unveil the next iPhone," Ives says. "There is a lot of pent-up demand out there, so this has the potential to be a game changer." Cook promises there are still many iPhone advances yet to come that will win even more fans. "The smartphone is still in the early innings of the game," he said. "I think there's lots more to do." Apple Phone Inc. The iPad, a tablet that became a smash hit after its 2010 debut, remains mired in a three-year sales slump, further magnifying the iPhone's importance to Apple. The company shipped 13.1 million iPads in the past quarter, a 19 percent drop from the previous year. "Remember when Apple called itself Apple Computer Inc.?" says BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis, harking back to the company's identity until 2007. "They may as well call themselves Apple Phone Inc. now." Propelled by the iPhone, Apple Inc.'s revenue edged up 3 percent to $78.4 billion in the quarter. But its profit dipped 3 percent to $17.9 billion. Still Waiting It was Apple's biggest quarterly revenue in its 40-year history, but it doesn't erase the question that has nagged Tim Cook since he succeeded Jobs as CEO nearly 5 1/2 years ago: What's next? Cook touts a smartwatch that Apple introduced as a huge success, but most analysts still view it as more of a novelty. In interviews, Cook has hinted Apple is exploring opportunities in augmented reality, which casts holograms and other digital images onto the real world around you. Apple also has been buying companies and hiring engineer specializing in artificial intelligence, a niche focused on teaching computers to think and talk more like humans. Gillis believes Apple already has wasted too much time trying to figure out its next big move. "When your iPhone juice runs down, you should already be ready to ramp up your next product," he says.

During the company’s recent earnings report, year over year sales plummeted by 19% while revenue fell by 22%. Nonetheless, Tim Cook has said that Apple remains committed to the iPad and that there’s plenty of room for innovation in the tablet space. Don't Miss: These 4 iPhone hacks might just blow your mind “We’ve got some exciting things coming on iPad,” Cook said last week, “and I’m optimistic about where things are headed.” Amid a flurry of rumors and speculation regarding Apple’s iPad roadmap, we now have a better idea of how Apple plans to shake up its tablet lineup this year. According to reports, Apple in 2017 plans to release three new iPad models: an affordable 9.7-inch model, a revamped 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and saving the best for last, a brand new 10.5-inch device. Both the 12.9-inch and 10.5 inch iPad models are said to feature a new A10X processor. More intriguing, though, are rumblings that the 10.5-inch model will feature an edgeless display with minimal bezels, perhaps giving us a taste of what Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 will look like. As for when Apple’s 2017 iPad lineup might hit store shelves, reports point to a release sometime next month. Lending even more credence to this launch timeframe, MacRumors notes that the current 12.9-inch iPad Pro is already in short supply at retail stores like Best Buy and Apple stores across the globe, a telltale sign that a drastic refresh is not too far off. “A spot check of Apple’s online store,” the report notes, “reveals that most if not all 12.9-inch iPad Pro models are now estimated to ship in 2-3 weeks in the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and elsewhere—that’s up from a shipping estimate of 1-2 weeks as recently as last weekend.” As a final point, there have also been reports that Apple’s 2017 iPads will feature a stationary home button similar to what Apple implemented on the iPhone 7.

Cook said after meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday that he's optimistic about the country's prospects, noting that Apple is moving ahead with a new UK headquarters in London. Cook also met with London Mayor Sadiq Khan amid uncertainty about the impact that Britain's decision to leave the 28-nation bloc will have on the U.K. economy. Cook says Apple is "doubling down on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area and we're leaving significant space there to expand."

Apple is planning on releasing a tenth anniversary iPhone 8 with an OLED display and it will likely cost upward of $1,000 USD. The 5.7-inch iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) will likely look quite different than its predecessors. It is believed that the iPhone 8 will be composed of stainless steel, instead of pricier aluminum. The back of the iPhone 8 may also be made of glass instead of metal (like its iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s predecessors). Apple has been working to remove the physical Home button and relocate it underneath the display surface. There is even a slight chance that Apple will remove the side buttons on the iPhone and replace them with touch-sensitive inlays in the metal. It is also possible that there will be a 4.7-inch model (iPhone 7s) and a 5.5-inch model ( iPhone 7s Plus). The biggest rumor is that the iPhone 8 will feature an OLED display. Apple has been gobbling up as much capacity from available OLED manufacturers as possible in preperation. Samsung and a handful of other Asian upstarts are currently the only manufacturers who produce OLED displays. The iPhone 8 would receive the OLED display, however,  the smaller-screened phones would be stuck with LCD displays. Apple has also allegedly been working with Lumentum on 3D sensing technology, but it is currently unclear how this technology would be applied. Some believe that the technology would be used for facial recognition, while others surmise that it would be use to improve the effective resolution of the the dual lens camera. Intel’s 7480 LTE modems might be incorporated into some of the iPhones, while others may include modems from Qualcomm. Also expect to see a larger battery compared to current generation iPhones. Production for the iPhone 8 will likely begin this spring, while the announcement will come in the autumn.

An iPhone 8 concept with an edge-to-edge display. Image: screenshot: ConceptsiPhone/youtube By Freia Lobo2017-02-09 20:05:22 UTC First, Apple came for our headphones. Now the tech giant may be cutting yet another cord from our lives. KGI Securities, a reliable source for iPhone leaks in the past, reported Thursday that three new iPhones rumored for this fall will feature wireless charging. SEE ALSO: There will be three new iPhones in 2017, report claims Apple is said to be working on over-the-air charging, which would allow a device to charge without needing to be directly connected to anything.  According to a note obtained by MacRumors, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said wireless charging would increase the internal temperature of the phones. As a result, the forthcoming iPhone, dubbed the iPhone X by many, will have a new hardware component to protect the unit from overheating.  In the note, Kuo says that general users are not expected to notice any heat differences. The new hardware component will help control internal temperature, but will not affect user experience. This component could increase the cost of production by up to $5 per phone. While this alone is unlikely to add to a significant price increase, a new report says the next iPhone could cost more than $1000 due to the hardware upgrades. All of these rumors point to a wireless future for the iPhone. After AirPods released this past fall, we can only hope that come September, we'll see another wireless surprise from Apple.

In his hands-on video, Morrison discovers that Apple is bundling a promo code for three months of Apple Music with BeatsX purchases. BeatsX were first announced back in September alongside the iPhone 7 and promised to launch in the fall, but their release was pushed back to February 10 following the unexpected delay of Apple’s wireless AirPods. When BeatsX hit stores tomorrow, customers will have four color options including black, white, gray, and blue and will likely find a promo code good for three months of Apple Music in the packaging. Apple similarly promoted Apple Music to Beats headphone customers just over a year ago as part of a holiday promotion with a $60 credit for Apple Music or iTunes. Apple Music subscriptions are available for $9.99/month for individuals and $14.99/month for families. Students can subscribe to Apple Music for $4.99/month. The BeatsX Apple Music promotion specifies that it only applies to individual accounts. In addition to the Apple Music promo discovery, Morrison’s video shows BeatsX ear tips in multiple sizes and optional wing tips that make BeatsX more customizable than AirPods as far as fit goes. BeatsX offer 8 hours of battery life and feature a flexible neckband between each earphone for $149 compared to totally wireless AirPods with 5 hours of battery life without the charging case at $159. Both feature Apple’s W1 chip for instant pairing and fast switching between iCloud devices.

Speaking in Glasgow yesterday, current Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that the philosophy of Jobs, who died of pancreatic cancer back in 2011, will forever run through the company. Addressing students at the University of Glasgow where he was awarded an honorary degree, Cook described Jobs as the person who had “by far” had the most influence on his life before detailing the prolonged effect he has had on the brand. "Steve's DNA will always be the core of Apple. Steve is deeply embedded in the company. We celebrate him and we celebrate his philosophy,” Cook said. “His philosophy... will be at Apple 100 years from now... The philosophy is sort of passed down with every generation... so yes, he's very much at Apple.” Related: iPhone 8: Everything you need to know Since Cook took over the reigns at Apple shortly before Jobs’ death, the company has launched a number of products many skeptics claim went against Jobs’ view, including the more affordable iPhone 5C and, most recently, the Apple Pencil. Jobs had a known distaste for styluses and, back when the original iPhone launched in 2007, famously stated: “Yuck. Nobody wants a stylus, so let's not use a stylus.” The topic of Jobs arose when Cook was question on how the former Apple head would have viewed the Apple Pencil and, according to Cook, the Pencil wouldn’t go against Jobs’ stylus-based thoughts. "The truth is Steve did hate styluses. But if you have ever used the Apple Pencil, the Apple Pencil is the furthest thing from a stylus that has ever existed," Cook is quoted by CNBC as saying. Related: Apple Pencil: How does it compare with the competition? "Designers historically, and many still do, carry sketchbooks... because they don't know when they're going to have inspiration. And when they have it, you want your tool there. “With Apple Pencil, you have the best of all worlds. Because unlike a sketch that you have to do many times to try out many different looks, whether it's colours or specific lines, etc, with the Apple Pencil, you can quickly try out any number of designs.” Cook is currently on a mini tour of Europe and today met with British Prime Minister Theresa May to discuss Brexit.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Feb 9, 2017 at 2:59PM China has been the world's largest smartphone market for a few years now, underscoring how important the region is for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). But the Mac maker has hit a speed bump in the Middle Kingdom in recent quarters, largely thanks to intensifying competition from local, low-cost manufacturers. The company occasionally mentions growth rates for various geographical markets, but it doesn't disclose unit sales by region in detail. That leaves investors having to rely on third-party estimates, and the most recent ones don't look good. We're No. 5! We're No. 5! Market researcher Canalys released its estimates today for the Chinese smartphone market in 2016. Total unit volumes in China hit a fresh high of 476.5 million handsets, up 11%. Of that total, roughly 131.6 million units were shipped in the fourth quarter, a quarterly record that represents a third of the global market. The top four brands were all Chinese manufacturers; Apple came in at No. 5 amid declining unit volumes. Manufacturer 2016 Units Huawei 76.2 million Oppo 73.2 million Vivo 63.2 million Xiaomi 51.4 million Apple 43.8 million Data source: Canalys. Both Xiaomi and Apple saw double-digit declines from 2015 levels, with Xiaomi's units falling 21% and Apple's units down 18%. Oppo and Vivo exploded onto the scene in 2016; both companies sold fewer than 40 million units in 2015. Huawei strengthened its position in the tier-one and tier-two cities, according to Canalys analyst Jessie Ding. Oppo and Vivo are now looking to target those regions, while Huawei moves in on tier-three and tier-four cities. iPhone 7 with AirPods. Image source: Apple. While Apple has never aspired to be the largest vendor in any market by volumes, instead focusing on other things like customer satisfaction and profitability, that's still a discouraging directional trend at a time when Apple has been trying to reinvigorate investor confidence. The iPhone maker's decline in China is also significantly worse than its worldwide volumes; iPhone units fell 7% in 2016 to 215.4 million. If we look at it in absolute units, Canalys' numbers suggest that Apple sold 9.7 million less units in China in 2016, which is a large proportion of the 16.1 million unit decline in total iPhone units. China is becoming an increasingly tough market, and it's weighing on results. "A very, very difficult market" Last quarter, Greater China was the only geographical segment of Apple's five reportable segments that did not hit record levels. Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown. Apple's Greater China segment includes Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan. The weakness appears to be coming from Hong Kong and Taiwan, and revenue in mainland China was roughly flat with the record levels from a year ago. Here's CEO Tim Cook on the call: If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12% and about 4 points of that was currency related. So it's an 8-point decline in constant currency. And then within Greater China if you look at the [People's Republic of China], our revenue was flat year over year, and that was against the all-time record quarter. Cook also conceded that Hong Kong "remains a very, very difficult market." Evan Niu, CFA, owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Hahaha, ha... seriously though, that Word doc could be malware Files spotted using Python code to infect Apple machines 9 Feb 2017 at 19:34, John Leyden Hackers are menacing Apple Mac users with Word documents laced with malicious macros that install malware. Security researchers spotted a rash of poisonous files doing the rounds earlier this week, one of which was titled "U.S. Allies and Rivals Digest Trump's Victory – Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.docm." Apple fans who opened the document on a Mac are prompted to enable macros. If enabled, the file executes a function, coded in Python, that downloads a malware payload to infect the machine. The Python code is taken from the open-source EmPyre project, a pure Python post-exploitation agent. The tactic is used to push persistent malware onto compromised Macs. The IP address from which the documents were spread is geo-located in Russia and has previously been associated with malicious activities such as phishing, according to a write-up by security researcher Patrick Wardle. "Overall this malware sample isn't particularly advanced. It relies on user interaction (to open a malicious document in Microsoft Word (not Apple's Pages)), as well as needs macros to be enabled," Wardle concludes, adding that the reliance on macros rather than a software vulnerability means that the exploit can't be blocked by patching systems. Separately, security researchers have spotted macOS malware targeting the defense industry, and reported elsewhere to have been used against a human rights advocate. The MacDownloader nasty attempts to pose as both an installer for Adobe Flash and the Bitdefender Adware Removal Tool. Researchers reckon the malware is a work in progress – still lacking the ability to survive a reboot on infected systems (ie, persistence) – and is ultimately geared towards extracting data from compromised systems. The Iranian hackers suspected in the Mac raid have previously developed Windows and Android keystroke-logging and data exfiltrating spyware. ® Tips and corrections 43 Comments More from The Register Apple fans using Chrome on alert for Mac malware Google AdWords has been spewing software nasties 30 Comments WikiLeaks uploads 300+ pieces of malware among email dumps Freedom.

Eve Motion can be used as a sensor in iOS 10’s Home app to trigger scenes and control accessories. When added to Apple’s Home app, Eve Motion ($49) appears just like other HomeKit motion sensors. You can see when sensors are armed and ready, when sensors are activated by motion, and check values like battery level and charging status. You can optionally enable notifications for motion sensors including Eve Motion so the Home app sends you an alert each time motion is detected, but for me the value is mainly in using Eve Motion as a trigger for automation. For example, you can use Eve Motion to automatically turn on a HomeKit lamp when motion is detected after sunset with a few steps. From the Automation tab of the Home app, select Create New Automation then tap A Sensor Detects Something. From here you can select Eve Motion as the automation sensor, then select which scene or device you want to react when motion is detected. After you make your selection, you can toggle on the option to trigger the automation only after sunset and set the state of what you want controlled (like lamp on at 100% brightness) then tap Done to save the automation. Eve Motion works reliably as a motion sensor, but you may want to increase the sensitivity. In testing, I found that I could enter my office in the dark for several seconds without triggering Eve Motion (Elgato promises 2 second response time) and automatically turning on the desk lamp when using the default sensitivity level. After some poking around in Eve’s companion app, I turned up the sensitivity level from low to high (and there’s a medium level too) which noticeably helped. Eve Motion relies on Bluetooth Low Energy for connectivity and runs on two AA batteries so increasing the motion sensitivity likely negatively impacts battery life. The biggest issue for me with motion sensors and automation in Apple’s Home app is what appears to be a missing feature in my experience. It’s easy to turn a light on when motion is detected, but Apple’s Home app doesn’t appear to support automatically turning a light off when motion is no longer detected. (If this is supported in Apple’s Home app, I’m not aware of it and haven’t discovered it.) Ideally, I’d like to be able to turn off the desk lamp if no motion has been detected for, say, 30 minutes. This may be possible when configuring automation through Eve’s companion app, but my interest is primarily in configuring Apple’s Home app and not managing a folder of accessory apps. Physically, Eve Motion is the same size as other Elgato smart sensors (80 x 80 x 32 mm) like Room and Weather, but larger than Ecobee’s remote sensors with motion detection and HomeKit support. Eve Motion can be placed on a flat surface and stand on its own without using a stand, or Eve Motion can be mounted on a wall. Elgato promises a 120º field of view and 9 meters or 30 feet range when mounted 2 meters or 6.5 feet above floor level. In practice, Eve Motion works on par with Ecobee’s remote sensors which were recently updated to support HomeKit as motion (and temperature) sensors. The main difference is that you need an Ecobee 3 thermostat ($249)to use Ecobee remote sensors (2 for $79). If you plan to use the motion sensor at an entryway, Eve Motion is definitely the better solution even if you have an Ecobee 3 thermostat. Eve Motion is a standalone motion sensor whereas Ecobee’s remote sensors also capture temperature data that affects thermostat settings so outdoor use is out of the question. Ecobee’s remote sensors are smaller and run on a CR2032 that lasts for 18 to 24 months (although one of my sensors lasted for 14 months). I haven’t tested Eve Motion for long enough to gauge battery life, but my other Elgato sensors powered by AA batteries generally last 2 to 3 months before needing new batteries so that’s something to consider as well. [Update: Elgato actually documents battery life by product here; Eve Motion is rated for over 1 year whereas Room is rated for the 3 months that I’ve observed. Updating batteries annually is reasonable and good to learn.] At this point, Eve Motion and motion sensors in general are more experimental than essential in my HomeKit setup. Lights, locks, and a thermostat are key accessories, but Apple’s Home app needs to learn a few more tricks before motion sensors are as useful as they could be for me personally. Still, if you’re interested in HomeKit and want to see what motion sensors can do for your setup, Elgato Eve Motion ($49) is the standalone motion sensor to purchase.

But the data is outdated and we’ve learned from sources that the problem has been fixed for the majority of users for almost a year and for the rest quickly after the issue was discovered. The data that Apple does store is kept for good reason… Apple fixed the issue with plain text URLs being accessible since iOS 9.3, so for the majority of users the problem hasn’t been an issue for almost a year. And Apple has since fixed the issue server side for the rest of users, according to sources familiar with the situation. Keeping some of the data around for a certain period of time helps devices that may be out of sync to properly receive changes once coming back online, according to these people. So if you have a device that is offline for an extended period of time, when it powers back up, it will be able to reliably sync iCloud to your current Safari setup and recent changes. As noted in the message on iOS (pictured above) when you clear history for Safari, “history will be cleared from your other devices signed into iCloud.” It’s also important to note that Safari provides the option to “Clear history” opposed to “deleting”, which could have led to some confusion among Elcomsoft and users regarding how the feature functions behind the scenes. One of the major advantages that comes with using iCloud in the Apple ecosystem is the ability to have your data go with you wherever you go. It can sync data between devices to create a seamless experience. An obvious example is the ability to start browsing a website on your iPhone, and then continue it on your iPad or Mac. And even for your cleared history, iCloud needs to sometimes store data to make sure everything is in sync across devices reliably. So to recap, since iOS 9.3 almost a year ago (which the majority of users quickly updated to), Safari has kept the cleared records but stores them so URLs can’t be extracted as plain text. This makes the data cryptic thus not allowing anyone to decipher what exactly the browsing data is. For the small percentage of other users, Apple has recently fixed the issue entirely on iCloud’s servers so URLs are never accessible as plain text after cleared from history.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is news of a release date for the Beats X earbuds. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday. Beats X Earbuds: Apple will officially start selling Beats X earbuds this Friday, Feb. 10, reports BGR. The launch of the wireless earbuds comes after months of delays. They were originally announced alongside the iPhone 7. However, problems with the tech resulted in a delay for the earbuds, as well as the AirPods. Color options for the Beats X earbuds are black, blue, grey and white. They will cost $149.95. Apple TV: AAPL is getting more serious about its TV business with a new vice president for Apple TV product marketing, MacRumors notes. This new hire is Timothy Twerdahl. Twerdahl is the former general manager and director of Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV business. The company reportedly hopes that this will allow Pete Distad, its former head of TV product marketing, to help with content negotiations. Content providers have allegedly been reluctant to sign deals with AAPL to include their content in streaming packages. Optical Drive Lawsuit: A settlement in a class action lawsuit can get Mac owners $10, reports AppleInsider. The lawsuit states that four optical drive makers kept prices of the components artificially high from  April 1, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2008. Customers that bought an optical drive from one of the four companies, or a computer containing one of these drives, can get $10 back per purchase. The computers or optical drives must have been bought between the above-mentioned dates. The four optical drive makers in the lawsuit are Panasonic Corporation (ADR) (OTCMKTS:PCRFY), NEC, Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE), and Hitachi-LG. This offer is only available in certain states.

The Rise of China's Smartphone Makers Video How NOT to lose your Apple AirPods Perhaps the next iPhone 8 will be Apple's next shot at achieving greatness in China. The current iPhones aren't helping Apple gain market share in China, according to Canalys. Markets like China and India are at the top of Apple's agenda to grow the iPhone business. China accounts for a third of worldwide smartphone shipments. Buyers in the market are leaning toward local brands like Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi, which formed the top four smartphone vendors in China in 2016, according to Canalys. [ Review: 8 password managers for Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android ] Apple was in the fifth spot, and Samsung doesn't figure in the top five. In 2016, Apple's phone shipments in China totaled 43.8 million units, a drop of 18.2 percent compared to 2015. It's not looking any better for Apple in 2017. "This year, the outlook remains bleak for Apple to get its China performance back to its heyday of 2015," said Jessie Ding, a research analyst at Canalys. The decline in China hit Apple's worldwide shipments hard, with a net effect of about a 7 percent decline in the number of iPhones shipped globally, Ding said. But the Chinese buyers are "awaiting the 10th anniversary of the iPhone with very high expectations," Ding said. The iPhone 8 may succeed, but it may not change a long-term trend of Chinese smartphone buyers buying local brands. In many smaller Chinese cities, Huawei, Vivo, and Oppo smartphones are selling well. Those companies are also investing heavily in branding in top-tier cities, posing a further threat to Apple, Ding said. Apple faces a similar problem in India. The iPhone brand awareness is limited to urban areas, and the handsets are priced too high for most of the population. Apple recently made a move to start assembling smartphones in India. Many Chinese companies are launching new handsets this year with a focus on cameras and screens. One such smartphone is Huawei's Mate 9 Pro, which was shown at CES. Huawei -- known for networking gear -- also makes its own chips, like Apple and Samsung. Other Chinese brands like LeEco are also emerging and growing internationally. LeEco has particularly interesting smartphone designs. The company came out with a smartphone without a headphone jack ahead of Apple. It's a tight race among the top three Chinese smartphone makers. Huawei in 2016 shipped 76.2 million units, Oppo shipped 73.2 million units, and Vivo about 63.2 million units. Xiaomi's market share tumbled, declining by 21 percent to 51.4 million units. A survey released by IDC this week also noted a down market for iPhone in China, but placed the company in the fourth spot, ahead of Xiaomi. According to IDC, total smartphone shipments in China were 467 million units in 2016, growing by 8.7 percent. But Apple's shipments declined by 23.2 percent that year, totaling 44.9 million units. The top three Chinese smartphone makers were Oppo, Huawei, and Vivo, according to IDC. To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter.

The patent filing, “Electronic Devices With Soft Input-Output Components,” suggests the flexible display could be used on smartphones, computers or other input-output electronic devices.

It seems the company has been working on how to make smartphones different from the iPhones it has released over the past 10 years. In 2014, Apple filed another patent for a foldable device. The patent for “flexible display devices” reveals a touchscreen phone with a flexible, metal-backed OLED display that can be folded in half and grip to the user’s clothes. Screens would bend either towards each other or back-to-back and additional hinges would allow the device to be folded in different ways, even in thirds.

Speaking to Forbes, Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov explained that the company had been able to retrieve "deleted" browser history dating back more than a year. Deleted browser history pulled from iCloud by Elcomsoft Apple was keeping deleted browser information in a separate iCloud record called "tombstone," and in a press release announcing updated Phone Breaker software for extracting the stored browsing info, Elcomsoft explains that the data was likely kept as part of an iCloud feature that syncs browsing history across multiple devices and ensures it's deleted from all devices when history is cleared. The point is that Apple keeps synced Safari browsing history in the cloud for much longer than one, three or four months - even for deleted entries. ElcomSoft researchers were able to access records that've been deleted more than a year ago, which means that deleted records are not actually cleaned up from iCloud.Forbes tried using the Phone Breaker software created by Elcomsoft and was able to retrieve nearly 7,000 records dating back to November of 2015. Site names, URLs, Google searches, visit counts, and the date and time items were deleted were included. It's not clear why Apple was storing the information for so long, but it appears to have been an oversight related to ensuring information is deleted on all devices once cleared rather than intentional. Shortly after Forbes and Elcomsoft published their iCloud findings, Elcomsoft noticed previously available records being deleted as part of a server-side fix quietly implemented by Apple. All deleted browser records older than two weeks have been eliminated. From Elcomsoft's blog: Update: we have informed media about this issue in advance, and they reached Apple for comments. As far as we know, Apple has not responded, but started purging older history records. For what we know, they could be just moving them to other servers, making deleted records inaccessible from the outside; but we never know for sure. Either way, as of right now, for most iCloud accounts we can see history records for the last two weeks only (deleted records for those two weeks are still there though). Good move, Apple. Still, we would like to get an explanation.Even before Apple made the server-side fix to make sure deleted browsing history is permanently removed in a timely manner, it was difficult to get ahold of the information. Forensic software like Phone Breaker was required, which doesn't come cheap, and Phone Breaker only works with a user's Apple ID and password, or an authentication token pulled from a user's computer. In iOS 9.3 and later (and Safari 9.1 and later), Apple also began turning URLs into unreadable hashes instead of plaintext when browser history is deleted, an additional security measure, but Forbes says that didn't stop Elcomsoft's tool from working with the newest versions of Safari. While Apple now appears to be deleting browsing data at the two week mark (or has made it invisible to tools like Phone Breaker), iCloud users should be aware that their browsing history, including cleared browser history, is stored in iCloud for at least that two week period. Users who are not comfortable with that can easily disable syncing features through the iCloud section of the Settings app. Apple has not commented on Elcomsoft's finding or the apparent server-side fix.

What's written on your tombstone tends to be whatever is most memorable about you, so the fact that Apple considers your internet history worthy of an epitaph is worrisome.

What's written on your tombstone tends to be whatever is most memorable about you, so the fact that Apple considers your internet history worthy of an epitaph is worrisome. Tombstones are a method of storing deleted records in databases, whether its a record keeping track of deleted items or a marker to tell the database to go back later and reclaim the space. There's nothing necessarily creepy (or ominous as per your original text) about the naming in this context. I'm not saying this is the case, but its entirely possible that Apple might store the records in such a way and then go back later and clean them up in bulk. It's then possible that the cleanup procedure wasn't working properly. Again, not saying this was what was happening but with the naming of the record and how they seem to have "resolved" the issue recently its one possibility.

Best drawing apps for iPad and Apple Pencil By Serenity Caldwell Sunday, Feb 5, 2017 at 1:00 pm EST 25 Comments The age of the digital sketchbook has arrived. Updated February 2017: Added Linea, my new favorite sketching app. I've been wanting a true digital sketchbook ever since I first discovered you could (poorly) draw circles on the Newton. Almost two decades later, I got my wish: The iPad Pro and Apple Pencil are just about the nicest tools for digital sketching I've ever tried. (And I've tried a lot of styluses, computers, and Wacom tablets.) Even if you've never had an art background, the iPad Pro and Pencil make it pretty easy to start sketching — and better, continue sketching. One of my first friends in comics told me that the only way you gained drawing skill was by doing it over and over and over and over again; the iPad Pro is a pretty great tool with which to do that. (And you don't have to spend continuous money on ink, pens, and sketchbooks!) But first! Let's talk about the drawing apps you should check out. If you want to use your iPad Pro to make some digital artwork, these are the best of the best. Notes Apple's default Notes app is limited in both tools, canvas textures, and color picking, but it's a nice starter app for anyone looking to have a little fun with their Pencil without picking out a paid application. It also offers the least lag time from Pencil to line of any app on the market, thanks to Apple's implementation. (Surprising no one, it helps to have your app, device, and accessory all designed to work together from the start by Apple.) FiftyThree Paper If you want a variety of tools for doodling or taking notes, Paper is an excellent (and free) starting point beyond Notes. It offers an assortment of options for starting a pencil, ink, or watercolor sketch, and works beautifully when paired with the Apple Pencil. Better still, Paper can sort all these doodles in separate digital sketchbooks, and you can even share certain drawings to the public Paper feed, or to Adobe's Creative Cloud or OneNote. The downsides to Paper aren't many, but they're worth noting: The Pencil's lag time isn't great when compared to some other apps on the market, and Paper lacks a good way to fill edge-to-edge on the screen without accidentally closing the application. It also doesn't provide options for layered or transparent export. Paper - Download now Linea While I love Paper's tools, the Iconfactory's Linea app has supplanted it to become my favorite all-purpose sketching application. Linea offers similarly well-crafted pencil, ink, and marker options to Paper's fare, but it builds on that by giving users a starting set of layers, easily customizable export options, a beautiful color palette, and my favorite eraser implementation of any drawing app out there. Linea is truly best if you're looking for a digital sketchbook replacement rather than a full-featured Photoshop clone. And because Linea can export to PNG, JPG, or layered PSD, it's also the perfect app to start a project in before bringing it to one of the iPad's heavier hitting graphics programs — or your Mac. Linea - Download now Procreate While Notes, Paper, and Linea can help you flush out ideas and organize them, Procreate is the true master and commander of making those ideas reality. It's the closest app to Photoshop on the Mac in many ways, offering a truly ridiculous number of layers, customizable brushes, and templates. For specific projects, you can even create your own tools, as my pal Jessie Char is doing for her makeup blog: None of the brushes on Procreate looked enough like lipstick, so I made my own pic.twitter.com/0VFPZzjnVg— Jessie Char (@jessiechar) January 27, 2016 Procreate can export truly large images as PSD, JPG, PNG, or in the Procreate file format, where you can then send or share them with your friends, clients, or web pals. It also offers a live-streaming option, and print-ready export formats. Procreate - Download now Graphic I'll be honest: Until Autodesk's Graphic showed up on the scene, I hadn't worked with vector illustration since the death of Macromedia FreeHand in the early 2000s. Illustrator makes me want to throw things at my computer, and since my art hobby was just that — a hobby — I left it well enough alone. But Graphic makes vector art fun for me again, and it does so in a completely approachable way. You can draw vector lines directly with the Apple Pencil or place nodes by hand, or combine both. You can change fills, colors, and group vector pieces. All of the fun of drawing with vectors, none of the Illustrator stress. Graphic isn't perfect for professional work, but it's a pretty darn good start. Graphic - Download now Animation Desk Cloud Disclaimer: I am a terrible, terrible animator. But the animation folks I trust put Kdan's Animation Desk at the top of their list, and it's not hard to see why. Most of the other animation apps available on the App Store are too limited for budding artists — unless you want to make clip-art dance — and the few that do offer traditional animation tools have user interfaces that predate iOS 7, or aren't optimized for the iPad. Kdan's Animation Desk Cloud is the company's iPad Pro successor to Animation Desk, and it strips the clunky skeuomorphic interface while keeping a bevy of tools for animating pros. Like Graphic, there's a huge opportunity for Kdan — or another company — to improve upon the app's foundation and add key tools, but if you want to animate something by hand on your iPad, this is the app to do it with. Animation Desk Cloud - Download now uMake Like animation, 3D modeling is not, shall we say, my forté. But if you want to build some 3D models on the iPad Pro, uMake has very quickly made a name for itself as one of the best programs on the App Store. It offers extensive tutorials on building custom 3D shapes or importing 2D images and making them into 3D models; while I haven't had time to study more than a few of them, they're incredibly detailed and helpful. If 3D modeling is a skill you'd like to learn, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better app for it on the iPad. uMake - Download now For coloring books: Pigment When I was in high school, I had a pretty standard "keep myself from falling asleep in class" routine: I'd doodle vast webs of intercrossed dark lines, then slowly color them in. It was usually good for an hour of entertainment — and provided my brain with just enough stimulation to remain awake while listening to lectures. Pigment takes my high-school doodling to an extreme, offering thousands of pages of intricately-drawn shapes for you to color in — whether you're listening to a lecture, or just want something to do with your hands while watching TV. The app is free to download and view, but you'll need a monthly in-app subscription to actually sketch on the patterns. Pigment - Download now Astropad and Astropad Studio If you drew digitally before the age of iPads, you probably used a Wacom tablet at least once in your life: The tablet and pen combination allowed users to draw naturally within apps like Photoshop, either by using a plastic tablet or drawing directly on the screen via the company's more expensive Cintiq line. Astropad essentially lets you turn your iPad Pro and Pencil into a Wacom Cintiq — with or without wires. A wired connection to your Mac results in almost no lag, and a supremely comfortable sketching experience, but going wireless is also fantastic: I have a couch set up across from my iMac and standing desk, and with Astropad, I can sketch in Photoshop on my retina iMac from 4 feet away. If you want to use your iPad on-the-go but also integrate it into your desktop drawing workflow, Astropad is an incredible resource to have in your app library. For true pros, there's also a subscription-based version of the app available, Astropad Studio, which offers better Apple Pencil input, Magic Gestures, faster latency, and more.

It's a good-to-fantastic new CAD suite built from the ground-up to work on mobile and in modern "evergreen" web browsers with WebGL. It's not the sort of app where full-bore Apple Pencil support (e.g. pressure, tilt, etc.) makes sense, but is one where Pencil's precision is wonderful. Big iPad Pro screen is also wonderful... The app is free, but does require an account. OnShape's free tier is quite ample for those who want to tinker, prototype things, build models for 3D printing, etc. There's a fair bit of documentation and online tutorial vids to get you started. For those new to CAD, this is what's called a fully parametric CAD suite, one geared towards modeling working mechanisms. You can do a some surface-design work, but other CAD suites would often be used alongside this for exterior design styling. (e.g. think of the internal build of your awesome Hairdryer 2.0 kickstarter project vs. the curvy exterior molding.) [Disclaimer: I have no affiliation, just elated to have a modern Mac/iOS compatible contender in a market of ancient, super-expensive Windows-only behemoths.] -1 1 year ago Reply A Danz A friend of mine (no, really) asked for a recommendation of an app that you could take a line drawing (scanned or hand-drawn) and color it, where it kept you inside the lines. Similar to Pigment, but where you provided the art (and without the ongoing subscription requirement!)... Does anyone have a recommendation? My personal FB hive mind did not provide any pointers. Thanks! 0 1 year ago Reply rluka Procreate can import picture from your photo library. As long as the line is closed enough, the fill tool can colour inside the lines, like Photoshop's Paint Fill tool. The selection sensitivity is also adjustable on the fly. 1 1 year ago Reply talldreams Thank you. Thank you all for pointing out these apps. After years of waiting, I'm finally sold on an iPad.

It also have line stabilizing feature to make cleaner line, seems to be staple feature for comic drawing software in desktop. BTW, which Pencil works better with Paper ? Apple's or their own ? :D 1 1 year ago Reply tsteele937 I only just found out about Medibang Paint. I find it odd that I have searched a LOT both in the App Store and online for iPad PAINT apps and it has never come up before until I got an adonit Pixel stylus and they showed it as supporting their stylus.

I'm a comic artist and illustrator and here are my go-to apps: Procreate - Best drawing app on iPad, hands down. Sketch Club has a lot of great features, but Procreate is the real pro powerhouse with larger canvas sizes, a better brush engine, and touch gestures for a quick and easy workflow. It also supports copy/paste from clipboard for easier workflow between apps. Aside from the Notes app, it works the best with Apple Pencil. Pixelmator - As close as I've seen to Photoshop on iOS. Useful for final touches/filters and resizing to save out to web. Supports copy/paste from clipboard. Graphic - Best vector graphics tool, and because it uses system fonts, you can use it with AnyFont to use custom fonts in your art. Supports copy/paste from clipboard. I can't wait to see what developers will release in the next year or two, but the iPad Pro already has a pretty strong suite of pro-level art apps. 0 1 year ago Reply Heidern I really want to like Procreate more, but compared to the notes app, the response to the pencil is so slow. It really takes me out of the whole experience. Adobe Sketch works much faster, but has way less features. I really hope the developers of Procreate can fix that latency. 0 1 year ago Reply Shirk It's been four weeks now - did I miss the follow up?

The best HomeKit accessories Let’s Talk Jailbreak 158: The ends and the means The best iOS 10 jailbreak tweaks   skip to main content skip to main menu     iCloud was storing deleted browsing histories, but Apple fixed the issue By Christian Zibreg, Feb 9, 2017 Tweet 3 Comments A Russian forensics firm named Elcomsoft has discovered that Apple was storing users’ Safari browsing histories in iCloud going back more than a year, possibly much longer. This was happening even after users had asked for any deleted records to be wiped from their iCloud-connected devices. Soon after Elcomsoft announced a way to extract deleted browsing histories from iCloud, Apple applied a server-side fix to stop the retrievals and apparently purged all records older than two weeks. “Good move, Apple,” Elcomsoft said. “Still, we would like to get an explanation.” Apple declined to comment publicly on Elcomsoft’s findings. Elcomsoft has discovered, by chance, that information about deleted entries in Safari’s browsing history was being stored in iCloud, possibly indefinitely. Those records included things like website names, URLs and when a given site was visited. Cleared records were simply marked as “deleted” in the table on iCloud. The items don’t appear to have been accessible to law enforcement requests. According to security experts, this was a design flaw rather than some sort of nefarious scheme on Apple’s part. iCloud syncing requires records of deleted items to remain accessible on servers for some time after the actual items have been deleted. This allows an iCloud device that may be turned off or inaccessible to remove a copy of the item which was previously deleted from Safari on another device, as soon as that device is back online. Now, all companies that run online services which store user data on servers are required by law to adhere to some form of data retention, obliging them to keep any deleted items on servers for a certain period of time. As explained, keeping a record that a given site has been visited and cleared permits Apple to synchronize this information with other devices that may be currently inaccessible to iCloud. Elcomsoft successfully pulled these records with its mobile acquisition tool going back more than a year, but that was before Apple silently applied a server-side fix. The tool extracts full information about each record including the date and time on which the record was last accessed as well as the date and time the record has been deleted. Elcomsoft found those records stored in unhashed form as far back as November 2015. Though Elcomsoft’s Phone Breaker probing tool could be used to access this data in an unencrypted form, it requires the user to have access to a target’s iCloud login credentials or an authentication token stored on the device itself, making iCloud-related privacy invasions difficult to pull off. According to Forbes, a change Apple implemented in Safari 9.1 and iOS 9.3 turns any deleted URLs from the user’s web history into a hashed form to prevent snooping. In the meantime, you can avoid this problem altogether by disabling Safari syncing in iCloud settings on your iPhone, iPad or Mac.

The “we didn’t know this was happening” won’t wash. Google are starting to appear more transparent. GUY Yeah of course this was a “design flaw” but it’s fine now because Apple “fixed the issue” JohnS I’m not sure I understand the ending of your article. You stated that Apple has been turning these URLs into hashes since March 2016 (the release of Safari 9.1) and that Apple applied a server side fix to stop retrievals after deleting everything older than 2 weeks just recently. But you follow this up by saying, “In the meantime, you can avoid this problem altogether by disabling Safari syncing in iCloud settings on your iPhone, iPad or Mac.” In the meantime of what?

DMAMBMCMDMEZBZBRZDZGZHZQZRZSZTZU Six years after it lost the crown to Apple Inc., Google Inc. has reclaimed the title of the most valuable brand in the world. For Android fans, the reversal of fortune is especially gratifying given that much of Apple’s luster was largely due to the success of its iPhone. “Google won out mainly because Apple’s fall was even more dramatic. The iPhone company saw its value drop by 26%,” said HowMuch.Net. As of 2017, Alphabet’s (GOOGL) (GOOG) Google brand is worth $109.47 billion, and Apple (AAPL) is valued at $107.14 billion. See larger map “The market is volatile and their survival is precarious. Huge, wealthy brands can stumble and shrink to a ghost of their former selves,” HowMuch said. Brand value is more than just how much money companies are worth, according to the cost-estimating website. It also captures the abstract quality of how much confidence consumers have in the brand, as well as name recognition. Following closely on Apple’s heels is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) at $106.37 billion. AT&T Inc. (XNYS:T) comes in at fourth with $87.2 billion and Microsoft Corp.(MSFT)  rounds out the top five at $76.27 billion, underscoring the dominance and the prestige of U.S. brands across the globe. Samsung (005930.KS), the Korean conglomerate that makes everything from Galaxy smartphones to apparel, was sixth with a brand value of $66.2 billion. The only other non-American brand to crack the top 10 list was Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, at $47.8 billion, Brand Finance data show. Brand Finance Aside from the predominance of tech names in the U.S., banks were the most valuable in eight countries, although with the exception of Santander in Spain, most did not have much global recognition, according to HowMuch. Energy companies and telecommunication brands also popped up fairly often on the map. You can follow Sue Chang on Twitter at @SueChangMW.

Mello Jr. Feb 9, 2017 9:45 AM PT You dont need an army of developers to create segmented & personalized email campaigns. Klaviyo's advanced features  like automation, AB testing, auto reminders, abandoned cart flows, analytics & more - are designed to drive results. Sign up Free. Dozens of applications for Apple's mobile devices are vulnerable to WiFi snoopers, a security researcher reported this week. Will Strafach, CEO of the Sudo Security Group, identified 76 popular iOS apps available at Apple's App Store that were vulnerable to wireless eavesdroppers, even though the connections were supposed to be protected by encryption. There have been 18 million downloads of the vulnerable apps, he said. Strafach categorized 33 of the vulnerable apps as "low risk." Potentially intercepted information included partially sensitive analytics data about a device and partially sensitive personal data, such as an email address or login credentials. VivaVideo, Snap Upload for Snapchat, Volify, Loops Live, Private Browser, Aman Bank, FirstBank, VPN One Click Professional, and AutoLotto: Powerball, MegaMillions Lottery Tickets are some of the apps he assigned to the low-risk category. Riskier Apps Strafach categorized another 24 iOS apps as "medium risk." Potentially intercepted information included service login credentials and session authentication tokens for users logged onto the network. Strafach labeled the remaining apps "high risk" because potentially intercepted information included the snatching of financial or medical services login credentials. He did not identify the medium and high risk apps by name, in order to give their makers time to patch the vulnerability in their apps. How concerned should users be about their security when using these apps? "I tried to leave out anything regarding concern level, as I do not want to freak people out too much," Strafach told TechNewsWorld. "While this is indeed a big concern in my opinion, it can be mostly mitigated by turning off WiFi and using a cellular connection to perform sensitive actions -- such as checking bank balances -- while in public," he said. Man in the Middle Attack If anything, Strafach is understating the problem, maintained Dave Jevans, vice president for mobile security products at Proofpoint. "We've analyzed millions of apps and found this is a widespread problem," he told TechNewsWorld, "and it's not just iOS. It's Android, too." Still, it likely is not yet a cause for great alarm, according to Seth Hardy, director of security research at Appthority. "It's something to be concerned about, but we've never seen it actively exploited in the wild," he told TechNewsWorld. What the vulnerability does is enable a classic man-in-the-middle attack. Data from the target phone is intercepted before it reaches its destination. It is then decrypted, stored, re-encrypted and then sent to its destination -- all without the user's knowledge. To do that, an app needs to be fooled into thinking it's communicating with a destination and not an evesdropper. "In order for a man-in-the-middle attack to be successful, the attacker needs a digital certificate that's either trusted by the application, or the application is not properly vetting the trust relationship," explained Slawek Ligier, vice president of engineering for security at Barracuda Networks. "In this case, it appears that developers are developing applications in a way that allows any certificate to be accepted," he told TechNewsWorld. "If the certificate is issued and not expired, they're accepting it. They're not checking if it's been revoked or even if it's properly signed." Developer's Problem Should Apple act to weed these vulnerable apps from behind its walled garden? "Apple should most certainly remove any of the offending apps from the App Store," said Sam McLane, head of security engineering at Arctic Wolf. "This is something that is relatively easy to test for and should be enforced by Apple, since the trust model starts with the Apple ecosystem being safe for people to use," he told TechNewsWorld. Strafach disagreed. "The setup now is exactly as it should be with regards to developer control of networking code," he said. "Developers can do something about this problem. For affected apps, the fix is only a few lines -- less than an hour tops, if that, to fix the matter in affected code." Lazy Coders If Apple tried to address this app vulnerability, it could create headaches for developers, especially those developing enterprise apps, noted Simeon Coney, chief strategy officer for AdaptiveMobile. "A lot of app developers rely on current behaviors to do things like enterprise apps, which may not have a public certificate," he told TechNewsWorld, "so the responsibility lies more with the app developers to make sure their apps aren't bundled with this risk." Apple doesn't want to force developers to fully trust certificates, added Ligier. "It will break a lot of things, especially internal apps, and generate a lot of unhappy users," he said. Nevertheless, developers should not release apps that allow for third-party certificates to be blindly accepted, McLane maintained. "This is entirely in their hands to remedy," he said. "It's easily tested and only out of laziness would someone ever ship an app that had this egregious security hole in production level code."

Share on Twitter Click me! Copy Link For many iPhone power users, news that the iPhone 8 (arriving as a sort-of tenth-anniversary edition) will sell for north of a grand isn’t jaw-dropping. As it stands now, the iPhone 7 Plus maxed out with 256 gigabytes of storage gets you within spitting distance at $969. But for those of us who have been content with earlier iterations, other brands, or cushy upgrade packages, seeing a fourth figure in the price tag may set off alarm bells. (This piece from BGR calls a $1,000 price tag from Apple “courageous,” which suggests our definitions of courage differ wildly.) Another estimate by iPhone8look puts the price at $1,200.  A lot of changes and fanfare are expected around the device, which may break naming tradition with the moniker iPhone X, a nod to the tenth-anniversary rather than the 8th iteration of the phone. Further, at least some models are expected to feature an OLED display rather than an LCD screen, which will stretch across the entire face of the phone, creating a borderless appearance and larger viewable surface. It’s estimated in this Fast Company article that the display upgrade alone will cost Apple twice what the old ones did.  Here’s a rendering of the phone based on descriptions and anticipated features:  Handy Abo Vergleich Rumors abound regarding integration of some 3D technology, which is possible, but completely speculative at this point.  More good news (if you’re willing to float the cash) comes in rumors of a much larger battery which consumers may balk at upon seeing purchase price, but a year or two down the line, who wouldn’t contribute another $100 or so to get a little more use out of a charge?  We’re also about six months away from the reveal, and then a few more weeks away from the sale of the iPhone 8/iPhone X, and economic uncertainty could certainly play a role in the price point of the device as well, though Apple’s enjoyed inelastic demand when it comes to its products thus far, so bowing to external economic factors seems unlikely.  So...$1,000 for an iPhone. And probably not even the best iPhone. Whether or not you’re a potential customer for the product, Apple remains the leader in the field of smartphones, and history’s indicated that whatever Apple does tends to become the consumer standard (for better or worse, I’ll concede). Considering phone usage and utility continues to climb, this benchmark’s been a long time coming, but is jarring nonetheless, especially considering the increased cost offers no more protection that we won’t drop the damn thing or leave it on top of our car as we drive to work. The price would also put the iPhone at a new point in the spectrum of Apple’s offerings, coming in more expensive than most iPads and now the lower-end laptop computers, which hover around the $1,000 mark as well. So as much as the price could be a reflection of what’s going into the new phone, it could also simply be a reflection of how much our phones mean to us in 2017.  Survey How GOOD are we?

Gained 17% in January The rumor mill pushed share prices higher, as several reports agreed that Apple is gearing up for large-scale screen production on U.S. soil -- and some of it might be OLED-based. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Feb 9, 2017 at 12:35PM What happened Shares of Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) rose 17.2% in January 2017, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. So what The big driver of Universal Display's January gains came from Chinese electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn. The company publicly "mulled" a $7 billion investment in a U.S.-based manufacturing facility, equipped to provide Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with high-quality smartphone and tablet screens. The U.S. factory plan dovetailed nicely with rumors that the next few generations of Apple iPhones might ship with OLED screens. Furthermore, Foxconn recently acquired screen maker Sharp for a cool $5.1 billion, and that company had already dipped its toes into OLED waters before joining the Foxconn mother ship. Put all the pieces together, and it starts to look as if Apple and Foxconn might want to order quite a bit of OLED equipment and materials in the reasonably near future. Universal Display shares gained more than 12% in three days, based on this collection of circumstantial evidence. Image source: Universal Display. Now what The American Foxconn factory is still an unconfirmed rumor, and we certainly don't know for sure how Foxconn might use such a facility. However, the volume of harmonizing rumors has increased. This week, a Reuters report reaffirmed that Sharp is taking the lead on Foxconn's $7 billion factory-building plans in America, citing unnamed insider sources. So the Apple rumors remain neither confirmed nor debunked, but the sheer weight of similar third-party reports is making the whole thing sound plausible. And if that wasn't enough, Universal Display just announced a $15 million investment to double materials manufacturing partner PPG 's (NYSE:PPG) OLED emitter capacity over the next three quarters. Next up, Universal Display is slated to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 23.  Anders Bylund owns shares of Universal Display.

More specifically, the present embodiments relate to the use of graphene in heat dissipators for iDevices. The timing of Apple's patent filing is quite revealing. Apple filed it on September 9, 2016 or a week or two after Note 7 fires began gaining attention in the blogosphere and more importantly, Consumer Reports. Whether the Note 7 fires were a motivator for the patent filing or pure happenstance, the fact is that as Phablets get larger, extra safety measures to safeguard users from battery overheating incidents are needed and it's great to see that Apple is being proactive.   Coincidentally, KGI analyst Ming Chi Kuo noted today that because the wireless charging component inside the devices produces more heat, a new graphite layer will be required inside the phone to protect the film 3D Touch sensor. This graphite sheet will be laminated to the heat-sensitive film sensor internally. The timing is most interesting.   Apple notes in their patent filing that their invention relates to techniques for facilitating thermal transfer in a portable electronic device. The portable electronic device includes a battery pack, which further includes a battery cell.   The battery pack may supply power to a set of components in the portable electronic device. The portable electronic device also includes a heat dissipator composed of graphene. The heat dissipator may be in thermal contact with one or more of the components. The heat dissipator may also be disposed over a surface of the battery pack.   In some embodiments like the iPhone, the battery cell corresponds to a lithium-ion and/or lithium-polymer battery cell that contains a set of layers, including a cathode with an active coating, a separator, and an anode with an active coating. The battery cell also includes a pouch enclosing the layers, wherein the pouch is flexible. The layers may be wound to create a jelly roll prior to sealing the layers in the flexible pouch.   Apple's patent filing also provides formulas where graphene could be utilized in future versions of the Apple Watch and Macs.   Apple's patent application 20170038803 was filed back in Q3 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

That's important as Apple's next generation of smartphones will be offering wireless charging. Coincidentally today we learn that Samsung's next-gen Galaxy S8 will introduce both an entry model with a 5.7" display and their premium model offering a 6.2" display.   So how is Samsung going to handle the heat for yet larger smartphones? Well, they plan to play it safe by simply using the same battery size used in the Note 7 and just have more room to breathe. While Apple will be offering a real solution for heat dissipation, Samsung has chosen to go quick, cheap and brainless way as expected.   After confirming the two display sizes, the Korean report today noted that "The first will be fitted with the 3,000mAh battery while the latter will come with the larger battery capacity. The ill-fated Galaxy Note7 that exploded its way to an early demise had also featured a 3,500 mAh battery."   The report went on to quote a Samsung official stating that "After completing a rage of tests, Samsung made a final decision to deploy the battery capacity for the two S8 variants.'   Samsung is said to have recently started receiving smartphone components in large volumes from its partners for the mass production of the S8.   After the Galaxy Note 7 crisis, the company is said to have made some change to its battery supplies, by tapping Murata Manufacturing of Japan for the S8 battery supply."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Samsung design patent case to Judge Koh in Northern California By Gene Quinn February 9, 2017 4 Print Article Judge Lucy Koh. License: CC BY-SA 4.0. Earlier this week, in a non-precedential decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. back to Judge Lucy Koh of the United States Federal District Court for the Northern District of California. In December 2016, the Supreme Court overturned a $400 million damages award for design patent infringement. In it’s ruling the Supreme Court explained that damages may be limited to revenues attributable to a component of an article of manufacture and not the entire article itself. See Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple, Inc. Apple requested that the Federal Circuit keep the case and the panel review the decision in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, while Samsung requested that the Federal Circuit remand the matter to the district court for a new trial on damages. The Federal Circuit adopted neither suggestion. Instead, the Federal Circuit chose to remand the case for further proceedings, which the panel explained may or may not include a new trial on damages. Judge Koh will decide whether a new trial on damages is necessary. The Federal Circuit panel wrote in a per curiam decision: In short, the parties dispute what jury instructions the current trial record supports. Because the district court is better positioned to parse the record to evaluate the parties’ competing arguments, we remand for the district court to consider these issues in the first instance. On remand, the trial court should consider the parties’ arguments in light of the trial record and determine what additional proceedings, if any, are needed. If the court determines that a new damages trial is necessary, it will have the opportunity to set forth a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture for purposes of § 289, and to apply that test to this case. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the district court for further proceedings. “It’s not surprising that the Federal Circuit decided to give the district court wide latitude to reconsider the merits of the damages case after the Supreme Court’s ruling,” said Christopher Loh, a partner with Fitzpatrick, Cella, Harper & Scinto. “The Supreme Court didn’t provide specific guidance on how to apply its rulings to the facts of the case, so the Federal Circuit wisely determined that the details were best left to the person most familiar with those facts: Judge Koh.” So now the dispute will return to the Northern District of California. “It will be interesting to see whether and to what extent Judge Koh allows Samsung to present additional evidence in its favor, and whether Judge Koh will in fact proceed with a new trial,” said Loh. Thumbnail Sketch of the Dispute This design patent dispute relates to the ongoing patent war between two technology giants. A jury in the Northern District of California found that Samsung infringed Apple design patents, Apple utility patents and also diluted Apple’s trade dresses. The infringed design patents are U.S. Design Patent Nos. D618,677 (“D’677 patent”), D593,087 (“D’087 patent”), and D604,305 (“D’305 patent”), which claim certain design elements embodied in Apple’s iPhone. The infringed utility patents were U.S. Patent Nos. 7,469,381 (“’381 patent”), 7,844,915 (“’915 patent”), and 7,864,163 (“’163 patent”), which claim certain features in the iPhone’s user interface. The diluted trade dresses are Trademark Registration No. 3,470,983 (“’983 trade dress”) and an unregistered trade dress defined in terms of certain elements in the configuration of the iPhone. Following the first jury trial, the district court upheld the jury’s infringement, dilution, and validity findings over Samsung’s post-trial motion. The district court also upheld $639,403,248 in damages, but ordered a partial retrial on the remainder of the damages because they had been awarded for a period when Samsung lacked notice of some of the asserted patents. The jury in the partial retrial on damages awarded Apple $290,456,793, which the district court upheld over Samsung’s second post-trial motion. On March 6, 2014, the district court entered a final judgment in favor of Apple, and Samsung filed a notice of appeal. All totaled, the amount won by Apple as a result of the infringement (i.e., damages as well as pre-judgment and post-judgment interest) reached to $399 million. On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed the jury’s verdict on the design patent infringements, the validity of two utility patent claims, and the damages awarded for the design and utility patent infringements appealed by Samsung. The Federal Circuit also reversed the jury’s findings that the asserted trade dresses are protectable. See Apple v. Samsung (Fed. Cir. May 18, 2015). The Federal Circuit’s decision from May 2015 upheld the traditional interpretation of §289, finding that the whole of the infringing Samsung smartphone products was the only permissible article of manufacture because consumers could not buy the smartphone in individual components. In oral arguments presented to the Supreme Court on October 12th, Samsung’s counsel made the case that the damages award should not be derived from the entire profits on the sale of design patent-infringing smartphones when those design patents only covered a portion of the device’s appearance. In its December 2016 decision, the Supreme Court explained that determining the proper damages award under §289 involves two steps. “First, identify the ‘article of manufacture’ to which the infringed design has been applied. Second, calculate the infringer’s total profit made on that article of manufacture.” The Supreme Court would go on to conclude that the term “article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product.” Having reached that conclusion the Supreme Court had little difficulty concluding that the narrow interpretation of  §289 by the Federal Circuit, which found that the article of manufacture could only cover an end product sold to consumers, was inappropriate.

Anon2 February 9, 2017 11:26 am Factually, a single design could be “applied” to multiple components making up a single physical product. I don’t understand why the Supreme Court used singular language. It probably doesn’t mean anything though. Inventor Woes February 9, 2017 10:21 pm It makes sense to limit damages to only the infringed component and not the whole system. Otherwise someone could just keep loading “add-ons” and accessories to the main product as a “bundle” and say that “it comes with everything as a single package” in order to hike up any potential damages from a future lawsuit. Paul F. Morgan February 10, 2017 8:08 am IW, “loading “add-on’s” and accessories” is indeed what happened with “smart phones.” E.g. there was no essential reason why a pocket telephone had to include the addition of fancy cameras, Bluetooth, ability to store and play movies, games, hi-def color screens, etc., etc. That may well be one reason why smartphones represented a much poorer fact situation to be insisting on a strict interpretation of the old design damages statute than for other products. Anon2, I don’t think it is at all common that a single design could be “applied” to multiple components making up a single physical product. But one example might be a set of multiple design-patented screws holding the product together. In that case could not the “article of manufacture” be the whole set of screws? Anon2 February 10, 2017 12:08 pm Paul@3 When a design is a shape such as for example a vase, normally an integral single molded product, I believe if the design is still applied to a multicomponent vase. For example one with a wooden base, a silver midsection, and a glass top section (with lights embedded inside the glass itself). Certainly the whole product has had the design applied to it. I would argue that each piece (article?) of the product sold has had the design applied to it because it was shaped to fit that portion of the design it constitutes, and although each piece does not have the totality of the design applied to it, it has the design applied to it in some portion.

Vote! Marian Hill's Airpods Synch Pushes 'Down' Way, Way Up 2/9/2017 by Gil Kaufman FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Timothy Saccenti Marian Hill A decade removed from Apple ads breaking artists like Feist and The Ting Tings, rhythmic pop duo Marian Hill has hit the mainstream thanks to the first AirPods headphones commercial. Since the ad — featuring gravity-defying footwork from dancer Lil Buck — debuted on Jan. 14, downloads for the song “Down” have jumped from negligible to 101,000, according to Nielsen Music, and the track has shot to No. 37 on the Billboard Hot 100. There are no "alternative facts" when it comes to the astonishing numbers for the rocket rise for the pair's single. Since the entrancing song from the EDM-meets-jazz pop duo hit the air as the soundtrack to Apple's first commercial for its wireless AirPods headphones, digital song sales have jumped from negligible in the week before to 22,000 for the week ending Jan. 19, according to figures provided by Nielsen Music. The spare, beat-driven song from singer Samantha Gongol and producer/keyboardist Jeremy Lloyd's 2016 full-length debut, Act One, is the perfect compliment to dancer Buck's gravity-defying footwork in the spot. The skyrocketing sales are further proof that the right synch (especially an Apple-related one) can change lives overnight. "You hope for it but we certainly did not anticipate the degree to which everything has exploded," Gongol, 26, told Billboard. "We grew up watching those ads."   The Philadelphia-bred pair who've known each other since middle school and worked together professionally for three years grew up watching other iconic Apple ads featuring acts such as Feist. "We just proceeded as usual in our head, not expecting much," Lloyd said of the spot they didn't see until its online debut in mid-January, just hours before its placement during an NFL playoff game. "But for it to do everything it's done has been really gratifying and surreal and validating." Gongol said she got goosebumps while viewing it the first time. "I saw it online the day it came out and I was with my friends and family in their hotel room," she recalled. "Thank god so many people watch football! The stars could not have aligned more perfectly... and to actually have them say our name at the beginning [of the ad] was so perfect." On-demand streams for "Down" (audio and video combined) jumped from 89,000 the week before the ad to more than 1.6 million in the week ending Jan. 19, a leap Republic Records co-founder and president Avery Lipman calls "magical." In the first week after the ad debuted, Lipman said sales of Act One quadrupled totals for the six months preceding. Lipman and Marian Hill said they were not at liberty to discuss the terms of the Apple deal and both said it was too early to calculate the financial upside of the sales increase. On the Digital Song Sales chart "Down" was up 53 percent, shooting up 33-8 to sales of 34,000 for the week ending Jan. 26, according to Nielsen Music. In a testament to how many "oh man, what is that song?" moments people are having, according to the group's label they continue to hold down the No. 2 spot on the Shazam Top 10 global chart. "For it to be in such a high-profile place and be so totally our vibe visually? We love it," said Lloyd.  "Sales prior to this were literally anemic, with the single maybe moving 100 units a week, but in the past week (ending Jan. 28) they did 32,500 on just iTunes," an ecstatic Lipman said. Numbers for the pair's 2015 EP Sway have also spiked and "Down" went from "literally zero" airplay before to 270 spins on Jan. 26 and pick-ups across formats including Top 40, Triple A, Alternative, Hot AC as well as online and satellite radio. It also recently debuted on the Pop Songs (No. 36) and Alternative Songs (No. 37) airplay charts. "When Apple gets it right the sky's the limit… and financially speaking we had nothing on the books for this group and I call this one of the few unbudgeted windfalls we've had." One more example of how quickly things have changed for Marian Hill? Before the commercial aired the group didn't have many plans for 2017 besides working on new music. The week after, they got booked on The Tonight Show on two day's notice and Lipman said the manager for a "huge artist" was recently in his office and a collaboration is in the talking stages. "I'm trying to make as much music as possible," said Lloyd, whose group had a modest hit ("Back to Me") last year with Fifth Harmony's Lauren Jauregui. "A lot of stuff for us to work on together, things to send to other people. We're in a slightly different mindspace now because it's an exciting place to be where people will be listening." Lipman recalled being a bit envious in the past when he'd be at home watching a high-profile commercial with an amazing synch from another label. He's just happy now that Republic's "number came up" with the AirPods spot, which has nearly 9 million YouTube views to date, plus 1.8 million for the official audio clip, more than one million streams on Pandora over the past week and over one million streams a week on Spotify, according to Republic. "We've definitely met people we've looked up to and want to collaborate with," said Gongol. "[Actor] Chris Evans said he's a fan! Captain America likes our music!"

The Apple CEO met with Theresa May at Number 10 Downing Street on the final day of his European tour, which has seen him visiting France, Germany and now the UK. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister told ZDNet that she and Cook "discussed number of issues including science and technology, Apple's investment in the UK and the government's approach to Brexit". The discussion on Brexit came the day after MPs voted in favour of invoking Article 50 and to formally begin the process of the UK leaving the EU. Downing Street wouldn't say what May and Cook specifically discussed on Brexit, but in the run up to the referendum, many in the UK technology sector were vocal in their opposition to leaving the EU. Uncertainties still remain over investment, access to talent and the extent to which UK based businesses will be able to trade with EU customers once Britain leaves the EU. Tim Cook also stopped in at City Hall to meet the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, where the pair discussed talent, digital skills and Apple's investment in the capital, including plans to move the company's UK headquarters to a new development at Battersea Power Station. "The Mayor met Tim Cook to discuss Apple's investment into Battersea Power Station that will generate new jobs and economic prosperity for the city," a City Hall spokesperson told ZDNet. "They also discussed trade and investment opportunities post-Brexit and the Mayor's new Digital Talent Programme that that will arm young Londoners with the skills they need to access jobs in the industry," they added. The Apple CEO's tour also took him to Scotland, where he received honorary doctorate of Science at the University of Glasgow. Speaking at the university, Cook spoke out against US President Trump's order to ban immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. "If we stand and say nothing we become a part of it, our company thrives on diversity," he said.

By James Billington February 9, 2017 18:00 GMT Close Apple Campus 2: Drone video of spectacular 'Spaceship' HQ David Sexton videography Apple Campus 2 is the multi-billion dollar spaceship-style building that's going to be the new home for Cook, Ive and co when it's finally built. Envisioned by Steve Jobs, the dramatic ring-shaped headquarters is scheduled to be completed by 2017 – two years later than initially planned as a result of the meticulous attention-to-detail involved. Situated in Cupertino, California, the plans for the Sir Norman Foster-designed Campus are out-of-this-world – and so were the demands put on contractors working on the site, leaving them literally running around in circles. Reuters conducted an investigation behind the build, speaking to those who have worked on the site and unearthed a few gems. As completion of the project draws nearer we've rounded up our favourite factoids. Apple Campus 2: 13 crazy facts about the 'spaceship' HQ The Apple Campus 2 takes shape as construction nears 2017 completion.Reuters The building, the builders and the barn The Apple Campus 2 is a 2.8 million sq ft construction sat in a 176-acre site. It was initially going to be a smaller build, but when land became available from Hewlett Packard, Apple snapped it up and blew up the scale of its plans. In fact, it wasn't going to be circular at all. This development came with the acquisition of the land, revealed Sir Norman Foster in an interview. As part of the deal between the two tech giants, a century-old barn already on the land was to be restored, kept intact and remain on the site. Contractors Skanska USA and DPR Construction, who were originally signed to work on the site, walked away almost as soon as it began – losing out on a reported $800m in the process. Neither Apple or the contractors have spoken on why they parted ways. Total cost? The budget for the Campus 2 has never been officially revealed but is estimated at $5bn – although this may climb even higher with a reported $1bn set aside to spec out the interior. The stats and figures of the new headquarters.Reuters Toilets like iPhones Many elements inside the building have reportedly been designed to mimic some of Apple's famous consumer electronics. Buttons of the elevators are said to be similar to the home button on the iPhone, while even the design of its toilets is reportedly similar to the sleek form of the smartphone. This revelation has unsurprisingly led to the toilets being dubbed 'iThrones'. Ridiculously meticulous Apple wants doorways to have no threshold, instead being completely flat so engineers can walk about the complex without having to alter their stride so as not to interrupt their train of thought by stepping over a strip on the floor. This came as a huge aggravation to builders, but Apple believe this small step could get in the way of the next big product. One door handle took 18 months to complete. Another anecdote from the Reuters report claimed Apple's achingly attentive search for perfection saw a lengthy process between Holder Construction and Rudolph & Sletten to finalise a door handle design. Apple would check the design down the nanometre looking for imperfections. After months of painstaking discussions and refinements, Apple's in-house team took hold of the design – and then rejected it after they felt a faint bump. World's largest piece of curved glass The Apple Campus 2 will feature the world's largest piece of curved glass. Glass clads the whole exterior of the circular construction (which is a mile in circumference) with an estimated 3,000 sheets in total, which Jony Ive claims are the biggest in the world. No vents or pipes could be reflected in the glass. Another demanding demand from the project managers said that all heating or cooling systems must be hidden and unseen. Even emergency exit signs, which would adhere to strict health and safety laws would have to be displayed in a more stylish manner than your average building, which tested the resolve of the fire inspectors who attended 15 meetings on the matter. The roof will be covered in solar panels to help the building run in 100% renewable energy.Reuters Renewable energy The whole building is run entirely on renewable energy. Solar panels on the roof will be one of the largest onsite corporate solar energy installations in the world with an estimated 700,000 sq ft of panels used. There will also be an ingenious ventilation system that will see it avoid using planet-sucking air-conditioning or heating systems for three quarters of the year. To further add to its green credentials there will be nearly 8000 trees planted around the campus, engulfing the structure in a canopy. Going underground An underground carpark will be built so as to ensure cars do not ruin the view – and rightly so. Employees will, however, be able to get around on one of the 1,000 bicycles to use on campus or they can jog on one of the numerous trails weaved throughout the site. Recycle and reuse The current Apple headquarters will be demolished and recycled.Reuters And the old building? When it's time to move out, the materials of the demolished old campus at 1 Infinite Loop will be recycled and used in the production to create new Apple products.

Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty Images Our relationships with and access to music lie between rocks and hard places; the rocks that own it, the hard places that distribute it to us. Those relationships are constantly evolving, and to figure out what might come next, we've combed through the recent earnings statements of some of the largest record labels and tech companies to reveal how they're preparing for 2017 and beyond. Musicians and labels have had to adjust to a world where they hold less control, because of the ways we listen now. Where once music distribution centered mostly around record stores, or radio disc jockeys — with whom musicians and labels typically had more symbiotic relationships — they're now forced to work with companies like Apple, Facebook and Google — for whom music is a cherry, not the sundae — and streaming companies like Spotify, who now hold sway over huge portions of their bank statements. These tech companies will also control distribution channels that have yet to manifest — like virtual and augmented reality technologies, as well as "high resolution" music, which was mentioned on Warner Music's earnings call Wednesday and which another major label source told NPR last week is a major priority in this year, and years, to come. (These companies are barred from collusion, but often reach the same conclusions at similar times.) Where tech has the platform, labels — for better and worse — have the content tech needs to make those platforms rich, emotionally and otherwise. Article continues after sponsorship Consolidation is expected this year in the streaming industry, as presaged by Sprint's recent purchase of a third of Tidal, the streaming service that Jay Z purchased in 2015 for $56 million. Pandora also has been tipped as an acquisition target by SiriusXM, though Pandora seems keen to see how its forthcoming Spotify competitor, Pandora Premium, fares before any organizational capitulation. Record companies want as many outlets (think Spotify, or the app Music.ally) as possible using their music, in part to avoid the market domination that Apple had with the iTunes Store starting in 2004, and in part to keep pricing for their music catalogs competitive. However, tech companies have their own leverage, in the form of billions of "captive" users. The hands wash each other and the tendrils of industry are labyrinthine. (This very long, very dense piece on antitrust and Amazon from The Yale Law Journal is a fascinating breakdown not just of Amazon, but of the many problems facing tech's primacy, regulation and the laws around it.) Over the past week, the companies below have either shared their most recent financial statements (except for Snap Inc., which filed a comprehensive internal breakdown ahead of its $18 billion IPO). These statements (along with tech's activity over the past year and conversations we've had with them) give us a look at the proverbial tea leaves and where we fall between the hard place and the rock. SPOTIFY Enlarge this image Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg looks on a Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski demos a virtual reality headset. Pablo Parciuncula/AFP/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Pablo Parciuncula/AFP/Getty Images Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg looks on a Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski demos a virtual reality headset. Pablo Parciuncula/AFP/Getty Images The financials of the world's most-used streaming service are a notoriously elusive commodity — the company files in the spring, in Luxembourg, in French, and makes it a point not to announce them — but two things over the past day alone and one as-yet-unannounced move indicate where the company's head is at. Last things first, its partnership with AccuWeather, which yielded a study on how weather affects listening patterns. Next, two as-yet-unannounced podcasts exclusive to the service, one on music supervision (the work of selecting and licensing songs for television and movies) and the other about hip-hop record executive Chris Lighty. Finally, and most importantly, the deal it announced Wednesday with the New York Times, where new digital subscribers will receive a year of Spotify Premium for free. Taken together, along with past initiatives like its "elastic" running songs, show the market leader intends to keep pushing the envelope with data — but not with exclusive music content, as founder Daniel Ek has made clear. (Just podcasts, apparently.) APPLE Last year, Apple Music banked heavily on releases exclusive to it, including Frank Ocean's highly anticipated Blonde. However, likely due to an inspired bit of contractual gymnastics on Ocean's part, exclusives were subsequently banned by Universal Music CEO Lucian Grainge. Despite that, Apple executives described platform-specific exclusives like Blonde as working "really well for everybody concerned — they're great for the label, they work for the artist and for us." To that end, it announced that Apple would be the home for Carpool Karaoke, a massively successful segment that started on The Late Late Show With James Corden. (Adele's turn has been viewed 145 million times as of this writing.) This will also, serendipitously, benefit Apple TV. Apple's streaming service, Apple Music, has emerged as Spotify's primary competitor, but from the outside is financially inextricable from other business segments of the Cupertino tech giant; Apple Music's reports are bundled with other "services," like its consumer insurance product AppleCare and Apple Pay. Regardless, it is a success, at least culturally. Apple Music now claims to have 20 million subscribers since launching in June 2015. Its "services" arm was up 22 percent between 2015 and 2016, from $19.9 billion to $24.34 billion. FACEBOOK As anyone who has seen the traffic report from any digital publisher of articles knows, Facebook's dominance of media distribution on the web is near total. As such, even small moves make big waves. And, while "music" wasn't mentioned once in last week's earnings call, the hiring of Tamara Hrivnak last week to lead, as she posted on Faceook, "global music strategy and business development," is a crystal clear indication that it will no longer sit on the sidelines when it comes to music. As Recode reported, Facebook plans to focus more on "high-quality" video. It wouldn't be shocking to see the company partner with video companies (like the music-focused Vevo, for instance) and music rights holders to host longer-form series, like Apple is doing with Carpool Karaoke. GOOGLE YouTube is the world's largest streaming service, by consumption, but remains the black sheep among those services for what the recording business says are lower-than-fair values for their work on it. A source with knowledge of the negotiations described them as routine, despite unrelenting attacks on it last year from various industry stakeholders over a perceived "value gap" between what YouTube pays for music streams versus what music services like Spotify (sometimes referred to as "pure-play" services) return to the recording industry. As a source pointed out to NPR last week, that value gap has been increasing as more people consume more music on the site. YouTube brought on veteran label executive Lyor Cohen in early December as its global Head of Music. AMAZON With the success of Echo and the ease of use between it and the company's own streaming service, Music Unlimited, as well as Amazon's variegated entertainment investments, Jeff Bezos' e-commerce giant will continue to aggressively expand. Enlarge this image Shaquille O'Neal laughs as he tries a pair of Snapchat Spectacles during CES on January 5, 2017 in Las Vegas, Nv. Ethan Miller/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Ethan Miller/Getty Images Shaquille O'Neal laughs as he tries a pair of Snapchat Spectacles during CES on January 5, 2017 in Las Vegas, Nv. Ethan Miller/Getty Images The company launched Amazon Music Unlimited last October, a "full catalog" service aimed at music fans less casual than those wooed by Amazon Prime Music — Prime has a catalog of two million songs, whereas Unlimited includes "tens of millions." "Prime members engaged with the Prime digital benefits at a voracious rate, more than doubling the number of video, music, and reading activities compared to 2015," Amazon writes in its fourth-quarter earnings, released Feb. 2. The company has had an impressive year with its cultural work, winning two Golden Globes and drawing seven Academy Awards nominations, including a Best Picture nod for Manchester By The Sea. WARNER MUSIC GROUP In its earnings call on Feb. 7 Warner Music — which is owned by Len Blavatnik's Access Industries — says it made $1 billion from streaming in 2016 (as much as YouTube paid the industry worldwide that year), and pointed to new music from Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran as key to its revenues in the coming year. It also cited, as mentioned above, virtual and augmented reality and high-resolution music as promising new sources of revenue over the coming year and beyond. Warner Music reports it made 8.1 percent more from records than it did over the same period in 2015, with $917 million in total revenue, $311 million of which came from streaming services. SONY CORP. Sony Corp., which owns both major label Sony Music (home of Adele and Beyoncé, among many many others) and Sony/ATV, the world's largest music publishing company (responsible for administering and exploiting compositions, which are legally separate from the sound recordings that record labels, like Sony Music, sell) reported sales down slightly in its third quarter, to $1.49 billion. That the company is about to get a new CEO — Rob Stringer, who is moving up from the reins of Columbia — after many years of being run by a legacy executive will no doubt bring fundamental change to the company. Sony Music's recorded music revenue dropped 12.8 percent between 2015 and 2016, to $990 million. Of that, $364 million was generated by streaming services. Sony's music operations were helped this past quarter not by music sales but rather thanks to a video game, Fate/Grand Order. (That the company folded animation and mobile video games into music is a little strange, and seems to do little more than obfuscate the health of its music operations.) SNAP INC. While the relationship between an amorphous social platform like Snapchat and music may seem tangential, a tech company worth tens of billions and that holds the attention of 150 million young eyes daily, and with a nascent hardware business to boot, will inevitably interact with music, as any youth-oriented concern must. (In fact, founder Evan Spiegel, as the hack of Sony Corp. revealed, had expressed interest in starting his own record label.) In a 118,000-word filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Snap Inc., the recently formed parent company of social media platform Snapchat, explained itself — even its famously inscrutable app — ahead of an initial public offering. Notably, it writes that "Snap Inc. is a camera company," and defines Snapchat itself as a "camera application." (The only camera it has released for sale are a pair of well-reviewed "Spectacles," released surreptitiously in vending machines in Los Angeles and New York.) It is, of course, more than that. Cost of revenue, which includes licensing deals for content from publishers like BuzzFeed as well as failed content partnerships like the one it cancelled with Warner Music Group, was about $451 million in 2016. The company as a whole posted a net loss last year of $514 million. Spiegel stands to make $3.7 billion from his 227 million shares once the company goes public — plenty of money to play with. (And, not for nothing, the former CEO of Sony Entertainment, parent of Sony Music, is now the chairman of Snap Inc.'s board.)

MacRumors obtained a note from the reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who writes that Apple is developing wireless charging features for three iPhones to be released in 2017. Kuo doesn’t say exactly how Apple plans to implement wireless charging. The company already uses wireless charging for the Apple Watch, so it’s very possible we’ll end up seeing something similar to that — it’s the kind of wireless charging we’ve seen on Android phones for years. But Bloomberg reported last year that Apple is working on “cutting-edge” wireless charging tech that may be able to power devices at a distance, so there’s some possibility Apple is looking to do more. The iPhone might see some big changes this year Though he doesn’t seem to touch on it in this note, Kuo has previously laid out what he expects from the three different iPhone models. All three will receive a new design, with Apple returning to a glass front and back for the phones. Two models are expected to succeed the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, maintaining the models’ 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LCD displays. And the third model will be a higher end device, with a 5.8-inch curved OLED display. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus review More From The Verge The Hawai’ian volcano that created a spectacular firehose of lava just collapsed Apple, Facebook, Google, and 94 others file opposition to Trump's immigration ban Google’s Super Bowl ad accidentally set off a lot of Google Homes Lady Gaga opened her Super Bowl performance with a protest anthem Trump is turning Elon Musk into a crony capitalist Why the sounds of eating make some people so angry Now Trending Congressman is righteously booed after dodging a young girl’s simple question about science Android’s convenient Instant Tethering is now rolling out to Pixel and Nexus devices First photo of Magic Leap prototype leaks This Article has a component height of 9.

Buy this photo Dan Wheat/Capital PressChris Schlect, president of Northwest Horticultural Council, Yakima, Wash. YAKIMA, Wash. — It was a spring day in 1980. Chris Schlect, a 29-year-old deputy prosecuting attorney for Yakima County, looked forward to a career in private practice, maybe eventually becoming a judge. That day at the local bar association luncheon he sat next to a distinguished, white-haired gentleman who appeared to be about 70 and looked every bit like a judge. That chance meeting marked a turning point in Schlect’s career. The white-haired gentleman was Ernest Falk, a former assistant U.S. attorney who in 1947 had become the first president of the new Northwest Horticultural Council, an organization set up with the broad purpose of handling trade, transportation and other issues confronting the burgeoning tree fruit industry in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. “He told me he worked on trade and federal issues, and I thought that was fairly interesting,” Schlect said. Falk learned that Schlect grew up on an orchard west of town, obtained his law degree from Gonzaga University and was involved in policy issues in his work for the county. Nearing retirement, Falk was looking for someone to take his place and asked Schlect to apply. Part of the appeal for Schlect was the opportunity to travel. Schlect would follow in Falk’s footsteps to become president of the Horticultural Council — known by its initials, NHC. For more than 36 years he has advocated on behalf of the tree fruit industry in the halls of Congress and before federal agencies and helped negotiate the creation of the World Trade Organization, laying out the ground rules for international trade. Schlect, now 65, is retiring at the end of March. The transition Falk had been NHC president for 33 years. A big part of his job had involved freight rates charged for Washington apples that were shipped overseas and domestically by rail. The domestic part was lessened by deregulation during the late 1970s. When Schlect became president in October, 1980, he was initially worried there might not be enough to do. It was a one-person office, and Falk stayed on for a year of transition. “Compared to being a deputy prosecutor, it was very quiet,” Schlect said. But he could see lots of potential and with the election of Ronald Reagan as president in 1980, it wasn’t long before the pace picked up. Overarching issue International trade issues were developing and the relatively new Environmental Protection Agency would become more active, but immigration was the overarching issue. Schlect spent several years working on what would become the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. “It was many of the same issues we have now, taking care of the people already here and seeing if it was at all possible to have a guestworker program,” he said. Schlect became involved in the Farm Labor Alliance, mainly driven by California agriculture, that put forth a guestworker program known as the Panetta-Morrison amendment, named for Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., and Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash., who represented Schlect’s home district. A variation of the amendment was adopted, also allowing preferential legalization for farmworkers without criminal records. “Many people now foremen and retired were legalized in that. Yes, it was amnesty and people don’t like that word but to move millions of people out of the country is a tremendous undertaking and disruptive socially,” Schlect said. “There was high expectation we would gain control of the border and we did not, so people view it as a failure but a number of laws were improved,” he said. One improvement requires immigration enforcement officers to have probable cause to apprehend suspected illegal immigrants. With Donald Trump now president, Schlect predicts immigration enforcement will increase. But he also said federal agencies must cease their hostility to the H-2A visa guestworker program, which in turn needs a more realistic way to set the minimum wages. Legal work status is needed for illegal immigrants who have not committed other crimes, he added. He’s optimistic it can happen. “If the U.S. government can control the southern border and there’s not a lot of people flooding over, I think public emotion on the issue will die down,” he said. Respectful approach In industry meetings over several decades, Schlect has built a reputation for his calm and reasoned approach. “Anyone in my job has to be diplomatic and forceful. Shippers have strong views that have to be communicated but in a way that’s thoughtful and respectful, not creating more problems,” he said. Thomas E. Stenzel, president and CEO of United Fresh Produce Association, has worked with Schlect 24 years and said he can be diplomatic or aggressive when he needs to be. “He’s one of the smartest guys in the room, but doesn’t wear it on his sleeve,” Stenzel said. In 1995, Stenzel and Schlect sought a California congressman’s support to amend the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act to require produce buyers to pay for produce bought on verbal agreements. “The congressman wasn’t sure his constituents wanted him to vote for it. Chris got very firm. I’m not sure if he pounded the table, but he said it was national legislation and that the congressman needed to put the interest of the nation first. It had the desired effect,” Stenzel said. James R. Cranney Jr., president of the California Citrus Quality Council and former vice president of the U.S. Apple Association, has known Schlect for 20 years and calls him a “seasoned diplomat” and very knowledgeable of the Washington, D.C., political process. “Chris has always been consistent in pointing the way to practical and workable solutions,” Cranney said, “and has an ability to get to the heart of an issue.” Alar scare In 1989, the CBS television program “60 Minutes” broadcast a story on Alar, a chemical plant growth regulator used to keep apples from falling from trees before they were ripe. Alar had been approved by the government for use in 1963, but there was debate over whether it caused cancer. The CBS show resulted in congressional hearings in which actress Meryl Streep spoke against Alar. “It was probably the largest food safety issue in the last 50 years. The industry thought Alar was safe, but people disputed that. Some within the EPA felt it could be pulled if there were stronger laws,” Schlect said. A philosophical debate over the nature of regulations and chemicals followed. It was a major national story for several months and the biggest crisis NHC and the Washington Apple Commission had faced. Apple prices and sales tanked. USDA estimated Washington apple growers lost at least $125 million in the six months after the initial uproar. Apples were dumped on the ground. Sales suffered even after the manufacturer voluntarily removed Alar from the market. Growers then lost a $250 million class-action lawsuit against “60 Minutes.” “It was a perception problem. People like me found it hard to explain. It was an intense time. Plenty of us were lying in bed at night with our eyes on the ceiling,” Schlect said. It led, in part, to NHC hiring its first vice president of scientific affairs, respected chemist Wally Ewart. NAFTA and TPP In 1994 Schlect worked for passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. It was controversial because manufacturing jobs would go to Mexico, but it increased U.S. agricultural exports there by eliminating tariffs that ranged as high as 20 percent. Few Washington apples were sold to Mexico before NAFTA. Now Mexico is the No. 1 export market for U.S. apples, buying roughly 10 million, 40-pound boxes, worth about $200 million annually. Mexico has reimposed tariffs during anti-dumping cases, but NAFTA outlines the procedures for resolution. President Trump plans to renegotiate NAFTA. “I don’t think the administration wants to shut down trade with Canada and Mexico but will negotiate a new, better deal. It’s our opportunity to improve our technical access and we want to be part of that,” Schlect said. He believes Trump’s cancellation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership is not a big loss for Northwest tree fruit. It had some benefits but included no big new markets or tariff reductions for apples, he said. The gain was more strategic to offset China’s influence in the region than for trade. The new administration wants bilateral agreements with the 11 other TPP countries, and NHC plans to work toward that, he said. WTO and trade The World Trade Organization, an intergovernmental organization regulating international trade, was created by 123 countries in 1994. It replaced the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which had been in force since 1948. WTO provides a framework for negotiating trade agreements and resolving disputes. At the time, Schlect was a member of the Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee of U.S. Trade Representative and USDA. In that position, he was involved in negotiations in Europe that set up WTO. Schlect has now been on the committee for about 30 years. “Most of the other ag sector advisers, like dairy and soybeans, were there to protect their commodities and were dealing with tariffs,” he said. “I had a different perspective along with few others. Phytosanitary issues were potentially more important to our industries.” They worked on the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures segment of the agreement, which allowed countries to set their own sanitation standards for pests and pathogens but required they be based on internationally accepted science. It’s proven to be a useful section of international law and an achievement he’s most proud of. Being on the advisory committee has enabled him to raise issues important to tree fruit. However, not all trade issues were solved. For example, Israel, Europe and Russia all still pose access problems. Other issues The 1990s were busy not only with trade agreements and the WTO, but unanimous congressional passage of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. It tightened controls on the registration of agricultural chemicals. Schlect helped form and served as chairman of the Minor Crop Farmer Alliance, which worked to have the act include registration of chemicals for minor crops. The alliance still works with the EPA to resolve issues facing chemical use on minor crops. For the past five years, NHC has also been trying to ameliorate burdensome elements of the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011. Complicated and costly testing of orchard water strikes many as overkill, and there’s hope the Trump administration will roll back such regulations, Schlect said. There have been many other issues NHC has worked on during Schlect’s tenure, including saving the fumigant methyl bromide for cherry exports, access for U.S. apples to China, keeping other markets open and industry opposition to genetically modified apples developed in Canada. Sometimes, NHC gets involved in getting specific truckloads of apples moving again when they are stuck at a border because of paperwork problems. NHC has an export manual open to the public on its website that lists minimum pesticide residue level requirements and tariffs for imported tree fruit by country. Future of NHC For 70 years, NHC has represented the Northwest tree fruit industry on transportation, trade, legislation and regulations. During that time, the organization has only had two presidents. “I don’t know of any other trade association that can say just two people have been at the helm over 70 years. Hopefully that’s a sign of stability and not senility,” Schlect quipped. He’s enjoyed his career and believes it was tailor-made for him. His appreciation of the hard work of raising tree fruit came from growing up on the family orchard that’s still run by two of his brothers, Neal and Kurt. He says his law degree, public policy interest and love of travel also made a good fit. He says he has every confidence in his successor, Mark Powers, 54, NHC vice president for the past 18 years, who has a background in trade an international policy. He also has high regard for Kate Woods, 32, hired two years ago as another vice president, for her experience as an aide to Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., before he retired. NHC has grown to a staff of seven and operates on an annual budget of $1.46 million, funded 40 percent by the Washington Apple Commission, 25 percent by the Washington State Tree Fruit Association, 13 percent by the Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission, 12 percent by the Fresh Pear Marketing Committee, 5 percent by the Washington State Fruit Commission and smaller amounts from Columbia Gorge Fruit Growers, Oregon Sweet Cherry Commission and Idaho Apple Commission. It was ingenious of the industry to fund NHC so staff could concentrate on issues and not have to fund raise, Schlect says. The Apple Commission occasionally talks about reducing its NHC funding, but Schlect hopes it continues. Schlect continues to believe face-to-face interaction with federal officials is always better than letter-writing. Overall the Northwest tree fruit industry has improved in growing, storing, packing and marketing fruit and has become more sophisticated in meeting the challenges facing it, he says. “I’m grateful I’ve spent my career in a dynamic industry...,” he said. box Retirement reception Northwest Horticultural Council will hold a public reception for Chris Schlect from 2 to 5 p.m. March 31 at the Yakima Country Club. Schlect and his wife, Janet, will be honored. They have three children and four grandchildren.

The special model will reportedly be called the iPhone 8, and despite the hefty price tag people will likely buy it. Apple’s special 10th anniversary iPhone could cost over $1,000 Topping $1,000 for an iPhone sounds pretty steep, but it’s totally plausible. The 256 GB iPhone 7 Plus costs $969, so moving to a slightly larger display with OLED technology and extra RAM could easily push the cost of the anniversary iPhone above $1,000. According to Fast Company’s sources, Apple is buying up the available OLED display market leaving other phone makers without the parts they need. The iPhone 8 will sport a 5.8-inch OLED display, they say, higher storage capacity, and dual camera lenses. Instead of an aluminum frame, Apple is going with stainless steel, and the back will be glass instead of metal. Apple isn’t, however, going with OLED across the board. The company is reportedly going to release a 4.7-inch iPhone 7s and 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus along side the 5.8-inch iPhone 8. The 7s models will stick with the LCD-based displays Apple currently uses. Insider sources say Apple is working on removing all of the physical buttons from the new iPhone. The Home button will become a touch surface embedded in the display, and the buttons on the sides of the phone will change to touch-sensitive areas, too. They also say Apple is sticking with its fall release schedule, so we won’t see the 7s, 7s Plus, or 8 models before September. It sounds like much of Fast Company’s information is coming from supply chain sources, which makes it interesteding but not necessarily complete. Parts suppliers have limited knowledge of Apple’s plans, and in many cases the information gleaned from their reports is akin to weaving an entire tapestry from a single thread. Apple isn’t talking about its next iPhone refresh yet, which fits with its modus operandi. Still, we are late enough into Apple’s design schedule for planned product details to leak so we’re likely getting a glimpse of at least some of what’s coming this fall.

I’ve been thinking about this topic for a while. I love iBooks, and I think it offers a better reading experience on my iPad than Kindle. By a lot. It’s not even close. But Apple hasn’t been giving iBooks the love it needs to thrive. And the truth is, this started with the DOJ’s successful antitrust suit against Apple. Since Steve Jobs came back to Apple—and since his untimely passing in 2011—Apple has shown that any product or service that’s not important to the top leadership will languish, fall by the wayside, and eventually get dumped. What I think happened with iBooks is that executives were furious with the DOJ’s obscene pursuit of Apple in the face of Amazon’s predatory monopoly in the ebook space. That fury, and the controls imposed on Apple in the wake of its conviction, naturally sapped interest in ebooks. There are plenty of things for Apple’s tiny leadership team to focus on, and iBooks just isn’t getting the love. iBooks Strengths There are a number of ways where iBooks is a great ebook platform. The number one is reading experience. From page turning to page numbers to highlighting and notes to general interface, iBooks beats Kindle on iPad hands down. Apple has also done a great job with enhanced versions of popular books. The Song of Ice and Fire and the Harry Potter series have both gotten some enhanced love. On the other hand, Apple needs more enhanced editions. At the same time, if there already are more such enhanced iBooks, Apple needs to do a better job of promoting that. A Feast for Crows Enhanced Edition on iBooks iBooks is also great when it comes to managing my library. I can easily decide which devices get auto-downloads, and I can shop on whichever device works best for me. Amazon does a good job of making Kindle books available, but the company’s device management sucks butt. Big butt. Lastly, I enjoy Apple’s iBooks promo emails. They’re gorgeous and enticing. The company’s sales and book collections are good, too, but I’d like to see more of them. iBooks Store Sucks for Self-Publishing The absolute biggest weakness iBooks has is that it’s not a good platform for self publishers. No, that’s not strong enough. iBooks is a terrible platform for self publishers. For every author—fiction or non-fiction—who uses or likes iBooks—there are dozens who hate it, don’t bother with it, or worse, don’t even think about it. For instance, Mr. Steinberg mentioned that iBooks Author has languished. And it has. It makes beautiful books, but it’s a pain in the ass to use. I’ve experienced this myself, and I’ve heard other people complain about it, too. Just this week I spoke to a teacher who told me her private school had abandoned iBooks for an epub platform. They did so in part because iBooks Author wasn’t meeting their needs. And while I’m mentioning that, said move had the ancillary effect of the school allowing Surface devices in for their 1:1 student/device initiative. No longer being tied to iBooks for content created by the school meant that students didn’t need to be tied to iPads. That’s just one story, but I’m fairly confident that at this moment, few people are happy with iBooks Author. And few authors care about the platform. Daniel Steinberg also referenced reporting tools for self-publishing authors, and iBooks lags far, far behind Amazon and even third-party sites like Gum Road. I’d never heard of Gum Road, but according to Mr. Steinberg, that’s a better platform for self publishing than iBooks. Come on, Apple. It is imperative that Apple make iBooks the premier platform for self-publishing. Apple should have the best publishing tools, the best reporting, and the best promotional tools for the growing legions of self-publishing authors out there. Shopping for iBooks Shopping on iBooks is another place that needs improving. I’ve often found it hard to find every book by an author. iBooks does a bad job of mixing in second-language versions of a book in with English versions. It’s not that I don’t think other languages should get love, but Apple needs to give us better ways to sort iBooks. By series, by date, by title, by language, by rating…come on, Apple! Where are my sorting options? Big Picture Selling ebooks isn’t particularly easy. Goodness knows. And I’m not arguing that Apple has forgotten iBooks entirely, but it is languishing. It needs an evangelist with the power to do what needs to be done to make iBooks great. It doesn’t have to be the biggest ebook platform, but it needs to be the best. And that includes catering to self-publishing authors. I’m personally invested in iBooks, and I don’t want to see it get iWorked/iLifed/AirPorted/Displayed/Mac Proed. Unfortunately, there’s no magic button to flip to make Tim Cook and Phil Schiller care more about its success, but I hope they find that caring anyway.

This supports the idea that Apple needs a restructuring. This one line top down management form worked when Apple made just computers. It does not work with a multi platform company. Apple needs to restructure into a group of sub equal companies, each focussed on their product. A Mac group that has as its top priority the making the best Macs. Another group for Phones. Another group for iPads. another group for online services and stores. Finally a group who’s raison d’être is to make Apple software the best in the world. From Pages, to Photos, to Books, they would live and breathe keeping Apple software great. This would end the absurd wait while the Apple board focuses on doing something great with the iPhone and lets the Mac desktops languish. No more would Apple management be concentrating so hard on things like the Apple Watch while software gets older and more dated. Apple is just too big for one single management team. Multitasking requires multiple teams running multiple companies. Apple needs to follow the structure of General Electric, or General Dynamics. February 9, 2017 at 11:06 EST AM renaldo February 9, 2017 I agree with the basic premise of this article, but disagree with many of the points the author makes. Apple screwed up royally with its behind-closed-door pricing agreements with the publishers–specifically to close out Amazon: this was predatory monopolistic behavior in the classic 19th century sense. No matter how you try to set up Amazon as the bad guy here, it’s simply not going to work in this case. In an open market society, Amazon is at liberty to set its prices according to its own markets (and customers). And in any case, I highly doubt Apple walked away being offended from this legal slap in the face, this is not the reason why iBooks has languished. iBooks is having problems because Apple has completely acquiesced to publisher pricing for ebooks, making their products too expensive for high-volume consumption. Apple didn’t learn from its success with iTunes, where Jobs was able to force the hand of music publishers in setting prices. It’s not hard for consumers like me to do comparison shopping, and to see that Amazon has a much larger selection, and almost always lower prices, than Apple’s iBook Store. I’m a huge Apple fan, and would much prefer buying from them, but Amazon is simply doing a *much* better job making Kindle a superior platform. The author of this article is also mostly wrong about touting the technical superiority of iBooks, that’s simply not the case. iBooks does a *much* poorer job consistently synchronizing between Apple devices, for example. Like the Siri vs Alexa debate, Apple is flat out losing to Amazon with ebooks, and the numbers show this. As long as Apple acts as a passive servant to publisher demands, their iBook platform will languish. They either need to pull *way* ahead of Amazon in terms of being a superior product with iBooks, or they will need to have to buck the publisher stranglehold on exorbitant pricing. February 9, 2017 at 4:12 EST PM Андрій Алєксєєв February 10, 2017 iBooks does a bad job of mixing in second-language versions of a book in with English versions. As far as I know from my author’s experience, this is not Apple’s intention. iBooks Store does not have a built-in translation engine for search terms—which would be nice in some cases actually. The mixing in second-language versions is taking place only because of keywords that tricky authors use to describe their books. But you are absolutely right, there is definite lack of sorting options on iBooks Store. And there is no suitable workflow to sell bilingual books, for instance. Thank you for sharing your thoughts Bryan, it’s a good article. February 10, 2017 at 1:37 EST PM Андрій Алєксєєв February 10, 2017 In response to renaldo: It’s not hard for consumers like me to do comparison shopping, and to see that Amazon has a much larger selection, and almost always lower prices, than Apple’s iBook Store. I’m a huge Apple fan, and would much prefer buying from them, but Amazon is simply doing a *much* better job making Kindle a superior platform. This is not actually true. I cannot set the price £0.49 on my small books for kids on Amazon, they should be at least £1.49 ‘due of operational costs’. But I can do it on iBooks Store. Also online preview for the Kindle Edition displayed incorrectly, compare with clean screenshots on iBooks Store. February 10, 2017 at 3:50 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

For Apple, solar energy is serious business. It is committed to operating all its stores, offices, and data centers with clean, renewable energy. This week, the company confirmed plans to expand the amount of installed solar power in the state of Nevada by 200 megawatts. The electricity will be used to power Apple’s massive data center located in Reno. The local utility, NV Energy, is a partner in the expansion. The deal includes the ability to sell up to 5 megawatts of any excess power generated by the new solar installation to other residential and commercial customers in the area using NV Energy’s grid infrastructure. Last year, Apple created a new entity called Apple Energy specifically to market any excess power its solar panels generate to other companies and individuals. That plan was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Administration. Apple’s vice president for environment, policy and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, told the press after the announcement, “Investing in innovative clean energy sources is vital to Apple’s commitment to reaching, and maintaining, 100 percent renewable energy across all our operations. Our partnership with NV Energy helps assure our customers their iMessages, FaceTime video chats and Siri inquiries are powered by clean energy, and supports efforts to offer the choice of green energy to Nevada residents and businesses.” The time table to complete the new Apple solar energy installation is 2019. What Apple is doing in Nevada is in line with its efforts to use renewable energy for its operations in China. It currently has 200 megawatts of power online in that country which is used to supply its 34 stores and 19 offices in the country. The renewable energy eliminates 20 million metric tons of  greenhouse gas pollution that would otherwise occur from Apple’s operations in China over the next 4 years. “Climate change is one of the great challenges of our time, and the time for action is now,” says Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “The transition to a new green economy requires innovation, ambition and purpose.” And lots of money. Apple fortunately can afford to make the investment in clean energy. According to CNN, it has also begun investing in wind turbines in China to supplement the electricity it gets from solar panels.

Kevin Kusatsu & Andrew McInnes, Founders, TMWRK Methodology: A committee of Billboard editors and reporters weighed a variety of factors in determining the Power 100 rankings, including but not limited to: impact on consumer behavior, as measured by metrics such as chart performance, social media impressions and radio and TV audiences reached; company growth; career trajectory; reputation among peers; and overall impact in the industry. Where required, record-label market share was calculated using Nielsen Music U.S. total album plus track-equivalent album (TEA) sales, and U.S. current album plus TEA market share, which Billboard computed using Nielsen Music data. Unless otherwise noted, Billboard Boxscore and Nielsen Music are the sources for tour grosses and sales and streaming data, respectively.

In Jonathan Morrison's newest video, titled BeatsX Wireless vs Apple AirPods, the YouTuber has discovered that all purchases of BeatsX come with a code for three free months of Apple Music, akin to users getting another free trial period of Apple's streaming music service. To get the three months of free Apple Music, all users will have to do is register their new BeatsX Earphones on the official Beats By Dre website and enter the code that comes in the box. In the video, Morrison also discusses what he likes about the time he's spent with BeatsX, including the ease of connectivity with the W1 chip and iCloud connectivity. The biggest advantage over the AirPods, according to Morrison, is the in-line remote control on BeatsX, which provide tangible buttons for volume and playback. On AirPods, users have to invoke Siri or use an iPhone or Apple Watch for these controls. A few other unboxing and impressions videos were posted today, including one with a closer look at the traveling case included in the box posted by YouTube channel UrAvgConsumer. The video also takes a look at comparing BeatsX to other earphones with similar neck straps, as well as putting the new earphones to the test in terms of audio quality by listening to a variety of different genres. With a launch tomorrow, interested users don't have to wait much longer to get their hands on BeatsX. The earphones will launch for $149.95 on Apple.com, in Apple retail stores, as well as at other retailers.

Rating: 3 Votes oneMadRssn 2 days ago at 09:59 am The reviews were very informative. I'm a bit disappointed at how neck-band the BeatsX look. I hate the neck-band wireless earphones, and I was really hoping the BeatsX would more like the jaybirds with a more natural way they sit. But from these vidoes, even though that middle part is flexible, it still looks stiff enough to give them that neck-band look.

When I redeemed it in the store it asked if I wanted to use the credit towards 3 months of Apple Music or just $29.xx in iTunes credit to use on anything in the iTunes store. So if you have no interest in Apple Music, it's basically a free $30 iTunes gift card.

The current iPhones aren't helping Apple gain market share in China, according to Canalys. Markets like China and India are at the top of Apple's agenda to grow the iPhone business. China accounts for a third of worldwide smartphone shipments. Buyers in the market are leaning toward local brands like Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi, which formed the top four smartphone vendors in China in 2016, according to Canalys. Apple was in the fifth spot, and Samsung doesn't figure in the top five. In 2016, Apple's phone shipments in China totaled 43.8 million units, a drop of 18.2 percent compared to 2015. It's not looking any better for Apple in 2017. "This year, the outlook remains bleak for Apple to get its China performance back to its heyday of 2015," said Jessie Ding, a research analyst at Canalys. The decline in China hit Apple's worldwide shipments hard, with a net effect of about a 7 percent decline in the number of iPhones shipped globally, Ding said. But the Chinese buyers are "awaiting the 10th anniversary of the iPhone with very high expectations," Ding said. The iPhone 8 may succeed, but it may not change a long-term trend of Chinese smartphone buyers buying local brands. In many smaller Chinese cities, Huawei, Vivo, and Oppo smartphones are selling well. Those companies are also investing heavily in branding in top-tier cities, posing a further threat to Apple, Ding said. Apple faces a similar problem in India. The iPhone brand awareness is limited to urban areas, and the handsets are priced too high for most of the population. Apple recently made a move to start assembling smartphones in India. Many Chinese companies are launching new handsets this year with a focus on cameras and screens. One such smartphone is Huawei's Mate 9 Pro, which was shown at CES. Huawei -- known for networking gear -- also makes its own chips, like Apple and Samsung. Other Chinese brands like LeEco are also emerging and growing internationally. LeEco has particularly interesting smartphone designs. The company came out with a smartphone without a headphone jack ahead of Apple. It's a tight race among the top three Chinese smartphone makers. Huawei in 2016 shipped 76.2 million units, Oppo shipped 73.2 million units, and Vivo about 63.2 million units. Xiaomi's market share tumbled, declining by 21 percent to 51.4 million units. A survey released by IDC this week also noted a down market for iPhone in China, but placed the company in the fourth spot, ahead of Xiaomi. According to IDC, total smartphone shipments in China were 467 million units in 2016, growing by 8.7 percent. But Apple's shipments declined by 23.2 percent that year, totaling 44.9 million units. The top three Chinese smartphone makers were Oppo, Huawei, and Vivo, according to IDC. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

How sleep tracking, cellular, and an always-on display could be major improvements Zac Hall - Feb. 9th 2017 8:13 am PT @apollozac Apple Watch watchOS Apple Watch Series 3 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 both address a major flaw of the first-generation model with significant speed improvements, and all Apple Watches benefit from a performance boost and a simpler interface with watchOS 3. So what’s next for Apple Watch and watchOS this year? Let’s take a look at some of the next opportunities for Apple Watch (and a few rumors) that may tell us what Apple could be planning. Apple sharpened its focus on fitness and health with Apple Watch Series 2 and watchOS 3. Adding a GPS improved outdoor running, cycling, and walking exercise tracking, stronger waterproofing enabled swim tracking, and the display brightness increased which dramatically improved legibility in sunlight. watchOS 3 also added Activity Sharing to bring a little competition to meeting daily fitness goals, and a new Breathe app introduced the concept of mindful minutes and meditation with Apple Watch. A supply chain report out of Asia earlier this year claimed Apple is planning to introduce a third-generation Apple Watch later this fall with a focus on improved battery life. Apple Watch Series 2 owners will be quick to tell you battery life has improved since the first-gen model, however, so improving battery efficiency could be used for a number of things other than extending battery life. Longer use between charge times is still a possibility, of course, as most users including myself charge nightly. Other sports watches and smart watches are less powerful and capable but offer extended use time between charges. Charging every two or three days is helpful, but I’m more interested personally in what Apple could do with more efficient battery life in general.   Some version of an always-on display is my most wanted feature. Apple Watch looks fine with the display off, but traditional watches are still superior at just presenting the time without delay no matter how precise Apple Watch may be. Apple’s raise-to-wake wrist detection works well, but showing the static time without animations or the rest of the watch face would both be a cool effect and a practical improvement. Further emphasizing the health tracking space, built-in sleep tracking remains a major opportunity for Apple Watch today. There are watchOS apps on the App Store like Sleep++ and AutoSleep that enable sleep tracking from Apple Watch and feed data into Apple’s Health app on iPhone, but Apple doesn’t support sleep tracking from Apple Watch with its own app yet (just from the Clock app on iOS). Sleep tracking with Apple Watch means charging during the day. Charging is pretty quick (roughly two hours from zero to full) and wouldn’t take as long if going from 50% to 100% if battery life was that good. The hardware needs to be right and watchOS 4 would need its own sleep tracking software, but Apple’s new Theater Mode in watchOS 3.2 is already addressing the whole display coming on at night issue for sleep trackers. Apple has also been rumored to be developing an upgraded heart rate app on watchOS. The new version reportedly analyzes the time it takes to fall from peak to resting heart rate as an additional fitness measure. New Apple Watch features like additional workout tracking could rely on the same sensors we have today and be introduced through watchOS 4. Something that was briefly rumored for Apple Watch Series 2 but didn’t make the cut is cellular connectivity. There are versions of Android Wear watches that already feature LTE radios for cellular connectivity, but Apple is taking its time with introducing the additional radio to its hardware. How useful cellular may be relies largely on the software running on Apple Watch. If software could rely on cellular data to refresh and run independent of iPhone, apps like Pokémon Go could potentially become standalone games on Apple Watch rather than companion apps that rely on iPhone.  It would also be super useful to be able to stream Apple Music, sync podcasts, and send and receive iMessages and phone calls from Apple Watch without iPhone. Apple Watch Series 2 adds GPS which is mainly used for mapping outdoor workouts, but you can use it with pre-loaded maps including navigation (in case your iPhone dies). Apple Watch could match what iPhones can do with maps and navigation if cellular were an option. Cellular is also something that significantly improved battery efficiency could help enable. Android Wear watches can experiment and try different things, but Apple Watch will likely want to at least match its current battery life. I could see Apple doing both cellular and non-cellular versions of Apple Watch just like today we have Series 1 without GPS and Series 2 with GPS, but a big question mark is how you would be charged for cellular data and if it would be something worth paying for monthly. Regardless of what new sensors and radios Apple Watch adds this year, I’m willing to bet that Apple introduces new bands and case finishes this year especially if the case design remains mostly unchanged. Apple Watch Nike+ introduced a unique version of the Sport band and other existing bands saw new color options last year, but Woven Nylon was the only totally new band from Apple. Case finishes were also unchanged aside from Apple Watch Edition dropping gold and rose gold for white ceramic. Apple could introduce pricier titanium models and cheaper polycarbonate models that create new looks and price points compared to the current lineup of aluminum, stainless steel, and ceramic models. Finally, something we haven’t heard rumored lately but was once reported is a built-in FaceTime camera. Adding video calling to Apple Watch seems inevitable as a futuristic communication device. You can already make phone calls and dictate text messages, but video calling could be convenient and personal in certain scenarios. A bigger display is usually better, for example, but I find that I video call more often from my iPhone since it’s with me more often. Other changes that could come with software include more capable apps, improving music and audio controls, and even third-party watch faces using Apple’s watch hands as a template. Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 debuted alongside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September so it’s possible we could see their successors (Apple Watch Series 3?) later this fall around the same time.

Rumor has it that the company is going to conduct an event next month to unveil new iPads. According to a report, the 12.9 inch iPad Pro is getting harder to come across as supply has dried up. This is normally taken as an indication that a new model is in the pipeline and is due to arrive in the very near future. Apple has obviously said nothing about its tablet plans for 2017 at this point in time. However, it’s easy to imagine that the company might come out with new iPads next month since they are long overdue and the company has often launched new tablets in the month of March. The report mentions that the 12.9 inch iPad Pro is seeing shipping estimates ship to 2-3 weeks in key markets like the United States, Australia, France, Canada, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and others. The shipping estimate was at 1-2 weeks just last weekend. Additional checks of in-store inventory suggest that the stocks are depleting fast and there’s no indication that new shipments are coming in to restock the 12.9 iPad Pro, which is one of the tablets that Apple is expected to replace this year with a new model. Apple CEO Tim Cook did say recently that there are exciting times up ahead for the iPad so fans of the tablet are certainly interested in finding out what the company has in store for them. Apple is yet to confirm an event for next month in which it will unveil the new iPads. The company is expected to launch a new 10.5 inch iPad Pro along with refreshed models of the 9.7 inch and 12.9 inch iPad Pro. Filed in Apple >Tablets. Read more about iPad and ipad pro.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 9, 2017 at 10:18AM Back in October of 2016, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released much-needed refreshes of its MacBook Pro product line. Thanks to the launch of these new systems, Apple broke the long losing streak that its Mac business had been seeing, and reported 1.1% year-over-year Mac unit growth, as well as roughly 7% Mac revenue growth in its most recent quarter, implying a boost in Mac average selling prices. Although the numbers clearly speak for themselves, there's one more bit of information that Apple disclosed on its most recent earnings call that points to positive customer reception of the company's new MacBook Pro systems. Apple's newest MacBook Pro. Image source: Apple. Supply constraints curbed growth Apple CEO Tim Cook said that that Apple was "supply constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December quarter and is just now coming into supply/demand balance" for the systems. Additionally, CFO Luca Maestri offered some commentary about the company's Mac channel inventory dynamics, saying that the company "ended the quarter at the low end of [Apple's] four to five week target range for Mac channel inventory." Apple sells many different Mac products besides the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar -- including the older discounted MacBook Pro models, MacBook Air, 12-inch MacBook, and iMac -- so even though Apple apparently ended the quarter within its target channel inventory range, channel inventory levels of the new MacBook Pro systems may have been at lower levels. What's next for the Mac? Apple has a reasonable shot of continuing to outperform the broader personal computer market again, especially if it gets back to putting out new/refreshed systems at a regular pace. Next up, I expect Apple to refresh its desktop systems. The ones that Apple currently has for sale are now a generation behind in processor technology, so at the very least, the company ought to offer models with the latest chips. The performance boost from the new chips won't be earth-shattering -- generation-on-generation improvements in personal-computer performance are hardly dramatic these days -- but it's easier to market systems with the latest processors than it is to try to market ones with previous-generation processors, especially when the competition has moved to the newer ones. I also expect Apple to refresh the 12-inch MacBook system soon. The current models use older processors, so at the very least, a processor upgrade is in order. Once again, this is not the sort of thing that's going to be fundamentally game changing, but a better, faster system should be easier to sell. After those systems are updated, I expect Apple to go back and update the MacBook Pro lineup again. I don't expect significant changes like the ones the company brought with the ones launched back in October 2016, but improved processor technology, and perhaps a larger battery, could make for a "good enough" upgrade. Apple doesn't need to deliver "revolutionary" Mac products to the market to do reasonably well -- the company's brand power, its reputation for excellent customer support, and perhaps even the strength of macOS relative to Windows, to some potential buyers should be enough to allow the company to at least perform with the market, if not steadily gain share. However, as we saw in the last year, if Apple doesn't regularly refresh its product line, keeping it stale in an already muted personal-computer market, then there will be less incentive for current Mac owners to upgrade, and it will become harder to convince Windows users to switch over. For the sake of Apple's Mac business, let's hope that the company has plans for annual product refreshes to keep things interesting.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(AAPL) Stock Target Was Upped Again APPL stock continues to show room to run for investors By ValueWalk  |  Feb 9, 2017, 10:06 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Target Was Upped Again Why is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Stock So Expensive? (BRK.A, BRK.B) Apple Inc. (AAPL) Nears $100 Billion In Debt: What Does This Mean? Recent Posts: Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Target Was Upped Again Apple Inc. (AAPL) Nears $100 Billion In Debt: What Does This Mean? How to Benefit From Alibaba Group Holding Ltd Stock’s Latest Dip (BABA) View All Posts Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock enjoyed healthy gains in the days following the company’s earnings reports, and analysts crooned over the results. But not everyone was so thrilled, with some pointing out the fact that the December quarter had an extra week and others focusing on the challenges being seen in the smartphone market. Nonetheless, analysts are as happy as can be and continue to try to sell investors on the iPhone 8 cycle. At least one analyst has boosted his price target for AAPL stock based on the record iPhone unit number in the December quarter. AAPL Stock Target: $154 Per Share  Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley raised his price target for Apple stock by more than $10 per share, from $142 to $154 per share in a research note dated Feb. 6. He feels the company took a “strong share” of the premium end of the world’s smartphone market during the December quarter, as it generated 92% of profits. That is a decline from 106% of the profits in the September quarter, however, because SAMSUNG ELECTRONIC‘s (SSNLF) profits improved after the Galaxy Note 7 recall. Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones with an average selling price of $695 during its first fiscal quarter as consumers preferred the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus models. Walkley also believes the iPhone maker benefited from the Note 7 recall—although there was some debate about that before the results were released. Apple management said the quarter had the highest quarterly number of switchers from Android, something that third-party data indicated just before the release. The analyst also expects the iPhone 7 lineup to continue doing well, bridging the gap until the iPhone 8 is released, probably in September. Despite Walkley’s (and almost everyone else’s) enthusiasm about Apple stock, Neil George, a contributor for The Street, feels investors are doing nothing more but attending the “church of Apple.” Here’s How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200 Investors dumped Amazon.con, Inc. (AMZN) stock immediately following the retailer’s earnings results (although the shares are up today), but they have been happily slurping up Apple stock. He said the iPhone maker “is faced with a dwindling market share and shrinking margins,” which means it just doesn’t make sense to be so enamored with the company. Meanwhile, Amazon recorded soaring revenues and the seventh consecutive profitable quarter. There’s also new data from Slice Intelligence indicating that the company hoards 53% of all growth in U.S. online sales.

Is Not Releasing the iPhone 8 Early Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Finally Fires Back at Apple With Android Wear 2.0 View All Posts After delaying the release for months, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) finally launched Android Wear 2.0, the new version of its smartwatch operating system. Along with the new OS, which incorporates advanced features like Google Assistant, new Google smartwatch hardware was announced. Made in partnership with LG, the new devices are premium quality, made to take full advantage of Android Wear 2.0 and ready to take on the Apple Watch. Source: Google Here’s what you need to know. Google knows it didn’t exactly hit the ball out of the park when it first released its Android Wear smartwatch OS. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has dominated the smartwatch market since its release and despite an overall cooling for smartwatches in general, it looks as though Apple Watch absolutely destroyed the competition over Christmas. That has to be especially galling to Google, considering the Apple Watch is only compatible with iPhones, while Android Wear smartwatches work with nearly 90% of the smartphones being sold today. And while Apple Watch remains locked into a clunky square watch face, Android Wear supports the traditional, round wristwatch look. Android Wear 2.0 Key Features Google was originally supposed to release Android Wear 2.0 last September, but decided to delay it to this spring. The official announcement landed yesterday afternoon on GOOGL’s blog. What did Google engineers spend the extra time working on? It appears that they had several major goals: improving on the basic features most smartwatch owners use (such as fitness tracking), cutting the cord to a smartphone with LTE support, and making Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches as compatible as possible with the iPhone. Key features Google is showing off include: Improved fitness tracking with Google Fit app LTE support for running apps and making voice calls directly from a smartwatch without requiring connection to a smartphone Google Assistant is integrated Customizable watch face components Google Play access direct from smartwatch Support for hardware control similar to Apple Watch digital crown In particular, the ability for more apps to run independently on Android Wear 2.0 devices — with no need to be connected to a smartwatch — means iPhone users will get almost the same experience as Android phone owners. Assuming GOOGL can convince them to skip the Apple Watch.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Wearables Image Source: Google The 6 best new features of Android Wear 2.0 Mike Wehner @MikeWehner February 8th, 2017 at 3:36 PM Share Tweet Smartwatches have had a rough go of it in their relatively short lives thus far. Sure, the Apple Watch sold well enough that people don’t consider it a total disaster, and enough Android Wear watches are floating around that it seems like at least a few people care, but they’ve hardly been the runaway success that some thought they would be. Always ready for a challenge, Google is doing its best to reinvent its smartwatch platform with the Android Wear 2.0 update, which is finally rolling out after being teased and tested for months. Here’s why it’s a big deal, even if you don’t own a smartwatch (yet). It’s faster than ever Okay, so this is an obvious one, but Android Wear 2.0 makes navigating the interface and launching apps much quicker than it’s been in the past. It still won’t rival your smartphone in terms of boot-up time — that can still take a while, unfortunately — but on-the-go interactions with the watch are now noticeably less bogged down with waiting screens and loading bars. Google Assistant Google Assistant is one of the slickest AI assistants around, so having it on your wrist is pretty much ideal. It works via the same “Ok Google” voice command as it does elsewhere, and can create lists, calendar notifications, and grab directions without having to tap through any menus. Revamped complications Apple Watch devotees blew their collective lids when Apple showed off customizable complications for the first time, and for good reason: Having more information that you actually use on the watch face is never a bad thing. Android Wear 2.0 lets users customize their primary watch screens with calendar alerts, alarms, pedometer data, weather, and other information that requires much less digging than it ever has before. Better messaging Replying to a message without having to take your phone out of your pocket is a pretty huge benefit of owning a smartwatch, but Android Wear’s first attempt at replies was pretty lackluster. In 2.0, replies are both quicker to compose and faster to send thanks to built-in reply buttons for Android Wear-compatible apps, and Google’s handy Smart Reply feature that auto generates possibly replies for you to choose from. Smarter fit For anyone coming to an Android smartwatch from a dedicated fitness band, Google Fit was often lacking smarts. 2.0 sees Fit get a big upgrade. There’s now third party app sharing so that your favorite Android fitness app can play nice with your workout data, and the app is now smarter about knowing when you’ve started working out and when you stop, and has a much better sensor algorithm for figuring out the kind of exercise you’re actually doing, without being told. You don’t need your phone The dream of all smartwatch fans is to eventually have a device that doesn’t even need to be connected to a phone in order to do everything you need it to. Android Wear 2.0 lays the groundwork for that future with support for WiFi and LTE. However, since almost all current Android smartwatches don’t have LTE capabilities — LG’s new Watch Sport is leading the charge in this regard — taking advantage of this feature requires that you invest in an entirely new watch. Still, it’s a promising sign of things to come.

The Mac maker is back to growth after an impressive quarter. Motley Fool Staff Feb 9, 2017 at 10:05AM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) strong earnings beat on January 31 was driven by strong performance across numerous business segments. In this segment from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA discuss the headline numbers and other areas where the company executed well. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017. Dylan Lewis: I doubt that you could possibly be doing as well as Apple is doing this week, though. Evan Niu: [laughs] That's true. Lewis: It's not too often that you see the world's largest company spike 6% after earnings. Niu: Yeah. The numbers they put up, I mean, I was pretty impressed. I wasn't really expecting them to blow it out like this, and beat their own guidance by $400 million. Lewis: Yeah. We always do the Apple earnings show, it's one of my favorites to do. But after several in a row where we've been, like, "Yeah, we know that growth is slow or even declining, but just be patient, we think it's going to be OK," it will be nice to do a show where we can talk about them and have a bit of a rosier outlook on things, and maybe reaffirm some of the confidence that the Street should have in the business. In a lot of ways, it's still a fantastic company. Why don't we start out with a big numbers here? Revenue came in at $78.3 billion, which beat estimates of $77.3 billion. Also beat the company's guidance, like you said, by a couple hundred million. Earnings per share came in at $3.36 for the quarter, which also beat estimates of $3.22. So, for the first time since fiscal Q1 of last year, the company posted year-over-year revenue growth. Niu: Yeah. I think that's one of the big stories. 2016 was so tough on them in terms of storylines and sentiment, because, yeah, first year ever of showing negative growth, and everyone is kind of gloomy about it. Then, they come back and say, "We still have it in us, we can still set records, we can still push all these different parts of the business to these completely record levels," including the Mac, which is crazy, because the Mac has been around for 40 years, and they're still continuing to grow it and push up higher. Lewis: And they've been working against so many headwinds for such a long time in that year. You look at the strong dollar having a pretty sizable impact on the money they make overseas, and also the selling price of devices overseas. You look at the elongating of the upgrade cycle, particularly with some of the wireless carriers moving away from a subsidy model, and getting people off of that two-year upgrade. So, there are just a lot of things pushing against what would normally cause people to be buying phones, or would be allowing them to recognize more in revenue and earnings here in the U.S. So, it's nice to see them bring it back up this quarter.

Thanks to the launch of these new systems, Apple broke the long losing streak that its Mac business had been seeing, and reported 1.1% year-over-year Mac unit growth, as well as roughly 7% Mac revenue growth in its most recent quarter, implying a boost in Mac average selling prices. Although the numbers clearly speak for themselves, there's one more bit of information that Apple disclosed on its most recent earnings call that points to positive customer reception of the company's new MacBook Pro systems. Apple's newest MacBook Pro. Image source: Apple. Supply constraints curbed growth Apple CEO Tim Cook said that that Apple was "supply constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December quarter and is just now coming into supply/demand balance" for the systems. Additionally, CFO Luca Maestri offered some commentary about the company's Mac channel inventory dynamics, saying that the company "ended the quarter at the low end of [Apple's] four to five week target range for Mac channel inventory." Apple sells many different Mac products besides the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar -- including the older discounted MacBook Pro models, MacBook Air, 12-inch MacBook, and iMac -- so even though Apple apparently ended the quarter within its target channel inventory range, channel inventory levels of the new MacBook Pro systems may have been at lower levels. What's next for the Mac? Apple has a reasonable shot of continuing to outperform the broader personal computer market again, especially if it gets back to putting out new/refreshed systems at a regular pace. Next up, I expect Apple to refresh its desktop systems. The ones that Apple currently has for sale are now a generation behind in processor technology, so at the very least, the company ought to offer models with the latest chips. The performance boost from the new chips won't be earth-shattering -- generation-on-generation improvements in personal-computer performance are hardly dramatic these days -- but it's easier to market systems with the latest processors than it is to try to market ones with previous-generation processors, especially when the competition has moved to the newer ones. I also expect Apple to refresh the 12-inch MacBook system soon. The current models use older processors, so at the very least, a processor upgrade is in order. Once again, this is not the sort of thing that's going to be fundamentally game changing, but a better, faster system should be easier to sell. After those systems are updated, I expect Apple to go back and update the MacBook Pro lineup again. I don't expect significant changes like the ones the company brought with the ones launched back in October 2016, but improved processor technology, and perhaps a larger battery, could make for a "good enough" upgrade. Apple doesn't need to deliver "revolutionary" Mac products to the market to do reasonably well -- the company's brand power, its reputation for excellent customer support, and perhaps even the strength of macOS relative to Windows, to some potential buyers should be enough to allow the company to at least perform with the market, if not steadily gain share. However, as we saw in the last year, if Apple doesn't regularly refresh its product line, keeping it stale in an already muted personal-computer market, then there will be less incentive for current Mac owners to upgrade, and it will become harder to convince Windows users to switch over. For the sake of Apple's Mac business, let's hope that the company has plans for annual product refreshes to keep things interesting.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

David A. Graham Feb 10, 2017 Ian Bogost Feb 9, 2017 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Apple has great design is the biggest myth in technology today. The latest victim of this ideology comes in the form a remarkable report on the late Steve Jobs’s final project, still in production: a new, $5 billion Cupertino headquarters for Apple Inc. Writing for Reuters, Julia Love outlines the campus’s “astonishing attention to detail.” Vents and pipes remain obscured from reflection in the structure’s massive, curved-glass façade. Thick guidebooks regulate the usage of wood. Structural seams are held to a standards measuring a fraction of normal construction tolerances. Individual ceiling panels require multi-step approval. A door handle—the project’s first deliverable—is rejected for sub-nanometer imperfections. Even the empty spaces of thresholds are subjected to meticulous attention: One of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold. The construction team pushed back, but Apple held firm. The rationale? If engineers had to adjust their gait while entering the building, they risked distraction from their work, according to a former construction manager. Love compares Apple’s construction design process to that of its product design. The building is meant to be “as flawless as a hand-held device,” she writes, a process supposedly brought about by “treating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics.” The only problem with this conclusion: Apple has never accomplished sufficiently great design in its electronics to justify lionizing the pedantry of design at the new Apple campus. * * * At base, such a claim seems preposterous. In 1977, the Apple II made the microcomputer useful and affordable. In 1984, the Macintosh made the computer more usable by the everyperson thanks to the graphical user interface. In 2001, the iPod fit a music library in a pocket. In 2007, the iPhone made computing portable (and obsessive). Steve Jobs’s design philosophy was fascist more than it was exacting. But if Apple designs at its best when attending closely to details like those revealed in the construction of its spaceship headquarters, then presumably the details of its products would stand out as worthy precedents. Yet, when this premise is tested, it comes up wanting. In truth, Apple’s products hide a shambles of bad design under the perfection of sleek exteriors. Take Apple’s late-2016 MacBook Pro, its latest flagship laptop. The new model ships only with USB-C ports. But all of Apple’s current devices, including the iPhone 7 and a rechargeable Bluetooth keyboard and mouse come with USB-A cables, which cannot connect to the new laptop. A replacement cable can be had— for $20. Over time, this problem will work itself out as USB-C replaces USB-A entirely. But if good design is in the details, why should anyone spending thousands of dollars on a supposedly well-designed machine have to wait on the details? The iPhone is no better off. Starting with the iPhone 5S, first released in 2014, Apple adopted a software-controlled fingerprint sensor mounted on the home button. Known as Touch ID, the feature allows users to authenticate to unlock the phone, download products from the App Store, and make payments at participating retailers with Apple Pay. But even the slightest disturbance on a finger makes Touch ID unreliable. Washed your hands recently? Ate a banana? Dug in the dirt of the garden? Touched something too warm, or too cold, for too long? Good luck authenticating with your fingerprint. A mere inconvenience when unlocking the phone, but Apple Pay won’t work at all without Touch ID. So fat chance using that new digital wallet on a rainy day, or after tactilely interacting with worldly substances. And what about autocorrect? As funny as it once was to guffaw over its foibles, the feature hasn’t become smarter, so much as its users have become more acclimated to managing its errors when writing and reading smartphone-composed messages. How much typing has become retyping, correcting corrections. One of Apple’s solutions to the problem, revealed in a 2016 patent filing: just to punt, highlighting corrected words and inviting an interlocutor to “request clarification.” Likewise, the larger, 4.7-inch screens offered since the 2014 iPhone 6 made reaching the edges of the screen with one palm difficult, even for users with large hands. Apple’s solution, dubbed Reachability, was an awkward one: double-tapping the home button would lurch the whole screen down for easier address. Some Apple fanatics will blame these more recent misfortunes of design on the vacuum created by Steve Jobs’s death. After all, his tight control over the company’s products was legendary. But this explanation isn’t sufficient. After all, Apple’s design chief Jony Ive, who is considered to have taken over Jobs’s design dogmatism, has remained in charge of the company’s design efforts throughout Tim Cook’s tenure as CEO. And moreover, Apple products’ inattention to detail in design was already easy to see during the Jobs era anyway. Take the iPod. It made listening to a whole music library easy, but iTunes always made managing that library difficult and confusing—even destructive. In fact, most Apple software fails to meet the design standard set by the devices on which they run. Mail still can’t search for emails effectively or accurately. On the desktop, iMessage frequently stops working; on the iPhone, it successfully sends less reliably than text messages once did, particularly when reception is poor. Keynote, Apple’s PowerPoint alternative, randomly changes the formatting of text in presentation notes—a charming surprise to discover during an actual keynote. iWork, the Apple office app suite of which Keynote is a part, never came close to competing with Microsoft and Google’s commensurate products, horrid though both of them are, nor even in achieving the elegant simplicity of its ancestors like AppleWorks. The same invisible doorways lead to and from the authorized chambers of work and gardens of leisure. So exacting!   Apple’s Jobs-era hardware also failed to meet the scrupulousness for which it is nevertheless worshipped. In 2010, when the iPhone 4’s antenna design produced reception issues, Jobs famously told impacted users to just to “hold the phone differently.” In 2008, he revealed the first run of the impossibly-thin MacBook Air by sliding it dramatically out of a manila envelope. Amazing! Less so, but not shown: the inch-thick power adapter needed to charge the device. Apple still hasn’t even attempted to reduce the size—and particularly the bulky thickness—of its power supplies, even as it has systematically reduced the girth of its computers. * * * Steve Jobs’s design philosophy was fascist more than it was exacting. The man was a not a demigod of design, but its dictator. He made things get made the way he wanted them made, and his users appreciated his definitiveness and lack of compromise. They mistook those conceits for virtues in the objects themselves. And enjoyed it. At a time when every company bows to even the most absurd demands of the consumer, Apple never cared what its customers thought, or wanted. Instead it told them what to like, and how to like it. What a relief! The corporate design autocracy obviates the need for decision-making. Computer users won’t use floppy disks because there is no floppy drive. Later, likewise optical drives. Later, likewise mini-stereo headphone jacks. To ascribe such choices to design—or to courage—is a mistake. As I have argued before, Apple is expert at getting people to commit to Apple’s future without pondering how technology could have evolved differently. In the process, Apple standardized excellence in design at the surface level, while failing to achieve that distinction holistically. Apple’s products are beautiful objects, no doubt. But beautiful objects whose operation never matched their appearance. Beautiful objects that lied about the depths of that beauty. And in that lie lies an important, if accidental lesson of Apple’s obsessions in the new spaceship officeplex. The attention to detail around door handles and thresholds might feel like a design methodology so pedantic at the micro-level that it could only ever produce greatness at the macro. But one could also compare the zombified reality of Apple workers plodding to work over the carefully unperturbed thresholds in their new spaceship headquarters to the sleepy drone of an army built to abide rather than to think, let alone think different. The same invisible doorways lead to and from the authorized chambers of work and gardens of leisure. So exacting!   Ironically, such design amounts to an inversion of the company’s famous 1984 Super Bowl ad for the original Macintosh. In the ad, Apple’s exuberant individualism destroys the tedious uniformity of an unnamed foe, implied to be IBM. But as time has worn on, Apple’s wares have become increasingly collectivist and uniform, not to mention inoperative—even as the company has somehow gotten credit only for innovation and performance. It has inspired that uniformity in competing products too. Every vagrant entrepreneur in the local coffee house has the same gray (or rose gold) laptop and the same black (or rose gold) phone, no matter their makes or models. Like every Apple product, the company’s new headquarters is a monolith meant to be worshiped at sight and by touch. Just don’t ask too many questions about how it works in practice. And work it surely will. Borg-like, the black, glass Apple mothership, with its perfect ceiling panels and regulated wood veneers, will shroud its engineers in the safe comfort of an unperturbed gait, such that they might yet craft the identical, future devices that shall still inspire the indistinguishable software that will yet run on them, so you and I might rejoice in their splendor.

Twitter Most Popular Presented by Kevin Lamarque / Reuters Behind the Internet's Anti-Democracy Movement Rosie Gray White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is reportedly a reader of neoreactionary political theory. A tour through the pro-authoritarian philosophy gaining visibility on the right. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has been in contact via intermediaries with Curtis Yarvin, Politico Magazine reported this week. Yarvin, a software engineer and blogger, writes under the name Mencius Moldbug. His anti-egalitarian arguments have formed the basis for a movement called “neoreaction.” The main thrust of Yarvin’s thinking is that democracy is a bust; rule by the people doesn’t work, and doesn’t lead to good governance. He has described it as an “ineffective and destructive” form of government, which he associates with “war, tyranny, destruction and poverty.” Yarvin’s ideas, along with those of the English philosopher Nick Land, have provided a structure of political theory for parts of the white-nationalist movement calling itself the alt-right. The alt-right can be seen as a political movement; neoreaction, which adherents refer to as NRx, is a philosophy. At the core of that philosophy is a rejection of democracy and an embrace of autocratic rule.

Here’s the playbook Donald Trump could use to set the country down a path toward illiberalism. It’s 2021, and President Donald Trump will shortly be sworn in for his second term. The 45th president has visibly aged over the past four years. He rests heavily on his daughter Ivanka’s arm during his infrequent public appearances. Fortunately for him, he did not need to campaign hard for reelection. His has been a popular presidency: Big tax cuts, big spending, and big deficits have worked their familiar expansive magic. Wages have grown strongly in the Trump years, especially for men without a college degree, even if rising inflation is beginning to bite into the gains. The president’s supporters credit his restrictive immigration policies and his TrumpWorks infrastructure program.

Sean Spicer has never found his stride. Kellyanne Conway is in Congress’s sights. Welcome to Survivor: West Wing. It is a truth universally peddled by wisemen and -women in Washington, though not necessarily obeyed by presidents, that when the White House is in trouble, the best cure is to hoist the head of an adviser on a spike of the fence encircling the executive mansion. Firing—sorry, accepting the resignation of—an adviser makes for an easy way to demonstrate that the administration understands it has a problem and is working to fix it. That person doesn’t necessarily need to be the root of the problem, though it’s helpful if they’re at least somewhat involved. Other times, some bad press offers a useful pretext for pushing out someone who was already on thin ice. Continue Reading Yuri Gripas / Reuters Michael Flynn's Debacle David Frum Trump’s national security adviser’s potentially false statements about his pre-inauguration contacts with Russian officials are a major scandal. “This reminds me of the run-up to Iran- Contra.” The person offering that gloomy observation was a veteran of many years in and around the US defense community. Unusually for a person with such a background, he had been a Trump supporter even during the Republican primaries. Now, though, he was worried. The new National Security Council leadership was taking form—and he feared he saw history repeating itself. “The National Security Council,” he warned, “is not one executive body. It is a deliberative body.” But the new national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, obviously hungered to carry out policy, not merely preside over policy formation. That way lay the disaster that had befallen Reagan's national security advisers Bud Macfarlane and John Poindexter in the 1980s, who were convicted of lying to Congress about the administration selling arms to Iran to finance anti-communist militants in Nicaragua.

The above line is delivered to Anastasia Steele by Christian Grey near the beginning of Fifty Shades Darker, the second movie adaptation of the trilogy of zillion-selling erotic novels by Erika Mitchell (pen name E. L. James). But one imagines similar words being spoken by executives of Universal Pictures to Mitchell herself following the completion of the first installment in the series, Fifty Shades of Grey. That film was directed by the respected artist Sam (short for Samantha) Taylor-Johnson, and she and Mitchell reportedly fought over almost every aspect of the production, the latter having been granted uncommon creative control when she signed over the rights to her books. The result was a very bad movie, but one considerably less bad than the book it was based on.

The Wall Street Journal’s editorial features editor has left the paper following tensions over the section drifting in a pro-Donald Trump direction. News of the departure of Mark Lasswell, who edited op-eds for the Journal, comes as the paper’s internal tensions over Trump have begun to spill into public view. The reliably hawkish, pro-trade, small government conservative Journal op-ed page has been challenged by the rise of the populist, nationalist Trump movement. The Journal’s opinion pages have been a showcase for the intra-right divide over Trump, featuring Trump-sympathetic writers like Bill McGurn alongside anti-Trump columnists such as Bret Stephens. Lasswell appears to be a casualty of that divide, and his dismissal a victory for the pro-Trump faction on the editorial staff.

The suggestion was met with horror among privacy advocates. “With that kind of access, they can not only see what you’ve publicly posted, but things you haven't posted yet, private messages, private lists, they can impersonate you, and even do these things on accident,” wrote Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, on his website. “This kind of access is profoundly invasive.” Continue Reading Michal Novotný How Your Cat Is Making You Crazy Kathleen McAuliffe Jaroslav Flegr is no kook. And yet, for years, he suspected his mind had been taken over by parasites that had invaded his brain. So the prolific biologist took his science-fiction hunch into the lab. What he’s now discovering will startle you. Could tiny organisms carried by house cats be creeping into our brains, causing everything from car wrecks to schizophrenia? No one would accuse Jaroslav Flegr of being a conformist. A self-described “sloppy dresser,” the 53-year-old Czech scientist has the contemplative air of someone habitually lost in thought, and his still-youthful, square-jawed face is framed by frizzy red hair that encircles his head like a ring of fire. Certainly Flegr’s thinking is jarringly unconventional. Starting in the early 1990s, he began to suspect that a single-celled parasite in the protozoan family was subtly manipulating his personality, causing him to behave in strange, often self-destructive ways. And if it was messing with his mind, he reasoned, it was probably doing the same to others. The parasite, which is excreted by cats in their feces, is called Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii or Toxo for short) and is the microbe that causes toxoplasmosis—the reason pregnant women are told to avoid cats’ litter boxes. Since the 1920s, doctors have recognized that a woman who becomes infected during pregnancy can transmit the disease to the fetus, in some cases resulting in severe brain damage or death. T. gondii is also a major threat to people with weakened immunity: in the early days of the AIDS epidemic, before good antiretroviral drugs were developed, it was to blame for the dementia that afflicted many patients at the disease’s end stage. Healthy children and adults, however, usually experience nothing worse than brief flu-like symptoms before quickly fighting off the protozoan, which thereafter lies dormant inside brain cells—or at least that’s the standard medical wisdom. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters Trump Tried to Intimidate the Judges Over His Ban, and He Failed Garrett Epps Presidents have thought before that they could roll those wimpy-looking nerds with their gavels and robes. It usually doesn’t work out all that well. “Make this one out of cast-iron,” the late Judge John Butzner said to me one day in chambers. “There are going to be a lot of weasels sniffing around it.” I was Butzner’s clerk. He was assigning me to draft an opinion in a case on an abstruse point of federal law. No court had ever decided this particular question—and a lot of money was riding on the answer. Some judges on the Fourth Circuit would object to the result his panel had reached. Once Butzner’s opinion was published, they might try to persuade the other judges to rehear the case “en banc”—meaning on a bench including all members of the Circuit. It was a high-stress assignment, even though he gave me all the time I needed. Imagine the atmosphere in chambers this week as three Ninth Circuit judges and their clerks worked frantically to produce an opinion in Washington v.

Apple was first to patent dual display notebooks back in 2010-2011 with reconfigurable interfaces that would be able to double as a keyboard, a game pad, an artist's pad and more. In this advancement of the dual display notebook Apple reveals adding polarizer layers and other optical layers in the displays that could be configured to provide a viewer with the ability to view images on the displays while wearing vertically polarized sunglasses and to suppress reflections of light emitted by the first display off of the second display. For the record, while Apple may have patented the idea ahead of their competition, waiting this long to come to market has allowed Lenovo to be first to deliver a slick dual display notebook to market. We covered that story and provided a video of the unit that you could view here.   Apple's patent application 20170039018 titled "Dual Display Equipment with Enhanced Visibility and Suppressed Reflections" was originally filed back in Q3 2015.   Technically speaking, Apple notes that polarizer layers and other optical layers such as wave plates in the dual displays may be configured to provide a viewer with the ability to view images on the displays while wearing vertically polarized sunglasses and to suppress reflections of light emitted by the first display off of the second display.   The first display may be a display such as a liquid crystal display that has inner and outer linear polarizers. The outer polarizer may have a transmission axis that is parallel to horizontal edges of the first display.   The second display may be a display such as an organic light-emitting diode display. The organic light-emitting diode display may have pixels containing thin-film transistors and organic light-emitting diodes that emit light. A circular polarizer that covers the pixels may be used to suppress ambient light reflections.   The circular polarizer of the second display may have a linear polarizer with a transmission axis that runs parallel to the horizontal edges and may have a quarter wave plate interposed between the linear polarizer and the pixels. In configurations in which the first display emits vertically polarized light, the linear polarizer of the second display may absorb the vertically polarized light and thereby suppress reflections. In configurations in which the first display emits circularly polarized light, an additional quarter wave plate may be placed on top of the circular polarizer of the second display to help suppress reflections of light from the first display.   In Apple's patent FIG. 7 below we're able to see polarizers and other optical layers that may be incorporated into displays in an electronic device in accordance with an embodiment.   In FIG. 7 you're able to see viewer #48 at the bottom of the graphic viewing displays 14A and 14B through sunglasses #102 in direction #50. Each lens in the sunglasses has a linear polarizer with a transmission axis #120 that runs vertically, parallel to vertical dimension #110. Display 14A may be a liquid crystal display having a linear upper polarizer such as polarizer.   Display 14A may use negative liquid crystal material and may exhibit enhanced off-axis viewing performance when pass axis #122 of polarizer #54 is oriented horizontally. Display 14B may be an organic light-emitting diode display. The uppermost layers of display 14B (i.e., layers 14B') may include a circular polarizer such as circular polarizer 100 to suppress ambient light reflections. Circular polarizer #100 may have a quarter wave plate such as quarter wave plate 100A and a linear polarizer such as polarizer #100B. Transmission axis #130 of linear the polarizer 100B may run parallel to horizontal direction.   Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Fast Company reports that the next iPhone could cost well in excess of $1000 when it’s launched to the public in September. Apple According to a source who has knowledge of Apple’s iPhone 8, there’s actually going to be a very good reason for why it’s going to cost this much. There have long been rumours circling that Apple’s ‘Anniversary’ iPhone is going to be something special. Well according to this source, it is, and then some. Fast Company reports that the iPhone 8 will comes with a 5.8-inch OLED display that covers the entire surface of the phone. Now while we’ve heard rumours before that Apple is making a screen that covers the front of the device the fact that they’re using OLED is new information. FREDERIC J. BROWN via Getty Images Attendees view a demonstration inside a tunnel ceiling filled with curved and flat 4K OLED TV's from LG at the 2017 Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Las Vegas. OLED is a relatively new screen technology that offers incredible contrast levels and superior colour reproduction over LED, sadly one of the drawbacks is that it’s considerably more expensive. In fact this source claims that the iPhone 8’s display will cost Apple double what it’s currently paying to create the display for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Then you have to take into account the increased costs with production - you’re creating a phone that has no bezels but yet still needs to be incredibly strong and rigid. Finally there’s the rumour that Apple is working on a way of integrating the fingerprint sensor into the display itself. Now this, like all of these features are complete rumour and speculation, but if true it’ll almost certainly push the cost up again. If $1000 seems a bit out of your price range then Fast Company’s source claims that while the iPhone 8 will be the flagship device Apple will also release two updated versions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus which will offer the older screen technology but with some of the new features, thus inevitably keeping costs down. Either way we’ve still got a bit of a wait ahead of us and with Apple’s rivals such as Samsung and LG both expected to launch groundbreaking new devices this month the pressure will certainly be on Apple to do something different. Our Definitive Best Gadgets Of 2017 Xbox One S Microsoft If you own a 4K TV and also own an original Xbox One then the Xbox One S is the console for you. It is quite simply Microsoft’s best Xbox ever, it’s also the cheapest 4K Blu-ray player you’ll be able to buy this side of Christmas. Your games collection will look stunning and if you trade in your old console the relatively small cost shouldn’t sting while you wait for Microsoft’s uber-console Project Scorpio to arrive next year. Apple iPhone 7 Apple This is Apple’s best iPhone ever, and if we’re honest it’s one of their most innovative devices yet. Its exceptional camera, combined with with a slim, water-resistant body mean that while it's not a leap in design it is a leap in just about everything else. No it doesn't have a headphone jack, but wireless audio is finally ready. Sky Q Sky Sky Q as a complete package is the future, not just one single feature.It’s knowing that everything you’ve ever recorded is available in every room. It’s knowing that you can download any recorded show onto your iPad. It’s also knowing that every Sky Q box also doubles as a WiFi hotspot.This is where Sky Q makes sense. This is an all-in-one system, it does literally everything. There’s no switching, no painful tinkering, it all neatly fits together and if there’s one thing us humans like it’s everything working just as it should. Google Pixel Google This is Google’s iPhone. It’s that simple. As such there are achievements and compromises. If you’re after an incredibly well-built, powerful Android flagship, Google have given you a truly five-star smartphone. If you’re a photographer, the Pixel’s camera and cloud storage option make this a no brainer. This is Google's first 'made by us' smartphone and it's absolutely brilliant. Hive Active Heating 2 Review Hive If your boiler is compatible and you’re willing to spend the initial £249 (including installation) then Hive is one of the most complete smart home systems we’ve ever seen. While Nest offers third-party accessories like Philips Hue, Hive almost fights back by keeping things simple: If it’s got the Hive logo on it you know it works. Components are reasonably priced and the entire system has been utterly rock solid, we haven’t had a single issue since installation. Amazon Echo Amazon Amazon Echo works best when you have other gadgets that it can utilise such as Hive, Nest or Philips Hue. On its own its an incredibly smart speaker, paired with these other gadgets though and it becomes the fully fledged conduit to your home. It’s also really good at doing homework. Alexa really is the first gadget we actually felt comfortable talking to. Roli Lightpad Block Roli Don't be alarmed by its alien appearance. This is actually one of the most innovative music-making gadgets we've used all year. A large transparent gel-like surface is both touch and pressure sensitive allowing you to create music in a way that's both utterly unique and incredibly intuitive. The accompanying app is properly easy to use and once mastered the Lightpad can become the only tool you need to create an entire song. Apple Watch Series 2 Apple The Series 2 is the complete package. It’s the smartwatch that we feel Apple always wanted to make. It’s a fitness tracker, health monitor and wellness device that’ll help you stay fit and, just as importantly, calm in mind. BeoPlay A2 Active By B&O Play Bang Olufsen At £299 this is not a cheap option, however for that money you’ll get a product that’s just as happy being your main living room speaker as it is keeping you company on a road trip. The sound quality is truly room-filling and at the high standard you would expect for a Bang & Olufson product. The A2 Active is quite simply one of the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Samsung The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is powerful but won’t run out of battery, beautiful yet able to work underwater and capable of transporting you to alien worlds through the medium of virtual reality. If there’s a product that encapsulates all the of the best technologies on offer today it’s this one. Oh and it won't catch fire, so that's nice. PlayStation VR Sony At the moment, if you own a PS4 and are desperately excited to get into virtual reality, PlayStation VR is the only place to start. It’s comfortable, gloriously easy to use and when the hardware and software work in harmony it’s an utterly breathtaking experience. Visceral, emotional and yet entirely accessible, it’s a technological marvel. Bowers & Wilkins P9 Signature Bowers Wilkins Anyone who wants an industry-leading sound but without the usually eye-watering price tag. Yes, these are £699, but when you think that the average audiophile will spend upwards of £1000 on a pair of HiFi-quality headphones these make every bit of sense. They’re B&W’s best headphones ever and they’re quite frankly one of the best pairs of headphones we’ve ever used. PlayStation 4 Pro Sony If you’re looking for an affordable (it costs as much as the original PS4) entry into the world of 4K gaming then the PS4 Pro is a no brainer. Pair it with a 4K HDR TV and games look absolutely astonishing. At present most games are simply being given a new coat of paint but going forward there will be an army of titles designed with this console in mind. OnePlus 3T OnePlus The OnePlus 3T is simply a continuation of the ethos that makes OnePlus phones so good. It’s exceptionally well-built, powerful and offers you everything you could want in an affordable and meaningful package. No smartphone will give you more value for money. Beats by Dre Powerbeats3 Wireless Beats by Dre While Apple's AirPods might have got most of the limelight in the post-iPhone 7 world it's actually Apple-owned Beats who have given us the ultimate solution to the lack of a headphone jack.The Powerbeats3 are ultra-portable, durable, wireless headphones that are a doddle to set up and last for days then we’ve found the pair for you. They sound great, they’re comfy, they’re perfect for sports and they last for days. These are very, very good. Samsung UE49KS9000 Samsung TVs are massive these days. They're also really really expensive. The KS9000 then has a very special place in our hearts because at a very sane 49-inches it's the most living room-friendly TV we've seen in recent years. Oh and because it's part of Samsung's flagship range you're still getting probably one of the best 4K TVs on the market.  Sonos Play:5 (2nd Gen) Sonos While it was released in December of 2015, Sonos' newest speaker has played an undisputedly important role in how we consume music in 2016. This was the year of wireless and Sonos continued to show us that when it comes to ditching those wires, they were one of the best.  Withings Activite Pop Withings This is the anti-fitness tracker of fitness trackers. Boasting a beautifully minimalist design the Pop is all about getting the job done without shouting about it. A simple measurement dial at the bottom shows you varying metrics for how active you're being while Withings' app reveals just how much data is actually being collected. While Fitbit has led the way in Fitness trackers, Withings has been offering even the most resistant consumer a change to start taking better care of themselves./ More: Apple Iphone Computers Iphone 7 Smart Phones Suggest a correction Advertisement Suggested For You by Gravity Comments Advertisement Suggested For You Close SUBSCRIBE TO & FOLLOW UK TECH Learn more Newsletter 129 K 17.2 K 21.9 K Podcast Add us on Snapchat Advertisement Apple's iPhone 8 Could Be Most Expensive Yet Thanks To Stunning OLED DIsplay CONVERSATIONS Advertise RSS Careers FAQ User Agreement Privacy Comment Policy About Us About Our Ads Contact Us Archive "The Huffington Post UK" is provided by AOL (UK) Limited. © 2017 AOL (UK) Limited its affiliates and licensors.

In it, U.S. federal employees in T-shirts and blue jeans are seen intercepting network equipment from Cisco Systems Inc. at a shipping facility. The feds in the photo, their faces obscured, were reprogramming the machines to spy on people’s activities. The image captured a deeply held paranoia within Silicon Valley’s biggest internet companies: In an era of increasingly sophisticated nation-state hacking, how can we trust that network infrastructure isn’t compromised before it’s dropped off at the company loading docks? This fear has created a sense of urgency for Apple Inc., Google, Facebook Inc. and other technology giants that have been devising their own alternatives to Cisco, which controls more than half of the market for network equipment. After the photo was published, Cisco filed a public complaint with the White House, arguing that spying by the National Security Agency was hurting U.S. companies. Cisco told Bloomberg it doesn’t work with governments on backdoors for its products and maintains tight checks on its processes and supply chain to assure customers of their security. While Cisco’s dominance isn’t in danger of slipping any time soon, the industry’s creeping concerns over cybersecurity have created an opening for new businesses and equipment-design skunkworks inside large companies. In the three years since the Snowden leaks, networking software and equipment startups raised $6.35 billion, a 47 percent increase over the prior three years, according to researcher CB Insights. “We’ve lost confidence in the vendors in the wake of the Snowden revelations, and that is a weakness and an opportunity,” John Kindervag said in an interview last month as a vice president at Forrester Research. (He recently left the market analysis firm to become an executive at Palo Alto Networks Inc.) One company that’s benefiting is SnapRoute Inc., which was founded by a former manager of Apple’s global data center network. The startup makes a cheaper, simpler network switch than the ones Cisco sells. And unlike most switches, it’s open-source, allowing customers to look for bugs, performance glitches or backdoors that might allow a government to peek inside. SnapRoute plans to announce a $25 million round of funding Tuesday from AT&T Inc., Microsoft Corp., Lightspeed Venture Partners and Norwest Venture Partners. The startup counts Facebook among its customers. Facebook is also a founding member of the Open Compute Project, which develops and shares open-source data center designs. It launched the project in 2011 after revealing details about a data center it built in Prineville, Oregon, using only Facebook-designed servers, power supplies and backup systems. Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Microsoft are now members. So is Cisco. It’s playing along with a potential competitor because Cisco Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins has said the company needs to be “part of every technology discussion that our customers want to have.” The high cost of traditional networking products was the main reason for Amazon.com Inc.’s investment into creating its own equipment. “It was cost that caused us to head down our own path,” James Hamilton, vice president and distinguished hardware engineer for Amazon Web Services, said at a conference in November. “Networking gear is really expensive.” Besides looking to save a lot of money on premium equipment, companies are placing a higher value on transparency. Cisco guards its code and designs, making them difficult to repair when things break. Bloomberg Businessweek reported in September that a web hosting company filed for bankruptcy protection after a series of Cisco switches failed and a major customer left, while Cisco worked for months on a fix. Cisco has declined to comment on that case, saying only that it tries to fix problems quickly. By 2020, spending on open-source and self-built switches and other network technologies will account for at least 20 percent of the global data center market, up from less than 2 percent last year, according to researcher Gartner Inc. Big Switch Networks Inc., Cumulus Networks Inc., Pluribus Networks Inc. and SnapRoute are among the companies cultivating a niche that’s putting pressure on leaders Cisco and Juniper Networks Inc. and their proprietary code, said Naresh Singh, an analyst at Gartner. The giants are already under pressure from software-based networking alternatives like SnapRoute’s, and the adoption of open-source tools from mega users, such as Facebook and Goldman Sachs, poses an even bigger threat to their businesses, Singh said. Cisco said some companies balk at using open-source network equipment, citing maintenance “complexity and hidden costs.” SnapRoute founder Jason Forrester said the idea for his startup came from a key discovery he and his colleagues at Apple made when they began designing their own networking software and switches. Forrester (no relation to the market research firm) left Apple in 2015 but declined to talk in detail about his work there. “Switching wasn’t as hard as Cisco and others led customers to believe,” he said at SnapRoute’s offices in an industrial part of Palo Alto, California, located 10 miles from Apple’s campus. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Switches from SnapRoute are $30,000 to $40,000 cheaper than comparable brand-name models, Forrester said. And whereas switches from Cisco and other big suppliers can have tens of millions of lines of code, SnapRoute’s has just 22,000, he said. This means fewer features, so SnapRoute may not be an attractive option for some companies. But the simpler code makes it easier for customers to sift through in search of hidden spying devices. —With Ian King Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Latest: a new 'inbetweener' 10.5-inch iPad Pro with a bezel-free screen and no Home button has been predicted for early 2017, and it's expected to launch in March alongside the Apple Pencil 2 by David Price | 09 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will the iPad Pro 2 be released in the UK (or whatever they call the next version of the iPad Pro for 2017)? And what new features will be added to the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions of the iPad Pro 2? The iPad Pro 2 launch is an exciting prospect - but we may have to wait a bit longer. Apple made a splash in September 2015 when it unveiled its first giant tablet: a device known at the time only as the iPad Pro and equipped with a blockbuster 12.9-inch screen, quad speakers and a super-quick processor chip. The following March a smaller and frankly better 9.7-inch version of the iPad Pro came out, creating mild naming complications (we now call them the iPad Pro 12.9 and iPad Pro 9.7 respectively) and kindling a degree of regret in the hearts of early adopters. But we are now looking ahead to the future of the iPad Pro line. When will Apple release the new iPad Pro 2 for 2017, and what new features and design changes will this product incorporate? Will there be separate 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch editions of the iPad Pro 2 - will there even be a 7.9-inch model, a sort of iPad Pro mini, or a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2? Our iPad Pro 2 release date & new features rumour roundup weighs up all the clues, hints and evidence about the new iPad Pro models for 2017, as well as our wishlist of new features that are missing from the current generation of iPad Pro hardware. Check back regularly for the latest iPad Pro 2 rumours. Updated, 9 February 2017, with a stunning concept video showing the iPad Pro with a 10.5in screen, a dual-lens camera and a new 'wine' colour option, and predictions that you'll be able to attach the Apple Pencil to the iPad Pro 2 using magnets; on 19 Jan, with a supply-chain rumour that the iPad Pro 2 will launch in March, along with the Apple Pencil 2; on 9 Jan, with another analyst prediction of a 10.5in iPad; and on 14 Dec 2016, with a rumour of a folding iPad. Read next: iPad buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iPad Pro deals UK iPad Pro 2 release date rumours UK: Launch date When will the next iPad Pro come out in the UK? March 2017, most likely - though it could be later. In January 2017 the Chinese-language site Wei Feng reported a rumour from Apple's Asian supply-chain, which claimed the iPad Pro 2 would launch in March 2017 alongside the Apple Pencil 2. "Wei Feng network through the supply chain that Apple will be held in March this year, iPad new conference, when a new generation of Apple Pencil stylus will also be unveiled," the site reports, as interpreted by Google Chrome's built-in translation. During Apple's September 2016 event, there was no mention of the iPad line (focusing instead on the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2), while its October event showcased a smart if costly new MacBook Pro. If it had a new iPad Pro up its sleeve, surely Apple could have found time at one of these events to mention it... which suggests to us that the iPad Pro 2 is being held back until spring 2017. March is generally when Apple holds its first event of the year. However, DigiTimes believes Apple may have to hold out until the second half of the year as mass production of the iPads hasn't begun yet. Time will tell, and we'll keep you in the loop. iPad Pro 2 release: One iPad launch event, or two? As with the two strands of iPhone models - the mid-size iPhone 7 and large-screen iPhone 7 Plus, both launched in September 2016, and the smaller iPhone SE, released in March 2016 - there are two schools of thought here. Either Apple will unify the two Pro brands into a single annual update event, or it will continue to update half the models in spring and the other half in autumn. Both theories have downsides. If, as now looks likely, Apple does a full refresh (9.7-in and 12.9-inch together) in March 2017, then the current hardware will be starting to feel old before then - the original Pro will be 18 months old, which is a long time to be the most expensive tablet on Apple's books. Then again, the company would have been in almost as tricky a position if it did a full refresh in September, presumably upsetting a bunch of people who just bought new devices. Three major iPad updates in the space of 12 months might just be taking the mickey. There's also something a bit messy, a bit un-Apple, about having two press event to announce what would essentially amount to two SKUs of the same product line. I think the company will want to keep things simple. A final thought, however, is that people don't update their iPads as often as their iPhones: only 6 percent of the respondents to our poll said they get a new iPad every year. It's therefore debatable whether Apple actually needs to bring out new iPads this often. It could probably switch to a biennial release schedule without causing much of a problem. Read next: iPad Air 3 rumours | iPad mini 5 rumours | Apple Pencil 2 rumours iPad Pro 2 release date rumours UK: New 10.5-inch iPad Pro The latest rumour suggests that after the lack of an iPad Pro update in autumn 2016, Apple will make up for this in 2017 by launching an entirely new size of iPad. Ming-Chi Kuo, a market analyst with a strong track record, has published a report making predictions about Apple's moves over the next couple of years. Kuo is cautious in his iPad sales predictions - cutting a previous estimate of 45 to 50 million for the year to 35 to 40 million, partly because of a lack of new products in the near term: despite a comparatively strong performance in Q3 2016, iPad sales remain flat - but argues that Apple will sell three sizes of iPad. There will be a 12.9-inch Pro, a 9.7-inch regular iPad and a new 10.5-inch Pro, Kuo predicts, with the smallest offered as a low-cost option with a lower-powered processor as well as a smaller screen. Kuo's reasoning is that an 'inbetweener' 10.5-inch iPad Pro would sell well to the education and business sectors: "If the iPad comes in a larger size, such as a 10.5-inch model, we believe it will be helpful to bid for tenders within the commercial and education markets. As a result, we expect Apple to launch a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in 2017." These three iPad sizes don't include the 7.9-inch form factor of the iPad mini. Apple could continue to sell the mini alongside the three other iPads, but the success of the iPhone 6 Plus and the iPhone 7 Plus means Apple may feel that this area is covered by its phablet offerings. But we'll discuss the prospects of an 'iPad Pro mini' in the next section. This new 10.5in or even 10.9in size is rumoured to come with a bezel-free design, as it will accommodate the larger screen in a smaller form-factor. This might potentially see the end of the home button. Ming-Chi Kuo has reiterated his prediction in a January 2017 report, once again claiming that new iPad models for Q2 2017 will be 12.9-inch, 10-10.5-inch, and 9.7-inch.  He notes that the 12.9-inch model will be "the second generation of the existing 12.9” iPad Pro," that the new in-between size will be "the high-end model equipped with a narrow bezel design," and that the 9.7-inch model will be "the low-priced option." The first two will run on a new A10X chip, with the latter on an A9 chip. With that in mind, it looks like the likeliest outcome would be for the 12.9-inch model to be a new iPad Pro 2, the 10-10.5-inch model to be a smaller Pro, and the lower-price 9.7-inch model simply branded as the iPad. Once again, there was no mention of a successor to the 7.9-inch mini, adding fuel to the speculation that it will be phased out by Apple - unless it plans to stick the 'mini' name on the 9.7-inch model. Kuo also notes that while he expects another decline in the volume of iPads shipped in 2017 - down to 35-37 million - this is set to be a smaller decline than seen in 2016, and will be offset by a rise in the average selling price of the devices, leading him to conclude that the "worst has passed for Apple’s iPad." iPad Pro 2 release date rumours UK: Will there be an iPad Pro mini? Following the launch of the 9.7-inch Pro it's now firmly established that the Pro brand doesn't just refer to Apple's biggest tablets - instead, it refers to a set of specs and features and, in a way that's hard to define, any tablet that sits at the top of Apple's range. If we accept that a 9.7-inch tablet can be an iPad Pro, could we get a 7.9-inch Pro as well? The truth is that there's no concrete reason why there can't be a 7.9-inch iPad Pro 2, but for various reasons we still don't expect Apple to do this. For one thing, unlike the Air line-up, the minis are still being updated; the mini 4 came out at the same event as the first iPad Pro, which suggests that Apple plans to keep both brands going at the same time. And besides, the Pro brand has always existed in opposition to a lower-end alternative: the MacBook Pro sits opposite the MacBook Air (and plain MacBook); the Mac Pro opposite the iMac; and so on. Apple can't just call every tablet a Pro. We're starting to suspect that the Air brand may be phased out across Apple's laptop and tablet departments, but there still needs to be two lines left in each of these areas. Apple still sell a MacBook Pro and a 12-inch MacBook, we expect; in the same way, we'd expect there to be iPad Pro models and iPad mini models. To read more about the iPad mini 5 - or the iPad Pro mini - then take a look at our iPad mini 5 rumour roundup. iPad Pro 2 release date rumours UK: Design What design changes can we expect from the new iPad Pro 2? Apple Pencil changes Mac Observer has reported, via Weibo, that the Apple Pencil 2 might include a magnet to attach to the side of the iPad Pro - much like with Microsoft's Surface Pro models. This rumour was backed up in January 2017, when a report by the Czech-language website LetemSvetemApplem also claimed that magnets will enable you to attach the Apple Pencil to the side of the iPad Pro 2, citing "information directly from suppliers in China". The site also predicts that the next Apple Pencil will have a clip on the side, like a pen, which would stop it from rolling away across the nearest table - and also mean you can clip it to your pocket. Read more: Apple Pencil 2 rumours Folding iPad We'll start with the most out-there rumour. Analyst Gene Munster - he of the relentless and widely mocked 'Apple television' predictions, who in my opinion was somewhat vindicated when it turned out that Apple had been developing a telly but gave up on the plan - has predicted that Apple is going to make a foldable iPad. The prediction, reported by Apple Must, cites recent patent activity that shows Apple is exploring the idea of a foldable iPhone, and extrapolates this concept to the tablet sphere (where, because of the larger form factor of the devices, a folding design probably makes more sense). The timing of the prediction is interesting, coming as it does shortly after the end of the first series of Westworld, HBO's violent and disorienting TV series based on the 1970s Yul Brynner film of the same name. In Westworld, the human programmers who set the behaviours and personalities of the park's western-themed android inhabitants do all their programming on slick foldable tablets. The foldable tablet designs on the show make a lot of sense and look fantastic. (The idea of programmers working exclusively on tablets presently seems less plausible.) Bezel-free screen Macotakara, a Japanese-language Apple site, predicts that the iPad Pro 2 will have a largely bezel-free screen and no Home button, citing sources in Taiwan. The bezel (the non-screen area around the edge of the screen on an iPad, which you hold while using the device) will apparently be removed from the bottom of the iPad Pro, meaning the Home button will disappear, and Touch ID will have to be integrated into the screen itself. Oddly, the site predicts that the bezel will remain at the top of the iPad Pro 2, and will continue to house the front-facing FaceTime camera. Thicker design Macotakara also believes that the 12.9-inch model of the iPad Pro 2 will be 3mm thicker than its predecessor, and says the middle-size model of the iPad Pro will have a 10.9-inch screen, not 10.5-inch as has been rumoured elsewhere. iPad Pro 2 release date rumours UK: Leaked photos & videos This is where we will post the best and most convincing leaked photos and concept designs and videos created by artists and designers. Still from iPad Pro 2 concept video Concept video of iPad Pro 2 We'll start with this stunning concept video showing the iPad Pro 2 in all its (imagined) glory. The iPad depicted here has a 10.5-inch, 4K screen and a dual-lens rear-facing camera, and comes in six colours: adding white, purple ('wine'), and the black and Jet Black options from the iPhone 7 to the currently available gold and Rose Gold. Photos of iPad Pro 2 AppleInsider has published two photos ostensibly showing the iPad Pro 2, which were sent into the site by an anonymous reader. The images, like most Apple hardware leaks, are said to originate from the Asian supply chain; in this case it's said to be an employee at a Chinese supplier who has taken and leaked the photos. Both photos show the same onscreen imagery - the General > About tab of the Settings app, chosen presumably because it includes model number designations and other details that can corroborate the photo's legitimacy. (But, as AppleInsider observes, such details are not difficult to spoof, so the photos may yet be fake.) The About page says the depicted iPad is model MH1C2CD/F: that certainly sounds right, since that designation hasn't been given to any publicly known iPads, while broadly following the conventions of earlier Pro models. (The 128GB cellular 12.9-inch iPad Pro, for instance, is designated ML3K2B/A. By contrast, the iPad Air 2 uses a slightly different format: the 128GB cellular model is MH332B/A.)  Although, we should note that spoofing the model number can be changed relatively easily. More so, the model shows only 12GB of available storage - this can however be a test version, where 12GB of internal storage is more than sufficient. As one would expect, the depicted iPad is running a version of iOS 10 - you can tell because Siri gets its own top-level tab in the Settings app rather than a sub-category within General. Unfortunately - or conveniently, if you're cynical - it's virtually impossible to deduce anything else about the device from the shots, which don't show hardware ports or buttons, and have nothing else in frame with which to compare size of screen and so on. About all this tells us is that a new iPad Pro is probably on its way in the next few months.  Once we know more information or sent more details on the screenshots we will update this article. iPad Pro 2 rumours: New features wishlist The iPad Pro tablets are great, but they're not perfect. Here are a few new features and design tweaks we'd like to see in the second-gen iPad Pro. iPad Pro 2 wishlist: Bring the 9.7in Pro's new features across to the 12.9in model An issue we've addressed several times across this article concerns the disappointment felt by a number of 12.9-inch iPad Pro owners when the cheaper and in many respects better 9.7-inch iPad Pro was launched six months later. So the first thing we'd ask for is consistency. To achieve this the larger Pro model needs to get: A 12-megapixel rear-facing camera (up from 8Mp) A 5Mp front-facing camera (up from 1.2Mp) 4K video recording Live Photos Display with True Tone and 'wide colour' A 32GB cellular buying option A pink colour option iPad Pro 2 wishlist: Better keyboard accessory (for 9.7-inch model) The Pros are explicitly aimed at business users, and for this reason it was critical to get some good keyboard accessories. Apple's own Smart Keyboard is a strong offering in the larger size - even though it's expensive, and Macworld is divided on the issue of whether Logitech's less attractive Create keyboard offers a better typing experience - but the 9.7-inch version is a different matter. As a result of the smaller keys typing accuracy is weaker; the lower weight means it feels less satisfying under the fingers. (The design looks great, however, and is magnificently slim and light from a portability point of view. And the Smart Connector - and the fact that you never have to worry about battery life - is wonderful too.) We feel that Apple needs to create - or persuade a third-party accessory maker to create - a 9.7-inch keyboard you can really type on. And this may involve some compromises. It may need to have a foldout design (sounds ugly, right?) so that it could fit in larger keys. It might need to be heavier (thereby reducing portability) in order to feel better and reduce movement on the desk. But whatever happens, the smaller Pro needs an updated accessory line-up in order to compete as a business tool. Read next: Best iPad keyboards iPad Pro 2 wishlist: More (smaller) Home screen icons This is a software change rather than a hardware one, but it's frustrating that Apple doesn't allow you to fit more app icons on the screen of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. At present you're allowed 20 app icons (or folders), plus up to six in the Dock, and this is exactly the same that you're allowed on the 9.7-inch iPads, which feels like a waste of the extra space. By default, the icons are the same size, so there's far more empty space on the screen. You can select a zoom view, with larger icons, but we'd prefer the option to have a grid of 5x6 icons, plus a seventh icon in the Dock. iPad Pro 2 wishlist: iOS 10 We expect the new iPad Pro 2 to ship with iOS 10 pre-installed. Apple's latest mobile operating system brought more than 100 new and updated features. However, no special iPad-only features that have yet been announced or discovered on iOS 10 - so we hope Apple will address this during their March 2017 presentation. iOS 11 will come out in autumn 2017; if the iPad Pro 2 doesn't come out until then - which would be a disappointment, frankly - then it will come with that OS preinstalled instead. iPad Pro 2 wishlist: Processor We expect the iPad Pro 2 to be shipped with the A10X, a variant on the A10 Fusion processor found in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Rumours suggest the A10X will be an upgraded A9X built on a smaller FinFET technology. This would point towards a release date of spring 2017, with a new 10nm processor included within the iPad Pro 2. Might we also see 4K (3840x2160) recording abilities? Some rumours suggest that the feature will be integrated within the OS, as the likes of the nVidia and AMD mobile-generation graphics cards might make an appearance within the iPad Pro 2.  iPad Pro 2 wishlist: Design & display There are certain rumours suggesting that the iPad Pro 2 will feature an OLED or a flexible AMOLED display. Both are possibilities, but it's unlikely Apple will change their display manufacturing process. Nevertheless, it's a speculation some have - as Apple is losing its market share in the tablet industry and with ever growing competition, analysts predict Apple needs to react in a drastic fashion to interest consumers to stay or switch to an Apple product. Some say that the next iPad Pro 2 will feature a borderless design, providing a much better user experience and again, a more unique tablet in the market.  It's also rumoured that the new 12.9in iPad will be 0.3mm thicker, which would be a surprise - especially if it adds better battery life. Through this rumour by Japanese site Makotakara (spotted by 9to5Mac), we could see various design changes, such as the removal of the famous home button - not only on the iPad, but also on the upcoming iPhone 8.

Apple is expected to update its Apple Pencil stylus in March 2017, alongside new iPad Pro models! We round up all the rumours about the Apple Pencil 2's UK release date, tech specs and new features by David Price | 09 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will Apple release the new Apple Pencil 2 in the UK? What tech specs and new features will the Apple Pencil 2 offer, and what differences should we expect between the Apple Pencil and the Apple Pencil 2? Apple's stylus for the iPad Pro, called simply the Apple Pencil, is arguably the best tablet stylus in the world right now. But we don't want Apple to rest on its laurels, and we're keen to see what Sir Jony Ive's design team comes up with when the Apple Pencil 2 is unveiled. In this article we look at the rumours, clues, patent filings and more evidence to suggest when the Apple Pencil 2 will launch and the design changes and new features it's likely to incorporate. Updated, 9 February 2017, with predictions that the Apple Pencil 2 will feature a clip (to stop it rolling off tables) and attach to the iPad Pro 2 with magnets; and on 19 Jan, with rumours from the supply chain pointing to a March 2017 release. Read next: The 12 best styluses for your iPad Pro, Air or mini | Buy Apple Pencil 1 now New Apple Pencil 2 release date rumours: Release date The latest rumour from Apple's supply chain (Chinese-language site) points to an Apple Pencil 2 launch in March 2017, alongside the iPad Pro 2: updates, we hope, to both the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions of that device. "Wei Feng network through the supply chain that Apple will be held in March this year, iPad new conference, when a new generation of Apple Pencil stylus will also be unveiled," says the site, as interpreted by Google Chrome's translate function. This fits with previous expectations of when Apple was likely to announce a major update to the iPads. (We had hoped for a minor update to the iPads late last year, however.) The first Apple Pencil was unveiled alongside the 12.9-inch iPad Pro in September 2015, so the most obvious time to expect an update was in autumn 2016. That's certainly what we were hoping for. But 2016 came and went with no update to the Apple Pencil. New Apple Pencil 2 release date rumours: Design So much for the Apple Pencil 2's release date. But what will the next Apple Pencil look like? Magnetic attachment Some momentum is building around the rumour that the next Apple Pencil and the next iPad Pro will be able to attach to each other using magnets. Obviously this would be much more convenient than the current state of affairs, where the Pencil tends to roll off and get lost on the floor. The latest report to back this theory comes from Letemsvetemapplem, who cite "information directly from suppliers in China" and claim that "in accordance with the patent which Apple acquired in September last year, you [will be able to] attach a pencil to iPad using the magnet [just as] the original Apple iPad Smart Case covers the display". (The site is in Czech; both quotes are based on Google Translate.) Clip On a similar note, the same site claims that the Apple Pencil 2 will have a small clip, much like a traditional pen. This will mean you can clip the Pencil to your pocket, of course, but seems more likely a simple solution to the problem of the perfectly round pencil rolling across desks and not staying in one place. New Apple Pencil 2 release date rumours: New features So much for the Apple Pencil 2's release date. But what new features can we expect? Compatibility with more apps It's desperately vague at the moment, but word on the street suggests Apple is focusing on expanding the range of applications with optimised support for the Apple Pencil. Wei Feng, the Chinese-language site already quoted in the release date section, writes: "The so-called Apple Pencil 2 will have what kind of characteristics? According to the supply chain, the answer is 'compatible with a large number of applications'." Interchangeable tips/nibs Like most tech journalists, I suspect that the development and launch of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro was at least partly a response to the relative success of Microsoft's Surface line of tablets, which also have large screens and latterly come with styluses. (And are marketed at business users.) But the stylus for the Surface Pro 4, while weaker in many respects than the Apple Pencil, has one clear advantage: the option to buy interchangeable replacement nibs of various sizes and shapes. (You can buy replacement nibs for the Apple Pencil but they're always the same default size and shape.) An Apple patent has been discovered, however, which suggests that future Apple Pencils may offer a similar feature. Patent 9,329,703, filed in 2011 and published on 3 May 2016, describes an "intelligent stylus" where each nib has its own sensor, which pairs with a separate sensor in the body of the stylus. "The stylus 110 can include multiple sensors to provide information about its condition, where the sensors can be selectively used alone or in various combinations," reads the patent's detailed description. "The ability to provide information beyond simply touch input information, particularly information about the stylus's condition that the stylus determines itself, gives this stylus an intelligence absent from a traditional stylus." Eraser function Returning to patent 9,329,703, Apple also mentions the possibility of turning the back end of the Apple Pencil into an eraser. From the detailed description: "For the additional contact/proximity sensor at the stylus non-tip end, the MCU can determine the stylus's condition at the non-tip end as touching or hovering over a surface, e.g., to emulate an eraser." Touch ID One last titbit from patent 9,329,703's detailed description: "…the MCU [microcontroller unit] can extract fingerprints from the touch measurement and can identify the user of the stylus. The MCU can transmit the user identification to the touch sensitive device. The touch sensitive device can then perform some action based on the identification. For example, the touch sensitive device can authenticate the user of the stylus and can accept stylus input if the user is authenticated and deny stylus input if the user is not. The touch sensitive device can also display or speak the authentication result to the user." Sounds like a stylus version of Touch ID to us. Mac trackpad input Another one from a patent filing. Patently Apple has cleverly spotted what it believes to be a reference in a 2014 Apple patent filing to a stylus that can control the trackpad on a Mac. We've wondered for a while if the Apple Pencil will gain the ability to control iPhones and other iPads other than the Pro models, but the Mac range is a bigger leap than most of us expected. The patent, for a 'Stylus With Inertial Sensor', includes drawings that show what appears to be a Mac and trackpad setup: It seems unlikely that we'll see Apple Pencil compatibility on the Mac Magic Trackpad before we see it on the iPad mini, for example, but watch this space for further developments.

Ever since the Apple Watch came out, I’ve had a bit of a pet peeve that the Bluetooth symbol is always visible there as I’m always paired to the watch. Is it really necessary to show me something that is always there? This leads me into a feature request that isn’t a critical new addition to the system by any means, but a small refinement to polish the iOS experience. I believe the status bar is too cluttered with redundant information and would like to see Apple make it tidier and less busy … A lot of icons and symbols can appear in the status bar. There’s the cellular signal strength, the WiFi / Personal Hotspot indicator, the Bluetooth glyph, the Do Not Disturb crescent moon, the network activity loading spinner, the clock icon signaling an alarm is set, the Location Services indicator, and several others. There’s also the carrier name on the left, the centered time display and the right-aligned battery indicator. It doesn’t take too many of these to be visible for the status bar to get crowded. The screenshots and mockups are taken on a 4.7 inch iPhone, which is what most customers buy. This ‘issue’ may be less noticeable on an iPhone 7 Plus sized device in day-to-day use. iOS includes some limited customization options here already, namely you can choose whether the battery indicator includes a percentage or not. This means you can save some space by only displaying the battery meter, not the text as well. I’d like to see this kind of toggle available to more system status bar items. I think a lot of people want to be able to hide the carrier name, myself included. I know what carrier I use and pay for, I don’t need to be shown. I get to see the name ‘LIFE’ constantly with its distracting choice of capitalization. At least my carrier has a short name, it’s worse if your cellular service provider has a longer name that takes up a significantly wider region of the status bar. If it’s too long, it will even marquee scroll on the lock screen. In the same vein, it has bugged me since iOS 7 that the signal strength indicator was changed from a compact bar chart into a very-wide collection of five separate circles. I didn’t include this in the mockup but I would welcome a redesigned (less overbearing) appearance here. A typical status bar. What I would like to make possible. One of my leading complaints is the Bluetooth indicator. If you wear an Apple Watch every day like I do, it just feels so redundant to see the logo in the status bar every single moment. I prefer the way watchOS handles reporting the Bluetooth connection; if an Apple Watch is successfully communicating with a paired iPhone, the watch face displays no indicator at all. You only see a status item, a red phone glyph, in cases when the Bluetooth connection is broken and there is an error. I’d love to be able to remove it from the status bar in iOS, or at least have it not show if the only connection is an Apple Watch. On the Mac, I have full flexibility. I can option+drag the Bluetooth widget out of the menu bar if I find it unnecessary, as you can with almost all the Mac status items. The same kind of feature could be exposed in an iOS Settings pane. An alternative design would hide the Bluetooth icon when the Apple Watch is paired, presenting a red error icon when an Apple Watch is not connected. Showing Location Services icon has merit, as it is only visible whilst an app or service is using my location, so I don’t really have a problem with that one as it is providing relevant information. I would argue the Alarm Clock indicator is not necessary, though. I am in control of setting alarms, I know if one is set. It’s different to Location Services which are activated by external factors (the whims of the application). I would love to have a ‘Show Alarm Clock In Status Bar’ preference that I could disable. Arguing that the alarm clock has special priority is a slippery slope in my view, as there are plenty of other things that are significant events but don’t get a place in the status bar (timers, calendar events, reminders, scheduled email for instance). The Do Not Disturb crescent moon is another icon I would consider removing; whether Do Not Disturb is enabled or not can be checked at any time using Control Center. The same is true for the orientation lock. By the way, Apple has done some of this spring cleaning before. iOS used to put a Play icon in the status bar whenever music was playing, this was removed with iOS 7 assumedly because it is a redundant icon as the user is well aware when music is playing. As I said in the introduction, this feature request isn’t about something so critical to the platform that iOS must get it. Some of it is a difference in design opinion, there are subjective decisions at play. Adding toggles to Settings isn’t zero-cost either. That being said, I would like to be able to make my iPhone status bar less cluttered — and I don’t think I am alone.

The University posted a number of photos and short video clips on its Twitter account, and one attendee posted a video of the full hour-long event on YouTube. The video was recorded from within the audience using an iPhone 7 Plus as dedicated cameras were not permitted at the event, so while it’s not an official video, it covers the entire event, including Cook receiving his honorary degree as well as the chat that occurred afterward. Several key points that Cook made during the Fireside Chat included his strong opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump’s immigration ban, his views on activism, Apple’s commitment to the environment, the importance of finding fulfillment in one’s vocation, and the legacy of Steve Jobs and how his philosophy remains a key part of Apple’s DNA. Regarding the immigration ban, Cook noted that “Apple would not exist without diversity,” possibly referring not only to Apple’s diverse staff base but also the fact that Steve Jobs’ father was a Syrian immigrant, and went on to say, “I personally believe that the wealthier countries have the responsibility to accept people that are fleeing civil war. It’s a reasonable argument for people to have about to what degree. It’s also very reasonable for people to say that we’re not doing enough for people in our country today. And I think that’s also true. I just don’t think that it’s a trade, one for the other. I think the U.S. can do both.” Cook also noted that he does not view Apple as an “activist” company, but that Apple tries to make its voice heard in specific areas where the company can add a valuable voice based on its collective knowledge and experience. Responding to a question from an attendee about whether the Apple Pencil signals the company is moving away from Steve Jobs’ design philosophies, Cook explained that the Apple Pencil is not intended to be a “stylus” in the traditional sense, but is a creative tool aimed specifically at designers and artists so that the iPad Pro can provide all of the features of a digital sketchbook. Citing the example of a designer of very high-end dresses that he met with on Monday in Paris, Cook explained that this professional now designs “totally on iPad Pro with Apple Pencil” and has replaced a “box full of crayons and marker pencils” with the single Apple Pencil for his creative work. Cook added that Jobs’ philosophy is still very much a core part of Apple and will remain so, noting that “Steve is deeply embedded in the company. We celebrate him and we celebrate his philosophy. His philosophy will be at Apple 100 years from now. The philosophy is sort of passed down with every generation.” [via 9to5Mac] « Apple CEO Tim Cook meets with UK Prime Minister Theresa May Daily Deal: Zendure 40W Max A-Series 4-Port USB Travel Wall Charger » Related Stories Apple CEO Tim Cook meets with UK Prime Minister Theresa May Apple developing new ‘Ultra Accessory Connector’ for Made-for-iPhone accessories (Update: No) Apple patents ‘dual mode headphones’ that transform into standalone speaker Apple releases second betas for iOS 10.3, tvOS 10.2, and watchOS 3.2 to developers Apple negotiating to sell used iPhones in India after earlier denial Report: Blogger claims Apple augmented reality headset may arrive this year Subscribe to iLounge Weekly Recent News Security researcher discovers Apple retains deleted browser history in iCloud Report: Apple addressing heat dissipation challenges in ‘iPhone X’ design Apple CEO Tim Cook meets with UK Prime Minister Theresa May Tim Cook discusses immigration ban, Steve Jobs’ influence at ‘Fireside Chat’ Report: 2017 ‘10th Anniversary’ special edition iPhone could be priced above $1,000 EPIX launches Apple TV app Apple hires former Amazon, Netflix executive to run Apple TV marketing Iovine: Apple’s original content strategy ‘has nothing to do with what Netflix is doing’ Apple makes App Launch, other features available to Apple TV accessory makers Apple developing new ‘Ultra Accessory Connector’ for Made-for-iPhone accessories (Update: No) Recent Reviews Revogi Smart Lightbulb, Smart Lightstrip, Smart Candle + Smart Meter Plug Audeze iSine10 In-Ear Headphones MOCACARE MOCACuff Connected Blood Pressure Monitor Apple AirPods Elgato Eve Motion Olloclip Core Lens Set for iPhone 7/7 Plus Logitech Pop Home Switch Starter Pack Elgato Eve Light Switch iHome iPLWBT5 Docking Clock Radio for iPhone and Apple Watch Brydge 12.9 iPad Pro Keyboard Recent Articles Top Five: The Best Products for Building a Smart Home with HomeKit Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of watchOS 3 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of tvOS 10 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of iOS 10 Inside the betas: iOS 10 Photos gets Advanced Computer Vision Inside the betas: iOS 10 Music app delivers ‘clarity and simplicity’ Inside the betas: iOS 10 Maps gets a major redesign Inside the betas: iOS 10 shakes up the user experience Inside the betas: watchOS 3 promises a real speed boost Inside the betas: A sneak peek at what’s new in tvOS 10 Win Subscribe Buy ADVERTISE | CONTACT US Search Sign up for the iLounge Weekly Newsletter iLounge is an independent resource for all things iPod, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Apple TV, Mac, and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc. iLounge is © 2001 - 2017 iLounge, Inc.

The iPhone’s user experience is so smooth and Apple’s integrations across platforms run so deep that I don’t see myself leaving the Apple ecosystem anytime soon. That said, several Android vendors have really come into their own over the past couple of years, and there are a number of Android smartphones out there right now that mark major advancements in both hardware and software design. In fact, I recently penned a piece about two Android phones in particular that have come closer than ever to prying me away from my iPhone. Now, the next-generation version of one of those two phones has been imagined by a design team in a new video, and the result may very well be the ultimate Android phone. What’s more, the stunning design and killer specs touted by this concept aren’t far-fetched at all. Don't Miss: 5 ways Android has taken Apple’s ideas and made them better The graphic designers behind YouTube channel DBS Designing are back, and this time they’ve set their sights on the Chinese Android smartphone startup OnePlus. The company’s OnePlus 3T is without question one of the hottest smartphones money can buy right now. Featuring a sleek all-metal design, plenty of power and my personal favorite custom Android build on the market, the OnePlus 3T is just about as good as it gets right now for Android. Of course, there’s always room for improvement and DBS Designing has improved every single aspect of the latest OnePlus smartphone in its new OnePlus 4 mockup. oneplus-4-concept-dbs-designing-8More The designers’ mockup shows a positively gorgeous phone that actually doesn’t stray too far from the realm of possibility. Most mockups we see out there are like this incredible iPhone 8 concept we showed you yesterday. They look great, but they’re simply not possible with current technological limitations. The DBS OnePlus 4 concept, however, actually does show a design that is in line with what we’re expecting to see from several different smartphone vendors in 2017. Beyond the look of the handset, DBS says its OnePlus 4 concept would include a Snapdragon 835 processor, 6GB RAM + 128GB ROM or 8GB RAM + 256GB ROM, dual 18-megapixel rear cameras, a 16-megapixel front-facing selfie camera, a 5.5-inch Quad HD display and a massive 5,000 mAh battery. As I mentioned, these specs are hardly outlandish and we can expect to see several flagship phones along these lines this year. Check out the full video (via Concept Phones) of this sleek OnePlus 4 concept below.

A spot check of Apple's online store reveals that most if not all 12.9-inch iPad Pro models are now estimated to ship in 2-3 weeks in the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and elsewhere—that's up from a shipping estimate of 1-2 weeks as recently as last weekend. Apple's in-store pickup tool lists most 12.9-inch iPad Pro models as available on March 3 to March 6 in locations ranging from New York and San Francisco to Toronto, Canada and London, England. Some models remain available for pickup as early as "today," but stock has increasingly depleted based upon our checks. 12.9-inch iPad Pro models are also largely out of stock or backordered by several weeks at resellers such as Best Buy, AT&T, and Verizon in the United States. That's in sharp contrast to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, which remains well stocked and available to ship immediately on both Apple's website and at resellers. Lengthy shipping times can sometimes indicate that a product refresh is imminent, but in this case, the supply chain could be to blame. In its latest earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company underestimated iPad demand this quarter and had an issue with one of its suppliers. Cook said he does not expect the shortage to be totally resolved this quarter, and that could reasonably explain why the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is increasingly hard to find. Apple analyst Neil Cybart of Above Avalon said Apple has been experiencing "increasingly noticeable supply chain troubles," as evidenced by long shipping estimates on products that launched months ago, such as Apple Watch Series 2 and AirPods. With a 2-3 week wait, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro can be added to that list. Rumors suggest Apple will launch an all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro with slimmer bezels as early as March—or as late as the second half of this year per hit-and-miss supply chain source DigiTimes. Apple is also expected to release updated 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models with faster A10X processors. Japanese blog Mac Otakara said the next-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro will feature a True Tone display like its current 9.7-inch counterpart, using advanced four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in the surrounding environment. The new 12.9-inch iPad Pro will also gain the 9.7-inch iPad Pro's same 12-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera and True Tone flash, and it will allegedly still have a 3.5mm headphone jack, according to the blog. "We've got some exciting things coming on iPad and I'm optimistic about where things are headed," Cook said last week.

 We're witnessing the slow-motion collapse of the smartwatch Steve Kovach Feb. 8, 2017, 3:45 PM 45,823 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson After several months of delays, an overhaul of its original vision, and some wrangling of hardware partners, Google's new smartwatch software, Android Wear 2.0, launches this week. But it comes after months of dour headlines for smartwatches and wearable gadgets. Tech geeks may hyperventilate over the newest wrist computer, but it's becoming apparent that most people are increasingly skeptical of the category. Pebble, the startup darling that was credited with popularizing the concept of a modern smartwatch, was forced to shut down after poor sales and sell itself to Fitbit at a major loss. Fitbit, despite its popularity, has had its own struggles, laying off 6% of its employees after disappointing holiday sales. Apple greatly pared down the capabilities of the Apple Watch, instead focusing the software on fitness-tracking and app notifications. Jawbone hasn't released a new product in nearly two years and has stopped selling devices altogether as it prepares to release a clinical-grade health tracker. And several of Google's most important Android Wear partners, such as Samsung, Motorola, and Huawei, have essentially abandoned Google's software. (Motorola, once a marquee Android Wear partner, had the strongest opposition to the operating system, citing a lack of "broad appeal" for smartwatches.) What you're witnessing is the slow-motion collapse of the smartwatch. The category will morph into something else, but it will ultimately fail to live up to the promise of being a new kind of computing platform that frees us from the smartphone. The LG Watch Sport and Style. The first two watches running Android Wear 2.0.Google Android Wear 2.0, which will debut this week on two new smartwatches made by LG and roll out to a handful of existing Android watches soon, is something of a reset for Google's smartwatch ambitions. Like we saw with the Apple Watch last year, many features have been dialed back in Android Wear to focus on a handful of activities such as messaging and fitness tracking. I've been testing one of those watches: the $349 LG Watch Sport. It's a heavy and chunky monstrosity that's tough for me to recommend to just about anyone. But the hardware isn't the whole story. This is a make-or-break moment for Google's smartwatch experiment, and I'm not confident it's going to work. Google is making a weak case for Android Wear. It's not building its own products, instead relying on fashion brands like Michael Kors and Fossil to carry the torch. This is despite Google's increased investment in excellent hardware, like the new Pixel phone and Home connected speaker that are designed to push the Android ecosystem forward. A member of the Android Wear team told me last week that the reason Google isn't making its own smartwatch is because Google sees smartwatches as more of an open ecosystem driven by personal style, so it wants to let in as many partners as possible. That's one way to look at it. The other way to look at it is Google sees the same writing on the wall that many of its other partners have, and time is running out to prove Wear is a viable platform. Instead of investing resources in building its own smartwatch, it put more of the burden on its partner LG. (Google did say Android Wear is gaining momentum, with holiday activations up 70% from the year before, but it declined to provide hard numbers. Take that stat with a healthy dose of skepticism.) Hollis Johnson The most recent data doesn't help Google's case either. According to a new report published this week by the research firm Canalys, 49% of smartwatches sold in 2016 were made by Apple, followed by Fitbit at 17% and Samsung at 15%. None of Google's Android Wear partners even made the list; they were lumped into the "other" category. I stand by what I said a few months ago: People don't want smartwatches. They want an Apple Watch or a basic fitness tracker like a Fitbit. After several days with the LG Watch Sport, I don't see anything in Android Wear that could turn things around. While Android Wear has been cleaned up and streamlined quite a bit — read my colleague Avery Hartmans' review for more details — there's no killer feature that makes me confident in the platform's longevity. It's just another smartwatch, the latest attempt to force a product category people don't need or want. The only glimmers of hope I found were in the fitness app's ability to track reps while you lift weights or perform other strength exercises like sit-ups. I haven't seen a fitness tracker do that yet, and it could turn into a killer feature for the category. The watch also has a 4G connection, so you can stream music directly to the device. Pair it with a set of Bluetooth headphones, and you can leave your phone at home while you work out. I have a feeling this is closer to what future wearables will be like — not a shrunken-down smartphone you wear on your wrist. If someone made a simple fitness tracker that let me stream music and do nothing else, I'd buy it immediately. But for now, I have a feeling Android Wear will continue to muddle along with the rest of the smartwatches.

Image credit: Reuters/Toby Melville The Tata Group has lost its place among the world’s top 100 brands, according to the latest Brand Finance Global 500 report. The salt-to-software conglomerate fell 21 places to 103 from the 82nd spot in the 2016 list. Its brand value fell to $13.11 billion (around Rs 88,105.75 crore) from $13.68 billion (approximately Rs 91,936.44 crore). The group’s downgrade is believed to be a fallout of the row between Tata Sons and its former chairperson Cyrus Mistry, who was ousted from the post last year. Bharti Airtel, Infosys, Life Insurance Corporation, State Bank of India and Larsen & Toubro are the other Indian companies on the list. While Airtel climbed to 190 in 2017 from 242 in 2016, Infosys rose to the 251st position from 301 last year. LIC also improved its ranking by 61 places, climbing to 222 from 283 in 2016. However, SBI and L&T dropped to 294 from 244 and 498 from 479, respectively. Globally, Google took over from Apple as the world’s most valuable brand, with its worth rising 24% to $109.4 billion (around Rs 7.35 lakh crore). Apple’s value declined sharply to $107.1 billion (some Rs 7.19 lakh crore) from $145.9 billion (approximately Rs 9.80 lakh crore). Amazon retained is third place on the rankings from last year, with US telecom giant AT&T and Microsoft rounding out the top five places on the list. Brand Finance CEO David Haigh said Apple had “struggled to maintain its technological advantage, with new iterations of the iPhone delivering diminishing returns”. The business valuation consultancy evaluates brands on the basis of their power and strength by analysing factors such as their marketing investment, familiarity, customer loyalty and corporate reputation. The overall brand strength is then used to determine how much of its revenue comes from the brand alone, after which the top 500 scores are published in the report.We welcome your comments at letters@scroll.in.

May and Cook discussed the company’s presence in the country in the aftermath of Brexit. Cook basically discussed with UK’s Prime Minister how Apple might adjust its business once the country leaves the European Union by 2019. A spokesperson for the Prime Minister called the meeting “a very positive and useful discussion”. Here’s the full quote: Apple have made a recent announcement about their investment in the UK and they had a conversation around that and the importance of government and business on digital skills which going forward will clearly be a huge part of the future industry. It was a chance for the prime minister to outline her plans for negotiating our EU exit. It was also a chance for her to reiterate and welcome Apple’s investment in the UK. Cook had a wonderful European adventure, documenting his trip on Twitter. Europe, of course, is very important to Apple as its second largest market by revenue. The Cupertino company is expanding its European presence with such initiatives as new retail stores. Additionally, Apple is building a brand new UK headquarters in London’s Battersea Power Station, expected to be complete by 2021. The CEO met European artists, app makers and even the furniture manufacturer Dula which builds some of the furniture used in Apple’s retail stores. All told, Cook was spotted in Marseille, Paris, Vreden, Berlin, Glasgow and London in recent days. Photo: Tim Cook arrives at Downing Street. Credit: Press Association.

While the LG G6 is still weeks away from announcement, we’ve compared the iPhone 7 and LG G6 based on rumours floating around the internet. Read next: iOS vs Android iPhone 7 vs LG G6 preview: UK pricing and availability Let’s first talk about pricing and availability for both the iPhone 7 and upcoming LG G6. The iPhone 7 was announced in September 2016 at an event alongside the larger iPhone 7 Plus and Apple’s wireless earphones, EarPods. While Apple strives to keep the pricing of the iPhone the same year-after-year, due to the weak GBP following Brexit in 2016, the price of the iPhone 7 went up to £599 for the base model, up from the £529 iPhone 6s. The LG G6 on the other hand, is yet to be announced. LG’s 2017 flagship is coming, though, as it recently sent out invites to a MWC 2017 (Mobile World Congress) event where the company historically has announced its flagship smartphone for the year. It’s not only LG that uses MWC as a platform for its flagship either, as Huawei is also rumoured to announce its 2017 flagship, the Huawei P10, at the event. Anyway, we digress. The grand reveal of the LG G6 is to take place on 26 February 2017 in Barcelona, with sources claiming that it’ll go on sale weeks later, on 10 March 2017. Though there’s no word yet on UK pricing, going by the price of LG’s 2016 flagship, the LG G6 will cost somewhere around the £529 mark. Read next: iPhone 7 review iPhone 7 vs LG G6 preview: Design and build The iPhone 7 is crafted from Series 7000 aluminium following the bendgate saga of the iPhone 6 Plus, and sports a rather sleek design – although it’s getting somewhat tired now, with only minor tweaks to the overall look over three iterations of the iPhone (iPhone 6, 6s and 7). Within the aluminium chassis is a 4.7in IPS LCD display which takes up roughly 65 percent of the front of the smartphone, with rather chunky (when compared to the likes of the Huawei Mate 9) bezels surrounding the display. Let’s get this clear: the iPhone 7 isn’t a bad-looking phone, with an antenna-less rear and curved edges along the aluminium chassis, but with gorgeous phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge on the market, we think it’s time that Apple switched it up a bit. The LG G6 on the other hand is said to sport a different design to the modular LG G5, offering a gorgeous blend of metal and glass – if recent leaks are anything to go by, anyway. Rumours suggest that the main draw of the LG G6 will be the display, which will apparently be practically edge-to-edge, and is even suggested in LG’s official MWC 2017 invite. But what more do we know? Rumours claim that it’ll feature a 5.7in display with curved edges, although not as curved as the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. In terms of resolution, it’s said to trump the 750 x 1334 iPhone 7 with a QHD+ (1440 x 2880) display, although we’re yet to hear specifics. The high screen-to-body ratio means there will only be a small gap above the display for the speaker, sensors and front-facing camera, and one beneath to don the LG logo (a bit of a waste of space, in our opinion). However, while the display of the LG G6 is said to be impressive, there’s no mention of any built-in pressure detection technology like the 3D Touch feature of the iPhone 7. While Android fans may remark that it’s a gimmick, as an avid fan of Apple’s 3D Touch technology, we think that it enhances the already great iOS experience available to iPhone 6s and 7 series users. The other big difference between the smartphones is a rather obvious one: the LG G6 reportedly does have a headphone port, while Apple made the decision to remove the headphone port on the iPhone 7. It comes with a Lightning-to-3.5mm port adapter in the box, but it’s not an ideal solution. Read next: iPhone 8 rumours iPhone 7 vs LG G6 preview: Features and spec Let’s dig a little deeper into the two flagship smartphones. The iPhone 7 features Apple’s own A10 Fusion chipset, comprised of a Quad-core 2.34GHz CPU and, per GSM Arena, a PowerVR Series7XT Plus six-core GPU, alongside 2GB of RAM. While that may seem slightly underwhelming on paper when compared to Android flagships, it’s worth noting that as Apple develops both the hardware and software for the iPhone, it can get more out of the tech. For example, the iPhone 7 scored incredibly highly in our graphics benchmarks, beating many rivals including the Galaxy S7. Per reports, LG decided to opt for the Snapdragon 821 processor over the top-of-the-line 835 as Samsung apparently has exclusivity for the chipset, and LG didn’t want to delay the launch of its flagship until after the announcement of the Galaxy S8. Although despite not using the most powerful processor available, the LG G6 is said to have a heavy focus on performance and according to sources, it’ll be extraordinarily powerful for a smartphone. Sources even claim it’ll have as much as 6- or 8GB of RAM, although we think that might be overkill. We assume that the high-end graphical power and gorgeous display will be used to provide great mobile VR experiences and will likely be a DayDream-enabled smartphone. Apple is also rumoured to be working on a VR/AR solution, although it seems like it’ll be a standalone device instead of something that utilises the iPhone itself. Security wise, both the iPhone 7 and LG G6 boast a fingerprint scanner; the iPhone 7 fingerprint scanner is embedded within the Home button, while the scanner of the LG G6 is said to be on the rear of the smartphone, like many other Android flagships. However, rumours suggest that the G6 could have another level of security; an iris scanner. While unconfirmed, if true, the G6 will have a built-in scanner separate from the front-facing camera that’ll scan users eyes as a way of authorisation. In terms of storage, it seems like the iPhone 7 is the clear winner here, offering not only a 32GB variant but also 128- and even 256GB storage options too. The LG G6 is rumoured to have a base storage of 32GB, although it’s unclear now whether it’ll feature a microSD card slot or if there will be higher-capacity variants available. One feature of the LG G6 that is yet to be announced is in the photography department. While a leaked render suggests that the LG G6 will have a rear-facing dual-camera setup, we’re not sure of the specifics and thus, we’re not quite sure how it’ll compare to the rear-facing 12Mp camera of the iPhone 7 which has been praised for its overall performance, and low-light photography. Read next: Best iPhone 7 and 7 Plus cases iPhone 7 vs LG G6 preview: Software Of course, one of the biggest differences between the iPhone 7 and the LG G6 is software; the iPhone 7 comes with iOS 10, the latest iteration of Apple’s iOS, while the LG G6 is rumoured to feature Android 7.0, aka Nougat. While iOS features Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant across iOS and macOS, the LG G6 is also rumoured to feature a virtual assistant – and it’s not Google Now. In fact, it’s rumoured that the LG G6 will be the first non-Google smartphone to feature Google Assistant. While some may be quick to point out that a Google Assistant-enabled Huawei Mate 9 was announced at CES 2017, the update is yet to roll out to users. Google Assistant looks to compete with the likes of Siri and Cortana on Windows 10, and much in the way that Siri can control HomeKit devices, Google Assistant can be used to control your smart home, amongst other things. Those looking to find out more about what iOS 10 and Android 7.0 Nougat feature should look at this: iOS 10 review and Android 7 Nougat review OUR VERDICT While there are leaked LG G6 specs online, we’re waiting until the official announcement of the LG G6 at MWC 2017 before we decide which is the better smartphone. Make sure you check back after the announcement for our final decision! Tags: iPhone Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too.

Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has been meeting with representatives of Apple, Amazon, Oracle, Cisco, and Qualcomm to discuss tech policy, and he’ll unveil an “innovation agenda” at an event at the Capitol next week, a Republican aide tells Ashley. The discussions center on issues like copyright reform, data privacy and high-skilled immigration, the aide said. The tech industry has long wanted to increase the number of H-1B visas allotted each year, and a draft executive order circulating in industry circles has raised fears that President Donald Trump wants to subject the program to new restrictions. Hatch, chairman of the Senate High-Tech Task Force, has sponsored a bill that would raise the H-1B cap. The senator’s meetings with tech started Wednesday and continue today. We’re tracking. Story Continued Below SESSIONS TAKES OVER DOJ TODAY — Tech is waking up this morning to the fact that Jeff Sessions, a foe of the industry on everything from surveillance to H-1Bs, will have the vast resources of the Justice Department at his disposal when he is sworn in as the new attorney general this morning. The Senate confirmed the Alabama Republican on a near party-line vote of 52-47 on Wednesday night after a bitter confirmation battle, and he resigned from the upper chamber as of midnight on Thursday. — As a member of Congress, Sessions was an outspoken critic of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his push for immigration reform, saying the tech mogul should hire more American workers. He took a shot at Apple during its fight with the FBI over a password-protected iPhone linked to the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. And Sessions’ vote against the USA Freedom Act, which ended the government’s bulk collection of phone records, has alarmed the tech community, which strongly backed the measure’s passage in the wake of Edward Snowden’s leaks about National Security Agency spying.

PRESENCE — The buzzy transportation startup that’s trying to make cross-country travel much, much faster is beefing up its Beltway operation. The company, which was inspired by an Elon Musk vision and has gone through some ups and downs this past year, is bringing on the Republican lobbying firm Jochum, Shore & Trossevin to focus on issues related to manufacturing, transportation and infrastructure. Hyperloop One also hired Dan Katz — who served as chief of staff at the Transportation Department and for the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) — as transportation policy counsel. “We can’t do first and ask permission later, we need permission in advance,” the company’s general counsel, Marvin Ammori, said of the regulatory approvals it needs to build its projects. BLACKBURN, WALDEN TALK TELECOM AGENDA — Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), chair of the House telecom subcommittee, told reporters Wednesday that she expects the FCC, not Congress, to make the first move on net neutrality and that she’s talking with her Senate colleagues on a “daily basis” about using the Congressional Review Act to revoke the FCC’s broadband privacy rules. Here are some other tidbits from the chat with Blackburn and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.), via Ashley: — On reorganizing the FCC: Blackburn, who held a hearing on reauthorizing the National Telecommunications and Information Association last week, said the FCC’s turn is next. “We’re doing our housecleaning and good housekeeping components first. As we look at reforms, reauthorizations are important,” Blackburn said, adding that it’s “item number one” on her agenda. — On wireless spectrum: Asked if the House would offer up a companion to the Mobile Now Act — the bill from Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) freeing up more government spectrum for commercial use — Walden said: “We look forward to the full Senate moving the legislation. … Clearly we all want to move forward on new technologies, innovations, to get things in the marketplace.” — On Lifeline: “We will certainly give Lifeline a good look,” Blackburn said, noting that FCC Chairman Ajit Pai “wasted no time” in tackling perceived problems with the low-income telecom subsidy program. (Pai removed nine companies as Lifeline broadband providers.) “We want to make sure waste, fraud and abuse in the program is rooted out,” she said. COMMERCE IG EYES FIRSTNET — Commerce Department Inspector General Peggy Gustafson said oversight of spending by FirstNet, the wireless broadband network for emergency responders, is a key priority as the program prepares to award one of its largest contracts. “Significant spending is going to begin this year in earnest,” Gustafson said at a Senate Commerce hearing Wednesday. “Everyone anticipates this network is going to cost tens of billions of dollars.” TRUMP GIVES INTEL FREE COMMERCIAL — In a meeting with President Trump in the White House on Wednesday, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich committed $7 billion to build a new chip factory in Arizona and hire at least 3,000 employees, an expansion that he attributed to Trump — even though some of the plans had been in the works for years, Tony and POLITICO’s Madeline Conway report. “After a meeting with Trump at the White House, the president essentially turned the microphone over to Krzanich for what amounted to a product unveiling in the Oval Office that aired for free on the major cable networks,” they write. “The Intel CEO touted the fact that the company makes the ‘majority’ of its products in the United States, showed off a new computer chip and stressed the company held off on ‘doing this investment until now.’” TECH-BACKED TRUMP TAX PETITION HITS NEW HIGH — The top-ranked petition on the White House’s We the People site — calling for release of the president’s tax returns — just hit the half-million signature mark, thanks in part to the digital organizing of “A.D.,” a.k.a. New York City entrepreneur and tech-world thinker Anil Dash, and others. That’s about 400,000 more signers-on than is required to trigger an official response from the White House, with about a week and a half left to go. TRANSITIONS — Pierson goes digital: Former Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson is now a senior strategist at Giles-Parscale, the Texas-based agency that was deeply involved in the campaign’s digital operation. Company president and Trump campaign digital director Brad Parscale tells MT that Pierson, who’s working out of Dallas and D.C., will focus on growing the firm’s political business. — Snap has brought on Laurent Balmelli, a co-founder of Strong.Codes, a startup that makes it harder for competitors to duplicate a company’s code, per Bloomberg. — Facebook has hired Mina Lefevre, an executive who ran scripted programming at MTV, to oversee both scripted and unscripted programming, also via Bloomberg. — The product teams behind YouTube Music and Google Play Music are reportedly being merged, which could mean a “single unified music app from Google” sometime in the future, according to The Verge. QUICK DOWNLOADS Oracle getting pressure from employees on immigration: Hundreds of Oracle workers have signed a petition urging the company to sign the amicus brief supporting Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson's lawsuit against Trump's immigration order, BuzzFeed reports.

The New York Times links up with Spotify for digital subscription deal: The publication and streaming platform have rolled out a deal that gives new, full-year subscribers to the NYT’s “All Access” digital package the ability to use Spotify Premium, Mashable reports. Faulty batteries linked to fire at Samsung factory: A minor fire at one of the company’s factories in China on Wednesday was attributed to waste products that included faulty batteries, Reuters reports. “Steve was the son of an immigrant”: During a fireside chat at the University of Glasgow in Scotland on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke about the company’s opposition to Trump’s immigration order and about Steve Jobs’ background as the son of a Syrian immigrant, VentureBeat reports. Facebook adds to Safety Check: Users are now able to leverage a new tool called Community Help to offer assistance to others in a disaster area, Recode reports. — The social network is also using machine learning to help flag discriminatory ads related to housing, credit and employment, according to a company blog post.

When the company launched its 'budget' iPhone 5c in 2013, it still cost an eye-watering £469. But the latest reports suggest that Apple's next device - thought to be called either the iPhone 8 or iPhone X - will be its most expensive yet, exceeding the $1,000 (£795) mark for the first time. The price was reportedly leaked to The Fast Company by "a source with knowledge of Apple's plans". The source said that Apple will be launching three devices this year - a massive 5.8-inch model (likely called the iPhone 8), a 5.5-inch model (called iPhone 7s Plus), and a 4.7-inch model (called iPhone 7s). The iPhone 8 will reportedly have a new OLED display that will stretch across the whole front of the phone. This is part of the reason for the high price tag, according to the source, as the OLED display will cost Apple roughly twice as much as the LCD display used in current iPhones. Read More iPhone 8 rumour: Apple planning to ditch iconic Home button and Touch ID fingerprint sensor The new phone is also likely to get a memory upgrade from the current iPhone 7 line, which will add to the cost of manufacturing the device. The source added fuel to previous rumours that the sides of the iPhone 8 will likely be made from stainless steel, with glass panels on both the front and back of the phone. The iPhone 8 will likely have glass panels on both the front and back of the phone The home button will be relocated underneath the display surface, they said, giving the front of the device the appearance of "a smooth black monolith". There's even a chance the physical buttons on the sides of the iPhone will be replaced with "touch-sensitive inlays in the metal". Read More iPhone sales are back on track - despite Apple killing the headphone jack The iPhone 8 is expected to have a much bigger battery than the current iPhone 7 line, and may also feature 3D-sensing technology, which could be used for facial recognition or some form of augmented reality application. The 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus and the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 are expected to each have dual-lens cameras, like the iPhone 7 Plus before them. iPhone 8 concept by Marek Weidlich (Photo: Marek Weidlich) However, the source contradicted recent rumours that the next iPhone could arrive early , claiming that Apple is expected to announce its new phones in the autumn and begin selling them soon afterwards. None of these features have been confirmed by Apple, and the company may choose to change the features and specs before launch. However, the report seems to tally with earlier rumours.

In the US, the UK, France and Germany, around a quarter of mobile users between the ages of 18 and 34 block mobile ads. More than a third of mobile users in France between the ages 18 and 24 don’t want to see mobile ads, which is the highest percentage among the respondents surveyed. eMarketer predicts that one-third of US internet users will block ads in 2017. Mobile Wallet Transactions in India Climb MediaNama reports that the number of mobile wallet transactions in India shot up by 75 million in December 2016, citing data from the Reserve Bank of India. The total amount of money transacted via mobile wallets also increased by INR 41.43 billion ($616 million) in December, a sign that consumers are becoming more comfortable with digital payment methods in a post-demonetization world. Apple, Android Roughly Even in US, UK Share Findings from Kantar’s Q4 2016 Worldpanel ComTech reveals the intense competition between Apple and Android smartphones. In both the UK and US markets, Android hovered at about half of sales while Apple garnered 47.6% and 44.4%, respectively. However, in comparison to Q4 2016, Apple sales were up while Android sales declined. In other countries, such as China and Italy, Android clobbered Apple with about 80% of all sales. eMarketer expects there will be 2.4 billion smartphone users worldwide in 2017. Films in China Bypass Theaters for Online Distribution The number of feature-length films released on the seven major video-on-demand (VOD) services in China totaled more than 2,500 in 2016, according to data from research firm EntGroup cited by TechNode. In contrast, 423 films made it into theaters in China, among them 92 foreign titles. Many VOD platforms offer film studios revenue sharing programs as enticements to host their movies. Amazon’s Alexa Now Multilingual Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service (AVS) is now available for developers building voice-enabled products for the UK and Germany. As a result, Amazon Echo, Amazon Dot and other products that support AVS will be able to understand British English and German. Classifieds Marketplace OLX Targets Women in Indonesia OLX, a digital classifieds service, launched a new Android app in Indonesia with features aimed at drawing more women and millennials. According to the service, which served as an intermediary for an average of 1.4 million transactions each month in the country in 2016, its user base largely consists of men over 30 years old. OLX has found Indonesia to be a growing market—the company reported that users there posted 170,000 ads on its service in 2016, an increase of 41.6% from the previous year. Gambling Site Bodog Offers Bitcoin Option Gambling site Bodog.eu is now offering deposits and withdrawals using the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, making Bodog the first major gaming brand to do so, according to the company. Bodog says the option will benefit gamers by cutting out the “double-dipping” involved in traditional currency transfers via banks and credit card companies. What India’s Demonetization Feels Like IRL Writing for Tech In Asia, Kylee McIntyre had a boots-on-the-ground report on the practical effects of demonetization in India, in which the government took two high-value denomination notes out of circulation as a move against corruption. McIntyre reports that many people could not pay for basic services or staples, and that lines at ATMs lasted for weeks. —Cliff Annicelli, Rahul Chadha, Rebecca Chadwick New in eMarketer PRO This Week Report: Ad Spending in Southeast Asia Report: Measuring Influencer Marketing StatPack US Mobile Coupons Forecast Data: US Ad Blocking Users Not a PRO subscriber?

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India Elections World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Best iPhone offers on Flipkart: 'Apple Fest' sheds prices of iPhone 7, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S models If you have been planning to buy an iPhone, Flipkart's Apple Fest could fetch you some great deals. Sami Khan   February 9, 2017 20:07 IST Apple iPhone 6sCreative Commons Apple iPhones aren't usually available on discounts, but Flipkart is making an exception with its "Apple Fest" sale. The ongoing sale ends on Friday (February 10), before which customers get attractive offers on iPhone 7, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S models. Flipkart's Apple Fest is widely promoting the hefty discounts buyers can fetch through its exchange programme. For instance, iPhone 6 16GB Space Grey variant is available with up to Rs. 24,000 off on exchange, which means the handset's cost will come right down to Rs 4,000. If you choose the silver shade, the exchange bonus comes down to Rs 20,000, and the selling price of the device is Rs 36,990. The conclusion is that the buyers need to check for the best offers not just based on their models, but also their storage and colour variants. The space grey variant of the iPhone 6 also fetches an extra five per cent off on using Axis Bank Buzz credit cards. While the offer seems too tempting, we had to independently investigate it only to find out it's certainly not as worthy as it sounds. Under the exchange offer, the maximum discount of Rs 24,000 is only given to iPhone 6S Plus. And who would want to exchange a better version of the iPhone for an older generation? The Apple Fest also highlights offers on other iPhone models. They are listed below for your reference: iPhone 5S 16GB Price: Rs 18,999 Offers: Up to Rs 15,000 off on exchange and five per cent off on Axis Bank Buzz credit cards. iPhone 6S 32GB Price: Rs 44,999 Offers: Up to Rs 20,000 off on exchange and five per cent off on Axis Bank Buzz credit cards. iPhone 6S Plus 16GB (Silver) Price: Rs 49,999 Offers: Up to Rs 20,000 off on exchange and five per cent off on Axis Bank Buzz credit cards. iPhone 7 128GB (Jet Black) Price: Rs 65,000 Offers: Flat Rs 5,000 off, up to Rs 20,000 off on exchange and five per cent off on Axis Bank Buzz credit cards. iPhone 7 Plus 128GB (Black) Price: Rs 77,000 Offers: Rs 5,000 off, up to Rs 20,000 off on exchange and five per cent off on Axis Bank Buzz credit cards.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Feb 9, 2017 at 8:37AM Over the past 12 months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has absolutely trounced the S&P 500, surging 40.4%, from just under $95 per share to about $132 at the time of this writing. This rise compares with the S&P 500's 22% gain during the same period. Interestingly, the performance of Apple's business during this period hasn't been particularly impressive. So, what drove the stock higher? Boring results In Apple's most recently reported trailing-12-month period, results actually look quite dismal. During this period, revenue fell 7% and earnings per share tumbled an even steeper 11.3%. Yet Apple stock surged higher. Image source: Apple. Sure, Apple's financial results have turned upward recently, with the tech giant reporting 3.3% and 9.6% year-over-year increases in revenue and EPS for the company's most recently reported quarter. But this is just one quarter. Further, these aren't the sort of results often associated with 40% rises in a stock price -- especially when referring to a popular tech company. But despite Apple's lackluster performance in the past 12 months, shares have climbed higher and easily outperformed the market. Valuation matters So if Apple's business saw both revenue and EPS decline in the past 12 reported months, why are shares trading higher? While investors could come up with a range of reasons, one catalyst for the stock during this period likely stands out the most: Apple stock was undervalued. AAPL PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts One year ago, Apple stock had a mind-boggling low price-to-earnings ratio of just 10. For context, the average P/E of stocks in the S&P 500 at the time was 21.4, more than double Apple's. Combining this dirt-cheap valuation with Apple's dividend, its sizable repurchase program, and the company's long history of successful products, it was clear that the Street had oversold Apple stock as the market worried about the company's ability to continue growing its business. Sure, Apple's stock probably didn't justify the same 20 P/E its peers in the S&P 500 averaged, but the stock almost certainly didn't deserve to trade at a P/E of 10. What's next for Apple stock? Going forward, can Apple stock continue soaring? While Apple's higher price-to-earnings ratio today of nearly 16 does a better job of pricing in a more optimistic outlook for the company, investors should keep in mind that the stock's 40% rise during the past 12 months doesn't automatically make Apple stock expensive today. Indeed, the stock is arguably still a buy. For Apple to live up to its valuation today, the company will need to return to more consistent revenue growth and maintain pricing power -- two outcomes that shouldn't be a problem for the company. Yes, revenue and EPS are down in the trailing 12 months, but Apple's return to growth recently, it's fast-growing services segment, and consistently strong pricing power, all point to a bright future for Apple's business -- and a bright future for the underlying business when a stock is trading at just 16 times earnings likely means the stock will perform well, too.  Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry  ⋮  Mobile iPhone 7 Is Losing Out to OPPO and Huawei, But Not in the Region You Think By Omar Sohail Feb 6, 2017 31Shares Share Tweet Submit Despite its impressive run when it announced its Q4 2016 financial results, Apple and its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have taken a thrashing at the hands of emerging Android smartphone giants, and the surprising thing is that Samsung isn’t even included in this bout. iPhone 7 Is Losing Out to Major Players Like OPPO, Huawei, and Vivo in the Chinese Smartphone Market The year 2016 saw Apple’s first ever year-over-year decline in the Chinese smartphone market. Despite the boatload of features it offers in mobile devices, we believe that price is still a major contributor to why consumers are opting to look for alternatives in the shape and size of high-end Android offerings. IDC reports that overall, the smartphone market did well in China, as it states the following: Advertisement “Smartphone market in China saw a 19% YoY growth and 17% QoQ growth in 2016Q4. For the full year of 2016, the market grew by 9% with top Chinese smartphone vendors taking up a larger share of the market. The 4 Chinese vendors in the top five were the same in 2015, and their share grew from 46% in 2015 to 57% in 2016. This shows the growing local acceptance of Chinese vendors in its home country with the improvement in product features and better marketing messages seen in the past year.” However, the report did not have anything encouraging to say about Apple and its new iPhone, even though it states that the new Jet Black version certainly caught a few eyes. The report goes on to say that the announcement of the new iPhone 8 will certainly attract the Android crowd into trying out Apple’s yearly improving smartphone ecosystem. “2016 was the first time ever that Apple saw a YoY decline in the PRC market. Even though the new black colored iPhones caught the attention of consumers, overall, the new launches did not create as much of a frenzy compared to the past. Despite the decline, IDC does not believe Chinese vendors have actually eaten away Apple’s market share. Most Apple users are expected to be holding out for the new iPhone that will be launched this year, and that will help the brand to see a growth in 2017. Apple’s 10-year anniversary iPhone will also likely attract some of the high-end Android users in China to convert to an iPhone.” Currently, manufacturers who are intending to release flagships this year are preparing their own versions of virtual assistants in order to boost smartphone sales as well as take on Apple’s own assistant, Siri. What do you have to say about Apple’s performance in China? Let us know your thoughts right away.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry [Updated: More Join] Apple, Facebook, Google, Uber, and Others File Legal Brief to Oppose President’s Immigration Order By Rafia Shaikh Feb 6, 2017 15Shares Share Tweet Submit "Call me" - Donald Trump to tech leaders at December's tech summit The country’s biggest tech companies filed a legal brief late Sunday in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals opposing President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration – also known as the immigration ban. Apple, Google, Facebook, and over 90 other companies have filed this amicus brief. Tech firms legally fight against President’s immigration ban “Ninety-seven companies, from Apple Inc. to Zynga Inc., filed an impassioned legal brief condemning President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration, stepping up the industry’s growing opposition to the policy,” Bloomberg reported on Monday. Last week, reports had indicated that the industry was considering to send a joint letter to the President opposing his immigration ban. In this letter – leaked last week – the industry had emphasized the importance of immigrants in the economy. Bloomberg added that while the companies had originally planned to file the brief later this week, they “accelerated efforts over the weekend after other legal challenges to the order.” President Trump had issued an executive order on January 27, imposing a 90-day ban affecting travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day ban on all refugees. On Friday, a federal judge put a temporary nationwide block on the order after other legal challenges. Advertisement A total of 97 companies have filed this legal brief. These include Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Netflix, Snap, Uber, Twitter, Zynga, and Intel. Amazon wasn’t listed in the brief as the CEO Jeff Bezos was backing the original lawsuit by Washington state’s attorney general that had resulted in a temporary halt to the immigration ban on Friday. When Billionaires Meet: Foxconn's Response to Trump's All-American iPhone (Satire) While most of the companies that signed the letter are tech firms, there were a few exceptions, including yogurt producer Chobani and fashion brand Levi Strauss. Both of them, like several tech companies, were founded by immigrants. “The Order represents a significant departure from the principles of fairness and predictability that have governed the immigration system of the United States for more than fifty years,” the brief stated. Immigrants or their children founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list. Immigrants make many of the Nation’s greatest discoveries, and create some of the country’s most innovative and iconic companies. America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants – through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country. Of course, the federal government can and should implement targeted, appropriate adjustments to the nation’s immigration system to enhance the Nation’s security. But a broad, open-ended ban – together with an indication that the ban could be expanded to other countries without notice – does not fit the goal of making the country more secure. Instead, it will undermine American interests. [Updated]: 128 now A report from TechCrunch suggests that an additional 31 companies have filed to join the amicus brief, including SpaceX, Tesla, ZenDesk, Evernote, Coursera, Udacity, TripAdvisor, and Adobe.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor VR Enthusiast Claims Apple AR Headset Release Will Take Place This Year By Omar Sohail Feb 6, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple was previously rumored to have partnered with Carl Zeiss to roll out an Apple AR-capable headset, but the details regarding that rumor stated that the tech giant was probably going to release the product in 2018. However, one VR evangelist lays down his thoughts, and to bring you up to speed, those thoughts revolve around the release of the Apple AR headset taking place this year. Robert Scoble Predicts That an Apple AR Headset Is Going to Be Released This Year – Date Has Been Moved up Considerably According to sources present at high levels who are involved in this matter, Scoble has laid down his prediction regarding the release of the Apple AR headset, which he predicts is going to take place this year. During the ‘This Week in Tech’ show with several individuals onboard, Scoble stated that an announcement could take place as early as 2017, but was also open to providing info that this announcement could very be taking place until 2018. Since Apple’s iPhone 8 is going to be the primary bread and butter of the company, the tech giant is naturally going to focus on this product rather than have any other obstacle in its path. Advertisement According to a previously published report, Apple is working behind the scenes to bake augmented reality into the native iPhone Camera app. By doing so, it will allow the users to identify objects as soon as they point their smartphones at them. Apart from recognizing objects, it seems as though AR will be able to manipulate people’s faces as well and recognize people as well. This feature alone can be handy in a lot of ways, which we will find out shortly in the foreseeable future. A prototype phase for this headset might have already begun, and if there are no production hurdles with other important product lineups on Apple’s shelf, then it is more than possible that a summer announcement for an Apple AR-capable headwear takes place.

Just ask Donald Trump to fix it Nassim Khadem 10 Feb 2017, 6:28 a.m. Apple was slugged with an $18b fine by the EU last year but the company will be smiling if Donald Trump's US tax plan gets off the ground. Tax bill? Just ask Donald Trump to fix it US President Donald Trump would give multinationals a special tax break if they brought profits to be taxed back to the US. Photo: Olivier Douliery, Bloomberg Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Can Donald Trump's tax plan save Apple from paying a €13 billion ($18.2 billion) tax bill to Ireland? Probably not, but the US President could still put his hand up for a share of the pie. Recall that in August Apple was ordered by repay €13 billion in taxes and interest after European Commission found the software giant's Irish tax structure was "illegal under EU state aid rules". This week Margrethe Vestager, a Danish politician, who is currently serving as the European Commissioner for Competition and took on the Apple case last year, said that regardless of what Trump does ("whatever US tax reform they may pass is, of course, for them") the ruling stands. "What is important for us is ... if any company or group of companies gets selective advantages by member states and thereby unlevelling (sic) the playing field." But what if other countries might want a share of the tax owed? As Vestager noted a her statement after the decision last year: "It may be that not all the unpaid taxes are due in Ireland. Other countries, in the EU or elsewhere, can look at our investigation." She continues: "If they conclude that Apple should have recorded its sales in those countries instead of Ireland, they could require Apple to pay more tax locally. That would reduce the amount to be paid back to Ireland." This leads to Trump's tax plan. He wants some of the $2.5 trillion profits that Fortune 500 companies hold offshore to be brought back to the US. To do this, Trump has proposed giving them a special one-off 10 per cent rate on their offshore earnings rather than taxing them at the full 35 per cent US corporate tax rate. A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a non-profit, non-partisan think tank that works on state and federal tax policy issues, suggests Apple could gain a $US48.1 billion ($62.9 billion) tax break because of Trump's proposal. "Under current rules, Apple should pay $67.3 billion in taxes when its $216 billion in earnings being held offshore are repatriated," the report says, noting the calculation is based on the estimated 3.8 per cent tax rate the company has paid to other governments on its offshore earnings. Ordinarily Apple would be subject to a 31.2 per cent tax on these earnings upon repatriation. But under Trump's planned repatriation of 10 per cent, it would allow the company to pay just $19.2 billion, representing a $48.1 billion tax break compared to the $67.3 billion it would otherwise owe. No wonder Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he will repatriate several billion dollars of cash held overseas to the US this year. But it is not just Apple that stands to gain from the proposed tax holiday. The ITEP report examines the benefit to the 10 companies with the most money offshore – Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Citigroup, Amgen, Qualcomm, Gilead Sciences, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs Group, and Bank of America. The report suggests  that Trump's plan would allow US companies to collectively pay an estimated $206 billion in taxes on their $2.5 trillion in offshore earnings, rather than the roughly $720 billion that they would owe if these earnings were subject to the statutory corporate tax rate. "In other words, Trump's proposal would give US companies a tax break of up to $514 billion," it says. Rather than rewarding tax avoidance for a short-term revenue boost, the report calls on lawmakers to pursue legislation that would require companies to pay the full $720 billion they owe on their unrepatriated earnings. Meanwhile in Australia the Australian Taxation Office, equipped with tougher anti-avoidance laws, has been investigating a number of multinationals over their tax structures. Apple is among a number of technology companies currently under audit by ATO over its transfer pricing structures. According to its latest accounts filed with the corporate regulator ASIC, Apple's Australian revenue fell $296 million, or 3 per cent, to hit $7.5 billion in 2016. Its profit fell $119 million, or 97 per cent, to $3.6 million, which was largely due to an increase in the company's reported tax expense. Apple paid $128 million in income tax ($69.8 million related to FY2016) and there was an adjustment of $58.3 million relating to prior years. The tech giant's local tax bill has fluctuated over the years, but is up from $85 million in 2015 and $80.3 million in 2014. The story Tax bill?

Today we look at the iPhone 7 Plus Rating:  4 Typical Price:  £720.00 Pros:  Great build quality, Waterproofing, Amazing cameras, Super-powerful chipset Cons:  No 3.5mm headphone socket, No quick-charging capability Verdict:  More RAM, a bigger battery and a serious impressive dual-camera setup makes the iPhone 7 Plus a much better purchase than the standard model - assuming you have no issue with the increased cost and larger size facebook twitter google+ The signs were there a long time before the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launched, but as much as the rumour mill hits the mark year-on-year there's always an element of not being quite sure what will arrive on announcement day. We, and many others, gave Apple the benefit of the doubt  despite the fact that plenty of rumours consistently said that 2016's iPhones will be incremental updates, and the big release to watch is the iPhone 8 (if it is indeed called that) launching for the iPhone's 10th birthday in 2017. So, sure enough, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus look very much like last year’s models, despite a tweak here and there, plus  a couple of new colour options in the form of “Jet Black” (gloss) and “Black” (matte). They have slightly updated internals, and an impressive new camera. And one other big rumour turned out to be true, also one we were hoping would not be. Neither handset has a 3.5mm headphone jack, which really does suck despite Apple’s claims to the contrary about being “brave” for removing it. The workaround Apple has come up with is an adapter which will ship with all iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 units, but for audiophiles who love their own carefully chosen headsets, it's another layer of faff. Apple says its sold a billion iPhones since 2007, which is impressive. The pace of adoption over the years has been frankly insane. But that party is drawing to an end. As we saw earlier this year, things, while still very respectable, are beginning to slow down. Tim Cook glossed over dipping sales in 2016 but that’s to be expected. Apple’s main MO for the event was simply to show off how many brands it is now associated with – brands like Nike, Pokemon, Nintendo and, err… James Cordon. Apple's sales improved in late-2016, however, as demand for iPhones picked up again.  “During the first eight months of 2016, Apple saw its smartphone market share remain at a record low compared to the last few years. However, the iPhone 7 series launch has been able to offset most of the previous decline. The iPhone 7 series demand was healthy through the holiday period, especially in markets such as USA, Western Europe and Japan somewhat offsetting a softer than expected performance in China. Apple surpassed Samsung in December 2016 capturing a 19% share of the global smartphone sell-through volumes," said Jeff Fieldhack, Research Director at Counterpoint Research. He added: "Furthermore, Apple’s share of the $400+ segment crossed the 70% mark in December 2016 from a low point of 47% in May 2016, which is commendable considering the premium segment growth has been flat annually. A healthy sell-through of iPhones in the channel points toward a strong holiday quarter from a shipments perspective and strong wholesale ASP as the mix shifted towards higher capacity and larger screen iPhone models. In markets, such as the USA, Apple’s share in the premium segment has reached close to a record 80% in this peak season.” Apple’s decision to move to a three-year hardware cycle has been met with a lot of resistance. Many feel the iPhone 6 design language the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are based on are tired and in need of a refresh. Whether you agree is entirely subjective. Personally, I don’t mind the way they look, though I definitely wouldn’t buy one of these right now as I am infinitely more interested in the Google Pixel XL – but that’s just me. Apple has implemented a few key changes but for the most part the average consumer will struggle to tell the iPhone 7 Plus from the iPhone 6s Plus – and even the iPhone 6 Plus for that matter. And herein lies the rub: Apple’s switching to a three-year hardware cycle, which is all well and good, but aside from a few key changes to imaging and performance, there’s not a lot on show here to get really excited about. This is the kind of update I’d expected to follow the iPhone 6 – the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus feel very much like an S-update. Not a whole number bump, which are traditionally the more innovative releases for Apple, showcasing new design attributes and advanced technology. I like that the iPhones are now waterproof, that’s a solid move by Apple, but I just can’t help but feel a lot of people, those upgrading from 6s models, especially, might feel short-changed by what’s on offer here. The are some big pluses like the camera and waterproofing, but beyond this it almost feels like the same handset we saw released in 2014 and 2015. And this is not something I expect from a company that claims to be the most innovative brand in technology. Apple knows what its users like, so it says, and it knows how to give it to them. This is why it is the biggest tech brand in the world. The split in features between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, however, is only getting bigger. I mean, save for size, I cannot think of a good reason not to get the Plus over the standard model. Case in point: for the first time ever, shipments of the iPhone 7 Plus model have out-paced the standard iPhone 7 model. This is significant because it not only shows a maturation inside Apple’s traditional user base, they’re warming to the idea of larger phones, but it also shines a light on just how important consumers see the cameras on their phones. Apple says the iPhone 7 Plus is the best camera it has ever created. Whether this is the case will be detailed later on. We've already delivered our verdict on the standard iPhone 7, but for those who crave a big-screen experience, the 7 Plus is likely to be of more interest. We'll be covering the key differences between the two siblings in this review, but won't be going into as much detail on the elements which are common across both phones - you can refer to our iPhone 7 review for those points. iPhone 7 Plus Review: Design & Display The 7 Plus shares an almost identical design to the smaller model, with the only significant difference - aside from the dimensions - being the fact that it has a dual camera setup on the back, which we'll cover later in this review. In every other regard this is simply just a bigger iPhone 7, so we advise you to refer to that review for more information. It goes without saying that the iPhone 7 Plus boasts a larger screen than the standard model. Its 5.5-inch backlit LED panel has a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels, which is a jump from the 4.7-inch, 750 x 1334 pixel screen on the smaller model. A 1080p display on a phablet isn't all that impressive in 2016, and many smaller Android phones have sharper screens. However, as was the case with the standard iPhone 7, it's impossible to pick out individual pixels so it's not that much of a concern. The panel is brighter and better at replicating colours than the one seen on the iPhone 6S Plus, which should give existing iPhone fans reason to upgrade. Next year, however, is when things will get really interesting as Apple is moving over to AMOLED panels and that will bring a whole host of benefits to the iPhone 8 or iPhone X or whatever next year’s handset is called, the least of all being a bump to QHD resolution. Like most things iPhone 7, the display technology on show here is just about par for the course. Apple has made some tweaks and improvements to the overall quality of the panel, which is expected, but it pales in comparison to the displays you find aboard the Galaxy S7 and Google Pixel XL. iPhone 7 Plus Review: Hardware Specifications In terms of technical specifications, the 7 Plus is an exact match to the iPhone 7, aside from RAM - the larger model has 3GB while the smaller version has 2GB. To be honest, it's hard to notice any real difference in day-to-day use, although the additional gigabyte should ensure smoother performance on the 7 Plus in the long run. The powerful A10 Fusion chipset is something of a beast, and we weren't able to make it stutter or stumble during the review period. It's that good. Apple has an immense command over the silicon inside its phones and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are no exception. The A10 chipset is the most advanced chipset in the world right now – nothing else comes close to what Apple is able to do with this chipset. But like the design, this bump in performance just sort of fades into the background. For most consumers it is not a standout feature, as the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 before it were also pretty exceptional in this regard as well. In fact, for the last three generations of iPhones I don’t recall anyone saying they weren’t potent enough in the performance department. The A10 is more power-efficient as well but in my experience the battery life of the iPhone 7 Plus, in the long term, is pretty similar to what I experienced on the iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 6 Plus before that. It’s good, solid and will see you through a full day with heavy usage but compared to what I’m regularly getting on my Pixel XL it’s nothing to right home about. iPhone 7 Plus Review: Camera Aside from the screen, this is one of the key areas where the 7 Plus differs from the normal iPhone 7. It has the same 12 megapixel lens as its smaller stablemate, which boasts an aperture of f/1.8 and OIS, allowing for really effective low-light shooting. However, the 7 Plus is packing a second 12 megapixel, f/2.8 telephoto lens which gives x2 optical zoom and works in conjunction with the other camera to create some impressive depth-of-field effects. When taking a photo, the phone uses the data from both lens to create a depth map and then applies a nifty "Bokeh" effect to blur out the background and bring the subject into sharper focus. While the effect is artificial to degree, it's convincing - and to achieve it via normal means you'd need an expensive DSLR camera with a wide aperture, so what Apple has achieved here is remarkable. The telephoto lens also allows for incredible macro shots, and once you've taken a few snaps with the 7 Plus, you'll wonder how you ever coped without it. iPhone 7 Plus Review: Audio So yes, the 3.5mm headphone jack is gone in favour of the Lightning port and a new set of Lightning-based headphones bundled-in with the phones. What's also bundled-in is an adaptor dongle allowing users to keep using their 3.5mm headphones with the new devices. However, the iPhone 7 series non-headphone audio setup has also been upgraded; it's the first set of iPhone devices with stereo speakers! On top of this, Apple has also developed a set of wireless "Airpods" allowing you to free yourself from wired headphones altogether. The Airpods feature a 24 hour battery life and are button-less, their setup is also synchronised across iCloud between devices. They use a dedicated W1 chip for audio and wireless, while built-in infrared sensors detect when you place them in your ears. Motion accelerometers detect touch to activate Siri and Voice accelerometer enhance your voice for calls and commands. They will ship in October and cost $159.  iPhone 7 Plus Review: Battery Life There's a 2900 mAh battery inside the 7 Plus, which is a big jump from the 1960 mAh cell seen in the smaller model. Stamina could be something of a concern with the standard iPhone 7, but that's not the case with the Plus model - even by the end of the day, our review unit still had juice in the tank and we were able to push it a lot more in terms of playing games, watching movies and surfing the web. Apple’s larger iPhones have always been good in the battery department and the iPhone 7 Plus is no exception. Even with very heavy usage the handset can still take a full day in its stride. Nothing really fazes the handset, whether gaming, video or streaming.   iPhone 7 Plus Review: Conclusion If you must buy an iPhone in 2016 the iPhone 7 Plus is the model to go for. The standard iPhone 7 model is just, well… disappointing on too many fronts. Battery performance isn’t great, the display pales in comparison to cheaper Android alternatives and it lacks the iPhone 7 Plus’ main USP, the dual-lens camera. For this reason it’s impossible to recommend the iPhone 7 over the iPhone 7 Plus. The Plus model, as always, is the vastly superior model. But you will have to pay a premium to access these benefits – and also use a larger phone as well. Then there’s the case for whether or not you NEED to upgrade. If you’re using an iPhone 6s I would 100% say wait for Apple’s 2017 release. There’s nothing too new here to get massively excited about. It’s an iPhone and it works great, just like the iPhone 6s before it. I don’t see any major USPs on this handset that you can’t get elsewhere for less. I tend to use iPhones on occasion, I used the iPhone 4, iPhone 5s an iPhone 6 Plus as well as the iPhone SE, but I have no desire to use either the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. Instead, I’m waiting for next year’s model and filling the interim with the awesome Google Pixel XL. You might feel differently, and if you’re using an older iPhone – say, the iPhone 5s or iPhone 6 – then the case for an upgrade is slightly different. If you’re using an older iPhone model then the case for an update is strong – you will notice the difference. For everybody else, though, hold tight for 2017’s release as that one will be very impressive indeed!

More like this Apple's bezel-free iPhone 8 -- what to expect This year's iPhones expected to get wireless charging 10 years -- The Evolution of Apple's iPhone Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! Better start saving now, if you want the next iPhone. We drop some serious cash on our smartphones, but how much is too much? Apple is hoping that loyal customers are willing to spend more than ever before to buy the 10th anniversary iPhone. So how much will it cost, and what features will it sport? In IT Blogwatch, we see how much we have in savings.  So what is happening? Mark Spoonauer shares some background: If you've been following...the iPhone 8 rumors, you...have a good sense of what to expect, from an OLED display and less stupid Siri to the lack of a Touch ID button. The latter would be integrated into the screen. ... But a new report says the iPhone 8, which could be called the iPhone X (for the iPhone's 10th anniversary) might not have any buttons at all...Oh, and it could...cost $1,000. That is a pretty hefty price tag. Is it unheard of in the smartphone industry? And why would Apple make it so expensive? Chris Mills has some more info on that: That’s well above the traditional...pricetag for a flagship phone, although not unprecedented. The most expensive iPhone 7 Plus costs $1,000 with tax...given that Apple was sold out of the iPhone 7 Plus for three months following launch, it might have decided that it’s time to test the upper end of the phone market. ... Also...creating a groundbreaking new device will cost serious money. Curved, no-bezel OLED screens -- what the iPhone 8 is rumored to use -- don’t come cheap, and neither do dual-camera modules, or a fingerprint sensor that works from behind a touchscreen...raising prices might be the only option. But is the price worth it? What other features will the iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) have? Mark Sullivan has more details: There’s...a chance...the physical buttons on the sides of the iPhone may go away...replaced by touch-sensitive inlays in the metal. ... Our source says Apple has been working with Lumentum...on 3D-sensing technology...It remains unclear how the technology will be applied, however. It could be used to recognize the user’s face for authentication...[or] in the camera to provide better image resolution. It could even be used in some form of augmented reality application. And will a $1,000+ iPhone be the only option for consumers? Stacy Liberatore is in the know: Apple...is also rumored to be launching two other smartphones along with the iPhone 8 -- a 4.7-inch...iPhone 7s and a 5.5-inch...iPhone 7s Plus. So is all of this set in stone? Juli Clover thinks we should remember something: The iPhone 8 is expected to include a glass body with a stainless steel frame...for...the display...we've heard everything from 5 inches to 5.8-inches. ... With such major changes expected for the 2017 iPhone...rumors have been running rampant for months, making it hard to suss out some of the exact specifications of the device...As we...start to see the first part leaks, we can expect to have a...clearer picture of what to expect from the first significant iPhone redesign since 2014. Is that all? Anything else we can expect? Wyatt makes some predictions: iPhone 7: no headphone jack iPhone 8: no physical buttons iPhone 9: no screen iPhone 10: no phone. literally just air To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Advances their 3D Mapping and Optical Scanning Technology | Main | Cool: Apple Invents a Dual Display MacBook that a User will be able to use Outdoors with Sunglasses on » February 09, 2017 Apple Invents Flexible Displays and Electronics to Work with Future iDevices, Clothing, Smart Windows & more   Patently Apple's other blog called Patently Mobile has covered the advances of flexible displays from Samsung for years. You could check out some of the major ones here: (one, two, three and four. The most interesting ones relate to a possible scrollable smart device. Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that reveals their work on flexible displays and electronics that will extend to specialty applications. Beyond applying their revealed technology to known devices such as a smartphone or tablet, Apple see's the technology being widely adopted into smart clothing, smart windows, applications in vehicles, furniture and more. One of the inventors on the patent previously worked for a company where they made flexible medical devices, skin-mounted epidermal electronics and even next gen flexible processors. So this is a serious invention that is likely to work through the system over time and eventually to market. It's not just pie in the sky thinking.   Traditional displays and touch sensors mounted in a device may be subject to stress-induced failures. As devices with flexible displays are being considered for the future, Apple has to invent new and improved input-output methodologies to accommodate such displays.   Apple notes that their invention relates to a flexible input-output device such as a display or a display with integrated sensors and haptic output may be formed from an elastomeric substrate layer.   The substrate layer may have signal paths to which an array of electrical components may be mounted. Openings or thinned areas may be formed in the elastomeric substrate layer between the signal paths.   An array of through-hole openings may be formed in the substrate to create a mesh-shaped substrate that can be stretched in one or more dimensions. The signal paths that extend between the openings to interconnect the electrical components may have serpentine shapes that help to accommodate stretching.   A display or other component in an electronic device may have stretchable lighting structures. A stretchable lighting unit may, for example, have a stretchable light guide formed from a sheet of elastomeric material and a stretchable light source. The stretchable light source may be formed from light-emitting diodes that are coupled to each other using stretchable signal paths such as signal paths formed from serpentine signal lines.   Apple's patent FIG. 18 noted below is a perspective view of an illustrative stretchable lighting unit in accordance with an embodiment of this invention.   Apple's patent FIG. 18 is a key figure to this invention. In this figure we're able to see a perspective view of an illustrative stretchable lighting structure 100 which could include a stretchable light source #102 and stretchable light guide #104.   The stretchable light guide may be formed from a stretchable transparent layer such as layer #112. This Layer may be formed from a sheet of transparent elastomer such as a stretchable clear plastic (e.g., silicone, etc.).   Light may be emitted into the interior of this layer along the edge (edge surface) #116 or may be otherwise launched into layer #112. In the example of FIG. 18, the light source has a plurality of light-emitting components #24 (e.g., components containing light-emitting diodes and/or other circuitry) along the edge that are electrically connected to control circuitry and/or each other using paths #42 (e.g., stretchable serpentine signal paths or other stretchable signal paths). Light from the components in source #102 is launched into layer (light guide layer) #112 and is distributed throughout the layer by total internal reflection.   All or selected parts of layer #112 may be provided with light scattering structures such as light scattering features #114 of FIG. 18. Light scattering features may be formed from protrusions, recesses, patterned coating material on the surfaces of the layer, embedded microbeads, other light-scattering particles, or other embedded structures, and/or other structures that scatter light out of the entire layer.   Apple's patent FIG. 19 above is a perspective view of a stretchable lighting unit showing how a lighting unit may be stretched by a user; FIG. 43 is a perspective view of an illustrative stretchable light guide that is conforming to a curved surface of an object or device.   Apple's patent FIG. 17 is a schematic diagram of illustrative input-output devices for an electronic device that include a stretchable lighting unit and other structures; FIG. 2 is a perspective view of an illustrative flexible input-output device having an array of components; is a perspective view of an illustrative flexible input-output device that has been deformed into a dome shape – like a mouse.   Applicable to Traditional Types of Devices   Apple notes that their latest technology could apply to form all or part of a future tablet computer, laptop computer, a desktop computer, a monitor that includes an embedded computer, a monitor that does not include an embedded computer, a display for use with a computer or other equipment that is external to the display, a cellular telephone, a media player, a wristwatch device or other wearable electronic equipment.   Also Applicable to All-New Applications and Devices   More interesting in context with this invention, Apple future notes that their invention could apply to future equipment that is integrated into furniture, equipment that is integrated into a vehicle, equipment that is built into windows or architectural elements in a building, a kiosk, seating, clothing, a strap for a bag or watch, a lanyard or other structure for supporting a pendant device, a cover or other enclosure for a portable device (e.g., a bag, a computer case, a phone case, a tablet computer cover, etc.), or other suitable device.   Micro-LED Display   Apple notes that these future flexible display may include light-emitting pixels based on organic light-emitting diodes, discrete crystalline light-emitting diode dies (sometimes referred to as micro-light-emitting diodes or micro-LEDs), or other suitable pixel elements." Interesting enough, Apple acquired LuxVue in 2014 that was on the cutting edge of micro-LED technology.   Apple's patent application 20170040306 is actually a continuation patent that was filed back in Q4 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   About Apple's Sr. Emerging Display Technologist   One of the inventors listed on Apple's patent filing is Yung-Yu Hsu, a Sr. Emerging Display Technologist. He's noted as a seasoned mechanical and materials research engineer/scientist with extensive experience in design, microfabrication and testing of microelectronic packaging, sensing technology and flexible/conformal/stretchable electronics for wearable and medical applications.   Prior to working at Apple, Hsu worked at MC10 covering medical devices such as flexible sensors (temperature, contact, force, ECG) for interventional catheters, to flexible and stretchable wearable devices such as skin-mounted epidermal electronics.   The Skin ID Tattoo was a one-time project Motorola and Google. Patently Apple covered this in a report three years ago titled "Motorola Skin Tattoo Patent Contains Bizarre Big Brother Twist." Our original report on this was posted in 2013 titled "Apple, Motorola Look to New Authentication Methods." In the latter report Walt Mossberg interviewed Regina Dugan about this technology. Dugan had worked for DARPA and eventually went on to work for Google and now Facebook.   Lastly, in addition to wearable devices, Hsu was leading the mechanical and materials design and process integration for embedded ultra-thin chips (micro drivers and processors, etc.) and stretchable interconnects.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

As part of his European tour, Apple chief exec Tim Cook dropped in to Downing Street at 10am on Thursday morning. He paid a visit to Prime Minister Theresa May to talk about how Apple and the British government can work together going forward. In a statement given to Business Insider, a spokesperson for the prime minister said: “It was a meeting with the prime minister. It was a very positive and useful discussion. Apple have made a recent announcement about their investment in the UK and they had a conversation around that and the importance of government and business on digital skills which going forward will clearly be a huge part of the future industry.” The spokesperson continued: “It was a chance for the prime minister to outline her plans for negotiating our EU exit. It was also a chance for her to reiterate and welcome Apple’s investment in the the UK." Cook is now on the fifth day of his European tour, after kicking his visit to the continent off by dropping into Apple Stores in Marseilles. He then went to Paris to meet some app developers, followed by a trip to Germany where he doorstepped the company that builds Apple Store tables. His trip to the UK began yesterday when he went to Glasgow to collect an honorary degree, followed by today’s jaunt with May in London.

A statement from a government representative confirms that Tim Cook did indeed meet with Prime Minister Theresa May at 10 AM GMT this morning. The meeting covered Apple’s investments in the UK and the importance of digital skills in the workforce. May also outlined her Brexit plan to Cook, which will see the UK leave the European Union by 2019. The UK is one of Apple’s largest developed markets outside of the United States with 40 Apple Stores setup across the country. Apple recently announced it will be moving into a new UK campus situated at the Battersea power station site, moving up to 3,000 employees in 2021. Apple’s European headquarters reside in Ireland, which neighbors the rest of the UK. Relations have strained slightly in recent months as governments argue over the legality and morality of Apple’s tax arrangement with Ireland. Tim Cook’s meeting with the UK Prime Minister is a continuation of a tour the CEO has taken this week, visiting many different companies and people across Europe since Sunday. He visited Glasgow yesterday to receive an honorary degree, met with a German Apple supplier, an iPad Pro-centric fashion designer and visited many Apple retail stores along the way. Cook has generally documented his journey on his Twitter account, although he is yet to publicly acknowledge his meeting with Theresa May. Tim Cook also met up with the Mayor of London, tweeting that he is incredibly excited about Apple’s future in London and the United Kingdom as a whole. Great to meet @MayorofLondon today. We are incredibly excited about Apple's future in London and the 🇬🇧! https://t.co/pOYdisFAit — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) February 9, 2017 blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Android Wear 2.0 launched today to become the biggest evolution in Android smartwatches so far. Leading from the front are the LG Watch Style and the LG Watch Sport watches which launched alongside the new platform, becoming the first smartwatches to sport Android Wear 2.0. The update brings onboard a lot of much-awaited features including custom watch faces, standalone apps along with better support for iPhone users. Here we list out all the new features of Android Wear 2.0: STANDALONE APPS So far if you owned an Android Wear smartwatch, you’d have had to keep your Android phone nearby to make use of the Android Wear apps. If you had an iPhone, that made things even worse. With the new update, the biggest change in the smartwatch ecosystem is the support for standalone apps, which work straight out of the watch themselves without needing support from your smartphone. Using Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or cellular connection, the smartwatches running Android Wear 2.0 has become more functional. The update will be a welcome change for iPhone users who for long lacked the app support needed to call an Android Wear watch a smartwatch. You can now download apps straight to your smartwatch, apps which Google has promised will be available in plenty overtime. Support for Android Wear 1.0 apps is also there. A DEDICATED PLAY STORE FOR WATCH APPS In tandem with opening up standalone support for apps in Android Wear watches, the platform will now also include its own exclusive app store, termed the Android Wear 2.0 Play Store. Now you can browse and install apps from the Play Store directly from your watch. As a result, you also don’t have to install the same app on your phone, as was the case before. ‘COMPLICATED’ WATCH FACES For a change, Android is playing catchup with Apple when it comes to smartwatches. Apple’s watchOS has the nifty feature of displaying data from third-party apps on the watch face, something which can be customised to fit your need. The same feature is now coming to Android Wear 2.0. Google is calling it ‘complications’. Now, your custom watch face will display data from Google Fit to Flipboard to Spotify. You can also interact with them on the Watch Face itself . You can also have multiple watch faces lined up side by side. Load up multiple watch faces with different complications and swipe sidewards to access them. You can have one each for work, for when you are commuting and finally, when you are home. NOTIFICATIONS MADE BETTER While notifications in the form of Google cards made the watch faces look cluttered a bit, Android Wear 2.0 looks to shake things up. Now, when you receive cards, the icons on the watch face will shrink and take up less space. There is also a progress bar on the bottom now, showing you how many cards are left for you to swipe. The watch also displays the card notifications for sometime when you raise the watch to activate it, before hiding away again. To access them again, just swipe from the bottom as you did with previous watches. The cards itself have received a face-lift. Earlier it used to be dark text on a white background. But Google tweaked it to show light text on a black background to save up on battery. MATERIAL DESIGN COMES TO ANDROID WATCHES With Android Wear 2.0, Material Design has finally come to smartwatches. And it’s not just a simple copy-paste from Android smartphone template. Google has specifically optimised the design for round-shaped watch faces. The app drawer has been redesigned to accommodate round screens better. Instead of swiping left and right to access apps, you can push the standby button to get all of them displayed in an arc along the round edge. You can rearrange your apps by holding and dragging them. In addition, Google has added a new action drawer at the bottom, similar to the context-specific gestures seen on a smartphone. The menus have also been easier to interact with. Android Wear 2.0 now supports rotational input, much like Samsung’s Gear S3’r rotating bezel. You can use a rotating panel to move up and down menus, zoom in and out, etc. OK GOOGLE ON SMARTWATCHES Wear 2.0 also brings support for Google Assistant, the AI-based digital assistant found in the Google Pixel phones. This enables you to talk to your watch to get answers. Ask about the weather, book a table in a restaurant, order coffee and more by holding down on the standby button or simply saying ‘OK Google’. IMPROVED TYPING ON SMARTWATCHES Watch screens are anyway too tiny for typing out anything significant. Nevertheless, if you wish to reply to mails and messages directly from your watch, Google is offering its native Gboard keyboard app with handwriting recognition to scribble out replies. You can swipe on the small keyboard to type out replies or even Google’s automated replies which are context-based. GET FIT WITH ANDROID WEAR 2.0 If the lack of support for fitness support was a complain in the earlier versions, Google is more than making up for it with this update. Google Fit is integrated more deeply now with additions of individual activity tracker. You can also launch your workout playlist from Spotify or any other music streaming apps directly from the watch without even turning on your phone.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: February 10, 2017 10:11 am Apple BeatsX Earphones will be available globally from February 10. Apple’s long-delayed BeatsX Earphones will be available globally starting February 10, the company has announced. The wireless earphones cost $149 (or approx Rs 9960), and come in white, black, grey and blue. Apple says it will sell BeatsX at its brick-and-mortar as well as online stores. The BeatsX was originally announced at Apple’s September event alongside the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and AirPods wireless headphones. At that time, Apple had said it would make the earbuds available in the market in “Fall 2016”. After that the company remained silent throughout the crucial holiday season, until B&H Photo sent an email to its customers saying the earphones had been delayed “at least 2-3 months”, pushing the release further. Watch all our videos from Express Technology This is not the first time Apple has delayed the release of its product. The same thing happened with Apple’s AirPods, which had initially planned to release in October. However, AirPods weren’t made available until December, due to “technical issues”. The Tim Cook-led company didn’t mention what led to the delay of the BeatsX, which comes with Apple’s proprietary W1 wireless chip that also powers AirPods. The W1 chip is basically designed to enable easy paring to iOS and Mac devices.  The Beats X can work with Android devices via Bluetooth. Also read: Apple AirPods review: Great audio for Siri lovers Other than the W1 chipset, the BeatsX looks similar to other wireless earbuds available in the market. The earbuds come with an in-line remote and battery that should last 8 hours on a single charge and “Fast Fuel”, a five-minute charge gives you two hours of playback. Charging can be done through a lightning cable rather than the usual micro-USB, and there’s a dedicated Siri button. In the BeatsX Earphones box, users will get the following: BeatsX Earphones, eartips with four size options, removable secure-fit wingtips, a pocket-sized carrying case and a lightning to USB-A charging cable. They are compatible with the iPhone 5 onwards devices going up all the way to iPhone 7 Plus, Apple Watch, iPad mini 2, 3, and 4, iPad Air and iPad Air 2, as well as the iPad Pro series. They are also compatible with iPod Touch 6th generation. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple Election 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017 Phase 1 Live Updates: Polling begins in 73 constituencies of western region UP Assembly Elections 2017: Battle for heartland begins in west that may hold the key UP Assembly Elections 2017: Day before first phase, Muslim clerics back Mayawati Best of Express Setback for Sasikala as TN education minister Pandiarajan joins Panneerselvam camp EntertainmentJolly LLB 2 movie review : Akshay Kumar, Saurabh Shukla make this an unalloyed delight EntertainmentShah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan's first selfie in 25 years is one of a kind.

Mr Cook met the Prime Minister at Downing Street this morning to discuss the company's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the redeveloped Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. 'We're doubling down on a huge headquarters in the Battersea area and we're leaving significant space there to expand,' Mr Cook said. 'We're a big believer in the UK - we think you'll be just fine. Yes, there will be bumps in the road along the way but the UK's going to be fine.' Theresa May has hosted Apple chief executive Tim Cook, pictured in Downing Street today, at No 10 for private talks on her Brexit plans Apple boss Tim Cook today visited a primary school in north London as part of his trip to the UK to discuss Brexit with Theresa May Last year the iPhone maker revealed it would move 1,600 employees to the new campus in south London in 2021. In a statement about the meeting, Apple said: 'Tim had a positive meeting with the Prime Minister today, discussing Apple's continued investment in the United Kingdom. 'We are proud that Apple's innovation and growth now supports nearly 300,000 jobs across the UK.' The 56-year-old (centre) chatted to children at Woodberry Down Community Primary School  After the meeting Mr Cook visited a primary school in north London. The 56-year-old chatted to children at Woodberry Down Community Primary School in Harringay, which is part of the New Wave Federation group of schools that have incorporated Apple's iPad and related software into lesson plans.  Its students learn basic coding through Apple's Swift Playgrounds software and work with the company's GarageBand music app as part of their lessons.  'Technology has moved on considerably,' Mr Cook said. 'It gets kids a lot more engaged because they're living in a digital world. We're all living in a digital world. 'This school has done an unbelievable job of integrating it.'  The school is part of the New Wave Federation group of schools that have incorporated Apple's iPad and related software into lesson plans Students learn basic coding through Apple's Swift Playgrounds software and work with the company's GarageBand music app as part of their lessons Mr Cook was photographed sweeping into Downing Street this morning and was said to have held 'positive and useful' talks with the PM.   Mrs May's 'global Britain' strategy was boosted last year by Apple's announcement it would set up a huge new headquarters in London at the redeveloped Battersea Power Station. The lavish plans raised hopes Apple could abandon its base in Ireland and shift its European operations to Britain in what would be a huge coup for London - and the Treasury. The iPhone and iPad developer was slapped with a vast bill by the European Commission after Brussels ruled against a low corporate tax deal agreed between Apple and Ireland last year. Mr Cook said: 'Technology has moved on considerably. It gets kids a lot more engaged because they're living in a digital world. We're all living in a digital world' Mr Cook, pictured leaving No 10 after his talks, was said to have held 'positive and useful' talks with the PM Revealing details of the meeting, Mrs May's official spokesman said: 'It was a meeting with the Prime Minister. 'It was a very positive and useful discussion. You have seen Apple has made a recent announcement about investment in the UK. 'There was a conversation around that, the importance of Government and business on digital skills going forward which is going to be a huge part of the future industry.

Share this article Share 'And touching on what the Prime Minister outlined in our plans for negotiating EU exit. 'It was a chance for her to reiterate and welcome Apple's investment in the UK.' The spokesman would not comment on whether Donald Trump's immigration summary or how Mr Cook responded to the Brexit plans.  Apple announced in September it would create a new London headquarters inside the £9billion Battersea Power Station development for up to 3,000 staff.  The Grade II listed building on the Thames with its iconic towers is key a feature of south London's skyline. It is being refurbished by a Malaysian-led consortium.  Mr Cook and his team were pictured leaving Downing Street this morning following his talks with Mrs May  The tech giant will occupy six floors - about half a million square feet of office space - in the central boiler house of the former coal-fired power station. Apple, which insists it pays all taxes due in Britain, will become the largest office tenant in the new-look Battersea Power Station development. In 2015 it sparked fury after revealing that it paid only £11.8million in British corporation tax the previous year – despite raking in profits estimated at almost £2billion. It will take up around 40 per cent of the office space and spreading staff across six floors and employees will be relocated from various London offices in 2021, Apple said. Apple has around 1,400 office staff in London working across nine sites and another 1,100 working in its UK stores. The redevelopment of Battersea Power Station, pictured in December, is one of the biggest building projects currently underway in the capital  Once complete, Apple will occupy six floors - about half a million square feet of office space - in the central boiler house of the former coal-fired power station. Pictured: Computer generated projection of the revamped Battersea  Announcing its plans last year, it added that it was a 'great opportunity to have its entire team working and collaborating in one location while supporting the renovation of a neighbourhood rich with history'. Rob Tincknell, chief executive of Battersea Power Station Development Company, said: 'We are delighted that Apple has chosen to make Battersea Power Station its home in 2021. 'It is testament to our fantastic building and the wider regeneration of the 42-acre site which offers a carefully curated mix of homes, businesses and leisure amidst extraordinary open spaces and new transport links. 'It has always been our clear objective to create one of London's most thriving new communities and this commitment from Apple will undoubtedly help us achieve our goal.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 130 shares Most watched News videos Danielle Bregoli throws punches while boarding Spirit Airways Cameraman 'zooms in' on woman's breasts in 'see-through' swimsuit Caught on camera: Bystanders watch topless men fighting in street Moment Lindsay Hoyle and Alex Salmond scream at each other Danielle Bregoli discusses fighting a 'crack head' with her mom 'I don't take no s***': Bus driver kicks drunk man off bus Watch Barack Obama wipe out in kite surfing battle McConnell blocks Warren from reading letter from MLK's wife Footage shows hostile environment that Alexander Blackman endured Melissa McCarthy nails screeching Sean Spicer on SNL Danielle went viral after appearing on Dr Phil in 2016 Moment woman pops open her shirt by flexing her boobs Socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, 45, dies at her London...

New Apple MacBook Pro 2016 review: Worth the money, but Kaby Lake refresh models on the way 2. New Apple MacBook Pro 2016 review: Worth the money, but Kaby Lake refresh models on the way The New MacBook Pro was released just a few months ago, but it looks like Apple is already planning to update its new flagship. Code in Apple’s macOS 10.12.4 beta suggests that Apple will be updating all three of its MacBook Pro models with new efficient, powerful Kaby Lake processors. The code was discovered by Apple blog  Pike's Universum, and suggest the refresh will apply to those laptops with a TouchBar, and those without too. That means we should see a good increase in performance across the range. Should I buy one now? The Macbook Pro in its current form, is probably one of the best laptops you can buy, and will serve you for many years. The Kaby Lake processors should be released around June this year, but they’ll only offer an incremental upgrade in processing power and battery life – the rest of the MacBook Pro should remain the same. Therefore, it’s okay buy now if you need to, but worth holding off if it’s not an essential purchase. New MacBook Pro (2016) review: In full See related  Best laptops 2017: The TOP laptops you can buy in the UK Dell XPS 13 9350 review: The Windows ultraportable, perfected The new MacBook Pro is brilliant but it may just have killed Macs in the enterprise Every few years Apple gives its MacBook Pro model a complete redesign – with some designs more conservative than others. The new late-2016 MacBook Pro represents one of the biggest changes ever to Apple's flagship laptop, and you'll either love it, or hate it. First, Apple came for your serial port, then your parallel port, and in 2016 it took your phone’s headphone socket. Now, the new MacBook Pro family has come for pretty much everything else –  the fucntion keys, HDMI and display ports, memory card reader and pretty much eveything else has gone.  For all the design tweaks, all those alluring nips and tucks, it’s the arrival of the Touch Bar – and more to the point the departure of physical function keys – that’s caused the biggest waves. If you want old-school function keys, then it’s worth saying it upfront: you can still get your fix with the "entry-level" 13in MacBook Pro (£1,449). If you want a MacBook Pro with the all-new Touch Bar, however, you’ll need to find at least another £300. And if you’ve also got your heart set on upgraded SSDs and top-flight processors, then trust me, the new MacBook Pro family are going to cost you big time. READ NEXT: The best laptops of 2016 - our favourite portables New MacBook Pro (2016) review: Design There are three areas that define the new MacBook Pro family: the thinness, the keyboard and trackpad, and the screen. These are the thinnest and lightest MacBook Pros ever, with the 13in version coming in at a mere 1.4kg – the same as a 13in MacBook Air. If you think that’s impressive, then consider that it’s also thinner than a MacBook Air, at least at the thick end. Of course, it doesn’t taper like a MacBook Air to a razor-thin edge, but it’s still a very slender machine. The 15in model has also emerged transformed. Weight has fallen from a whisker over 2kg to 1.83kg, and Apple has trimmed down the girth from 18mm to an impressively slender 15mm. As 15.4in laptops go, this is pretty much as thin and light as you could possibly ask for. New MacBook Pro (2016) review: The Touch Bar The Touch Bar is a thin strip of OLED touchscreen that sits directly above the keyboard, replacing the function-key row. What appears on the Touch Bar is programmable and – importantly – context-sensitive, so different applications can have different “keys” appear. For example, in Safari you see a set of “keys” representing your open tabs, allowing you to quickly flip between them with a quick dab of the finger. Play a YouTube video and a progress bar pops up, allowing you to quickly jump back and forth with a tap or drag of a finger. It’s really quite ingenious. In the Photos app, you can not only navigate quickly between image thumbnails by swiping left and right, but also, once images are opened, carry out basic editing tasks in full-screen view without having to go near the touchpad. In Messages, you’ll see Quick Text suggestions, including emoji; in Mail, there are shortcut keys that let you send and reply, among others; while Final Cut Pro displays a timeline track allowing you to scroll quickly through your project while previewing the video in full-screen. And anyone worried about losing the escape key and function keys of the old MacBook shouldn’t worry unduly. If there’s an application that you always use function keys in, it’s possible to add that to a whitelist in the MacBook’s settings so that they always appear when that application is open and in the foreground. And regardless, you can get to these keys quickly and easily by holding down the Fn key, at which point the keys appear instantly along the top row. Third party Touch Bar support is also on the horizon. Adobe has said its new version of Photoshop, which can work with Apple's Touch Bar should be available by the end of the year.   The other big news is the inclusion of a Touch ID sensor at the right-hand side of the Touch Bar. The Touch ID sensor isn’t quite flush with the rest of the bar, which, while not the most aesthetically pleasing, does make it easier to find by touch alone. As with the iPhone and iPad, you simply place your finger on it to unlock the Mac. What’s more, you can set it up so different users’ fingerprints will log them in to their account without having to first log out. New MacBook Pro (2016) review: Performance Thankfully, those slender bodies haven’t forced Apple to compromise on performance. The non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro is the slower of the three, principally because it makes do with 15W TDP versions of Intel’s Core i5 and Core i7 processors, rather than the 28W CPUs found in the Touch Bar-equipped 13in MacBook Pro. Move up to the 15in MacBook Pro, however, and you get to choose between two substantially more powerful 45W Core i7 CPUs, a choice of AMD’s Radeon Pro 450, 455 and 460 GPUs, and 16GB of memory comes as standard. If it’s power you’re after, then the larger MacBook Pro is still a big step up. Apple has upgraded the SSD inside the new MacBooks, and as a result the new generation are a claimed 50% faster. The SSDs inside the 2015 MacBook Pros were darn fast already, but Apple’s custom-built drives in the new models blow them into the weeds. By using four PCI Express 3 lanes, the drive in the new MacBook offers potentially double the bandwidth of the previous generation, and in testing, the new models produced a fiery performance. In fact, it proved to be the most impressive upgrade, with sequential read rates of up to 3.1GB/sec and write speeds of up to 1.4GB/sec. The result of all Apple’s work – not to mention the shift from Intel’s Broadwell to the Skylake generation – is that even the low-end MacBook Pro is now faster than its predecessors. In my time with the three new models, it was striking that even the £1,249 model felt quicker than the now rather portly looking 13in MacBook Pro sitting on my desk. I suspect that the super-quick SSD was making the biggest difference, though. Swapping over to the Touch Bar model wasn’t night and day by comparison, and as you can see from the benchmarks below, its faster Core i5 CPU delivered a relatively modest improvement in the benchmark results. ^ All the models here have 8GB of RAM, but the Touch Bar model has a 2.9GHz Core i5-6267U, the non-Touch Bar model has a 2GHz Core i5-6360U, and the 2015 model has a 2.7GHz Core i5-5257U. It’s no surprise to find that the 15in MacBook Pro bounds past its smaller cousins. The combination of those quad-core processors and a lightning-quick SSD are a match made in heaven, and in most of the tests the king-sized MacBook Pro proved to be roughly twice as quick as the dual-core Core i5 in the mid-range 13in model. If you’re planning to hammer your laptop with a slew of heavyweight applications on a daily basis, it’s definitely the better choice. The MacBook Pro family’s legendary battery life hasn’t suffered, either, and in our video-playback test the three models exhibited broadly similar levels of stamina. The non-Touch Bar model lasted a little longer than its pricier cousins, thanks mainly to a more power-efficient CPU and a slightly larger battery than its Touch Bar-equipped sibling. However, it’s impressive to see that the 15in model keeps pace, and actually beats one of its smaller cousins, eventually expiring just a minute short of nine hours. New MacBook Pro (2016): The speakers Elsewhere, the speakers have had an update, and now flank each side of the keyboard. Apple claims they produce twice the dynamic range of the previous model, which is tricky to test, but audio quality is clearly better, with more solidity, clarity and body all round. There are differences between the models here, though. Surprisingly, the 13in non-Touch Bar model is noticeably quieter than the pricier Touch Bar model, but it’s also noticeably fuller-sounding and bassier. I suspect there’s good reason for this, though, as the faster processors in the 13in Touch Bar models required Apple to fit a secondary fan and adopt a different internal design – this has clearly had a knock-on effect on sound quality. Step up to the 15in model, though, and there’s another improvement thanks to greater clarity, and basslines that are inaudible on the smaller models suddenly reappear.

Worth pointing out that you have *two* processor options – the 2.0 GHz you were using, and a 2.4 GHz version that may not be as quick as the Touch Bar-equipped machines, but is still faster than the 2.0 GHz one, with a 3.5 GHz boost. Although it'll cost you an eye-watering £270 extra, at which point you might as well just give up and buy one of the more expensive machines anyway... Submitted by wittgenfrog on Thu, 2016-11-03 08:56. Another breathlessly enthusiastic review of an Apple product. I don't doubt that its well-made very thin and can play video for simply hours & hours. I don't doubt that when running proper Windows applications it could be a useful tool. AS David Court acknowledges there are numerous other devices which offer equal or better performance in well-made chassis that are only marginally more bulky and much cheaper. I think most buyers will. Like Mr Court, be treating themselves to a luxury item, which just happens to be a PC. Submitted by Zeafer on Fri, 2016-11-04 04:05. As a frequent user of both MacOS and Windows, I know which one I prefer for my workspace. Simply not having to deal with Malware/Adware and never using a single cycle or byte of RAM saves significant time (and in business, time is money). Yes, you pay an increasing premium for the Apple badge (their profiteering is over the top) but at the end of the day, I've found it to be mostly worthwhile. FYI: I'm typing this on my "Early 2011 17-ince Macbook Pro" which is still going strong (with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD inside). How many PCs from 2011 are still usable as a designer/developer's daily machine 5 years later? Also, Microsoft wants £2,649.00 incl. VAT for their similar spec Surface Book, so the pricing doesn't look quite so steep now. Submitted by wittgenfrog on Fri, 2016-11-04 09:09. Many, many Developers use PCs from 2011 which have, like your MAC been upgraded over time. We mainly only replace PCs in order to improve performance and efficiency. There have been very few hardware faults apart from a couple of HDD failures and issues with Graphics cards. Neither of these issues is unique to non-Apple PCs. The Surface Book is a ludicrously expensive device and seriously hampered by Intel's flawed Skylake Generation chips, as is Surface Pro. In its defence the Surface Book does have a couple of unique features, but not enough in my opinion to justify the price. Lots of better-value Windows PCs are available Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2016-11-15 10:34. This bottom end of the MacBook Pro range has an I/O capability of 80 Gb/s. On the higher range version, 160 Gb/s. Where else can I get that? Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2016-11-15 10:45. I'm typing this on my 17" 2011 MacBook Pro bought in January 2012. It gets used several hours a day. I've recently had the Graphics issue that you mention which effected machines of this age. Last week Apple replaced the main board to resolve the issue. Free of charge. And no, the machine had no extended support contract, just the standard warranty. That is the first repair that it has had. The second hand value of the machine is approaching 50% of what I paid for it. Which will make a significant dent in the cost of a new one. Not bad for an almost 6 year old machine (which looks almost new and is functionally perfect) Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Thu, 2016-11-17 14:36. "Right now, this means that buying a MacBook Pro guarantees that you'll need to budget for a clutch of essential USB Type-C adapters, and most likely a docking station" Actually in many cases what you need is the right cable. Yes, you could buy a USB-C to USB-A socket dongle to attack your iPhone. But I preferred to buy a USB-C to Lightening cable. And a USB-C to USB-B cable to connect a printer / scanner. Yes, I could have bought two multi Media dongles plus two HDMi to DVI cables to attach my two monitors, but I preferred to buy two USB-C to DVI cables. This will actually reduce the clutter on my desk as I currently use Thunderbolt 2 to DVI dongles. And yes, I will buy the 5K LG monitor if it looks as good as it sounds, because that will reduce the cable count to one. A very big step forward. (two if I buy two of them). Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Thu, 2016-11-17 14:48. "To put this into context, that’s £120 more expensive than the equivalent Dell XPS 13, and that laptop comes with a touchscreen and a better selection of ports." From what I've seen, not many people seem to use touchscreens after the first few days. Particularly on notebooks. As for a "better" selection of ports, perhaps wider might be less misleading. It's I/O capability is substantially less than the MacBook Pro. One Ethenet, two USB 3.0 and one thunderbolt ports isn't going to get near the I/O capacity of 2x thunderbolt 3 ports. Let alone 4x. thunderbolt 3. Though in some situations it may be more convenient. Submitted by Ben Searson on Fri, 2016-11-18 10:15. The base model is £1449 not £1249 Submitted by CampoX on Sun, 2016-12-04 12:29. The 13" with Touch strip is 169,045 yen in Japan (duty free + 5% off for Visa - Yodabashi Camera), or 1,170 GBP-ish (even with the weak pound). Walk out of the shop with it - no waiting/Space Grey. Ok so the keyboard is a little odd/has extra characters, but difficult to say no to close to 600 quid off. Excellent machine - makes my 2015 Macbook feel like it was from a different planet.

The UK price is £1457.5 plus VAT To import the £1170 Japanese purchase will cost you £234 in import duty, so £1404 and all you've saved is £344 less shipping and handling.

The keyboard is slightly frustrating though - the delete is small with a Yen key next to it, and the brackets are on the 8 and 9, so more difficult to reach - and a few other quirks. Anyway, have sold it (for what I paid) and just got a 16GB/I7/512GB in HK instead for HK$19,188 (2,000 GBP). Anyways, we all know Brexit has just made USD>GBP pricing even worse.

The company also might be prepping a new iPad Air 3. Advertisement Rumors continue to point to some big changes to Apple’s iPad lineup. The company is reportedly going to upgrade its iPad Pro line though, it appears that the company might also replace its long-running iPad Air 2. Its been nearly two-and-a-half years since Apple released its 9.7-inch iPad Air 2. And while iPad Air 3 rumors have swirled, the company’s kept the aging device on shelves. That’s starting to change. An iPad Air 3 release could happen in 2017. According to AppleInsider, iPad Air 2 stock at popular retailers like B&H and MacMall is starting to dry up, a sign that a new iPad Air 3 could finally be on the way. The silver and space gray versions of the 32GB Wi-Fi-only iPad Air 2 are currently out of stock at MacMall. At B&H, all LTE-equipped 128GB iPad Air models are listed as “no longer available.” These aren’t the only retailers with dwindling inventory. Advertisement Amazon, Best Buy, and Staples are sold out of select iPad Air 2 models. The Apple Store is also showing cracks with wait times for online orders pushed into late February. A 32GB iPad Air 2 from the Apple Store will deliver by February 20th. This doesn’t confirm an imminent iPad Air 3 release but this is typical behavior ahead of a major product announcement. According to multiple reports, Apple is currently developing new Apple hardware and new iPad software including wider support for the Apple Pencil accessory. A report from Bloomberg claims “Apple may roll out the new iPad software features as part of an upgrade to the iOS 10 operating system in the first half of 2017.” Advertisement Apple currently has its iOS 10.3 update in beta and there’s speculation that it could arrive alongside new iPads in March. Apple typically hosts an early event to bridge the gap between its iPhone launch and WWDC. Last year, the company announced the iPhone SE and a smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro during its March launch event. iPad Air 3 rumors point to a modest upgrade with a processor bump expected to be one of the key features. Rumors suggest the budget iPad will feature the A9 processor that’s found in the company’s iPhone 6s smartphone. While upgrades to the iPad Pro and iPad Air lineup are expected, there doesn’t appear to be anything imminent for Apple’s iPad mini line. Apple’s last iPad mini refresh, the iPad mini 4, arrived alongside the company’s original iPad Pro in September, 2015. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2.1 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 13 known patches for potential exploits. That's one more than its predecessor (iOS 10.2). These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2 update and/or the iOS 10.1.1 update, know that iOS 10.2.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2 update had 12 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, an Apple filing for "Gesture-based information exchange between devices in proximity" describes a secure data transfer system between two portable devices that works by detecting customizable gestures, or "greeting events", such as handshakes, high-fives, hugs, fist bumps, bows, waves, and salutes. The gestures trigger a customizable data set that takes into account device context, with a particular focus on privacy and security. For example, in all cases, users must select the pre-defined gestures to allow the transfer of specific information only between the two devices, reducing the possibility of unintentionally sharing data with other devices in close proximity. Information shared can be stored either locally or in the cloud, and can include most data fit for transfer across a wireless connection, such as contact details, photos, media files, calendar events, and so on. Greeting events can also generate data for sharing across social media, such as a Twitter post that announces a meeting between two users. The sophisticated customization features of the system are of particular note, since they allow users to decide beforehand what kind of information is shared, and with whom, based on pre-defined contextual parameters, such as encountering someone for the first time, versus meeting a family member or an old friend. Device identifiers, location data, and user histories are all corralled in order to enhance the reliability and security of the system. On another security note, the patent describes the use of cryptographic keys to identify individual sharing sessions, which can be either automated or user-initiated via an on-screen interface, with the possibility of using artificial intelligence-managed sharing under the hood. As always with patents, the invention may or may not be used in-house or in a product, but the document offers another example of Apple's commitment to simplifying close-proximity data sharing while also paying particular attention to the security and privacy implications of such systems.

The iPhone 5s is also available for Rs 18,999, although the latest iPhone 7 has only marginal 7 per cent discount, and the iPhone 6s is at Rs 44,000 with another Rs 20,000 off on exchange. There are some deals on the Apple authorised accessories as well and discounts on an older MacBook Pro, MacBook Air (8GB RAM+128GB storage) with another Rs 7000 off on exchange for Mac buyers. Of course, users will be most interested in the iPhone 6 offer. Technically the deal on the iPhone 6 is this: The price without exchange is Rs 27,990, but if you are exchanging it with an older device you can get up to Rs 24,000 off on exchange. Additionally Flipkart is giving Rs 4,000 off on regular exchange value, which will bring the price to Rs 23,990 under exchange. There’s also a extra 5 per cent off on Axis Bank Buzz Credit Cards. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Technically if you’re buying the device on exchange, the phones likely to fetch the highest discount are iPhone models higher than the 6, which makes little sense. Older higher-end phones have a better potential for those looking to get the new iPhone 6 with the exchange, if you want a higher discount. So should you buy the iPhone 6 or even the iPhone 5s? The iPhone 8 will launch in the next seven months or so, which will technically make the iPhone 6 that was launched nearly three years back. Essentially you’ll be paying for Rs 25,000 plus for a device with outdated specifications. Onboard storage space is also limited to 16GB, which is an important consideration. But this doesn’t mean performance will be a problem on the iPhone. Also read: Apple iPhone 7 review: This phone still sets the benchmarks At Rs 25,000 plus, it is possible to get phones with newer specifications and a better battery life. Options in the list include OnePlus 3, OnePlus 3T; the latter sports the latest Snapdragon 821 and a bigger 3600 mAh battery, but is slightly more expensive. The ZTE Nubia Z11 is another good phone, though priced at Rs 29,999. Asus Zenfone 3 series has phones in the Rs 25,000 range and even lower, some of which sport good battery life. Samsung’s Galaxy A9 Pro, Galaxy A7 2016 are also options in the Rs 25,000 range, as is the Moto Z Play. But are there any advantages to the getting the iPhone 6 over these phones? If you’re plan to upgrade in the next six months, then the iPhone makes for a better buy. An iPhone’s exchange value will always be higher compared to any other phone company on the market, no matter what the specifications. Just go and compare exchange discounts with any other phone vs the Apple iPhone on Flipkart; the latter will always fetch a higher discount. If you are on an iPhone 4s or iPhone 5s and have been using an iPhone for a really long time, and don’t want to leave iOS, the iPhone 6 is a good option. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch Retina HD display, A8 chip, comes with an excellent 8MP camera, which can put most of the competition to shame. But the iPhone 6 doesn’t have OIS, while the iPhone 6 Plus does, which is better for low-light shots. If you’ve been wanting to get an iPhone for a while now, and don’t want to pay Rs 40,000 plus, the iPhone 6 is a deal to consider. But for those who need a fast phone with a good camera, remember the iPhone is not the only option anymore. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple iPhone 7 Election 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017 Phase 1 Live Updates: Polling begins in 73 constituencies of western region UP Assembly Elections 2017: Battle for heartland begins in west that may hold the key UP Assembly Elections 2017: Day before first phase, Muslim clerics back Mayawati Best of Express Setback for Sasikala as TN education minister Pandiarajan joins Panneerselvam camp EntertainmentJolly LLB 2 movie review : Akshay Kumar, Saurabh Shukla make this an unalloyed delight EntertainmentShah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan's first selfie in 25 years is one of a kind.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Highlights V / MacOS trojans are becoming more common place, new Word file exploit discovered MacOS trojans are becoming more common place, new Word file exploit discovered Jon Martindale 2 days ago Highlights V, Security A new piece of malware that specifically targets Mac operating systems has been discovered. Found in an infected Word file, when launched on a MacOS machine, the file automatically triggers a macro which can download an encrypted payload and begin running it on the user’s system. Anyone who’s been interested in technology for at least a decade is familiar with the tired maxim that Apple devices don’t get viruses. Apple even used it in its old “I’m a Mac” adverts with Jason Long. They do though and as Apple devices become more commonplace, malware that targets them has followed suit. The malware this time around was discovered in an infected Word document called “U.S. Allies and Rivals Digest Trump’s Victory – Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.” A surprisingly wordy and official sounding document that seems likely to be targeting a specific group of people. Source: Objective-see If one of those people should have opened the document however, it would have immediately attempted to run a macro. While MacOS users would receive a warning at that point, if they were to ignore it, the malware would first check to see if the LittleSnith firewall was running. If not, it would download a payload from an infected URL, decrypt it and execute said payload. While Ars and the security researchers it quotes don’t know exactly what the payload does, the codebase that it borrows from would suggest that it would likely monitor webcams, record keystrokes, access browser histories and steal stored passwords. Although the attack is said to not be the most sophisticated, it does show that more of the commonplace tactics for targeting Windows users are migrating over to MacOS systems too. Much like phishing attacks, Word macros utilise humans as the weak point in the security chain. Why try to break into a system manually if you can have people do it for you by opening a malicious file? Discuss on our Facebook page, HERE. KitGuru Says: This is why the two most important security measures you can take on any system, are to not open email attachments unless they were expected and come from a trusted source – and even then scan them first – and don’t click links sent to you. Always copy and paste or check them out first.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags Infected MacOS malware news word Previous Blood Bowl 2 Legendary Edition adds a lot, but will be standalone Next Fire prone Samsung batteries caused a fire in its manufacturing plant Check Also EVGA launches new ICX technology for GTX 10-series graphics cards EVGA this week has launched its all new ICX technology, which will serve as an … Polls Which system memory next?

 Apple CEO Tim Cook met with Theresa May Hannah Roberts and Adam Bienkov Feb. 9, 2017, 6:45 AM 1,388 facebook linkedin twitter email print Tim Cook arrived at Downing Street on Thursday at 10am.Press Association It was only a matter of time before Apple CEO Tim Cook arrived in London. Cook has been travelling around Europe this week, where he has so far visited Marseille, Paris, Vreden, Berlin, and most recently Glasgow. He arrived at Downing Street on Thursday at 10am and met with UK Prime Minister Theresa May.  A spokesperson for the prime minister told Business Insider: "It was a meeting with the prime minister. It was a very positive and useful discussion. Apple have made a recent announcement about their investment in the UK and they had a conversation around that and the importance of government and business on digital skills which going forward will clearly be a huge part of the future industry. It was a chance for the prime minister to outline her plans for negotiating our EU exit. It was also a chance for her to reiterate and welcome Apple's investment in the UK." Here's a map of everywhere Cook has been so far on his European tour.  BI / Google Cook has been uncharacteristically active on Twitter to document the trip.

The Apple Store opened last May and is located in the shopping mall of Terrasses du Port. While visiting, Cook mingled with both employees and shoppers. He can be seen chatting it up in images shared on social media. Cook also took a picture with some of the staff of the Marseille Apple Store and shared that image on his personal Twitter account. Delighted to be back in France to meet our talented team in Marseille. Instagram account manager Jean claude Luong tweeted an image of himself and Cook, saying the two spent around two hours together. When he departed the store, Cook received a loud round of applause from employees and shoppers. Tim Cook also visited an Apple retina location in Apple Store Carrousel du Louvre in Paris. This visit was also a surprise one, with Cook again mingling with both employees and shoppers. I had the privilege of spending two hours with @tim_cook during his visit to Marseille … what a fantastic and unforgettable experience At this point it’s unclear why Cook was in France to begin with. It could be that he went as a personal vacation and just stopped in to visit at the store. On the other hand, it’s possible that Cook is in France for business reasons.

Apple rumours suggest its price will SHOCK you Tech giant has BIG plans for its latest smartphone - but will it come with a sky-high price tag to match Apple's soaring ambitions? by JASPER HAMILL 9th February 2017, 11:48 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments THE next Apple iPhone could cost more than £900, it has been claimed. Rumours swirling around the tech world suggest Apple is planning to charge $1,000 for its next gadget, which is expected to be a blockbuster release to mark the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone. 2 Some of the previous iPhone models, first released in 2007 Leaked Apple designs show what iPhone could have been This would probably equate to about £900 in Britain, where prices have been whacked up due to the weak pound. The latest iRumour was published on business site Fast Company, which cited "a source with knowledge of Apple’s plans". It claimed one of the main reasons for the price hike was the inclusion of a super high-definition OLED screen.  These screens allow for deeper blacks and better colours, as well as having better power efficiency and allowing for thinner handsets. Here are all the rumoured features of the upcoming iPhone 8 High definition OLED screen Wireless charging An 'edge to edge' extra-wide display The physical home button is expected to disappear A more powerful processor It will run the iOS 11 operating system The next iPhone will be waterproof like the iPhone 7 It may have an iris scanner instead of a fingerprint scanner 2 These concept images show one Apple fan's idea of how the new device might look Its next model is expected to be a massive change from older gadgets because it is being released to mark the 10th anniversary of the first ever iPhone. This means it's unlikely to be called the iPhone 8 and may actually be called iPhone X or simply iPhone. The tech giant is rumoured to be tripling its production of the phone, which suggests it is expecting massive demand. It's also been claimed the device won’t come with a Lightning port OR a jack for earphones. The news is sure to infuriate Apple fans who are already smarting from Apple’s decision to get rid of the headphone socket in the iPhone 7.

If we were to tell you the iPhone 8 will actually be called the fruity-phone and will come with a magical function that lets you communicate with dead relatives, there are people out there who would probably take it seriously and Apple is unlikely to confirm nor deny the claims.

[ Docker, Amazon, TensorFlow, Windows 10, and more: See InfoWorld's 2017 Technology of the Year Award winners. | Cut to the key news in technology trends and IT breakthroughs with the InfoWorld Daily newsletter, our summary of the top tech happenings. ] "The goal is to design a new web API that exposes these modern technologies in a performant, powerful, and safe manner," the community group proposal states. "It should work with existing platform APIs, such as Direct3D 12 from Microsoft, Metal from Apple, and Vulkan from the Khronos Group." Beyond generic computational capabilities being exposed in existing GPUs via the API, Apple also wants to investigate shader languages to produce a cross-platform solution. Browser engine developers, GPU hardware vendors, 3D software engineers, and anybody else interested in 3D graphics are invited to participate. As part of the launch of this effort, Apple is sharing its WebGPU API proposal. It will also be releasing a prototype of the API to the WebKit open source project. The WebKit team anticipated a next-generation graphics API several years ago and began prototyping in WebKit to show it could expose a low-level GPU API to the Web and still improve performance. Apple's effort so far is not expected to become the actual API in the standard. W3C released a statement in support of the effort. Google and Microsoft did not comment Wednesday on whether they might participate in Apple's effort. Mozilla said Apple's proposal would be useful in the design process, but it was far too early to say more. The current standard for rendering graphics on the web is WebGL. However, since WebGL was created, both GPU technology and software APIs for tapping the power of these processors have improved. These newer APIs -- such as Direct3D, Metal, and Vulkan -- generally offer better performance than WebGL, but they are not available across all platforms. Apple's proposal attempts to remedy this by creating a standard API that can be implemented on top of many systems.  Demand for 3rd Party ERP Support Soars More from Rimini Street Join the Computerworld newsletter!

By Luke Johnson / Published 10th February 2017 LG REFRESHED: Android Wear 2.0 is dropping for Google's existing smartwatches After keeping expectant smartwatch owners waiting for months, Google has finally rolled out its new Android Wear 2.0 update. The sizeable patch, which is far more than a mere lick of paint, brings a number of major new features to the Google-friendly line of Apple Watch rivalling wearables. Chief among these is the smartwatch-friendly take on the new Google Assistant, a voice-activated digital assistant much like Siri or Amazon's Alexa. Originally introduced on the brilliant Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, Google Assistant can be summonsed on the watches by holding the power button and saying "OK, Google." Once activated, it can be used to reply to messages, make searches, set reminders and even ask for directions. Apple Watch Series 2 in pictures Thursday, 8th September 2016 THE Apple Watch is back with a new design and more features 1 / 9 APPLE Apple Watch Series 2 As well as new abilities to talk directly to your wrist, Android Wear 2.0 introduces more personalised watch faces, and a new on-device version of the Google Play Store. There's also additional, easier ways to reply to messages directly from your watch, with users able to swipe across a digital keyboard or handwrite their responses directly onto their device's display, a single letter at a time. Helping bring Android Wear 2.0 to life, the new software has been launched alongside two new wearable devices, the compact, elegant LG Watch Style and the oversized, specs-heavy LG Watch Sport. LG The Style and Sport offer Android 2.0 upgrades for both fashion-concious and power-prioritising users. While the Style features a 1.2-inch P-OLED display wrapped in a water and dust resistant sleek, compact body, the Sport kicks things up a notch with a sizeable 1.38-inch panel. This is paired with a mass of high-end features, including an integrated heart rate sensor, inbuilt GPS and even its own 4G LTE connectivity options, meaning it doesn't need to be synced to a smartphone. Both the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport will go on sale in the US this Friday, February 10, with their UK release to follow later this month. If you've already got an older Android Wear watch, however, don't worry, you're existing wearable offering isn't going to be left in the dark when it comes to Android Wear 2.0 updates. Instead, Google has announced that "Android Wear 2.0 will be available for all supported Android Wear watches in the coming weeks." It's been suggested that this rollout could begin on February 15, although like with Android powered phones, when your watch actually gets the update will depend largely on the manufacturer's speed at testing Google's latest patch. There's an extensive list of Android Wear watches confirmed for the Android Wear 2.0 update, with devices including the Moto 360, Asus ZenWatch 2, LG Watch Urbane, Huawei Watch and the Fossil Q Founder getting the nod.

With Apple's iPhone 7 Plus users are able to create a Bokeh effect where the subject is frozen in clarity with the background slightly blurred so that the focus of the shot is emphasized. In general, 3D cameras could also be used for capturing a user's in-air gestures to control a device interface and beyond. In this particular invention, Apple's technology could also be used in their Mapping vans that use LIDAR.   Apple's patent FIG. 2 noted above is a schematic, pictorial illustration of the optical scanning device showing a scattering line used in monitoring operation of the device.   Apple's Device 20 noted above could be particularly useful as a part of a 3D mapping system or other depth-sensing (LIDAR) device, in conjunction with a suitable scan driver and mechanical packaging, as are known in the art.   It's technically possible that Apple's mapping vans are using modifications that take advantage of their own 3D scanning technology as noted in this patent filing.   Today's patent application 20170038581 is an extension of their work that first came to light back in May 2016.   Apple's work on 3D imagery is on all levels of the art, and knowing that 3D imagery will become more popular over time, Apple's WebKit team has now proposed the creation of a new 3D graphics standard for the web.   Apple's patent was filed in Q3 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India Elections World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones iPhone 8 Price revealed: Buyers will need to shell out top dollar Apple is still months away from launching the 2017 edition of the iPhone, but the price of the new flagship will make you trip. Sami Khan   February 9, 2017 17:03 IST Apple iPhone 6sCreative Commons Beware! Buying an iPhone this year is going to be really, really expensive. If you think iPhones have always been expensive and that's what makes them premium, then the 2017 iPhone, widely referred to as iPhone 8, is certainly going to cost a lot more than any of the iPhones of the past. So be prepared to break your bank if you are planning to stand in those long queues outside the Apple Stores in the middle of the night. According to a report from Fast Company, we can expect three variants of iPhones in 2017 marking the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. One of them is going to be the 10th-anniversation edition and it is going to exceed the $1,000 mark, a source familiar with Apple's plans told the publication. This particular model is also said to be called the "iPhone X" and justify the top dollar bill with its premium spec configuration. For starters, the iPhone X is expected to use OLED displays instead of LCD panels, get rid of the physical buttons and incorporate the 'Home' button into the screen itself. The side volume and lock controls will be replaced by touch-sensitive buttons seamlessly integrated on a metal frame. The glass-back design is highly expected to make its way to this premium model. Apple will continue to offer the regular iPhone 8 variants with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays that will likely have quite standard names like iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, respectively. These models will target the buyers who cannot shell out top dollar for the "iPhone X". The iPhone X is said to come with the largest display, measuring 5.8 inches diagonally. The dual-lens camera setup will embrace the iPhone X, just like it will on the iPhone 7S Plus. But these are just early rumours and a lot could change between now and September, when the new iPhones are expected to arrive. But repeated confirmations on three iPhone models coming this year and one of them being the premium variant should have some truth. And $1,000 for the iPhone X seems reasonable if you'd consider the iPhone 7 Plus' 256GB price of $969.

TECHNOLOGY Silicon Valley Walks a Tightrope in Taking on Trump Tech CEOs are hoping there's safety in numbers as they push back on the president's aggressive immigration agenda. By Salvador Rodriguez Salvador Rodriguez is a staff reporter for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. He covers Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, tech diversity, virtual reality, and other aspects of technology and entrepreneurship. Previously, Rodriguez was the Silicon Valley correspondent for the International Business Times; before that, he was the lead tech blogger and gadget reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. Rodriguez has interned with The New York Times in Arizona, The Arizona Republic, and the Houston Chronicle. He was born in Mexico and raised in Texas, and he earned his journalism degrees at Arizona State University. One of his special skills is the ability to name all the Super Bowl winners chronologically from memory. @sal19 Staff reporter, Inc.@sal19 WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The tech industry is a lot like a group of siblings. Like kin, tech companies will fight tooth and nail, bully one another all day and night, and compete relentlessly. But if anyone else picks on any of them, everything stops, because if you mess with one, you have to deal with the whole lot of them. We saw this a year ago when the industry came to Apple's aid as the iPhone maker took on President Obama's Department of Justice, and we're seeing it again now as the industry steps up to oppose President Trump's executive order on travelers to the U.S. from Muslim countries. In each case, Silicon Valley's archrivals put their antipathies on pause to work for a shared goal. Against the DOJ, that goal was to prevent a precedent that would have allowed governments around the world to force tech companies into giving up user information whenever they'd like. Now, the Valley is fighting for its right to recruit the best talent from every corner of the globe by arguing the unlawfulness of Trump's executive order on refugees and travelers from Muslim countries. The strategies in the two cases are similar, but the executions could not be more different. Against Obama's DOJ, the tech industry filed numerous amicus briefs, each one arguing a different point. Companies teamed up with one another in an ad hoc way based on shared perspectives. Individuals in each case were careful not to say anything too provocative on the record, but in general, companies were happy to go in depth on the topic if granted anonymity. Against President Trump, the tech industry is playing a much more careful, calculated game. Thus far, Silicon Valley has been as diplomatic as possible in dealing with Trump. The industry has filed an amicus brief in opposition to his order. The document brings together more than 100 companies, and it does a great job arguing three points: why immigrants fuel innovation, how an anti-immigration ban hurts tech companies, and why the executive order was unlawful. That's it. No exotic legal theories or competing rationales. Strict message discipline and total unanimity. This tactic is set to be repeated in a letter being sent to Trump on Tuesday that includes the signatures of more than 200 investors, company founders, and venture capitalists. That letter similarly opposes Trump's travel ban, according to BuzzFeed. The letter is also proactively persuading Trump to abandon any plans he might have of reducing the H-1B visa program, which Silicon Valley relies on to bring foreign workers to America. "We're letting the brief speak for itself," multiple tech companies contacted Monday told Inc. when asked if they could expand on the amicus brief and how it came together. A few companies have pre-written statements they are sharing with the press, and some have even published blog posts touting their pro-immigration and open-border stances. But as the industry takes on Trump for the first time in his presidency, the denizens of Silicon Valley are making sure not to present themselves as targets, at least not without plenty of backup. Better to be part of the circling herd. This kind of cautious and subtle opposition has already been put on display. Last week, Politico reported the creation of a group called Win the Future, that has the backing of prominent tech leaders including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Zynga founder Mark Pincus. The group is intended to help progressive candidates organize and prepare for the 2018 midterms and 2020 presidential election. This is a clear attack on Trump, but no one from the group has publicly commented about it. A request by Inc. to speak with Hoffman was not returned while Pincus declined comment. "I don't know that this level of sensitivity has ever been needed before," one industry insider told Inc. "But considering how completely irrational and easily provoked Trump is, tech companies may be wary of inciting ire from him." In Obama, the tech industry had a president Silicon Valley could disagree with without fearing that it would forever burn that bridge. That's because Obama was tech's president. He is forever a fan of technology, a proponent of change, and an admirer of innovation. Washington and Silicon Valley could have differing opinions, but the status of the relationship was never in doubt. In Trump, the tech industry only knows that it is dealing with a man whose reputation is that of a compulsive decision maker. Silicon Valley knows Trump relies as much on his emotions as any other instinct or bit of information when making his choices. With Trump's anti-immigration policies, people who prefer to let their products speak for them have been forced to take a rare public stand. The industry simply cannot function without the help and brilliance of foreign workers. There are too many jobs to be filled and too many markets to be conquered to sit back and do nothing. But a fight with Trump carries far greater consequences than tech fight's with Obama ever did. And already, Trump has shown how he will treat any company that crosses him (just ask Twitter). Together, the tech industry can oppose Trump without running the risk of singular punishment. If he wants to take on anyone, he has to take on everyone. The bet is that's something even Trump won't want to do. Published on: Feb 7, 2017 Advertisement

As noted by German tech site Flo's Weblog, multiple front-of-store job listings recently appeared on Apple's site, suggesting that the company's presence in the upmarket shopping street of Kärntner Straße isn't too far away. Reports that Apple was planning to open a brick-and-mortar store in Austria first emerged in August, when local newspaper derStandard reported that the company was close to securing the necessary contracts on a flagship retail property formerly occupied by fashion company Esprit. Image: Signa Construction at the three-floor premises began in November, according to reports. The distinctive corner location makes the property an unmistakeable feature of the old town, and a typical premier site for a brand like Apple. Kärntner Straße is in close proximity to Stephansplatz, the square at the geographical center of Vienna and home to the Stephansdom cathedral, one of the tallest churches in the world.

The phone is expected to be the first one in Apple’s lineup to ditch the home button, which has been present on every one of its devices since the first iPhone. But, according to a new report, the device might not only ditch the home button, it could also do away with all other physical buttons including those for volume, power and the mute switch. The company is expected to replace the buttons with touch-sensitive ones placed inside the metal frame. In iPhone 8, the home button is likely to be a display-embedded one. Apple is expected to employ its pressure-sensing 3D Touch technology inside the button, so users would be navigating through the phone the way they did on previous iterations, but by applying pressure on the display and body rather than physically pressing a button. Related Stories iPhone 8 Rumors: Apple's 10th Anniversary iPhone May Cost More Than $1K Apple iPhone 8 Production To Start Earlier Than Expected Fast Company reported Wednesday that the device will look like a single slab of glass since it would have no bezels or physical buttons. The report said that the device will have a stainless steel frame in comparison to the iPhone 7’s aluminum one. It also stated citing sources that Apple has been working with smartphone components manufacturer Lumentum on employing iPhone 7’s 3D Touch technology throughout the upcoming device. Some such uses of the 3D Touch technology include user face recognition, camera imaging and augmented reality games. To support this technology, the device would need a bigger battery than the one already on the current iteration of the device.

Opinion | 06 Feb 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (38) What Apple Can Learn from Airwalk by Josh Centers When I was a teenager in the 1990s, Airwalk shoes were all the rage. They were a mandatory accessory for grunge-oriented youths, along with plaid shirts and corduroy pants. The company was founded in 1986, and in its heyday in the 1990s, it had grown to be the third-largest sneaker brand, behind only Nike and Adidas. Today’s teens have undoubtedly never even heard of Airwalk sneakers, which are now found on the bargain rack at Payless Shoesource. What happened? Wait, this is TidBITS, not a fashion magazine, so why am I talking about shoes? Keep reading. I’m about to tell you a story that may sound chillingly familiar. Airwalk began as a niche shoe for professional skateboarders. Skating legend Tony Hawk (who starred in an eponymous video game that ran on the Mac, along with many other platforms) was one of their first customers, and actually suggested the name. Much of Airwalk’s early popularity was due to getting input from skaters to create superior skateboarding shoes that wouldn’t cause blisters or crashes. Airwalk had a healthy business, but it didn’t hit the big time until it hired advertising firm Lambesis to run an ultra-chic, counter-cultural ad campaign. As Malcolm Gladwell wrote in “The Tipping Point,” Airwalk was a $16 million company in 1993. In 1994, it was a $44 million company. In 1995, it was a $150 million company. To satisfy the vast influx of teenage customers while keeping skateboarders and boutique shops happy, Airwalk developed a two-tier strategy. It sold cheaper, consumer-grade shoes to mainstream retailers like Footlocker while continuing to provide pricier, professional-grade shoes to boutique shops. But Airwalk’s success didn’t last. The company’s troubles began in 1997 as production problems led to limited back-to-school supplies. Meanwhile, its lineup had become stale, with few new models. Worst of all, Airwalk abandoned its professional line of shoes. Serious skaters dropped Airwalk, causing the brand to lose its cachet with teens, and it wasn’t long before Airwalk’s time in the sun was over. A smallish company exploding due to quality products and a hip ad campaign. A product line that split into both consumer and professional tiers to provide different price points and features. A company that was later plagued by production problems, stagnant product designs, and ignoring its professional market. Does that sound like another company you can think of? Airwalk might have skated along for a while with its old designs and made peace with retailers, but abandoning its key market of hardcore skaters was what drove it into market irrelevance. In terms of managing supply chains and industrial design, Apple has a pair of superstars in Tim Cook and Jony Ive (to the extent Ive is still involved in product design, anyway). And Apple no longer worries about disappointing retailers, having opened hundreds of its own stores. More concerning is how Apple is treating its professional users. Let’s itemize a few of the ways Apple has moved away from the professional market over the past five years: Killing the Xserve Dumbing down Final Cut Pro with Final Cut Pro X Replacing the pro app Aperture with the consumer-level Photos Increasing burdensome restrictions on Mac App Store apps Releasing a new Mac Pro without internal expandability Failing to update that Mac Pro for over 3 years Delaying updates to the MacBook Pro line for nearly 18 months Releasing a new MacBook Pro that has drawn criticism from professionals Showing a lack of support for automation by eliminating the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies We’re not alone in saying that Apple is now the iPhone company (see “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac,” 21 November 2016). That’s where most of its profit comes from, and so that’s where most of its resources go. Fair enough. But, here’s the thing: the Mac and the capabilities it provides to professionals are the foundation of that iPhone business. Die-hard Mac users kept Apple afloat in the dark years before the iPod and then iPhone. And even now, regardless of all other professional uses of the Mac, developers need Xcode on the Mac to create iOS apps. Apple still has many things in its favor: $241 billion in cash, massive profits every quarter, one of the most popular brands in the world, and nearly 500 successful retail stores. And it might seem odd to criticize Apple now, especially when the company just broke a quarterly record with the most iPhone and Mac sales ever (helped by new iPhone and MacBook Pro models, plus the holiday shopping season, see “Apple Sees Apparent Return to Growth with Q1 2017’s Record Results,” 31 January 2017). But as we saw with Airwalk, things could go downhill fast if professional users were to leave the platform, taking with them all the people and organizations they currently keep loyal to Apple products. I don’t want to be too hard on Apple. The company is still incredibly strong and is doing better in some areas where it has been weak. By many accounts, Final Cut Pro X has improved greatly since its initial release, and some professional movie makers are giving it a chance. App Store review times are plummeting, and Apple is planning to allow developers to respond directly to App Store reviews. Swift is an exciting new programming language with a bright future, and it’s suitable for both compiled apps and scripts. You might argue that Apple and Airwalk aren’t comparable. For instance, although it may have gotten its start providing athletic shoes, Airwalk ultimately became a fashion company. But isn’t Apple similar in many respects? Apple opened its doors with the Apple I hobby kit, and by the mid-2000s, the iPod and its white earbuds were fashion mainstays. The Apple Watch is clearly intended to be a fashion item today. Even the MacBook, with its prominent usage in coffee shops, airports, and other public places, makes its own fashion statement. Despite these similarities, Apple is a much, much larger company than Airwalk ever was. Plus, Apple is making so much money and has so much cash that it can afford many more missteps than a plucky young footwear company. Perhaps most important, Apple can learn from the example of companies like Airwalk that fell from grace after losing sight of their most influential users. Here’s hoping Apple realizes the danger of diverting too much attention away from the Mac and its professional users.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 10:37 Josh, I was thinking about this over the weekend, but came to a different conclusion. Relying on fashion is not the winning strategy for a company that is this large. Nor is relying on what used to sell - gizmos. I am an Apple computer/phone/watch/TV user. I'll probably buy AirPods. But as a stock holder, I don't want Apple to stay there. I want Apple to move into healthcare and financial services and be willing to abandon computer power users along the way. Shoes are a great analogy, they move to a diminishing market. I want Apple to thrive, and I think it is time to move out of the diminishing phone and computers business and into services. If I could delegate Apple resources, I'd put some of the best folks they have on healthcare and finance. What does that make the phone and Mac? Loss leaders in 2020. Important to have but not the future of the company. So I guess that I am hoping Apple does the reverse of your last paragraph. Thanks for letting me think aloud, Peter Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 There's a lot to be said for Apple and services, but it's a matter of convincing the right people to write up their thoughts for us. :-) I think Apple is making some smart moves in the healthcare and IT spaces, especially with its IBM partnership. But as someone who uses Apple computers professionally, I don't want to see Apple become like IBM, moving entirely out of the end-user market to focus on back-end stuff. The iPhone is still by far Apple's largest revenue source, and the Mac users who create things for it are the backbone of that market. Reply David   2017-02-06 10:38 The day that a teen puts a poster of Marco Arment on the wall of their bedroom is the day that I will believe that the professionals you're talking about with regards to Apple are comparable to Tony Hawk. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 Ha! Teens may not idolize developers, but they certainly enjoy the apps they produce, including maybe some of Marco's. You could argue that Snapchat today is what skateboarding was 20+ years ago, though that's sort of a lousy analogy. Another way to think about this is: imagine walking into a coffee shop and instead of MacBooks, everyone was working on Surface Pro tablets. Given enough scale, that'd certainly have a network effect. Something Gladwell describes in his book, which I didn't go into in the article, is how trends develop. You first have what he calls innovators, oddballs who do new things. Then you have other groups who translate those things for the masses, like mavens and connectors. My point is, to put it in Gladwell speak, if those innovators drop Apple for another platform, over time that could trickle down to the masses and quickly eat away Apple's bottom line. Reply David   2017-02-06 17:54 They may enjoy the apps, but I doubt that 1 in 100 of them know the name of the developer who wrote it. And that breaks the link between "I have to wear what Tony Hawk is wearing" and "I have to code on what Marco Arment is coding on." I can equally imagine -- in the coffee shop analogy -- the teens being horrified that the "old people" are using the same thing they are, and fleeing Apple en masse. Finally, I don't find Gladwell's arguments particularly convincing. He seems to me to regularly take a small part of a social science finding (10,000 hours of practice, eg) and blow it up into a much larger and simpler conclusion, one that makes a good pop-sci headline but doesn't really tells us much about the real world. The narrative at the moment seems to be that Apple is neglecting pros and that's going to cost them, but what I've mostly seen is a range of strained arguments about why it's going to cost them, ranging from possibly plausible to pretty outlandish. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:34 I agree about Gladwell, which is why I didn't go too much into his theories in the article. However, outside of the linked interview, his book was the best source for the Airwalk story. The problem with arguments in favor of the professional markets is that there are a lot of intangibles there. In the case of Airwalk, it likely made total sense to dump the pro skater market for consumers — I'm sure they made far, far more money from Foot Locker than local skate shops. However, that turned out to be an enormous mistake, one that wouldn't appear on any spreadsheet. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:44 I think I'd like to see more than an anecdote before I buy into a narrative that is highly convenient for the people telling and reading it. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:44 One might say the same thing about your arguments. There's a whole truckload of wishful thinking there. Just from a local perspective, the predominant healthcare provider in my area, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, has excellent computerized records and services. They work on Windows PCs, not Macs. Other medical professionals use tablets, though they're not iPads, because they have to link with their non-Apple computer systems. Which is to say, without a Mac backbone, medical providers are not going to be using Apple products and services. Sure there are some highly visible Macs on some popular medical TV shows, but again, those are the Macs you so blithely dismiss. Great product placement, by the way. As Josh says, Macs are at the core of Apple's business. Without the Mac, the iPhone is just another gadget, here today, gone tomorrow. You know, like the iPad. And without the Mac, there will be no Apple products in medicine. As for financial whatever, all Apple does now is provide an access point via Apple Pay for consumers to the real financial service providers. They don't actually provide any of those financial services, nor are they likely to do so. Though they make a tidy profit with every Apple Pay transaction. You want to buy a Mac on credit through Apple you'll be using a Barclaycard, one of the highest interest rate charge cards on the planet, to whom Apple is only an intermediate business. In other words, I don't think your ambitions for Apple growth are grounded in anything like reality. As for shoes being a diminishing market, what planet are you living on? As large third-world countries like China, Mexico and India grow more prosperous, shoes will continue to be a growth industry. Just like iPhones. Which is why Apple is working so hard to break into the Indian market with lower price, recycled iPhones. That's where the growth is for them—and for Nike. The iPhone is the primary driver for the App Store, Apple's most prosperous service niche. And the App Store sells apps. And apps for the App Store are developed on Macs. Without the Mac there would be no apps and no App Store and, for all practical purposes, no iPhone. And no Apple. While Microsoft's Surface PCs are not yet a dominant product, Microsoft is clearly thinking long term, hence their huge investment in product placement in the NFL. The Surface Studio is coming out this year and will eventually, I presume to predict, make a significant dent in Apple's base among design professionals. Unless, as Josh hopes, Apple begins to take their professional base seriously once again. If I were twenty years younger I would certainly take the Surface Pro seriously. I share Josh's hope, but I don't share his optimism. If the new MacBook Pro is Apple's idea of a professional computer, with only 16GB of RAM, they've lost their way big time. They've taken their obsession with thin well past the point of diminishing returns. In the meantime, Tim Cook is good at blowing smoke at financial analysts, but as has been pointed out elsewhere in this issue of TidBITS, Apple's record first quarter was a week longer than the same quarter last year. In other words, Cook is using accounting gimmicks to draw a false equivalency between the two. Adjusted for that extra week, Apple's sales and profits are far less rosy than Cook would have us believe. At best they are flat, year over year. Is Apple making lots of money right now? Sure. Even with no growth they're still a rich company with money to burn. But they don't appear to be burning any of it on serious R&D. Like, perhaps, a touch interface for the macOS that can compete with Microsoft. iOS does touch just fine. But Cook refuses to acknowledge the need for it in OS X. Apple is riding high right now. But there's an old expression, what goes up must come down. Put another way, in business if you're not growing, you're dying. Implicit in Josh's argument is the proposition that Apple may have reached the peak of it's growth and success. They won't fail overnight, but that doesn't mean they're not failing. If Tim Cook is not aware of that, as he seems not to be, then Apple will be going downhill from now on. There may be a blip of success here and there, but that won't halt the downward momentum. Tim Cook is a nice guy and Steve Jobs was a jerk. Still, some might say the biggest difference between them is the vision thing. Steve had it. Tim does not. But I think the biggest difference between them is that Steve Jobs would not tolerate mediocrity. Time Cook seems to tolerate it all to well. Thanks David for giving me a jumping off point for my rant. I would have made it anyway, but you gave me a convenient place to start. I agree with Josh's premise, but I'm more skeptical than he is. Josh is politely suggesting that Apple needs to return it's attention to the Mac and the wide range of professional users who depend on it. Unlike Josh, however, I feel no need to be polite. Tim Cook needs to wake the f*ck up. Reply David   2017-02-07 22:37 You're certainly welcome. None of what you said was in response to my actual points, enough that I was wondering if there was another David in the thread. Apparently not. If you'd like to engage with my actual arguments, you're welcome to do that, too. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-09 20:19 The PC 'enthusiast' market (broad term, basically power users of yore) is the only growth/margin market in the PC business. Apple are leaving money on the table by not addressing the enthusiast. Reply Zac Imboden   2017-02-06 15:06 What a thoughtful and well-written analysis. Regarding Peter Meyer's comments, I understand that Apple has it's own unique needs. What I would add is that what may be good for Apple (i.e. corporate expansion, diversification) may not be good for end users, specifically Mac users. I wish Apple to succeed as a company only as far as it concerns how they can continue to meet my needs and not theirs, my needs, not as a content revenue stream, an iPhone user, an iPad user, but as a MAC user. It appears to me that there is no longer any strong financial incentive for Apple to support and innovate their computer hardware and software as that segment continues to shrink in comparison to phone and content revenue. Continuing to complain about ridiculous mistakes in design and implementation and continuing to beg Apple to innovate and improve in the areas which matter the most to Mac users are losing propositions in the long run. If Apple wanted to do a great service to its various "niches", in my un-expert opinion, it would spin off the Mac and its system software and core apps into a separate company and let that company focus and innovate to meet the needs of its "niche" of Mac computer users at its own pace and peril. I'm not a investment guru, so I leave the financial merits of spin-offs for others. From an end-user endpoint, it seems to be the only way to get someone to pay closer attention to the very specific needs of computer users. Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:39 I think that would be courting the death of the Mac, honestly. As I argued in my other comment, the halo effect runs the other way - more people are buying Macs because they have used and liked Apple's consumer products. I think the main reason Macs have been bucking the overall decline in the computer industry is because they have Apple's strength in the consumer market to support them. If you cut the link there, you cut the main driving force for Mac market growth. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:19 Thanks for the kind words, Zac. However, I disagree with Apple spinning off the Mac. Tight integration with other Apple devices is still one of the Mac's strengths, and a spin-off would threaten that. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:20 I agree that the popularity of the iPhone and other Apple products helps drive Mac adoption. No argument there, and I think that's also still an important market for Apple. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:49 If Apple could value the Mac well enough to spin it off, they could value it enough to develop it internally. The problem is Apple doesn't seem to care one way or the other. Reply Derek Roff   2017-02-06 18:17 While Peter's suggestion that Apple get out of the hardware business strikes fear into my heart, I think it also misses Josh's key message. Why should a prudent investor like Peter assume that Apple can compete effectively in Services? This is an area where Apple has no particular expertise, and no intrinsic advantages. There are dozens of companies who understand Services better than Apple, and have both a deeper background and more agility. Airwalk survived as a fashion company, barely, and Apple might survive as an also-ran Services company, but as Josh indicates, this looks like the path to obscurity. Apple is a significant force in Services at the moment, because they are rich from hardware sales, and incredibly well known, from their integrated hardware, software, and lifestyle sales. Tossing all that out is, as Josh says, a losing strategy. Apple will not make its investors richer by proclaiming, "Think Conventionally". Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:30 Sigh. Another day, another 'Apple is doomed because they aren't catering to Important Users Like Me' article. The glaring flaw in this example is that it argues that people are drawn to Apple's consumer products because of the popularity of their computers among the elite - the halo effect. But if anything, the halo effect has run in the opposite direction, and has since the heyday of the iPod. People are buying Apple's consumer products, like the experience, and buying Macs to go with them. I've argued this before: Apple has, from the very first Apple ][, *always* catered to the ordinary user above the elite. When 'personal' computers were bulky S100 boxes that needed a separate dumb terminal and the arcane C/PM OS, Apple released a cute, streamlined all-in-one that hooked to a TV and booted into BASIC. When IBM introduced the designed-for-cubicles PC, Apple introduced the novice-user-friendly Mac. When smartphones were geeky tools, Apple released the iPhone. That's who they are. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-06 18:44 So you're saying that none of your less-technical family, friends, or clients buy Apple hardware because of your recommendations? In my experience, most people who know they don't have the technical chops to make an informed decision buy based on social influence. Reply David   2017-02-06 21:27 Are his family & friends a sufficient sample to generalize? Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-07 04:51 Actually, seriously, yes. I've been asked for advice on *which* Mac to buy, but everyone I know who bought Mac in the last year decided to go that route on their own. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:11 This is a discussion, not a research study. :-) Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:10 I obviously don't know the specifics, but unless you're well known for being platform agnostic, I doubt people would ask you for advice on other platforms. Your social influence to recommend Apple products is likely well known. Lots of people ask me for my opinions about what to buy, but they're always aware that I know Apple technology. But the article's point is that if you'd said, "Apple's hardware is stagnating and you'd be throwing money away if you didn't look at an Android phone or Windows PC" would those people ignore you and still buy Apple gear? In other words, if you as a tech influencer switched away from Apple gear, how many people would go with you eventually, purely because of your influence? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:22 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed. I can't count how many times I've written here something to the effect of "Apple is far from doomed." However, I do think shirking the professional market is an enormous mistake. Nor would I want Apple to drop or lose focus of its massively successful consumer line. The professional and consumer sides of Apple help build its strong ecosystem. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:50 2 people would go with me. Which would reduce Apple customers for the last quarter from 96 million people to 95,999,998. Even if there were 50,000 tech influencers who took 2 people with them, it would reduce Apple's customers from 96 million to 95,900,000 last quarter. (all numbers either approximate (customer numbers, people I influence) or made up (number of tech influencers)). Math done badly and on the fly. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:26 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed, either, though I'm more cynical on the subject that Josh is. For one thing, doomed is a vague and melodramatic term. If Apple fails to innovate and improve the Mac, then their base of support will be eroded over time because, as I said before, the Mac is the core of Apple's business. Without it Apple's other business interests would fail to flourish. And that's putting it mildly. In my opinion, without the Mac there is no Apple. But I don't see Apple killing the Mac. After all, it's still making money. What I see happening, as Josh points out in more polite terms, is that the Mac appears to be declining in importance for Apple. This doesn't spell doom, but it does spell stagnation. Meanwhile, Apple competitors continue to innovate. As an artist, the Surface Studio is the first Windows PC that has ever piqued my interest. If Apple continues to rest on it's laurels Microsoft is going to eat their lunch. Now that they are making good hardware, Microsoft is playing in the same ballpark with Apple. And, like macOS X 10.12.x, Windows 10 is a solid and accessible OS. And there are areas, like cloud services, where Microsoft far exceeds Apple's success. So do Google and Amazon. Services aren't going to save Apple's bacon. The Mac is the only thing that can do that, not because it makes the most money, but because it's central to the success of every other Apple venture. What I don't understand is why Tim Cook doesn't seem to know this. His desultory remarks about the future of the Mac are not encouraging. Another incremental update to the iMac or the Mac mini isn't going to get the job done. Nor are incremental improvements to the macOS. As I've said before, at the top of my wish list is a touch screen interface for the macOS. Without this it's very hard to see how Apple is going to keep up with the competition. Reply Christian Kaatmann   2017-02-06 19:21 The thing that Apple is certainly doing right now - seen from a user perspective - is that _all_ of their systems are much more reliable now than they used to be. I very rarely have to reboot, if one app crashes the rest of the system carries on unperturbed, I can go seamlessly from my Mac to my iPhone to iCloud on a windows machine without ever loosing a comma in the text I'm working on. It's like magic compared to not so many years ago. And Apple has got us all happily hooked on its services with iCloud at the centre. And I mean happily, thinking of the days back with Excel 1.04, swapping disks on my Mac SE or more recently trying to keep my iMac from crashing every time I switched from Mail to Word to Excel to ... Apple keeps a lot of customers happy and deeply dependent. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:31 That is a great point. Thank you! Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:23 Apple does enjoy tremendous lock-in, which certainly gives it staying power. iCloud is one of the weaker service bundles, but it's bolstered by the popularity of the hardware, which in turn benefits from iCloud lock-in. Not to mention dependence on iMessage. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:30 A quick addition if you don't mind. I am going to express my opinion, not fact. I don't think that Apple will abandon the larger Mac and phone and iPod markets (or TV or iPads.) I am looking at these devices as critically important. Not important as computing devices, but highly valuable as data devices. What is the difference? Computing takes place in a small fairly closed environment. Data is fed by and then feeds a larger system. (I think of the Mac Pro as being about computing, the iPad and Apple TV as being about data.) If I look at this as an investor, I see that data system as services with end point devices. The devices are either commodity products or are really sophisticated at handling data to and from the user. That data is the core of the future services. (Again, this is me as businessman, not as the guy who is really enjoying this MBP right now). Apple should, absolutely should, stay in the end point market and make exceptionally exciting devices like an iPhone so light that you need a lanyard to hold it in place. Those devices are data portals, and the real economic engine for what might be the most valuable company on the planet will be the data services. They actually might subsidize the hardware experiments that many of us love. For those hardware experiments, my credit card vibrates in anticipation. My business mind is looking for services in healthcare and automobiles. The hardware is what we know, the services that we do not yet know will be our future, just as the pocket computer once was. So much for me being quick. Josh, Adam, thank you! Reply Herb Bowie  2017-02-06 20:16 The analogy seems a bit contrived, and the conclusions a bit overblown. Part of what we have always loved and respected about Apple is its intent and ability to skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is. If we think about these issues from that perspective, we might make the following observations: 1. As device buses get increasingly powerful, and as the pace of technology change quickens, and as the desire for smaller computers increases, it will make sense for users to do "upgrades" by adding or swapping out peripherals, not through changes to the internals of their computers. 2. As SSD, memory, networks and microprocessors all get faster, the simple desire for ever bigger numbers -- faster chips, more RAM, etc. -- becomes less and less relevant for most users. 3. While Apple needs to provide core apps and services to make the average consumer happy, Apple's primary contribution to the larger app ecosystem is to make better tools for developers, not to make "Pro" level applications themselves. 4. As security becomes more and more of an issue, tight controls on the App store become increasingly important; however, third-party software suppliers still have the ability to deliver apps to their customers outside of the App store, so customers can have the best of both worlds. 5. As it becomes easier and easier to develop Mac applications, and as the Mac development tools grow stronger, and as the number of specialized apps continues to grow, it becomes ever harder to see why the Mac would need a special department for "Automation Technologies" for those few users who cannot find already developed solutions to their problems, yet who are also unable to develop new solutions themselves. So, yes, in all these cases, there are some short-term bumps in the road for many of us, and some more difficult issues for a few of us, but isn't this what we've always expected from Apple? Reply mike sanders  2017-02-06 21:53 Excellent response and a much more focussed overview, great respect to Josh but like so many "old" Apple users you still expect them to be a computer company which they no longer are. I have been a user since 1987 and an investor since the 2000s and have to say I am completely satisfied on both accounts. A very well run company which clearly knows where it is going just that it doesn't share it with us until the time is right. Have you seen the stock price today? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:25 Per your point on automation — I think Apple sees Swift as eventually overtaking AppleScript. That's fine with me, but Apple also needs to continue to create automation tools for professionals who aren't programmers. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:47 I agree. Unfortunately, Apple has a habit of dropping the ball on good ideas and technologies. For example, iWeb was overtaken by the competition because Apple lost interest in developing it. The same goes for Aperture. Now Apple Script and Automator are threatened with extinction, with no accessible replacement in sight. Apple Script and Automator enable the user to plug right into the OS and their applications. They are essentially programmable apps. Swift, on the other hand, is a programming language not an application. It's hard to imagine a third party developing a program with Swift that will have the broad capabilities of Apple's native apps. If history is any guide, apprehension is called for. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-02-07 00:35 You forgot bonehead moves like killing Apple Displays, AirPort, and now it looks like the iPad lines will be next. Possibly even the desktop Macs. Tim Cook needs to be canned. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:26 Indeed, I should have mentioned the loss of Apple displays and the apparent abandonment of AirPort routers. The latter is a thorn in my side at the moment, since my Express is on its last legs, and I'm distrustful of others on the market. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-08 01:06 Right you are. Both Apple Displays and Airport routers have been overtaken by the competition because Apple has apparently lost interest in supporting and improving them. This has the look of a tradition at Apple. Or a disability, like ADD. There was a time when third-party routers did not support the Mac with decent setup software. Airport routers solved that problem, though they tended to be less capable than the competition. They had the virtue of being simple. That time is past. Though various routers handle the matter differently, their setup software has improved. For instance, I can get into a Comcast router's built-in setup software with a simple URL, as I did with Linksys routers in the past. AT&T has always bumped me to a web site where I entered the appropriate information and the web site passed it to the router. This was particularly useful in the old days when routers and modem settings often got corrupted. If something went wrong, pop, there I was at the AT&T setup page. Nowadays routers are more reliable and such problems are rare—though not unheard of. Apple eventually improved the simple Airport Base Station by including a hard drive that interfaced easily with Time Machine—the Airport Time Capsule, an appropriate name at the time. And the Time Capsule has improved over the years with a space saving tower configuration and larger hard drives. Though you can still get the Airport Extreme which is a simple router without the hard drive. It's comparably priced with similar routers, except that you still need an external modem, which might be a disadvantage, unless you're used to setting up modems. That said, I don't know why Apple is apparently dropping their WiFi product line. They work perfectly well. Perhaps sales have declined as service providers now so often provide their own routers and independent modems are less common. Airport routers still require an external modem, which puts them behind the curve. I used to like a separate modem because they tended to fail more often that routers. But now I rent my router from Comcast and if it fails for any reason I just pop down to the Xfinity store and get a replacement. The same goes for AT&T. I haven't had occasion to set up an Airport router in years. Still, I don't think it's a good reason not to get a replacement Airport Express if your Airport Extreme orTime Capsule is still working OK. Current models have the fastest WiFi, 802.11ac, and they are still for sale on the Apple web site, as is the Airport Express. Replacing the Express seems to me to be simpler than regigering your entire system with a new router and a new repeater. But then if your router is also having issues, there are less expensive alternatives to the Airport, depending on your setup. Reply Jean-Pierre SMITH  2017-02-07 04:37 Great analogy and thinking, for the Mac platform. I liked the idea the combination of (1) techical brilliance, as seen by the recognised "experts" and (2) some hype (better call it "intelligent design") is a key factor of success for the Mac. Remove one of the two pillars and the structure collapses. To remember, I still have on my LC-475's screen saver (not used any more) the picture of a snail carrying on its back a rival PC's Intel CISC processor. These old macs used Motorola RISC processors, deemed faster by the "experts". You may have called to the bar Michelin, whose tyres for trucks (trucking fleets are the tyre equivalent to the Mac's "expert" users) are in demand for their durability (mileage), while car drivers don't measure mileage but simply benefit from it without knowing. Car tyres benefit directly from R&D invested in truck tyres just as the Mac for me [ordinary Joe] directly benefits from the Mac used, misused and challenged by its professional users (the "experts"). I am not so sure, though, the above analogy works for the iPhone, iPad and iWatch lines (is it still true that the iPhone for the Presidents is called "Blackberry"?). Thanks for the brain teaser. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-09 20:13 The PC 'enthusiast' market is the only one with growth. Sell the OS for $500 - restricted to 6 core+ (ie X99) motherboards, only from (a few) vetted vendors. No manufacturing costs. Pure profit once initial outlay of programming is covered.

The initial recall was issued on Feb. 3 following a consumer complaint. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says a manufacturing error “resulted in excess water in the product, which could support the growth of Clostridium Botulinum and pose a health risk to consumers.” The pouches were sold in Fortinos, Loblaws, No Frills, Real Canadian Superstore, Real Canadian Wholesale Club, valu-mart, Your Independent Grocer, Zehrs, Shoppers Drug Mart, and affiliated independent stores. Food contaminated with the bacteria may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. The company says there have been reported illness that may be associated with the baby food. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, blurred or double vision, dry mouth, respiratory failure and paralysis. In severe cases of illness, people may die. Customers can return the products to any store where PC products are sold to receive a full refund, with or without a receipt. The CFIA says they are working to ensure the recalled product is removed from the marketplace.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.
