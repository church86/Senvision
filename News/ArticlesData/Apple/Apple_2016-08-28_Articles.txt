For weeks reports have emerged saying that the European Commission, the bloc's competition watchdog, was gearing up to hit Apple with a hefty penalty over tax agreements with the Irish government. A source close to the matter told AFP on condition of anonymity that a decision was expected on Tuesday, while another source also cited that date. Under European Union rules, which deem state tax aid illegal, the firm could be ordered to pay back taxes to Ireland. A commission spokeswoman and Apple both declined to comment on news that a decision was forthcoming. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a Washington Post interview published August 13, said he hoped to "get a fair hearing" on the matter. "If we don't, then we would obviously appeal it," he added. The US stepped up its fight last Wednesday against the commission's crackdown on tax avoidance by Apple and other multinational companies, accusing it of unilateralism and overstepping its mandate. In a white paper, the US Treasury said the commission probe into alleged special tax treatment that certain EU countries gave Apple, Amazon, Starbucks (Swiss: SBUX.SW - news) and Fiat Chrysler "undermines the international tax system." - 'Defend our reputation' - A US Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on a possible ruling Tuesday from the commission. The US has acknowledged the problems around the issue of multinational firms obtaining state aid, in the form of secret and extremely lucrative tax breaks, from Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg for setting up business in those countries. But it said those deals were made under international treaties and accepted tax practices. The Treasury accused the commission in the white paper of taking a "new approach" to established EU tax law in challenging member states' legal tax breaks offered to multinational firms. Last week the commission denied it was targeting US companies in particular and said that EU rules do not allow national tax authorities to give tax breaks to some companies that are not available to others. If such breaks are ruled illegal, the benefits from them have to be repaid. "This is a standard feature of EU state aid rules," the commission's statement said. Ireland has stood by its actions, with Junior finance minister Eoghan Murphy saying Sunday: "We don't believe we gave any state aid to Apple". He reiterated the government's stance that it would appeal any decision that found against Ireland in the matter. "It's in the national interest that we defend our international reputation in this regard," he said in the comments on RTE, the national broadcaster.

The company is to be accused of receiving illegal state aid from Ireland, according to another report (paywalled) in the Financial Times. A giood portion of the FT report has been reproduced here. Apple, and other big technology companies like Google and Microsoft, have come under fire in numerous countries, including Australia, for allegedly evading tax by channelling most of their business through low-tax nations like Ireland and Singapore. The European Commission is expected to make a statement giving an exact figure that it expects Apple to pay back to Ireland, the WSJ report said. As iTWire reported in September last year, if the EC can force Ireland to comply with its tax findings, the decision could cost Apple €17 billion (A$27 billion) in Ireland alone, plus several billion more in countries around the world, including Australia. Over the last 10 years, Apple has been paying an effective tax rate of just 2% in Ireland. The agreement Apple has with Ireland allows it to use the country as its global distributor in exchange for paying this low tax rate. Countries like Australia have to buy products from the Irish subsidiary at artificially inflated prices and, as a result, the local outfit (the one in Australia) ends up making a very small profit and hence pays little or no tax in Australia. The heads of Apple, Google and Australia were hauled up before a Senate committee in April last year to answer questions about their tax avoidance schemes. The EC's anti-trust agency began investigating Apple's tax deals more than two years ago and said deals in 1991 and 2007 amounted to state aid, according to the WSJ report. The deals were allegedly done in order that more jobs would be created in Ireland. A whitepaper issued by the US Treasury on 24 August was critical of the EU move, arguing that they targeted only American multinationals. In it, US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew raised several objections to the EU's move, including a claim that the Commission's new approach was inconsistent with international norms and undermined the international tax system. Apple has more than US$200 billion stashed away in foreign locations and will have to pay a tax rate of 33% on this amount if it takes the money back to the US.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On Apple's next iPhone to debut next week By Allie Coyne on Aug 30, 2016 9:57AM Amidst legal stoush over dead touchscreens. Apple has issued invitations to a product launch event on September 7 United States time at which it is expected to unveil its latest generation iPhone.  It will mark the fifth year in a row that Apple has launched new products, most famously the iPhone, in early September. As usual Apple is tight-lipped on what can be expected at the event, but the new iPhone will reportedly boast only minor differences to the current 6s and 6s Plus models. One major change that is expected, however, is the removal of the smartphone's headphone jack. Reports have been swirling that the jack would be swapped out for a Lightning connector to 3.5 mm jack dongle. This would allow Apple to make the next iPhone slimmer and also ensure the device is more water resistant. The new iPhone is also anticipated to have fewer antenna lines and a dual camera system for the larger model. The tech giant will debut its new iPhone amidst a legal storm in the US initiated by former iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users who have launched a class action lawsuit over malfunctioning touchscreens. The ex-customers claim Apple is failing to address a design defect that renders touchscreens unusable on their devices. They claim the problems surfaced due to Apple's decision not to properly protect its touchscreen controller chips, as it did with the previous iPhone 5 via a metal shield. The touchscreen issue occurs when the chips come away from the controller board. Repair is difficult given the chips need to be re-soldered to work again, according to iFixIt.

Tech giant sends out cryptic invite for launch of new product in early September The announcement on Apple's website.Image Credit: Apple website Will the new iPhone 7 be cosmetically similar to the 2-year-old iPhone 6, with some new features thrown in?Image Credit: Apple website The inviteImage Credit: Gulf News‹› Published: 22:03 August 29, 2016 Gulf News Web Report   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dubai: An invite with cryptic words had been sent out. The date: September 7. Apple watchers the world over are abuzz with speculation that the iPhone 7  – the latest iteration of the tech giant's best-selling smartphone — is  coming, finally.   Following numerous purported leaks and rumours going around, Apple started sending out press invites on Monday for a September 7 product launch where the iPhone 7 — and possibly a new Apple Watch — will most likely by officially unveiled. In the company's usual enigmatic style, the invite features the Apple logo against a black background, but gives very little away: "See you on the 7th. Please join us for an invitation-only event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on Wednesday, September 7, at 10:00 a.m." The only other thing that's clear by the invite's text is the venue: Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, which seems to have become Apple's favourite venue for all its big product launches. The venue, with a seating capacity of about 7,000 people, is also where the company held its 2016 World Wide Developers Conference. It was during this event that Apple announced new versions of its operating systems, including iOS 10, macOS Sierra and watchOS 2. What tech watchers expect on September 7: Apple is expected to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone and Apple Watch at the event. Monday's invitation may refer to a larger version of the new iPhone that is expected to have a dual-camera system to improve photography. The successors to the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus is said to include advanced photography capabilities and upgraded hardware with a design similar to last year's models, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month. The iPhone generates about two-thirds of Apple's sales, making a product refresh essential to help revive growth in the run-up to Christmas. No more audio jack? Online reports suggest Apple plans to forego the 3.5mm audio jack and replace it with the lightning connector for audio output, for the upcoming iPhone 7. The move is likely aimed at making future iPhones even slimmer. Images circulating online claimed to be Apple's EarPods with lightning connector, seems to confirm this. The EarPods' images were posted on Chinese social media website Weibo. If Apple decides to ditch the 3.5mm audio jack, it won't be the first company to do so. Earlier this year, Chinese manufacturer LeEco launched three smartphones without a 3.5mm headphone jack. The company claims that the handsets are the first in the world to forego the traditional 3.5mm jack and feature a USB Type-C audio port with CDLA (Continual Digital Lossless Audio) tech.

Among the upgraded features rumoured for the iPhone 7 include two cameras on the back, a slimmer design and new waterproof skills. A new Apple Watch has also been heavily tipped, with the wearable expected to allow users to make calls without even being a connected iPhone. ©  Weibo (iPhone 7 leak) Nike also recently riled us all up by apparently leaking that Apple Watch 2 will be GPS-enabled - among many other new and exciting upgrades.

As per usual, Apple announced the event via cryptic invite with the words "see you on the 7th". The invite also features an Apple logo made out of coloured spheres, suggesting the focus of the event the could be the camera. The spheres simulate bokeh, the out of focus areas in photos or video with a shallow depth of field. DSLR-like bokeh is something smartphones have struggled to achieve due to small internal sensor size (after all, a smartphone is much smaller than a DSLR). Rumours have suggested that the iPhone 7 Plus will feature a dual rear-camera configuration (much like the Huawei P9), which could help in achieving this goal. Huawei's P9 was able to use its two camera setup to simulate bokeh thanks to extra depth information provided by the second camera. Other rumours have suggested the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus won't be too different in terms of design when compared to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. Key physical differences are said to be a thinner body, less prominent antenna lines, and the lack of a headphone jack.

Recover your password The USB Port Tech Apps Social US News Entertainment Science Editorials Autos Health Apple may launch the new iPhone and Apple Watch next week By Luis Mendez - August 29, 2016 29 Most credible rumors about the iPhone 7. Image credit: YouTube. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is ready to reveal the new iPhone 7. The company will hold an event at the Bill Graham Civic Auditory in San Francisco on September 7th. Apple emailed invitations to media outlets this morning. Although the message doesn’t give any further information about what the company is unveiling, the press is expecting an iPhone 7, and possibly a second-gen Apple Watch. The final updates of the iOS 10 and MacOS Sierra could also be part of the event, according to Mac World. Apple is known for releasing new devices at the beginning of September. The tech giant delivered both the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 series around this time. These early launches are the main reason for the media to speculate about the arrival of the new handset. Also, plenty of specialized websites have posted rumors about the iPhone specs and design in the past months. According to App Advice, the product won’t feature any significant changes on its looks. Apple is reportedly holding a design upgrade for next year when a 10th anniversary iPhone could arrive. The iPhone would come in Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold However, most of these websites have reported minor changes in the handset’s exterior. One of them would be the length of its antenna, as it would split in two, instead of extending across the body. Another heavily rumored change in the upcoming device is its audio output. Apple is getting rid of the 3.5mm standard jack, and instead, would replace it with wireless earbuds. This move from the company has faced mixed feelings among consumers, and even Apple’s co-founder, Steve Wozniak expressed his concerns about it. The curved-screen model shown above is an artist’s depiction of what next-generation smartphones could look like. Image Source: Business Insider The handset might also be water-resistant The iPhone’s hardware is expected to come with the latest high-end tech. An A10 chip with 64-bit architecture would run the device. It would also come with an ‘M10’ motion coprocessor, according to a leak from GeekBar posted on Weibo two weeks ago. Other possible features include a dual camera, and three options for the storage capacity of 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB respectively. The WatchOS 3 is running the next-gen Apple Watch The gadget is reportedly coming with a faster processor and GPS, but the central aspect of the Apple Watch might be its new OS. The WatchOS 3 was designed to be more practical, and will help the device feel more like a watch, according to a description on Apple’s portal. However, rumors across tech sites suggest the Apple Watch won’t face any significant changes in its design. The upcoming Apple event is invitation-only, customers will have to wait these days before official reports of the new products hit the internet.

Follow @UPROXX Member Sign Up Sign In Everything You Need To Know About The New Iphone 7 The iPhone 7 Is Coming Next Week: Here’s What You Need To Know Dan Seitz 08.29.16 4 months ago 6 Comments Facebook Twitter EMAIL Via Unbox Therapy It’s official: The iPhone 7 is being announced next week, likely sans a headphone jack and any mention of Barbra Streisand. Here’s what we know so far about the new phone, the Apple Watch, and what you can expect from both. The iPhone 7 First and foremost, the headphone jack is dead, or at least Apple is trying to mortally wound it in favor of Lightning headphones. Much of the discussion surrounding the iPhone 7 has hinged on Apple’s removal of the jack, as that’s really the biggest external change. Considering how much chatter has surrounded this, expect Apple to spend a lot of time talking up the virtues — including waterproofing — of making your earbuds obsolete, Outside of the disappearing headphones, little has actually changed, according to leaks. Expect more subtle antenna lines, more color options, a ginormous iPhone 7 Plus, and, externally, that’s about it. Internally, Apple might finally drop the 16GB model and make 32GB the minimum amount of memory on an iPhone, a change that many see as overdue. Apple will also likely debut the new, faster A10 processor, as it’s tended to upgrade hardware in the line with each new iPhone. In terms of iOS 10, expect lots of Snapchatty type features, and little tweaks that take more advantage of the hardware. Apple has been prepping for the tenth anniversary iPhone 8, so any really big changes to iOS are likely waiting a year. Still, don’t rule out Apple dropping in a few surprises. Finally, when preorders open, it seems likely you’ll get your new iPhone September 30th. Thanks, Babs. Apple Watch On the Apple Watch front, expect Apple to talk a lot about health. The watch is due for a general upgrade in the first place, and it’ll likely be receiving a faster processor and a GPS chip, making it ideal for step-tracking and collecting health data. Apple just bought a health records startup, Gliimpse, that specializes in tracking chronic health issues like diabetes. It’s also spent the last year improving HealthKit, its consumer-facing health software that fits all your calorie counting and fitness tracking under one interface, and ResearchKit, its industrial-grade health-tracking software doctors use to manage studies. Considering that fitness trackers have clung to market share even as the rest of the wearables market has slumped, it’s not the most surprising move. But Apple is in an unusually strong place to combine consumer health and technology to a degree we haven’t seen before. They may not announce that fully next week, but expect to see a strong emphasis on health in the near future.

Profile By: theliquidsword 08.30.2016 @ 8:28 AM The loss of the headphone jack is a deal breaker for me. I am going Android from this point forward. So tired of Apple pulling the rug out from under it’s customers to make a quick buck. Profile By: The Delusions of Officer Jim Lahey 08.30.2016 @ 12:01 PM No doubt. No headphone jack, no purchase. I listen to podcasts & music all the time on my iPhone. If they’re going to pull this bullsh*t con-job so they can sell you their earbuds/headphones, I hope they lose a lot of sales. I like the choice to choose my own earbuds, not to be forced to purchase theirs.

And the phones may not be as dull as widely believed. Eric Jhonsa Aug 30, 2016 9:52 AM EDT By holding its annual September iPhone event a little earlier than usual, Apple (AAPL)  might be able to book two weeks worth of iPhone 7 sales in what's expected to be a weak fiscal fourth quarter. That, along with reports that collectively suggest the iPhone 7 might not be as much of a dud as many expect it to be, could propel analyst estimates higher in the coming weeks. This would be a positive both for Apple, and for chip suppliers such as Cirrus Logic (CRUS) , Skyworks (SWKS) , Qorvo (QRVO) , NXP (NXPI) , InvenSense (INVN)  and Broadcom (AVGO) . On Monday, Apple sent out invites for an event that will be held at 1 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, Sept. 7, in San Francisco. Needless to say, the company is expected to unveil a new 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7-plus. A new Apple Watch may also be in the cards. Apple and NXP are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells AAPL or NXPI? Learn more now. Apple's event arrives two days earlier in September than its 2015 and 2014 iPhone events, and (given the company's past behavior) could mean the iPhone 7 will ship on Friday, Sept. 16. A bit of extra time to sell the iPhone 7 could prove useful in a quarter in which Apple has guided for revenue to drop to $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion from $51.5 billion in the year-ago period, largely due to an iPhone sales decline.

According to the report, the iPad will be receiving updated software for greater functionality, while Apple will be releasing new iMacs, an upgraded MacBook Air, a new 5K monitor, and a thinner MacBook Pro that’s been rumored for quite some time. Starting with the iPad, Bloomberg says that Apple’s developing new software exclusively for this piece of hardware that will better take advantage of the Apple Pencil which could be used to annotate certain screens within apps like iMessage, Safari, Mail, and more. The software is expected to launch as a part of an iOS 10 upgrade or within iOS 11 which is scheduled for release next year. Apple may roll out the new iPad software features as part of an upgrade to the iOS 10 operating system in the first half of 2017, or save the enhancements for the next major iOS version later in the year, said one of the people. Apple began integrating features exclusive to the iPad last year with the release of a mode to work in two applications simultaneously. The planned iPad update will include improvements to the Apple Pencil, a handwriting and drawing stylus aimed at professionals, according to one of the people. Apple has considered allowing users to annotate objects in many applications across the whole operating system, including in Mail, the Safari web browser, and iMessage, similar to what Samsung Electronics Co. offers on its Note smartphones, the person said. Currently, Apple only supports Pencil functionality in specifically developed apps. In addition, upgraded iPad models are expected for next year which will include faster display technology to make zooming, panning, and scrolling quicker and smoother. The new iPad hardware will include faster display technology that allows for smoother zooming, panning and scrolling, one of the people said. Apple isn’t planning to update its iPad lineup until next year, when a new version of the iPad Pro will be released… It’s nice to see Apple directing some software attention to the iPad. As we all know by now, the iPad is very powerful and capable of multitasking like no one’s business, but with the limitations of iOS loaded on-board the tablet, you’re pretty limited to what you can do. Hopefully in the future, Apple will release some type of special edition of iOS specifically designed for the functionality, speed, and powerfulness of the iPad which, I’m sure, will be met with much satisfaction from consumers. Moving head-on to the Mac side of this report, Bloomberg states that Apple’s readying upgraded iMac models, a new MacBook Air, a 5K monitor that will be brought to the public by ways of a partnership between Apple and LG, and (obviously) an upgraded, thinner MacBook Pro for release as early as October 2016. The new iMacs will likely be upgraded to include an option to opt in for a graphics card built by AMD, while the MacBook Airs are expected to feature USB-C ports rather the current USB-A and USB-B ports. The refreshed Mac hardware line includes new versions of the iMac desktop, MacBook Air laptop, and a 5K standalone monitor in collaboration with LG Electronics Inc., in addition to a thinner MacBook Pro laptop. … Apple is planning to release some of the new Mac products as soon as October, according to the people. The updated line includes tweaked MacBook Air devices with multi-functional USB-C port technology and iMacs with an option for new graphics chips from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Regarding the highly anticipated MacBook Pro upgrade, Bloomberg has obtained new in-depth details about the rumored OLED touch bar which will replace the Function key row on the Pro’s keyboard which, internally by Apple, is called the “Dynamic Function Row”. The standout feature is a digital function key display above the keyboard that allows for common tasks to be done more quickly for whatever program is being used, according to people familiar with the upcoming product. The feature is internally called the “Dynamic Function Row,” two of the people said, who added that Apple’s official name may differ. For example, if a user is on their desktop, the screen will show a virtual representation of the standard function row, which includes brightness and media controls. When in an application, the virtual row will show options specific to the task at hand, but volume controls and a switch to show the default functions will always be present. The Safari web browser would enable controls for finding and defining terms, while the iMovie video editor would offer controls for cutting clips and a more-precise volume slider, the people said. This is pretty much what we’ve all been expecting from the OLED touch bar, however it was never initially known until now just what the capabilities of this addd piece of hardware were. In addition, the touch bar will require macOS Sierra (which just entered stage 8 of its beta process today) to operate. The software will reportedly launch at the end of September. More details on Apple and LG’s partnership have also been shared by Bloomberg which claim that a 5K monitor is in the works for release. In addition to the new Macs, Apple is working on a new standalone monitor to connect to its computers, according to the people. After exiting the monitor business earlier this year with the discontinuation of the 27-inch Thunderbolt display, Apple is working with LG Electronics on a new monitor with a high-resolution “5K” screen, according to one of the people. Apple currently sells an iMac with a built-in 5K panel, which includes over seven times as many pixels as standard 1080p displays. All in all, it’s very interesting to see this type of partnership form between Apple and someone like LG. Two of the biggest competitors in the tech industry shaking hands to deliver a product to the public is pretty cool to see, especially since it’s Apple we’re talking about here. Not much else is known about the monitor like who will manufacture it or design it for that matter, however we don’t have much longer to wait if the October release date is of any indication.

Rumor has it that Apple will release the iPad Pro 2 in March next year. While there are those who suspect that the iPad Pro 2 will be one of the devices that will be unveiled in the rumored Apple event next month, it is said that the said device is likely to get a release in 2017. According to Mac World, many expected that the iPad Pro 2 would be launched at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) last June. However, the event commenced and concluded without even a mere mention of the device. The online publication opines, though, that, in the event that Apple will really release the iPad Pro 2 in March 2017, the current iPad Pro will already feel outdated. On the other hand, if it launches the device next month, it may upset those who have just bought the current iPad Pro 9.7, which was released only this year. With this, Mac World opines that Apple may come to a sort of a compromise. Instead of releasing an iPad Pro 2 this September, it will instead release a minor update on the current iPad Pro 12.9 that will introduce the impressive features of the iPad Pro 9.7, such as the True Tone Display, and an improved camera. After the updated version of the said device is released next month, then, there will be no more stopping the iPad Pro 2 from arriving in March next year. Advertisement Meanwhile, apart from being rumored to be released in March 2017, various speculations as to what the specs and features of the iPad Pro 2 may pack abound. According to reports, it is likely for the iPad Pro 2 to come with new A10X processor, which will prolong its battery life because of the 10-nm process technology that comes with it. It is also said that the upcoming device will still come with a 32 GB, although many gadget fans hope that it should come in 64 GB of storage given what the device can do and the size that it is made of. As far as the design is concerned, it is said that the iPad Pro 2 will still carry the look of its predecessor and will not really introduce significant changes, although overall improvement in user experience can be expected.

Or Will They Upgrade It? MacBook Air needs a major upgrade for it to compete in the market. However, there are reports claiming that the tech giant would just phase out the device and focus on the MacBook Pro instead. (Photo : Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Consumers are still waiting for the official release of Apple's MacBook Air 2016. Reports, however, claim that the tech giant might stop producing  the MacBook Air flagship and focus on the MacBook Pro istead. There are leaks that hints details about the future devices on Apple's flagship: from the MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch.  However the update about the MacBook Air is not gaining any popularity at all. It is could be that apple is terminating the MacBook Air flagship because the device did not get proper updates in the last years, BGR reported. In the modern lineup of laptops, the MacBook Air is being phased out slowly. The 11-inch MacBook air was already usurped by the Retina MacBook. On the other hand, The 13-inch version of the MacBook Air has inferior display as compared to a MacBook Pro with the same screen size. This means that the MacBook Air flagship needs major updates in order to compete in the computer market. Retina MacBook devices has been defeated by the Chromebook in the US market because it has limited capabilities despite its price. The Chromebook can do almost everything that the Retina MacBook is able to do. Since tech people are still waiting for the release of the Air model, there is still a chance that the MacBook Air will continue to live. Rumors claim that new versions of these devices will have 15-inch wide sizes while phasing out the 11-inch versions, according to Vine Report. The 2016 MacBook Air is rumored to have a Touch ID fingerprint recognition. It will also have Siri as an additional feature and will sport be lighter and thinner compared to the current Air models. It will be eqquipped with USB-C ports, Intel Skylake processors, new batteries and cooling systems. The Air 2016 is set for release sometime this fall              which is estimated to cost $980 for the 13-inch model while the 15-inch one would cost about $1,100.

M Monday, Jan 02 2017 | Updated at 10:32 PM EST Stay Connected With Us F T R Opinion Academics Students Special Reports Sports Finance Tech Career College Aug 29, 2016 08:33 AM EDT By Vinay Patel, UniversityHerald Reporter MacBook Pro 2016 Release Date Happening No Later Than November With Skylake, AMD Polaris GPU And Intel Integrated Graphics In The Offing! MacBook Pro 2016 Release Date, Specs And Features (Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) MacBook fans, rejoice! The MacBook Pro 2016 release date is upcoming, presumably not later than November 2016, but the refresh is likely to skip Intel's seventh-generation Kaby Lake chip, according to a slew of latest reports doing rounds online. Powering the purported Mac notebook instead is Skylake with the GPU muscle furnished by AMD and Intel. Although rumor mills have not ceased swirling speculations around the MacBook Pro 2016 release date hinting that Apple has pushed back the scheduled 2016 arrival of the much-awaited MacBook Pros due to Kaby Lake, Apple Insider claims that the laptops will be unveiled in the next few months, and will be running on Skylake. In other words, the impending MacBook Pro refresh will pack the seventh generation of the Intel Core-series processor in it. The report further claims that AMD Polaris 11 GPU will be used with exclusive models of the MacBook Pro 2016, especially the 15-inch premium editions. Industry watchers believe that Apple will debut the MacBook Pro 2016s in 13-inch and 15-inch form factors featuring lighter and thinner build than ever, and the latter will exclusively pack AMD's latest mobile graphics card. Citing the state of the GPU market, continued use of AMD GPUs seems inevitable with the Polaris"-series chip seemingly obvious for the imminent MacBook Pro. As far as the comparatively affordable 15-inch models and 13-inch builds are concerned, they are likely to be powered by the combination of Intel Skylake and the chipset's integrated graphics. Apple reportedly opted for Skylake as Kaby Lake is unlikely to be ready for the MacBook Pro specifications in near future. And Apple is understandably unwilling to further postpone the already delayed upgrades for the MacBook Pro. When it comes to choosing integrated graphics for most of the MacBook Pro 2016 models, the Cupertino-based tech giant seem to head towards the right direction. Integrated graphics chipsets are more advanced, and pack higher performance than ever. Moreover, benefits in power consumption for leaving out a dedicated GPU are undeniable. If rumors doing rounds proved to be true, Apple might just roll out the MacBook Pro 2016 along with the iPhone 7 in September, however MacWorld claims such a scenario is highly unlikely. The impending MBPs are rumored to pack an array of awe-inspiring upgrades including renamed MacOS Sierra, ultra-slim build and design, Touch ID-enabled power button, OLED touch bar, Apple Pencil support and Siri for Mac. MacBook Pro 2016 is rumored to be unveiled by late September or sometime in October with the actual release date happening no later than November.

Fresh from the “an iPad Pro isn’t a computer” commercials shown earlier this month, the Windows maker's latest ad boasts about the advantages of the Surface Pro 4 compared to a MacBook Air. Microsoft proudly highlights the Pro 4’s detachable keyboard, stylus, and touchscreen functions, labeling the MacBook as “slower, heavier, and a bit square.” The ad concludes that the Air is “less useful, like a hat for your cat.” The previous commercial placed both companies' virtual assistants – Cortana and Siri – up against each other. Apple’s AI was insistent that the iPad Pro’s keyboard made it a computer, but Cortana questioned the device’s lack of full desktop software, power, trackpad, and external ports. Between 2006 and 2009, Apple was ahead in the commercial wars, thanks to its popular “I’m a Mac, I’m a PC” campaign starring John Hodgman and Justin Long. Back then, the PC was portrayed as unintuitive and constantly under attack from viruses, whereas as the Mac was shown as easy to use and “cooler.” Today, things look a bit different. Apple’s laptops haven’t seen any major design changes in years, while Microsoft’s detachable 2-in-1s have got lighter, thinner, and more powerful, to the point where the Surface Book 4 is now many people's preferred choice when it comes to portable productivity. Don’t be surprised to see more Microsoft ads mocking Apple’s product range over the coming weeks, especially with the holiday season on its way. Hopefully, they won’t contain any more disturbing images of cat-faced men.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) and its Mac computers in the latest Surface Pro 4 ad. Microsoft has equated Mac to a “hat for your cat” in the ad, as it hopes to convince current and potential Mac users into moving towards the Surface Pro 4 systems. Some of the biggest selling points for Surface Pro 4 over the MacBook are detachable components of the system, like the touchscreen display, keyboard, and the stylus. All of these come with the MacBook but they are, of course, permanently attached. A picture of portability and accessibility has been portrayed in the music-oriented ad by Microsoft, as it also brands the MacBook Air “slower, heavier, and a bit square”. This isn’t the first time that Microsoft has turned towards comparative advantage strategy to promote its products either, as the same route has been previously taken for Cortana vs Siri, Surface Pro Vs iPad Pro, and Surface Pro 3 vs MacBook Air. While Apple has always appealed to the stylish, sophisticated side of technological aesthetics in users, Microsoft has taken the route of features and capabilities to try and overtake MacBook and iPad devices in both popularity and sales figures. Of course, these are two different courses of action and similarly, different types of users have long preferred the Apple and Microsoft offerings. But that has not stopped Microsoft from continuously taking aim at Apple products to try and prove to the users that not only Microsoft devices can do more, but they are as much, if not more, aesthetically-pleasing as Apple’s MacBook Air or iPad.

By Michael G. Skinner / 2016.08.29 The iPad Air 2 (R) and iPad Mini 3 are displayed during an Apple special event on October 16, 2014 in Cupertino, California. iPad Air 3 is speculated to be released in March 2017. Reportedly, it is unlikely that the device will be launched this Fall as Apple just recently released its new 10-inch iPad Pro 9.7 tablet. Advertisement When it comes to the specs of iPad Air 3, rumor has it that the device will sport a harder aluminum material, which could lead to an even thinner design. The device is also speculated to carry the new True Tone equipped display panel of the iPad Pro 9.7. iPad Air 3 is also expected to carry either an Apple 9 or an A9X chipset, Tab Times reported. Rumors claimed that the storage capacity of iPad Air 3 will start at 32GB. Speculations emerged that iPad Air 3 will also sport the stereo speaker setup which is similar to those found on both Pro tablets. With regard to its operating system, iOS 10 will be the software behind it all, reportedly. Apple's price points for the iPad Air 3 has not been revealed yet but it is suggested that Apple may stick to a $599 starting price. However, since it is speculated that the device will be almost the same size as the full size iPad models for years, Apple may be reducing the price this time. This will be based on how much technology that Apple will be borrowing from the iPad Pro 9.7, PC Advisor reported. iPad Air 3 might concede the usual price point if it will be true that the device will also come with iPad Pro 9.7's True Tone display panel. However, without the True Tone display panel, iPad Air 3's suspected reduced starting price may be set at around $499 to $549. Meanwhile, Apple is said to be working on upgrades for its other devices. For instance, the larger iPad Pro is rumored to be working on a 10.5-inch iPad.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Computers Image Source: YouTube Microsoft keeps mocking the MacBooks it uses as quality benchmarks Chris Smith @chris_writes August 29th, 2016 at 7:45 AM Share Tweet Both Microsoft and Apple are preparing to launch new laptops this year, but it’s only the Redmond-based company that’s making a big fuss about its existing lineup. In a hilarious attack on the Mac, Microsoft says – well, sings – that the Macs are less useful, just like as a hat for your cat. The 30-second ad is funny, but also rather ironic, as Microsoft is making fun of the devices that it also happens to praise. DON’T MISS: A closer look at the NSO Group, the organization behind the most advanced iPhone spyware ever released Microsoft last year introduced a couple of new Surface laptops that impressed the crowds, with the Surface Book being the unexpected star of the show. But during its Surface event, Microsoft kept comparing its Surface devices with MacBooks, effectively transforming Apple’s laptops in benchmarks for quality and design for premium products. The MacBook was the laptop to beat, Microsoft insisted, and suggested its new Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book would do the trick. “We look at Apple as a key competitor to the Surface product line and that’s how we think about the product line. We want to give our customers more options in the premium space,” Microsoft’s Panos Panay said last year. With the new ads, Microsoft is practically doing what Apple did to the PC for years, in its popular Mac vs. PC ad campaign. The difference is that Apple wouldn’t use a PC for inspiration, whether it’s software or hardware. And Microsoft has bashed Apple products for a few years – we saw a similar clip a few days ago targeting the iPad Pro. It’s not clear at this time when the Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2 will be unveiled. But seeing Microsoft getting back at making fun of Apple products does make sense, especially ahead of the busy back-to-school season. If you plan to buy a Surface or a MacBook, you’d better stick to your current laptop for a few more months as refreshes are on the way. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s new ad follows below.

New iMacs, a MacBook Pro and a 5K display are on their way, which is not surprising. What might make you scratch your head is the Air, which is also receiving an update. Europe, are you ready? TNW Conference is back for its 12th year. Explore our speakers and attendees now. TELL ME MORE! With the MacBook arriving last year, many wondered if Apple was simply going to replace the Air with that model in its lineup, effectively creating an iPhone-esque MacBook lineup with a base model and a Pro. But now that we have an iPhone SE, perhaps the MacBook Air also has a place in the lineup. Like the Pro, the MacBook Air is said to get USB-C. The iMac is said to carry a new graphics processor from AMD. The Pro will receive a flatter keyboard — something I really enjoy about the MacBook. Additionally, it’s said the OLED function key bar is called the ‘Dynamic Function Row’ internally at Apple. After dropping the Thunderbolt display earlier this year, Apple is said to be working with LG on a 5K display, much like the iMac. That’s a lot of new stuff from Apple; an iPhone coming soon, and a new MacBook lineup dropping later this year after an October announcement. Get your credit cards ready.

Microsoft Corporation has once again taken potshots at rival Apple and its products. This time, the company is comparing its Surface Pro 4 tablet to the MacBook Air. Although, the Surface Pro 4 functions as a 2-in-1 computer, while the MacBook Air is effectively a very good laptop, Microsoft still chose to target the Apple computer in its rather catchy new ad. As can be seen, Microsoft has chosen a musical tone in a bid to add a light touch to the ad. Unlike some rivalry ads, the Microsoft ad name-drops the Mac as a laptop, which “doesn’t have any of that” and calls it as useful as “a hat for your cat.” The ad flaunts the Surface Pro 4’s detachable keys and a pen that can be used to write on the screen. Microsoft also draws attention to the fact that the MacBook Air, which is supposed to be light, is still heavier than the Surface Pro. The ad also highlights the Surface Pro’s touch screen and features such as the ability to doodle on it. All in all, the ad’s color scheme, music, and the overall tone, clearly shows that Microsoft is appealing to the more creative minded with its new Surface Pro 4. Given that it is school season again, Microsoft might possibly be targeting a younger demographic audience with the ad. School-goers might find Surface Pro 4 more feasible in terms of flexibility than a Mac. Both devices start off with the 128GB models priced at $899; although the Surface Pro 4 features the Intel Core m3, while the MacBook Air features an Intel Core i5 processor. Also, the Surface Pro 4 has a bigger 12.3 inch screen, with touchscreen capabilities. The MacBook Air, on the other hand, only offers an 11-inch screen, albeit with very good graphics. Other than that, both devices offer 4GB of RAM and are mostly identical. It might have been a bolder move, if Microsoft Corporation had aimed at Apple’s MacBook Pro lineup as it makes more sense for Pro to take on Pro. However, the Surface Pro variant has been pitted against an Apple computer as Apple’s Pro variants cost much more than the Surface Pro (and arguably offer better specs as well). Hence, Microsoft has perhaps played it safe, while releasing an amusing advertisement. It will be interesting to see how Apple responds to Microsoft’s taunts.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Latest Surface Pro 4 Ad Chooses MacBook Air to be Its Latest Target By Omar Sohail Posted Aug 29, 2016 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Microsoft will find joy at every turn in insulting and diminishing Apple’s products and the latest Surface Pro 4 highlights the perks of owning the slate, claiming it to be far more capable than the MacBook Air. Surface Pro 4 Ad Highlights The Advantages of Owning the Windows 10 Powered Slate Coming straight to the highlights of the ad, Surface Pro 4 is shown to be equipped with a touchscreen and a bundled Surface Pen, and can be used with or without a keyboard. It also suggests that Apple’s MacBook Air is slower, heavier, and a bit square. The ad also highlights the fact that users can log in faster thanks to Windows Hello biometrics. While Microsoft can continue to make itself feel better about its Surface Pro 4, the $899 tablet only features a Core M processor and that too without a keyboard accessory. If Microsoft would have bundled a keyboard accessory along with the Surface Pen, then we would have been more of an agreeable mind that at least the tech giant is bundling in freebies that will transform the tablet into a tablet substitute. Unfortunately, that’s not the case, and you’ll often see that Microsoft continues to hold product deals involving accessories and Surface Pro 4, so you can tell which company is actually struggling to sell tablets. It could also be that Microsoft is attempting to sell as many units as possible, but at the end of the day, you’ll easily be able to purchase a decent spec’d $899 notebook any day. If the notebook comes without an SSD, then you can always resort to purchasing a cheaper notebook and upgrade it with an SSD. This little idea is something I myself did and thus transformed a slow notebook into a very capable machine. Advertisement The MacBook Air on the other hand is a complete notebook and doesn’t require any additional accessories. Though it’s pricier, you don’t have to go through the tedious process of purchasing expensive accessories, and while I haven’t used the OS due to my inclination with Microsoft Windows, I still find the MacBook Air to be a far better purchase. What opinions do you guys have of the latest Surface Pro 4 ad? Tell us your thoughts right away.

Microsoft took aim at Apple in a new advertisement with a snarky jingle highlighting ways in which its Surface Pro 4 tablet is better than a MacBook, the latter of which is "less useful like a hat for your cat." It's the latest in a long line of Mac versus PC commercials where Apple and Microsoft trade barbs. This latest ad draws attention to the Surface Pro 4's detachable keyboard, included stylus, and touchscreen display, all things the MacBook family lacks. There's also a subtle shout out to Windows Hello, the biometric security system Microsoft built into Windows 10, and the fact that the Surface Pro 4 is "lighter than Air." Less savvy users might miss the intended reference, but Microsoft is comparing the weight of the Surface Pro 4 at 1.69 to 1.73 pounds to the MacBook Air, which checks in at 2.38 to 2.96 pounds. Have a watch: The add is getting mixed responses from viewers on YouTube. At the time of this writing, it has 536 thumbs up votes and 272 thumbs down votes. "I love Apple but man this is funny—hahaha. I wouldn't buy a Surface over a MacBook but maybe I would consider buying the Surface Book though," reads one of the comments in response to the video. Another person wrote, "Shouldn't they be comparing the Surface Pro to the ipad Pro??" Valid point, though Microsoft and Apple are both guilty of glossing over the facts in their long war of words with one another. These ads, like the ones that came before them, are supposed to funny. I've always been critical of Microsoft's effort in the past, especially those awkward moments when it countered Apple's hilarious (albeit misleading) Mac versus PC ads with Jerry Seinfeld shopping for shoes and Bill Gates eating churros, among other cringe-worthy efforts. But this latest jingle is at least entertaining. Seriously, if the picture of the cat wearing a hat doesn't amuse you in the slightest, you might want to have your funny bone checked out.

Big iPad update will make Apple Pencil more powerful By Buster Hein • 3:09 pm, August 29, 2016 News iPad Pro is about to become an even better PC replacement. Photo: Apple Apple is planning to make some huge improvements to the software on the iPad, but owners will have to wait until next year to try it out. One of the biggest new features could involve the Apple Pencil, according to a new report that claims Apple’s big update will bring a powerful annotation feature to the device aimed at professional users. “Apple has considered allowing users to annotate objects in many applications across the whole operating system, including in Mail, the Safari web browser, and iMessage, similar to what Samsung Electronics Co. offers on its Note smartphones,” reports Bloomberg. The new feature will be packaged with a host of other productivity features for iPad that will either debut as a mid-major update at the beginning of 2017 — similar to iOS 9.3 — or as part of iOS 11 in the summer. New iPad Pro devices allegedly won’t be unveiled until next year as well, with Apple opting for a new 10.7-inch display on the smaller iPad Pro. The report also claims that Apple’s new stand-alone 5K display is being built in partnership with LG. It’s expected to debut later this year along with a new MacBook Pro with an OLED touchpad at the top that Apple staff are currently calling the “Dynamic Function Row.” Although the new MacBook Pros were originally rumored to be announced at WWDC 2016, Apple’s not expected to announce them at its keynote on September 7th that will likely feature a new iPhone and the second generation Apple Watch.

The federal government now allows commercial drone use without having to apply for specific permission from the Federal Aviation Administration. "It really makes the rules much more concrete and gives us specific guidelines to follow," said Mitchell Apple. Apple runs Bird's Eye View. For the last three years, his company has used drones to take aerial photographs and video for clients. Before August 29th, he needed a pilot's license to fly for commercial use. Other rules were less clear and left many potential clients on the fence. "There was so much grey," he told 13WHAM's Jane Flasch while flying his drone at Highland Bowl. "You didn't know if the FAA was going to make them harder or easier and how that might impact your business." The new rules allow anyone over age 16 to fly - provided they take a written test every two years and submit to a background test. Apple was first in line to take his airman's test Monday, however he learned the Scottsville Road facility where he signed up is not able to administer it. The next closest place in Ithaca. Drones can only fly during the day (or twilight, if they have lights) and no higher than 400 feet with a max speed of 100 miles an hour. They also cannot be flown over people. Don't expect them to deliver your packages from Amazon anytime soon, though. The rules require that the operator must be able to see it at all times. However the hope is that these rules will pave the way for more complex drone operations. For now, aerial photographers, real estate and construction companies are the first to benefit. The FAA estimates it will grow to an $82 billion dollar industry within 10 years. There are also implications for firefighters and search and rescue operations. "It's really going to introduce a lot more companies to drones and allow a lot more people to utilize the technology to save money," said Apple. close News In Pictures Family of woman shot believe killing was over plans to divorce RPD searching for M&T Bank robbery suspect Gallery: Allow these shirtless celebs to be your New Year resolution inspiration 8-year-old dies after interstate crash that killed three people on Christmas Eve Trending 1   Five stories you may have missed over the weekend 2   Crews investigating power outage, fire at URMC building 3   First live performers announced for Del Lago Casino and Resort 4   Attorney for person of interest in Drexel case arrested 5   Major changes coming to 390/490 interchange, Lyell Ave. bridge DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WHAM Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO LOADING ShareTweet × Trending 1 Five stories you may have missed over the weekend 2 Crews investigating power outage, fire at URMC building 3 First live performers announced for Del Lago Casino and Resort 4 Attorney for person of interest in Drexel case arrested 5 Major changes coming to 390/490 interchange, Lyell Ave. bridge 6 Takeaways from Mariah Carey's performance debacle 7 Bag that washed ashore is from plane carrying 6, police say 8 Healthy meal deliveries becomes trend in Rochester 9 Newark man, arrested for DWI, allegedly refuses mug shot to avoid publication 10 Police: Father to press charges after teen daughter buys $1,200 plane ticket

The iPad will also get a hardware upgrade, the report says. Apple's iPad sales have been declining in recent years, but the company saw some hopeful signs in the June-ending quarter, fueled by sales of its largest iPad, the iPad Pro. So no great surprise that the company would upgrade the product in 2017. The Mac line will get a refresh, the report states, including new iMac desktop computers, new MacBook Air laptops, thinner MacBook Pros, and a new 5K standalone monitor made in a collaboration with LG. The new hardware could come "as soon as late 2016," which seems like a perfectly silly time to announce major new products.  MS Apple 12.30.16 | 1:23 pm Netflix’s gift to parents: 200 minutes of peace on New Year’s Day Netflix generally sees a big spike of kids' viewing on New Year's Day, since parents are recovering from the previous night's festivities. This year, the company is making parents' lives easier by revealing its data on the shows that kids are most likely to watch back-to-back(-to-back). The selection is based on how fast kids, on average, consumed the entire season of a series. They are: Ask the StoryBots, Best Friends Whenever, Dragons: Race to the Edge, Ever After High, LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship, Mako Mermaids, My Babysitter's a Vampire, Pokemon: Indigo League, Project Mc2, Skylanders Academy, The Adventures of Puss in Boots, The Batman, The Deep, Trollhunters, Voltron: Legendary Defender.  To make things even easier for parents, Netflix has created a printable door hanger, available here. The idea is that when a kid comes knocking on mommy and daddy's door on January 1, they'll see a note about how much screen time they are allowed with a suggestion of episodes they can watch.

And it could be due to a flood of inexpensive headsets wiping out the very innovative spirit that originally led to the creation of between 200 and 300 Chinese VR startups. According to China.org.cn, the study, which was conducted by iiMedia Research, concluded that "the market for VR hardware has left slim chances for smaller manufacturers" in the wake of hardware releases by big-wigs such as HTC (with the Vive), Facebook (with the Oculus Rift), and Sony (with the PlayStation VR). More problematic, though, could be that "cheap copycats" have swallowed the VR market, "blocking the channels necessary for high-end innovation to reach consumers." It's unclear what this means for VR consumption in China. If the iiMedia Research report is true,  this cratering of development energy comes just months after Minal Hasan, general partner and managing partner of Silicon Valley VC firm K2 Global told me that she expected investment of $860 million in the Chinese VR market in 2016 alone, and between $8 billion and $10 billion by 2020.

Now, it appears that the company is listening and wants to do something along those lines—but it's not entirely clear what such a feature would be like. Following in the footsteps of Brian Chesky: what's the most important thing you want to see @Square improve or create in 2017?— 🚶🏽jack (@jack) December 29, 2016 This morning, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey issued a call for the public's ideas for how to improve the service in 2017. In response to numerous suggestions for an edit tool, Dorsey wrote that such a feature is definitely "needed," but said he's not sure whether editing a specific tweet should be allowed forever, or perhaps for just a few minutes.  @howardlindzon not sure why you're quoting this tweet but yes, a form of edit is def needed. But for everyone, not just those w badges— 🚶🏽jack (@jack) December 29, 2016 The difference in implementation matters, Dorsey wrote, as being able to edit a tweet in perpetuity is problematic because Twitter is often seen as "the public record." Unfortunately, Dorsey's willingness to discuss an editing feature was not a commitment to launching one. So, stay tuned. DT twitter 12.29.16 | 3:06 pm After the U.S. boots 35 Russian spies, many more will probably remain Today's big news is the Obama Administration's decision to issue new sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its attempts to impact the U.S. presidential election in November. Among the most noted elements of those sanctions is the expulsion of 35 Russian spies from American soil, each of whom has been given 72 hours to get out of Dodge.  Read the statement by @POTUS on U.S. actions in response to Russian malicious cyber activity and harassment:https://t.co/4IO178lrkW pic.twitter.com/nRBYmhyNVz— The White House (@WhiteHouse) December 29, 2016 Left unsaid in the U.S. government's statement today is how many Russian spies will still be here. And while there are no official numbers to cite, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center left clues as to the number in a February interview. According to NPR, William Evanina, who also serves as national counterintelligence executive, estimated that there were more than 100 Russian spies toiling away inside America's borders. Evanina did not immediately respond to a Fast Company request for comment.  [Photo: The Asahi Shimbun via Getty Images] DT President Obama 12.29.16 | 1:01 pm Report: Obamacare may be harder for Republicans to euthanize than imagined Over the last few years, nothing has been more of a cause célèbre for Republicans than killing and then "replacing" Obamacare. And when news came out earlier this year that premiums were shooting up by 25% for many people, it seemed like the silver bullet the GOP had been looking for all along. Donald Trump's election as president, along with Democrats' inability to retake the U.S. Senate seemed to be the final nails in the program's coffin. But wait! A new study reveals that Obamacare is showing surprising strength, with massive numbers of new sign-ups. In part, New York magazine reports, that's because the premium hikes appear to have been a one-time event rather than a harbinger of continued increases. More to the point, the millions of new registrants will make it far harder for Republicans to dismantle Obamacare than if the program had simply withered on the vine as Paul Ryan and his colleagues had hoped. After all, people are not going to be happy if Congress takes away a benefit that they like.

CZ 12.29.16 | 12:44 pm Amazon wants you to go hog-wild in its “digital day” sale Friday Tomorrow is December 30. The day before the day before New Year's. Don't think that's worth celebrating? Then you clearly don't work in Amazon's sales and marketing department, which never tires of looking for new ways to get people pumped up to buy a whole bunch of things. That's why Amazon has pegged Friday as "digital day," during which it is offering big discounts on a wide variety of digital items–video games, movies, comics, and the like. It's hoping, as TechCrunch wrote, to gin up the kind of buyer excitement as its other big concocted sales "days," such as Prime Day, especially because it knows that a whole lot of people just got new devices as presents and now need stuff to put on them. Also, and let's be honest here, the company probably thinks that buyers who come for the digital goods won't be able to keep themselves from buying a few full-price physical items.   DT Amazon 12.29.16 | 9:44 am A reckoning for Japan’s fatal culture of overwork  The suicide last year of a young ad executive who leapt to her death after working more than 100 hours of overtime is forcing Japanese officials and business leaders to come to terms with the country's infamous culture of overwork. In Japan, the phenomenon is known as karoshi, and it was deemed the reason that 24-year-old Matsuri Takahashi killed herself on December 25, 2015.   The incident not only sparked government raids on the offices of Dentsu, the firm where Takahashi worked, but it also led to the country's first-ever white paper on the problem, Reuters reports. That study found that employees worked more than 80 hours of monthly overtime at a fifth of Japanese companies. The issue has Japan's prime minister finally pushing for tougher overtime restrictions.  And this week, the fallout continued: Dentsu's president, Tadashi Ishii, announced he will be stepping down early next year. "It is extremely regrettable that we could not prevent overwork by a new recruit," he told reporters.  [Photo: Flickr user Ignacio Gómez Cuesta] CZ 12.29.16 | 8:51 am Morning intel: Snap preps its IPO campaign, Amazon outspent physical retailers on TV ads • Snap Inc. is honing its pitch for an initial public offering next year, but it might not be an easy sell. The company is expected to promote its plans to become a content powerhouse, the Wall Street Journal reports. But according to investors, it could be a long shot: Snap hopes to reach a valuation upwards of $25 billion, which is nearly 27 times the amount of ad revenue it will generate next year. That's a multiple of market cap to ad revenue greater than both Facebook's and Twitter's. • China's solution to a soft box office? Delete negative reviews. After another round of high-profile Chinese films fell short of expectations, the state-sponsored publication People's Daily posted an editorial blaming "vicious and irresponsible reviews," according to the Hollywood Reporter. In response, one of the singled-out sites, Maoyan, deleted professional reviews from its home page, leaving only glowing, user-generated feedback on failed movies like the big-budget (and controversial) Matt Damon-helmed The Great Wall. • Autonomous braking may have prevented the Berlin attacker from claiming more lives. In a seemingly rare bit of positive data concerning safety and autonomous-driving features, investigators of the Berlin terrorist attack that killed 12 people earlier this month have found that the assailant's truck stopped some 300 feet after it sensed a collision, German media reports. In 2012, the European Union set guidelines establishing such braking features for vehicles. • Amazon outspent its brick-and-mortar competitors on holiday TV ads this year. Recode reports that in October and November, the e-commerce giant spent around $135 million on TV spots, more than both Walmart and Target. (Compare that to five years ago, when Amazon spent $156 million on all forms of advertising over an entire year.)

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Tuesday January, 3, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Arts & Leisure Theater Music Movies- Films Lifestyle Food Celebrity News Books Arts Frank Ocean tops US album chart after outfoxing label AFP August 30, 2016, 2:00 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet NEW YORK -- Frank Ocean's long-awaited album "Blonde" opened at number one on the US chart Sunday in one of the year's biggest debuts after the artist thumbed his nose at his label. The genre-merging hip-hop star's album sold 276,000 copies or the equivalent in downloads and streaming in the week through Thursday, tracking service Nielsen Music said. The figure was the third highest for an album in its first week this year, although it was significantly below Drake's "Views" and Beyonce's "Lemonade." Like Drake and Beyonce, Ocean signed an exclusive arrangement, in his case with tech giant Apple, which made "Blonde" available exclusively on its Apple Music streaming service or for purchase on iTunes. But Ocean self-released the album on his own label, which he called Boys Don't Cry, despite a contract with Def Jam, a unit of the world's largest music conglomerate Universal. Ocean had won wide acclaim for his 2012 debut album "Channel Orange," leading to an intense wait for his follow-up album. After the four-year hiatus, Ocean on August 19 unveiled an album -- not "Blonde," which came out just one day later, but a more ambient work entitled "Endless" that accompanied a film on Apple Music. In the fine print, "Endless" was on Def Jam, meaning he fulfilled his two-record obligation through a work he described as secondary to "Blonde," essentially outfoxing the world's biggest music label group. The move reportedly infuriated Universal chief Lucian Grainge. He responded by ordering all Universal labels to end streaming exclusives, according to the Music Business Worldwide blog and other music publications. Apple Music and hip-hop mogul Jay Z's Tidal service have relied on exclusives in hopes of winning customers from streaming leader Spotify, whose model has been to aim at wide and open access rather than original content. Ocean performs in a unique blend of rap and R&B falsetto, with introspective lyricism known for its subtlety. "Blonde" features cameos or collaborations with a range of influential artists from Beyonce to Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood. Unusual in the often-macho world of hip-hop, Ocean has songs of relationships with other men and he has increasingly been seen as a gay rights icon.

This year's Apple Squeeze is set to be an even bigger event for the town, with officials approving a two-day entertainment schedule and the use of a professional stage. Posted Tuesday, August 30, 2016 4:20 am By Clarence Fanto cfanto@yahoo.com @BE_cfanto on Twitter LENOX — As the summer tourism season begins to wind down, plans for a major expansion of the town's autumn Apple Squeeze extravaganza have been completed with the approval of the Select Board and Police Chief Stephen O'Brien. The 37th Chamber of Commerce harvest festival, set for the weekend of Sept. 24-25 from 10 to 5 both days, remains a merchandising magnet for local businesses and a longtime favorite of area residents as well as visitors. But this year, it will feature a much more robust, two-day entertainment schedule, with well-known Berkshire-based vocalists and bands, as well as a professional stage that will require a daytime traffic shutdown of Main Street from the war monument at Walker Street to Housatonic Street. According to Chamber Director Kameron Spaulding, who is organizing his first Squeeze since being named to the post last February, the Sept. 24 headliners are folk-country rockers The Felice Brothers, who are touring to support their new album, "Life in the Dark." The band, based in New York, was founded in 2006 and first performed in the city's subway system. The three brothers are from Palenville, N.Y., in the Catskills, a short distance from the town of Woodstock. Songwriter Ian Felice now lives in Hillsdale, N.Y., a few miles west of Great Barrington. A four-star (out of five) review in the Guardian newspaper and website points out that the new, deliberately lo-fi album was recorded on a farm, with clucking chickens providing backup. "Their Dylanesque Americana — all wheezing accordion, fiddles and folk tales about forgotten bandits — occasionally conjures up the atmosphere of a heady barn dance. But this rustic, deceptively homely backdrop provides a clever vehicle for songs that subtly but powerfully address the suddenly shakier foundations of Trump-era America," wrote reviewer Dave Simpson. Returning from last year's Apple Squeeze is veteran pop-standard and TV entertainer John Davidson ("The Hollywood Squares," "That's Incredible!") who has carved out a late-in-life local performing career since moving to Lenox. Additional acts: • Jamie Kent, named by Rolling Stone as one of the "30 Must See Acts" of Country Music Association (CMA) Fest 2016, alongside Eric Church, Carrie Underwood, and Chris Stapleton. • Massachusetts-based The Whiskey Treaty Roadshow, songwriters of Americana, rock and roots-folk music. The collaborative band includes singer-songwriter Billy Keane of Pittsfield, Greg Smith, originally from Charlemont, and Chris Merenda of Great Barrington, as well as Tory Hanna and David Tanklefsky. Their first complete album is "The Heart of the Run" and a short documentary about the band has been making the rounds of film festivals. • Also: Joe Mansman and The Midnight Revival Band, Izzy Heltai and Secret Creature, Black Mountain Symphony, Heart of Gold, Tantrum and others to be announced. Most businesses downtown are in favor of the street closing, Spaulding informed the Select Board at a recent meeting. He said signs would be installed on the Route 7 & 20 bypass informing motorists on the reconfigured traffic pattern. The two-day Main Street shutdown would extend from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 24, and from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 25, following removal of the stage, he added. On Saturday night, there would be a partial reopening, though the lane closest to the Adams Community Bank would remain off-limits to traffic throughout the weekend in order to store the stage. O'Brien told the Select Board that a police detail would be provided and that he had no issues with the plan, which was approved 4-0 by the board members. "Obviously, Apple Squeeze is a signature event for Lenox," said Selectman Channing Gibson, "but that doesn't mean it can't get better and change and grow with new ideas." He applauded the Chamber's efforts, "taking something that was already working and trying to make a better version of it." Off-site parking with shuttle buses will be provided this year, Spaulding pointed out. Unlike previous Squeezes, vendors will line both sides of Main Street, he explained, easing some of the congestion for the public and allowing room for an additional 25 street-side merchants. The festival features handmade crafts, sculptures, original art work, handmade jewelry, textiles, wood carvings, leather goods and hand-woven clothing. Local farmers sell the bounties of the fall harvest, and food vendors line the downtown streets, along with purveyors of wines and craft beers.

Finance Search EU ruling expected Tuesday on possible fines for Apple: sourcesAFP – Mon, Aug 29, 2016 11:46 PM AEST Related Content View Photo Ireland's appeal comes after the Commission's ruling in August that Apple must pay ?13 billion ($14.2 billion) in back-taxes, arguing Ireland broke EU state aid rules The EU is expected to announce on Tuesday its decision on possible fines against American tech giant Apple, which is suspected of receiving preferential treatment from Ireland on taxes, sources said. For weeks reports have emerged saying that the European Commission, the bloc's competition watchdog, was gearing up to hit Apple with a hefty penalty over tax agreements with the Irish government. A source close to the matter told AFP on condition of anonymity that a decision was expected on Tuesday, while another source also cited that date. Under European Union rules, which deem state tax aid illegal, the firm could be ordered to pay back taxes to Ireland. A commission spokeswoman and Apple both declined to comment on news that a decision was forthcoming. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a Washington Post interview published August 13, said he hoped to "get a fair hearing" on the matter. "If we don't, then we would obviously appeal it," he added. The US stepped up its fight last Wednesday against the commission's crackdown on tax avoidance by Apple and other multinational companies, accusing it of unilateralism and overstepping its mandate. In a white paper, the US Treasury said the commission probe into alleged special tax treatment that certain EU countries gave Apple, Amazon, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler "undermines the international tax system." - 'Defend our reputation' - A US Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on a possible ruling Tuesday from the commission. The US has acknowledged the problems around the issue of multinational firms obtaining state aid, in the form of secret and extremely lucrative tax breaks, from Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg for setting up business in those countries. But it said those deals were made under international treaties and accepted tax practices. The Treasury accused the commission in the white paper of taking a "new approach" to established EU tax law in challenging member states' legal tax breaks offered to multinational firms. Last week the commission denied it was targeting US companies in particular and said that EU rules do not allow national tax authorities to give tax breaks to some companies that are not available to others. If such breaks are ruled illegal, the benefits from them have to be repaid. "This is a standard feature of EU state aid rules," the commission's statement said. Ireland has stood by its actions, with Junior finance minister Eoghan Murphy saying Sunday: "We don't believe we gave any state aid to Apple". He reiterated the government's stance that it would appeal any decision that found against Ireland in the matter. "It's in the national interest that we defend our international reputation in this regard," he said in the comments on RTE, the national broadcaster.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out entertainment Search Celebrities Film Music TV & Radio Books Arts Events Immortalising Billy Apple through science JUDITH RITCHIE Last updated 11:42, August 30 2016 MARTIN DE RUYTER Artist Billy Apple at the opening of his Cell Culture exhibition at the Suter Art Gallery. The projection is of Apple's own cells. Internationally acclaimed pop artist Billy Apple may be 80-years-old but his cells are immortalised forever, reports Judith Ritchie.   In 2009 cells were taken from Billy Apple's blood, then altered using a virus to keep them alive in perpetuity.  These immortalised cells have been stored at the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Auckland. Working with biochemist/artist Dr Craig Hilton, they created The Immortalisation of Billy Apple. This project explores the implications of the use and ownership of body tissue and genetic information, while challenging the constraints on the development and use of biotechnology. "Cells that aren't immortalised die and you have to keep going back and taking new samples," says Hilton. "Here, the cells are transformed, altered so they become immortalised cell cultures." In 2012 thousands of Apple's cells were sent to the American Type Culture Collection in Massachusetts, a biological culture repository that aids studies in areas such as cancer research. Unlike most scientific donations, which are highly restricted, Apple's cells, formally named after him, deliberately have no restrictions placed on their use. Some may question the morality of altering and storing cells but both collaborators say the intention is for good. "My dream is that his cells are used as a resource and will become so useful that they'll be used worldwide'" says Hilton. Apple has a history of working with scientists, including renowned physicist and white light laser pioneer, Dr Stanley Shapiro on Laser Beam Wall in 1970.  Apple is in Nelson this week with Dr Hilton to attend the Queenstown Research Week and their collaborative exhibition, Cell Culture, at the Suter Art Gallery.   Ad Feedback The exhibition combines photo-based works, while also continuing the debate around mortality versus living forever.  A massive screen image shows living moving cells, Apple's 'self-portrait'  revealing his molecular makeup. Across the room there's a photograph showing Apple looking into a microscope at his own cells, another molecular self-portrait. "It's a personalised representation of a new form of self portrait using contemporary technology," says Apple. "What I'm interested in is this particular work where I've made my cells available for things that are for good." Apple didn't want to comment on future plans for the use of his cells, only to say "the technology is wonderful and I'm just grateful that we'll hopefully be part of a bigger picture." Hilton has future plans for collaboration on another project, potentially taking the project from theoretical to actual immortalisation. "My next project I hope will be The Synthesis of Billy Apple, so I can make him as an art project," says Hilton. "That means I can re-synthesise him; take his digital information, making new DNA then putting that in a cell."  Cell Culture, Billy Apple and Dr Craig Hilton, the Suter Art Gallery until Sunday.

The MacBook Air hasn’t been updated since March, 2015. The Mac Pro, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini are very long of tooth. The latest iMac is coming up on a year old, and only the MacBook looks fresh. Soon, there may be much blood in the water. _____________________ 2013 Mac Pro. Image credit: Apple The Pro Market Hewlett-Packard was probably the first to sense Apple’s gentle, distracted, worrisome departure from arduous support of technical professionals. While these professionals have always appreciated Apple’s focus on great design, an equivalent need is for power and expandability (memory and graphics). HP now has a reverse-switcher-like page, directed at those technical professionals called “Mac to Z.” How ironic. Power is in. Glitz is not. The “Z” reference is to HP’s line of Z-class displays and workstations. In my case, I long ago gave up on Apple when it came to replacing its obsolete 27-inch Thunderbolt display from 2011. I bought a Z34c display myself, as did our Jeff Gamet, and we reviewed it. “The Display You’ve Always Wanted For Your Mac: HP Z34c.” We love it. On the CPU side, HP makes much of the HP Z8 workstation with 24 cores, up to 512 GB of RAM (compared to the Mac Pro’s max of 64 GB), seven PCIe slots and up to 15 TB of internal stoprage. This would be not so impressive if that hardware had to run Windows 8.x, but the arrival of a competent, secure, modern OS like Windows 10 makes HP’s proposition worth considering. That’s especially true for many who aren’t married to UNIX and simply focus on productivity apps. HP-Z8 starting at $2400. Image credit: Hewlett-Packard. Ugly. Powerful. The Sharks Are Closing In Microsoft also senses blood in the water. Apple never upgraded the MacBook Air with a Retina display, apparently looking to make it the bottom of the line. Or kill it. But Apple did neither. That left an opening for both Microsoft and Google. Microsoft’s latest TV ad compares its Surface Pro 4 to a MacBook Air with good effect. This ad has its weaknesses to be sure. A touch-screen tablet is compared to a notebook, for one. Qualitative statements are made about the Surface Pro 4 while the weaknesses of the MBA are emphasized. But since when do effective, pointed ads have to be strictly fair? Microsoft saw an opening and has made its point.   Previously, Microsoft has taken a healthy shot against the iPad’s weaknesses as well. “A Clever Microsoft Ad Gets to the Heart of Apple’s Fuzzy iPad Message.” When Apple stops updating its products fast enough, staying ahead of the competition, openings appear and can be exploited. Finally, Google has been exploiting an Apple weakness as well in its notebook line. Young people and schools are faced with an aging MacBook Air that, in any size and configuration, will set them back the better part of US$1,000. That’s a tough sell. Meanwhile, Chromebooks, given an appropriate position in the school curriculum, combined wit Google Docs, can meet the needs of many students for a small fraction of the cost. For Apple, apparently, education is in its DNA but not its product vision. Needed: A Really Big Macintosh Event After the dust settles on Apple’s September 7th event, an event that has the smart money focussed on the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2, we’ll wait for a Macintosh event. If all we get is the new MacBook Pro family, the Sturm und Drang will continue at an even higher level than before. A new MacBook Pro with OLED function keys, Touch ID & Skylake, alone, won’t be enough to calm the Mac storm. Concept image credit: Martin Hajek However, if such a Macintosh event covers all the bases and brings forth a coherent update to the Mac family, all will be forgiven. We’ll just shrug and say, “Apple needed more time to do something great.” No one knows what Apple is really up to here. The company could be working on something dramatic for the Mac lineup. And so guesses (and wishes) based on past products would be shortsighted. But I think it’s safe to say that Apple would want to address the professional desktop market, the technical, enterprise mobile market, the educational market and the home market. Just how the company does that, and with what refreshed product mix, is probably the most eagerly awaited Apple event of the year. Meanwhile, the competition is preparing for a shark-like feeding frenzy if Apple falters.

But I don’t believe for a second that Apple will not be soon introducing new Mac products that are much more innovative and desirable than the current crop of Mac products. We do know that Apple has been spending a record $10 Billion on R&D this year. That is much more than they have spent in the past, and it is logically going toward a new and improved product portfolio. Apple, unlike its competitors, has a tendency to work on new products in complete secrecy, and those new products are not released until Apple “gets it right”. It is this secrecy, and the waiting, that causes some people to become anxious and impatient. The secrecy also opens the door for rumourmongers to fabricate negative rumors about Apple, since they know that Apple will not respond to rumors, and that the company will not leak information about upcoming new products just to quell false rumors. August 29, 2016 at 7:47 EST PM NorthSaanichBC August 29, 2016 “Microsoft also senses blood in the water.” Actually I think that Microsoft’s most recent Surface commercial (like its previous ones) misses the mark. Those poor marketing people at Microsoft just continue to make fools of themselves, and continue providing free advertising for Apple’s products. They compare the Surface, which is not a real tablet (too thick, heavy, short battery life, overpriced, has an Intel processor instead of ARM, and runs a desktop operating system and apps, but hardly any real multi-touch tablet apps) to an iPad. Then they compare the Surface to a Macbook Pro, even though the Surface fails as a real notebook computer (thin, substandard and floppy keyboard, small and terrible trackpad, all of the weight behind the display so it is less easy to angle and almost impossible to use on your lap, it has a touch screen which is unnecessary and a hindrance when you have an excellent multi-touch trackpad on the MacBook Pro, and it can’t run BOTH Windows and Mac apps simultaneously like the MacBook Pro). It’s as if Microsoft is uncertain whether they should be selling the Surface as a tablet computer (like the iPad) or as a notebook computer (like the MacBook Pro). What they end up doing is showing that the Surface, by trying to be two completely different types of computers, is not really good at being either one of them! People who watch these commercials are much smarter than Microsoft gives them credit for. But by talking down to users as if they are children (“like a hat for your cat”) they are actually insulting the people that they are trying to sell their product to. August 29, 2016 at 7:50 EST PM Lee Dronick August 29, 2016 They need to improve their sensors August 29, 2016 at 8:19 EST PM Paul Goodwin August 29, 2016 It’s hard for me to make a case for Apple pouring billions of dollars of investment into the Mac lineup which is part of a slowly shrinking market. It seems like more evolutionary updates might be more likely. I may get surprised by Apple (hope I am), but I would think a big part of their investment dollars is going into the new OS. A really great OS and a Mac App Store full new 3rd party software would seem like the profitable way. Update the computers enough to run the new OD and apps quickly. I don’t know whether Apple thinks it’s worth it to produce a new halo machine replacement for the Mac Pro. They’ve let too many years pass with their approach to the Ned’s of professionals in both hardware and software. And Apple’s approach to computers as non-upgradable appliances doesn’t lend itself to buyers other than very average users. Their pricing has been a problem. It used to be you could justify the price on value. You used to be able to price a fully loaded up PC with what a Mac had in it and the price difference wasn’t that much. That’s getting harder to do – hence my still using my mid-2010 iMac. It was upgradable, so purchasing a lower tier iMac and upgrading later was a lot easier than plunking down the big bucks up front for one that will last 6-8 years. Again, I hope they surprise me with some awesome new Macs, but I’m not thrilled with their current design approach of non-upgradable computers. August 29, 2016 at 9:47 EST PM macjeffff August 29, 2016 Looking at the big Z box makes me wonder. Couldn’t a team of Apple engineers take the old Mac Pro form factor and turn out a killer prototype in about 90 days, if they had the resources? They could. And it could be on the market 90 days later. The old Apple could. August 29, 2016 at 10:12 EST PM bjeast August 30, 2016 I do hope that Apple will knock our proverbial socks off in the fall with some amazing Mac announcements, but in reality I don’t expect much. Whether I like it or not, Apple is changing. Cook says ““I think if you’re looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one? Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones.” I know, I know that doesn’t necessarily mean that Macs aren’t a priority, but you have to wonder…. August 30, 2016 at 1:18 EST AM geoduck August 30, 2016 Absolutely right John, Apple needs a BIG Macintosh wcwnr. But I just don’t see it happening. I’m not terribly hopeful. I’d like to see Apple overhaul it’s whole Mac lineup. Top to bottom refresh. I’d love to see Pro systems that emphasize function over thin and light. But there would have been more rumours about the upgrades. As of now I’m expecting new MacBook Pro’s, but no new Mac Pro, iMac, MacMini, and probably no update to the MacBook Air, which will likely be axed. I’m hopeful but I’m also specking out hardware to run MintLinux if they don’t. I’ve mentioned here before that I am as worried about the future of the Mac as I was 20 years ago when they made a bazillion performa models and the stock was at $12/share. bjbeast: I agree, you have to wonder if the Mac HAS a future. However, the trouble with Apple’s idea that the iPad is a replacement for the Mac is iOS. Until iOS is hugely improved it isn’t a replacement OS for desktop use. I write on my iPad, but edit on my Mac. I film with my iPhone and camera, but I edit on my Mac. Both because the Mac and Mac software and the Mac environment just work better. Apple may well be thinking that they can move users to iPads, but that just reveals a huge disconnect between Apple designers and how things work in the field. A very troubling disconnect. NorthSaanichBC: Hey neighbour. I’m in Nanaimo. August 30, 2016 at 9:17 EST AM z3r0bit August 31, 2016 A look at the competition: Boxx Apex 5 Dell PowerEdge T630 – Dual purpose for Pro’s and Server’s HP Z Workstation The Mac Pro is toast. Only thing it has going for it is that it runs Mac OS X versus Windows. Apple needs to dump the cylinder and go back to the upgradable tower format. External thunderbolt expansion is slow and not practical (messy and not apple like). A new Mac Pro to server both Pro and Enterprise markets is needed. The design of the Dell PowerEdge T630 is the way. Dual power supplies, rack mount, multiple expansion slots (GPU, capture cards at least 5 slots) tons of cores and memory along with SSD storage in the front. This will stop the bleeding. August 31, 2016 at 12:05 EST PM bjeast September 1, 2016 Geoduck, I do agree with you – for the biggest problem with the iPad is iOS. For me it’s just a lot harder to do some things on the Pad. This is what Cook and company seem to miss. Sure – I can use Word on my iPad if I want – but I can’t even have two word docs open at once….

Chris Mills BGR NewsAugust 29, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Earlier today, Verizon announced that it's rolling out LTE Advanced to customers from coast to coast, at no additional cost to Verizon's traditional arm and leg. But in case you're tired of the carrier/uncarrier announcements about the Fastest Internet Evarr, here's what it all really means. DON'T MISS: From the iPhone 7 to the Apple Watch 2, here’s everything we expect Apple to announce next week What is LTE Advanced? In short, a fancy name for using new technology to make existing LTE (4G) wireless connections faster. LTE Advanced can refer to all sorts of improvements to LTE, and the only real common factor is that they're all backwards-compatible with other LTE technology. In this case, it refers to combining multiple channels to send mobile data as quickly as possible. Verizon is claiming a 50 percent faster peak speed for its technology. How does it work? Verizon's technology is called "carrier aggregation," and it really isn't that hard to understand. Verizon owns multiple bands of spectrum, and normally, your device just uses the strongest signal. Using carrier aggregation, Verizon sends and receives packets on two or three channels at once, increasing the peak speed you can get under optimal conditions. Verizon has been trialling the technology for over a year. How fast is it? Very. Verizon claims that under optimal conditions, two-channel aggregation will hit speeds of 225Mbps, and three-channel aggregation over 300Mbps. That's significantly faster than most home broadband, and faster than you will ever possibly need on a smartphone. It reality, it's the difference between downloading an app in 20 seconds or 35. Really, LTE Advanced is futureproofing -- you won't notice much of a difference right now, but when we're all livestreaming 8K VR video during the next Olympics, Verizon will (probably) have the fastest, most mature network to do so. Can I use LTE Advanced? Maybe! Right now, there's a list of 39 compatible Verizon devices, including the iPhone 6s, the Galaxy S7, LG G5 and Moto Z Droid. Basically, if you bought a good smartphone within the last year or two, it's worth checking. Otherwise, you just need to be a Verizon user. There's no extra fees to pay or software to upgrade. In theory, the speed improvements should already be up and running. What about other networks? Sprint is also working on carrier aggregation. It sent out a conveniently timed press release today about a successful trial of what it's calling "Sprint LTE Plus" at Soldier Field in Chicago. It's the same basic technology, and in tests conducted by Sprint and Samsung, speeds of 230 Mbps were achieved. Carrier aggregation is live at 500 cell sites across Chicago for Sprint customers. Other networks are following closely, and you can expect carrier aggregation to roll out wherever possible within a year or two.

Photo / Getty Images Apple is facing a potential tax bill running into billions of euros, with the European Union poised to release a finding into the company's dealings in Ireland as soon as tomorrow, according to people familiar with the situation. The European Commission decision is expected to say Ireland provided the iPhone maker with illegal aid through a sweetheart deal in return for creating jobs in the nation, the people said on condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Ireland has vowed to fight any adverse finding. Such a ruling might heighten tensions between Europe and the US over taxation policies, with the US having already complained that Europe is unfairly targeting American companies and threatening global tax reforms. In preliminary findings in 2014, European competition authorities said Apple's tax arrangements were improperly designed to give the company a financial boost. There's a range of estimates on how much Apple might have to pay. In a worst-case scenario, Apple may face a $19 billion bill if the government ultimately loses and is forced to recoup tax from the company, according to JPMorgan Chase analyst Rod Hall. The Irish Times reported earlier on Monday that the figure might not be much more than 100 million euros ($112 million), although it later revised its estimate upwards. The European Commission declined to comment on a decision that's still pending or on the timing of its announcement. Apple said it had nothing to add to previous statements rejecting suggestions it received selective treatment from Irish officials. The ministry declined to comment. Continued below. Related Content Apple hit with $20b Irish tax bill Auckland building inspectors in hot demand Key says NZ looking at Apple's $20b Irish tax bill "A state aid ruling against Ireland is likely to bring the country's corporation tax regime back into focus," said Dermot O'Leary, an economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. A state aid ruling against Ireland is likely to bring the country's corporation tax regime back into focus. "However, the commission investigation relates to two rulings given to Apple in 1991 and 2007. So, a critical issue will be how the final decision relates to the current Irish tax code or to previously amended policy." The commission in January ordered Belgium to recover about 700 million euros in illegal tax breaks from at least 35 companies, including Anheuser-Busch InBev and BP. And last year, for example, Starbucks was ordered to pay 30 million euros in back taxes to the Dutch government. As of last month, Apple had $232 billion in cash, with about $214 billion of that being held overseas. The European Commission declined to comment on the pending decision or on the timing of its announcement. Photo / Getty Images The US Treasury Department has pushed back hard against the state aid probes, most recently with an unusual white paper that said the Brussels-based commission had overextended its legal authority and threatened global tax reforms. The Commission-ordered repayments could wind up costing American taxpayers under US tax law, and benefit EU taxpayers, the US said. That's because multinational corporations with large foreign operations, like Apple, are allowed to claim a credit against their US tax bills for any foreign taxes paid, an offset that reduces their tax payments to US coffers. The final decision relates to the current Irish tax code or to previously amended policy. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew first raised formal objections to the probes in a letter last February to top EC and EU officials, emphasising so-called unfair targeting of US companies -- a charge that European regulators deny -- and a potential damping effect on direct foreign investment. Robert Stack, the Treasury's top official for international tax affairs, underscored in a blog post that accompanied last week's white paper one of the department's biggest objections to the probes: that EU regulators were changing the rules of the game without prior warning. Calling the probes "new" and "unforeseeable," Stack wrote that regulators "should not seek to impose recoveries under this new approach in a retroactive manner because it sets a bad precedent for tax policymakers around the world." The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

While Apple never says what it’s planning before it announces new products, this is the time of year for a new iPhone and there have been plenty of reports indicating what’s expected for the next smartphone. The main rumor is that the company is going to break with its normal upgrade rhythm this year. In the past, Apple’s alternated between offering major updates for the iPhone and smaller, more incremental updates. According to that schedule, Apple should be offering a significant update to the iPhone this year, and call it the “iPhone 7.” But reports from analysts and other Apple watchers indicate that Apple’s actually not going to offer that much of an overhaul to its phones, but will instead likely introduce two phones that look an awful lot like its current iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. A bigger change to the device is actually now expected next year. Apple is expected to give the guts of the phone its typical overhaul, with faster chips, a better camera and maybe a larger battery, according to multiple reports, including one from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The larger version of the iPhone, which will probably be called the iPhone 7 Plus if Apple sticks with its conventions, may have two cameras on the back of the phone. Despite not being a “major” upgrade on the scale of years past, Apple is expected to make at least one big change: many reports have said that Apple will do away with its headphone jack. Instead, reports have said, the company is expected to use the space now occupied by the headphone jack for a second speaker. Headphones for the iPhone may instead work with the Lightning port on the bottom of the phone, which is currently only used for charging That would make the standard headphones that users have had for years completely useless with a new iPhone. Apple’s iPhone sales in 2016 haven’t been as strong as they were last year, and that’s worried many investors who know that the majority of Apple’s money comes from iPhone sales.

The tech giant announced the date for the Sept. 7 launch by sending out invitations to technology journalists and industry analysts on Monday. Apple didn't provide any details, in keeping with its usual practice, but it traditionally announces one or two new iPhone models at its annual September event. Apple may also show new models or features for other products like the Apple Watch or Macbook computer. Details are pictured on the back of an Apple Iphone 6 on a table in a restaurant in Hanau, Germany on April 10, 2016. (Photo: Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters) The Cupertino, California company sold more than 214 million iPhones over the last 12 months. But sales are down from a year ago, and analysts will be watching closely to see what changes Apple has made in the newest models. The new phone has been the subject of fevered speculation, with some observers wondering whether the device will have a headphone jack. The Verge reported that the new iPhone may be the first without a 16GB model.

Mylan N.V. has faced intense criticism for hiking the price for the potentially life-saving drug more than 500 percent after acquiring the product in 2007. The company said Monday it will begin selling its generic version for $300 for a pair of EpiPens, in doses for adults or children. ___ Takata troubles worsen as truck explodes, kills Texas woman DETROIT -- Air bag maker Takata Corp.'s troubles worsened Monday as the company confirmed that a truck carrying its inflators and a volatile chemical exploded last week in a Texas border town, killing a woman and injuring four others. The truck, operated by a subcontractor, crashed, caught fire and exploded Aug. 22 in the small town of Quemado, leveling the woman's house. The company says it sent people to the site and is helping authorities investigate the crash. Takata has a warehouse in nearby Eagle Pass, Texas, and it has an air bag inflator factory across the border in Monclova, Mexico. ___ Apple expected to show new iPhone at event next week SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple is expected to show off a new iPhone next week when the company holds its fall product launch event in San Francisco. The tech giant announced the date for the Sept. 7 launch on Monday. Apple didn't provide any details, in keeping with its usual practice, but it traditionally announces one or two new iPhone models at its annual event. The company sold more than 214 million iPhones over the last 12 months but sales are down from a year ago. ___ Over 40 pct. of VW owners seek emissions cheating settlement DETROIT -- About 210,000 owners of Volkswagens with 2-liter diesel engines that cheat on emissions tests have registered to settle with the company under the terms of a June court agreement. The figure was revealed in a federal court motion by class action attorneys seeking final approval of the settlement involving 475,000 owners. It says only 235 have asked to stay out of the settlement and pursue legal action on their own. Another 110 objections to the settlement were filed. U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer has given the $15 billion settlement preliminary approval, with a final decision expected Oct. 18. ___ American's No. 2 executive departs for United Airlines DALLAS -- The president at American Airlines is leaving to take the same job with rival United Airlines. United Continental Holdings Inc. said Monday that Scott Kirby has been named president and will oversee operations, sales and other duties. Kirby, 49, was often seen as a likely successor to American Airlines CEO Doug Parker. Instead, he will add airline-industry expertise to United's management. ___ US consumer spending posts slower growth in July WASHINGTON -- American consumers boosted spending at a slower pace in July, while their incomes accelerated slightly. Spending grew 0.3 percent in July following a 0.5 percent increase in June, the Commerce Department reported Monday. The slowdown had been expected given an earlier report that retail sales were flat in July. Economists are counting on solid gains in consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, to power overall growth in the second half of the year. ___ Banks lead gains on Wall Street on hopes for higher rates NEW YORK -- Banks led the stock market higher Monday as investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates this year from their historically low levels. That could help banks recover from a long slump by making lending more profitable. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told a conference last week that the case for raising rates was strengthening given improvements in the economy. Raising interest rates from their rock-bottom levels, where they have been since the 2008 financial crisis, could be a good thing not only for markets but for savers. ___ FAA forecast: 600,000 commercial drones within the year WASHINGTON -- There will be 600,000 commercial drone aircraft operating in the U.S. within the year as the result of new safety rules that opened the skies to them on Monday, according to a Federal Aviation Administration estimate. Commercial operators initially complained that the new rules would be too rigid. The agency responded by creating a system to grant exemptions to some of the rules for companies that show they can operate safely. On the first day the rules were in effect the FAA had already granted 76 exemptions, most of them to companies that want to fly drones at night. ___ Mondelez says it ended talks to buy Hershey NEW YORK -- Mondelez says it has ended discussions to buy The Hershey Co, a combination that would have created a global powerhouse selling some of the world's best known chocolates and snacks. Hershey said in June that it rejected a preliminary takeover bid from Mondelez International Inc. valued at roughly $22.3 billion. At the time, it said that the offer provided "no basis for further discussion." A representative for Hershey did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. ___ FBI warns of possible state election-system hacks NEW YORK -- The FBI is warning state officials to boost their election security in light of evidence that hackers breached related data systems in two states. In a confidential "flash" alert from its cyber division, first reported by Yahoo News and posted online by others, the FBI said it's investigating the pair of incidents and advised states to scan their systems for specific signs of hacking. The FBI said Monday that it doesn't comment on specific alerts, but added that it routinely sends out advisories to private industry about signs of cyber threats that it comes across in its investigations. ___ Pennsylvania firm launches Zika vaccine trial in Puerto Rico SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- A Pennsylvania drug company announced Monday that it has launched a clinical trial of an experimental Zika vaccine in Puerto Rico, the part of the U.S. hardest hit by the mosquito-borne virus. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. will be testing its DNA-based vaccine candidate on 160 adult volunteers in Puerto Rico. If the results are promising, the company would meet with regulators next year to discuss plans to develop the vaccine, CEO J. Joseph Kim said. The search for a vaccine is particularly relevant in Puerto Rico, which as of Friday had reported more than 14,000 cases, including 1,244 among pregnant women. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.59 points, or 0.6 percent, to 18,502.99. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 11.34 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,180.38. The Nasdaq composite edged up 13.41 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,232.33. Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 66 cents to $46.98 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price oil internationally, lost 66 cents to $49.26 a barrel. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 5 cents to $1.47 a gallon, heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon and natural gas fell 2 cents to $2.85 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Aug 29, 2016 Share Tweet 0 Apple may have made some users happy when it confirmed the release date for the highly speculated about iPhone 7, but it's also pissed off others who are suing the company for a so-called "touch disease" that doesn't allow them to keep using their iPhones, Reuters reported.   iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners are suing Apple for the touchscreen disease, alleging the company was aware of it and still refused to fix it. The malfunction often follows after a "flickering gray bar" appears across the top of the iPhone screen.   Related Is Apple Prepping an All-Glass iPhone 8 to Mark the Device's 10th Anniversary? Video Claims to Show What iPhone 7 Lightning Adapter Looks Like "The iPhones are not fit for the purpose of use as smartphones because of the touchscreen defect," the complaint said. The lawsuit accused Apple of "fraud and violating California consumer protection laws," according to Reuters. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit blamed "touch disease" on Apple's decision not to secure the IC (integrated circuit) chip with a metal "shield" or "underfill" to protect it in the 6 and 6 Plus. Basically the chip, which registers a person's touchscreen moves, isn't connecting and therefore processing those moves to make a touchscreen functional. You can see the problem explained at length here.  Last year Apple was hit with a lawsuit when users saw one of the iPhone's features started using data like crazy and alleged Apple didn't do enough to warn users about the data draining feature. iPhone 4S users also sued Apple for rendering phones useless and forcing them to get a new phone with the release of iOS 9.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is reportedly doubling down on its iPad Pro lineup, as a new report from Bloomberg claims the Cupertino company is developing features designed to expand the high-end tablet’s capabilities. Apple is also reportedly working on some big Mac upgrades, too, along with a new 5K standalone monitor, according to the report. Among the upgrades, Bloomberg claims Apple is building software that will include “wider operating-system support” for the Apple Pencil, the stylus used for tasks such as drawing and navigation. One possible scenario is supporting the stylus across more apps, including iMessage and Safari, for things like annotations. Bloomberg says Apple is also entertaining hardware upgrades for the iPad, such as faster display technology, for next year. The larger upgrades are coming to Apple’s Mac lineup, which could arrive as early as October. Among the updates, Apple is expected to introduce a MacBook Air equipped with a USB-C port, and an iMac with new graphics chips. Additionally, Apple is rumored to introduce a new MacBook Pro with an OLED display above the keyboard, something that’s internally known as a “Dynamic Function Row,” Bloomberg reports. Here’s how that might work, according to people briefed on the new Macbook Pro: For example, if a user is on their desktop, the screen will show a virtual representation of the standard function row, which includes brightness and media controls. When in an application, the virtual row will show options specific to the task at hand, but volume controls and a switch to show the default functions will always be present. The Safari web browser would enable controls for finding and defining terms, while the iMovie video editor would offer controls for cutting clips and a more-precise volume slider, the people said. It’s unclear if Apple will open up the functionality to third-party apps, such as Chrome and Spotify. We do know, however, that macOS Sierra will be a requisite, software that’s currently expected to be released in September. You can read more over at Bloomberg.

The European Commission decision is expected to say Ireland provided the iPhone maker with illegal aid through a sweetheart deal in return for creating jobs in the nation, the people said on condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Ireland has vowed to fight any adverse finding. Such a ruling might heighten tensions between Europe and the U.S. over taxation policies, with the U.S. having already complained that Europe is unfairly targeting American companies and threatening global tax reforms. In preliminary findings in 2014, European competition authorities said Apple’s tax arrangements were improperly designed to give the company a financial boost. There’s a range of estimates on how much Apple might have to pay. In a worst-case scenario, Apple may face a $19 billion bill if the government ultimately loses and is forced to recoup tax from the company, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Rod Hall. The Irish Times reported earlier on Monday that the figure might not be much more than $112 million, although it later revised its estimate upward. The European Commission declined to comment on a decision that’s still pending or on the timing of its announcement. Apple said it had nothing to add to previous statements rejecting suggestions it received selective treatment from Irish officials. The ministry declined to comment. “A state aid ruling against Ireland is likely to bring the country’s corporation tax regime back into focus,” said Dermot O’Leary, an economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. “However, the commission investigation relates to two rulings given to Apple in 1991 and 2007. So, a critical issue will be how the final decision relates to the current Irish tax code or to previously amended policy.” The commission in January ordered Belgium to recover about $800 million in illegal tax breaks from at least 35 companies, including Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and BP Plc. And last year, for example, Starbucks Corp. was ordered to pay more than $30 million in back taxes to the Dutch government. As of last month, Apple had $232 billion in cash, with about $214 billion of that being held overseas. The U.S. Treasury Department has pushed back hard against the state aid probes, most recently with an unusual white paper that said the commission had overextended its legal authority and threatened global tax reforms. “The United States is committed to tax fairness,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. “We want to make sure the kinds of agreements we reach with other countries are not manipulated to allow companies to shirk responsibilities.” Still, the commission-ordered repayments could wind up costing American taxpayers under U.S. tax law, and benefit EU taxpayers, the U.S. has said. That’s because multinational corporations with large foreign operations, like Apple, are allowed to claim a credit against their U.S. tax bills for any foreign taxes paid, an offset that reduces their tax payments to U.S. coffers. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew first raised formal objections to the probes in a letter last February to top EC and EU officials, emphasizing so-called unfair targeting of U.S. companies — a charge that European regulators deny — and a potential damping effect on direct foreign investment.

A 130-page judgment by the commission follows a three-year investigation into claims that two advance tax opinions issued by Dublin violated EU law by granting Apple an advantage not available to other companies. The ruling was apparently circulated by competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager to her counterparts in the EU's executive branch this morning. The decision will likely further tensions between Brussels and the United States which has urged the EU to drop the case. The US Treasury accused the commission of becoming a “supranational tax authority” that threatened international agreements on tax reform. The commission is calling for a new tax assessment on Apple. How much Apple has to pay was not in the decision. However, people briefed on the matter expect the amount to reach billions of euros. Earlier this month Tim Cook said. “I hope that we get a fair hearing. If we don’t, then we would obviously appeal it.” “The government‘s case is very robust,” said Ireland’s finance ministry. “The minister has indicated previously that any adverse ruling should be appealed in the European courts and will recommend that course to cabinet.” More details in the full report below...

The fact many would be most likely out of business considering the high tax rates, the extremely gross over cosy of the health care systems. The democratics feel it necessary to charge extremely large taxes to corporations. The fact large companies have to keep extremely large cash reserves to cover market down turn, poor business sales. The fact a company can have extremely $200 billion in reserves is testament to past failures. They are lambasted for making many products overseas, the fact remains many of the materials are only available overseas. They could make more products here however, in some case they will be less profitable. The fact remains the health care system cost so much because there are no price controls. Companies are charged billions in taxes that passed in the form of cost on the consumer. Many CEO"s make huge sums of money based on performance. The fact is charging upwords of 50% on corporations force them to go overseas , they simple can remain profitable and weather a market downturn. Lowering corporate tax rates will substantially increase production in the us. They could even incorporate the tax based on employees .

Between breaks for the rich and havens for the even more rich, a lot of people get a little uncomfortable when you talk about the percentage of your paycheck that goes to the government. But with big corporations, that conversation gets even more awkward because they have a history of dodging the proverbial bullet when it comes to taxes. And everyone’s favorite smartphone inventor appears to be no different. As The Financial Times reported, Apple potentially faces billions of euros in back taxes in the face of an official ruling from the EU. According to EU competition commissioner Margathe Vestager, Apple and Ireland have been colluding to provide substantial tax breaks to the technology company for a number of years. As one of the most prolific companies in the world today, Apple has a financial target on its back. The fact that they pay less taxes than they likely should is hardly up for debate. But the methodology used to manifest a solution is far from well-organized. “It’s important for everyone to understand that the allegation made in the E.U. is that Ireland gave us a special deal. Ireland denies that,” said Tim Cook in an interview with the Washington Post. “The basic controversy at the root of this is, people really aren’t arguing that Apple should pay more taxes. They’re arguing about who they should be paid to. And so there’s a tug of war going on between the countries of how you allocate profits.” The back taxes in question vary in size depending on the source. The investment bank JP Morgan claims that the penalties could reach has high as $19 billion, which would put a substantial damper on Apple’s profits. Other less dramatic estimates claim that the fine will likely hover in the hundreds of millions, which while still large, would do far less to penalize Apple. Apple has become a staple of the tech conversation for millions of smartphone, laptop, and general gadget users around the world. While the actual amount of their tax infraction remains a mystery, one question still remains: is the iPhone 7 going to have a headphone jack or not?

The US Treasury seemed to anticipated (or was perhaps notified) of the ruling and warned the European Commission against becoming a "supra-national tax authority" that has the scope to threaten global tax reform deals. In the bigger picture, this could be the beginning of the end of 'double Irish' tax deals that have lured corporate headquarters to Ireland by allowing them to skirt taxes elsewhere. The RTE report said the decision will be 130 pages and come some time after 10 am CET. Ultimately, the market doesn't appear to be overly concerned -- Apple shares are up on the day. Shares of other companies with similar arrangements have also been spared. So either the market is asleep (which is entirely possible) or shareholders believe this will all blow over or it will result in a minor fine. After all, if it isn't Ireland, there will be another government somewhere that finds a loophole so they can move the HQ there.

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. With more than 2 million apps in the Apple App Store and 2.2 million in Google Play, there are tons of things you can do with your smartphone beyond making calls and texting. Here are some of the most innovative apps that make your smartphone do things you've never imagined. 1. Measure your heart rate Instant Heart Rate is an app that uses your phone's camera and flash to take a reading of your pulse. Just place your index finger on the camera and the app will automatically measure your heart rate by detecting color changes. The app also collects data from each reading to create charts that help you monitor your heart rate over time. Plus, you can add tags and notes such as “Just woke up,” “Before bed,” “Exercising,” and “Resting,” to make your tracking more effective. You don't have to be a fitness enthusiast to benefit from this app. It's also helpful if you have a medical condition such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes and need to monitor your heart rate closely. When I tested the app, it was within a beat or two of manually measuring my heart rate. A free basic version is available for both Apple and Android users. However, there is also a Pro version (Apple, $2.99 / Android, $1.99) that's ad-free and offers unlimited data tracking. 2. Hunt for treasure One of the most unexpected things your smartphone can do is search for metal. If you own an iPhone, download a free app called Metal Detector. This app taps into your phone's built-in magnetometer, which helps your phone detect the X,Y, Z axes for things like the compass. Metal Detector won't detect everything that's metal, but don't discredit its ability. Point your phone's camera toward the metal objects and turn up the dial to increase the intensity. You'll be surprised by the things it picks up. The app detects any metal that is magnetic. If you don't have an iPhone, a similar app (also called Metal Detector) is available for Android devices. These apps share the same name; however, they were created by different developers and have slight differences in the way they operate. 3. Control your vehicle from anywhere Wouldn't it be great if you could warm up or cool down your car before you even reach the parking lot? That's what Viper SmartStart does. It's like turning your phone into a remote control for your vehicle. With the full system, you can start your car, unlock your doors, open your trunk, locate where you're parked, and even activate your security system. Premium versions also include features such as text alerts for speeding and when your car has a low battery. The apps for Apple and Android are free to download and test, but you'll need extra hardware and a monthly service plan to make the system work. There are four different service plan options, ranging from $70 to $240 per year, depending on the features you select. You will also need a module installed in your car, which costs around $300, plus installation. 4. Measure height and distance Using your phone's camera and fancy math, the iOS app EasyMeasure estimates the distance or height of an object. Before you play around with this app, an initial calibration is required. For better results, you'll need to set the lens' height. According to the app's tutorial, the lens' height is 4 inches from your real height. To use the app, stand up and hold your phone at eye level then aim the little arrow at the base of the object you want to measure. Using the camera's angle and your position, the app estimates the object's distance. EasyMeasure is available for both Apple and Android users as a free download. There is also an option to upgrade to a premium version (Apple $2.99 / Android, $.99) that is ad-free. 5. Level objects Here's a “handy” use for your smartphone, turn it into a leveler! iHandy Level is a free download for both iOS and Android that uses your smartphone's accelerometer to help you level objects. The app even mimics a real bubble leveler with a wooden overlay. The leveling action works with all your phone's orientations so it's quite versatile. Use it in portrait mode, landscape mode or go hands-free and lay your phone flat on its back. iHandy Level can help you hang picture frames, TV mounts, light fixtures and just about anything you want to straighten out. Other features include a digital readout of the current angle and a Hold button that locks the leveler in place. 6. See in the dark Thermal vision isn't something we're born with, but now it's possible to use it to see in the dark. All you need is a camera attachment, such as the Seek Thermal. This high-resolution thermal camera attaches to your smartphone through the lightning port for Apple or micro USB port for Android. There are two different models currently available, the Compact and Compact XR. Compact models cost around $250 and include a 206 x 156 thermal sensor. This model is also waterproof and can detect temperatures between -40 degrees and 626 degrees Fahrenheit at a range up to 1,000 feet. For $300, the Compact XR model gets you a larger field of view, as well as a range of up to 1,800 feet. You'll find these products on Seek Thermal's website and on Amazon. Seek Thermal cameras also come as an app to display the detected heat signatures on your phone screen. Use this equipment to scout and track wildlife, detect air leaks, monitor your home, find loose electrical wires, etc. Kim Komando dispenses advice on today's digital lifestyle, from smartphones and tablets to online privacy and data hacks.

Trending Windows 10 Windows 10 Mobile 20 stories today Trending Trending Recent How-To Opinion Videos Review Deals Announcements News Archive Store Who we are What’s Microsoft got up its sleeve for September 7th (iPhone 7 day)? 20 recent stories What’s Microsoft got up its sleeve for September 7th (iPhone 7 day)? Kip Kniskern Email @kipkniskern 4 months ago in Latest news This morning, Apple sent out press invitations for their widely expected unveiling of the iPhone 7, to take place on September 7th, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. The rumor mill has been churning uncontrollably for months, and it looks like the latest iPhone, some Apple Watch announcements, and who knows maybe even “one more thing” will finally be revealed. Microsoft has apparently taken note of the date as well, and at least two somewhat cryptic tweets coming out of Redmond are leading us to believe that Apple’s announcements might not be the only ones happening on the 7th. First, from Microsoft’s communications chief Frank Shaw, comes this tidbit: Circling 9/7 early a.m. on my calendar. Really early a.m. :) — Frank X. Shaw (@fxshaw) August 29, 2016 And shortly after that, Major Nelson of Xbox fame, Microsoft’s Larry Hyrb, posted too: Sounds like Sept. 7 may be a busy news day. — / Larry Hryb / + 1m (@majornelson) August 29, 2016 So, unless Larry and Frank are just really excited to get new iPhones, it looks like Microsoft might be planning an announcement or two of its own. Could a Surface All-in-One be revealed? Something Xbox related? Or is Frank just trying to roust hard working tech reporters out of bed yet again?

The Verge reports that Apple is sending out invites to select journalists for the new iPhone launch on September 7 at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. The event will start at 10 a.m. Pacific Time and Apple will stream it live on its website as well as Apple TV. Apple’s launch invite simply states “See you on the 7th” and thereby being subtle about the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Also, it also makes clear that previously rumored September 16 is not the launch date. In fact, the pre-orders begin from September 9, as reported by the Inquisitr. Apple is expected to announce the latest iPhone at an event in San Francisco next week????https://t.co/TfAyyrsFWT pic.twitter.com/wfMZZsM1Jt — CNN (@CNN) August 29, 2016 The new iPhone’s design is supposed to be very similar to that of last year’s iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. Relocated antenna bands might be the only visible change. The iPhone 7 will feature an edge-to-edge display with True Tone capabilities to adjust the screen according to the ambient light, reported Tech Radar. Apple’s iPhone 7 will feature improved iSight camera modules, and the rear one will sport a sapphire crystal glass for protection. For the first time, Apple is using a dual camera setup for capturing more light and colors to output sharper photos, reported Bloomberg. However, the dual-camera setup is said to be limited to the iPhone 7 Plus only. A flush, touch-based Home button will also be more pressure-sensitive and blend haptic feedback to simulate a press. Apple intends the Home button to mimic the experience that Force Touch delivers on the new MacBooks. Of course, the new processors and bump in the memory department will certainly help new features run smoothly. One of the many improvements will also include better water resistance capabilities. However, it is the absence of headphone jack that has piqued everyone’s curiosity. Leaked photos of iPhone 7 in blue remind us of the biggest remaining mystery https://t.co/CIMxh6rCFf pic.twitter.com/CVnQK57QCZ— BGR.com (@BGR) August 29, 2016 While Apple may have its reasons, the move will break render legacy earphones and headphones with the 3.5 mm audio jack useless. That could be frustrating, since the audio jack existed since forever, figuratively, according to Ars Technica. On the contrary, CNET reported that the popularity of Bluetooth headphones should be assuring enough for users not to panic about the headphone jack’s omission in iPhone 7. So, you may expect Tim Cook to justify that move with a new set of earphones, and possibly new wireless earbuds. Battery life in iPhone 7 is also one of the most anticipated improvements — especially since a handful of Android-based phone makers today boast fast charging technology in their marquee devices. While Apple seems least interested in that, a significant battery run time in the iPhone 7 can be the only saving grace. Interestingly, the Daily Mail stresses on rumors hinting that the iPhone 7 Plus packs a bigger battery (3,100 mAh) than the iPhone 6S Plus. Apple’s new iPhone 7 may set 32 GB storage as the base model, and phase out the 16 GB model. That change could also reflect the change in the base price of the new iPhones. So the iPhone 7 Plus might cost a bit more than the iPhone 6s Plus. We will finally get the launch date of iOS 10, which has been beta tested over the last six to seven weeks. In iOS 10, noticeable changes take place in the Control Center, and there is added 3D Touch support for Notifications. In the early days of Android, Google was gung-ho about the widgets, but the fascination for them declined gradually. With iOS 10, Apple’s move to bring them to iPhone seems a bit unusual. Siri, the personal digital assistant feature, is now open for the services providers and developers to create apps around it. So it would be interesting to see if Uber or Fandango has worked on deeper integration with Siri in the iPhone 7. At the iPhone 7 event, Apple might show the second generation Watch. Regarding design, expect no radical change. However, be ready for some new materials-based bands. The new Watch packs enhancements such as a faster processor, better GPS chip, and improved water resistance properties, reported MacRumors. Apple iPhone 7’s unveiling is scheduled for September 7 in the U.S., but its availability will happen in phases when it launches. Since the first iPhone launch nine years ago, this year is the first time Apple iPhone sales have slumped, according to the Wall Street Journal. That puts a bit of pressure on Tim Cook and his entourage to price the new iPhone very carefully.

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are rumored to include dual-lense cameras, better processors, 3GB of RAM, improved water resistance, a new home button (or perhaps lack thereof), but forego the headphone jack. The phones will include a minimum of 32GB with a possibility of up to 256GB of storage. They may also incorporate the True Tone feature which is able to adjust the display to ambient lighting. Apple is also likely to introduce the second-generation Apple Watch. This device will likely boast a better processor, improved water resistance, and even a built-in GPS chip. The Apple Watch is unlikely to come in a new design, however, many believe that new straps are a possibility. It is doubtful that Apple will announce a new MacBook Pro or other Apple devices. A new MacBook Pro announcement is due for later this year. It is also improbable that Apple will announce a new iPad. Apple fans should, however, expect the release of the launch dates for iOS 10, macOS Sierra, watchOS 3, and tvOS 10. iOS 10 and watch OS3 are supposed to be released before the iPhone 7, while tvOS 10 will possibly be released at the end of the month. The latest Apple OS is not radically different from its predecessor, but it does include some useful new features. The Raise to Wake feature allows users to simply lift up their iPhones to quickly access their notifications.

Blue iPhone 7 Rumors Turning Out to be True? New leaks have surfaced about the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus depicting grayish blue color with dual lens camera technology By: Staff Writer on Aug 29, 2016 at 5:12 pm EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Add to Flipboard Magazine. Apple – known for its notorious secrecy and master marketing strategies – is expected to refresh its premium branded iPhone soon and no matter how hard it tries to keep its plans guarded behind closed doors, some information is bound to leak through the cracks. With the upcoming iPhone launch event set for September – keeping up with old traditions – for the new generation iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and several reports surfacing with minor discrepancies, the industry has a gist of what to expect so far. Leak after leak have shared many expectations helping us to paint a better picture for the upcoming market-topping smartphones. However, some questions still exist that have yet to be answered, as new leaked photos of the next-gen iPhone doesn’t solve the biggest mystery left. Apple’s upcoming iPhone 7 models will apparently have designs much similar to the latest smartphones, the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus. While sporting new antenna designs with better finesse than in the predecessors, the two new smartphones will also be thinner. People around the industry are expecting two novel camera setups; the bigger iPhone 7 Plus to house a brand new dual-lens camera technology while the iPhone 7 to receive a single upgraded camera. Neither model would have the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack but they would house powerful internals and significant performance upgrades. However, it is important to remember that these are based on reports, leaks, rumors and speculation; none of these have been confirmed by Apple and may be inaccurate. There has been consistency in most of the leaks but one of the biggest mysteries that consumers are interested in is the color. Apple is expected to introduce a new color for its smartphone line this year. Since iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models looked exactly like their predecessors, the company introduced a new rose gold color to help boost sales. The rose gold color has been highly popular in the markets. In 2016 – with not massive changes coming to the product line – it is possible that a new color, possibly even more attractive than the rose gold, is on its way. Previous rumors suggested that the company is adding a novel Space Black color to its iPhone lineup in 2016. While mockups of the new generation black iPhone looked pretty swell, it doesn’t exactly go hand-in-hand with the more recent rumor of a new blue color being added to the iPhone 7 models. Now, a new set of photos presented by the Twitter user, The Malignant, in two tweets show mockups of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models in the blue color. The latest leaks depict a grayish blue color that look like something Apple would cover its precious iPhones in, in contrast to the deep blue color suggested in earlier reports. Apple has scheduled a press conference for September 7 and people are almost certain that this is where the so-called iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models will be unveiled. The phones will most likely be available for preorders on September 9 prior to the actual release on September 16.

The tech giant announced the date for the Sept. 7 launch by sending out invitations to technology journalists and industry analysts on Monday. Apple didn't provide any details, in keeping with its usual practice, but it traditionally announces one or two new iPhone models at its annual September event. Apple might also show new models or features for other products like the Apple Watch or MacBook computer. The Cupertino, Calif., company sold more than 214 million iPhones over the last 12 months. But sales are down from a year ago, and analysts will be watching closely to see what changes Apple has made in the newest models. ECONOMY Slower July growth for consumer spending American consumers boosted spending at a slower pace in July, while their incomes accelerated slightly. Spending grew 0.3 percent in July following a 0.5 percent increase in June, the Commerce Department reported Monday. The slowdown had been expected given an earlier report that retail sales were flat in July. Incomes grew 0.4 percent in July, up from a 0.3 percent increase in June. Economists are counting on solid gains in consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, to power overall growth in the second half of the year. The deceleration in July is likely to be followed by stronger spending increases in coming months. For July, spending on durable goods such as autos rose by a solid 1.6 percent, but spending for nondurable goods fell. AUTOMOTIVE VW owners register for settlement About 210,000 owners of Volkswagens with 2-liter diesel engines that cheat on emissions tests have registered to settle with the company under the terms of a June court agreement. The figure was revealed in a federal court motion by class action attorneys seeking final approval of the settlement involving 475,000 owners. It says only 235 have asked to stay out of the settlement and pursue legal action on their own. Another 110 objections to the settlement were filed. U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer has given the $15 billion settlement preliminary approval, with a final decision expected Oct. 18. Terms call for the German carmaker to spend up to $10 billion buying back or repairing Volkswagen and Audi 2-liter vehicles and paying owners another $5,100 to $10,000 each. AVIATION Boeing skips annual jetliner price hike Boeing isn't raising airplane prices for the first time in seven years as it contends with demand cooled by economic uncertainty and a glut of twin-aisle aircraft. The U.S. aerospace giant typically adjusts its published charges for commercial aircraft once a year to reflect an internal formula that takes into account increases in the costs of goods, services and labor. Boeing boosted prices 2.9 percent last year and 3.1 percent in 2014. The prices posted in July 2015 will continue to serve as a basis for customer discussions, Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said via e-mail. They range from $80.6 million for Boeing's smallest narrow-body aircraft, the 737-700, to $400 million for the 777-9, the first twin-engine plane designed to haul more than 400 travelers. RETAIL J. Crew to sell clothes through Nordstrom J. Crew Group's flagship chain will start selling an assortment of women's clothes at Nordstrom stores, part of a push to revive growth at the moribund apparel brand. J. Crew will introduce the collection on Sept. 12 in 16 Nordstrom locations, as well as the department store's website, according to a statement Monday. J. Crew is looking for ways to win back shoppers ­— especially women ­— after price increases and a shift away from classic styles alienated customers. The retailer has revamped its merchandise, but same-store sales have slid during the past seven straight quarters.

Mylan N.V. has faced intense criticism for hiking the price for the potentially life-saving drug more than 500 per cent after acquiring the product in 2007. The company said Monday it will begin selling its generic version for $300 for a pair of EpiPens, in doses for adults or children. ___ Takata troubles worsen as truck explodes, kills Texas woman DETROIT (AP) — Air bag maker Takata Corp.’s troubles worsened Monday as the company confirmed that a truck carrying its inflators and a volatile chemical exploded last week in a Texas border town, killing a woman and injuring four others. The truck, operated by a subcontractor, crashed, caught fire and exploded Aug. 22 in the small town of Quemado, levelling the woman’s house. The company says it sent people to the site and is helping authorities investigate the crash. Takata has a warehouse in nearby Eagle Pass, Texas, and it has an air bag inflator factory across the border in Monclova, Mexico. ___ Apple expected to show new iPhone at event next week SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is expected to show off a new iPhone next week when the company holds its fall product launch event in San Francisco. The tech giant announced the date for the Sept. 7 launch on Monday. Apple didn’t provide any details, in keeping with its usual practice, but it traditionally announces one or two new iPhone models at its annual event. The company sold more than 214 million iPhones over the last 12 months but sales are down from a year ago. ___ Over 40 pct. of VW owners seek emissions cheating settlement DETROIT (AP) — About 210,000 owners of Volkswagens with 2-litre diesel engines that cheat on emissions tests have registered to settle with the company under the terms of a June court agreement. The figure was revealed in a federal court motion by class action attorneys seeking final approval of the settlement involving 475,000 owners. It says only 235 have asked to stay out of the settlement and pursue legal action on their own. Another 110 objections to the settlement were filed. U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer has given the $15 billion settlement preliminary approval, with a final decision expected Oct. 18. ___ American’s No. 2 executive departs for United Airlines DALLAS (AP) — The president at American Airlines is leaving to take the same job with rival United Airlines. United Continental Holdings Inc. said Monday that Scott Kirby has been named president and will oversee operations, sales and other duties. Kirby, 49, was often seen as a likely successor to American Airlines CEO Doug Parker. Instead, he will add airline-industry expertise to United’s management. ___ US consumer spending posts slower growth in July American consumers boosted spending at a slower pace in July, while their incomes accelerated slightly. Spending grew 0.3 per cent in July following a 0.5 per cent increase in June, the Commerce Department reported Monday. The slowdown had been expected given an earlier report that retail sales were flat in July. Economists are counting on solid gains in consumer spending, which accounts for 70 per cent of economic activity, to power overall growth in the second half of the year. ___ Banks lead gains on Wall Street on hopes for higher rates NEW YORK (AP) — Banks led the stock market higher Monday as investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates this year from their historically low levels. That could help banks recover from a long slump by making lending more profitable. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told a conference last week that the case for raising rates was strengthening given improvements in the economy. Raising interest rates from their rock-bottom levels, where they have been since the 2008 financial crisis, could be a good thing not only for markets but for savers. ___ FAA forecast: 600,000 commercial drones within the year There will be 600,000 commercial drone aircraft operating in the U.S. within the year as the result of new safety rules that opened the skies to them on Monday, according to a Federal Aviation Administration estimate. Commercial operators initially complained that the new rules would be too rigid. The agency responded by creating a system to grant exemptions to some of the rules for companies that show they can operate safely. On the first day the rules were in effect the FAA had already granted 76 exemptions, most of them to companies that want to fly drones at night. ___ Mondelez says it ended talks to buy Hershey NEW YORK (AP) — Mondelez says it has ended discussions to buy The Hershey Co, a combination that would have created a global powerhouse selling some of the world’s best known chocolates and snacks. Hershey said in June that it rejected a preliminary takeover bid from Mondelez International Inc. valued at roughly $22.3 billion. At the time, it said that the offer provided “no basis for further discussion.” A representative for Hershey did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. ___ FBI warns of possible state election-system hacks NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI is warning state officials to boost their election security in light of evidence that hackers breached related data systems in two states. In a confidential “flash” alert from its cyber division, first reported by Yahoo News and posted online by others, the FBI said it’s investigating the pair of incidents and advised states to scan their systems for specific signs of hacking. The FBI said Monday that it doesn’t comment on specific alerts, but added that it routinely sends out advisories to private industry about signs of cyber threats that it comes across in its investigations. ___ Pennsylvania firm launches Zika vaccine trial in Puerto Rico SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A Pennsylvania drug company announced Monday that it has launched a clinical trial of an experimental Zika vaccine in Puerto Rico, the part of the U.S. hardest hit by the mosquito-borne virus. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. will be testing its DNA-based vaccine candidate on 160 adult volunteers in Puerto Rico. If the results are promising, the company would meet with regulators next year to discuss plans to develop the vaccine, CEO J. Joseph Kim said. The search for a vaccine is particularly relevant in Puerto Rico, which as of Friday had reported more than 14,000 cases, including 1,244 among pregnant women. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.59 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 18,502.99. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index climbed 11.34 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,180.38. The Nasdaq composite edged up 13.41 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5,232.33. Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 66 cents to $46.98 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price oil internationally, lost 66 cents to $49.26 a barrel. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 5 cents to $1.47 a gallon, heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon and natural gas fell 2 cents to $2.85 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Facebook Email Twitter LinkedIn Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

(Skip Dickstein/Times Union) Photo: SKIP DICKSTEIN Buy this photo Albany sheriff pulls TSA airport check-point proposal 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Albany A contentious local law proposal that would have made it a crime for passengers to refuse screening at Albany International Airport has been taken off the table. Sheriff Craig Apple said he requested Local Law E be withdrawn during the Albany County Legislature's Public Safety Committee meeting on Aug. 24 because of the lack of documentation needed to move the proposal for the Colonie airport forward and the mounting opposition against it. Several groups — from Muslim advocacy organizations to the New York Civil Liberties Union — came out against the law, which was proposed in April with bipartisan support. Opponents say the law could lead to confusion, unwarranted arrests and racial and religious profiling. "After conferring with members of the legislature, we figured the people have spoken, they've indicated what they want to do, so let's pull it," Apple said. The law aimed to cover a weak spot in the current system that allows passengers to walk away without boarding their flights if security staff flags them for additional scrutiny, according to Apple, who has said his deputies don't have legal grounds to question such a person. The Transportation Security Administration has no police power of its own and currently can only levy a fine. As the proposed law was written, passengers could be in violation of the law should they leave the line even prior to going through metal detectors and having luggage scanned. Those people could have been further charged with a misdemeanor. Apple has said the TSA approached the sheriff's office with the proposal, shortly after TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger told Congress and travelers to expect more visible airport security in the wake of bombings at an airport and train station in Brussels, Belgium, including more random searches even after passengers have cleared security checkpoints. On Monday a TSA representative in Albany, when asked about the withdrawl of the proposal by the legislature, would say only that it was the county's decision. Legislature Majority Leader Frank Commisso, a Democrat, was a sponsor of the proposal. He said pulling the proposal was the right thing to do. "This situation was rather unique in the way it came about, and I feel the sheriff felt very strongly in walking away from it," Commisso said. "I have no problem with his decision." Legislator Frank Mauriello, R-Colonie, said he was in favor of the measure, but thought it would've been helpful if TSA representatives had come out to explain it further. "We knew they were the ones that came to the sheriff and asked to do this," Mauriello said. "What I found really confusing, once they had our support and ear, they decided not to come." afries@timesunion.com • 518-454-5353 • @mandy_fries Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Vince Camuto 24" Hardside Spinner Suitcase for $110 + free...

A future iPhone will include technology called FeliCa, a mobile tap-to-pay standard in Japan developed by Sony Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. The FeliCa chip will let customers in Japan store their public bus and train passes on their iPhones. Users would then be able to tap their phones against the entrance scanners instead of using physical cards. While the FeliCa chip is the standard technology underlying the service, there are several different providers of transit payment cards based on the type of transit and areas within Japan.  The Near Field Communication technology powering Apple’s mobile-payments service, Apple Pay, is prevalent in North America, Europe and Australia, but the FeliCa standard dominates Japan with a penetration of 1.9 million payment terminals, according to the Bank of Japan. The terminals handled 4.6 trillion yen ($46 billion) in transactions in 2015. Last year, there were 1.3 million NFC terminals in the U.S. and 320,000 in the U.K., according to research from Let’s Talk Payments and the U.K. Cards Association. Apple intends to work with multiple transit card providers, one person said. The major players there include the Suica and Pasmo networks. Theoretically, virtual representations of the transit passes would be stored in the iPhone’s Wallet application, said the person, who asked not be identified because the planning is private. The card companies sell access to transit services both as-needed and via monthly packages. Apple’s opportunity in Japan is significant with the country alone representing 8 percent of the company’s total revenue and almost 11 percent of operating profit in the most recent quarter. IPHONE TIMING Apple has planned to launch these new features with the next iPhone models, which the company is set to unveil in September, according to people familiar with the matter. However, the company could hold back the transit card feature to next year’s model if discussions with the Japan-based payment networks fall apart, one person said. Apple is already at work on a major redesign of the iPhone for 2017 that focuses more heavily on the display by removing the Home button, according to a person familiar with the matter. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The  FeliCa chip is able to process a transaction in 0.1 seconds, according to Sony. Super-swift transaction speeds are critical for adoption in the fast-paced environment of Japan’s transit network, the person said. Each sale over Apple Pay currently goes through a server and requires bank approval -- which can slow the process. In addition to supporting the transit-pass network, the FeliCa chip can also store e-money, an electric form of currency now widely accepted at vending machines, convenience stores and cafes in Japan. Apple is in discussions with at least one major financial institution to support these e-money transactions, according to one of the people. REVENUE OPPORTUNITY Apple Pay first launched in October 2014 in the U.S. with the iPhone 6 and has since expanded to Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, France, Singapore, Switzerland and the U.K. Apple Pay contributes to the company’s rapidly growing services business, which grew 19 percent year-over-year to about $6 billion in the fiscal third quarter. Earlier this month, Apple struck a deal with Japan-based phone carrier KDDI to allow customers to bill iTunes purchases to their phone service bill instead of directly to their credit card. Apple’s deal with the Japanese carrier is indicative of Apple’s payment-related negotiations with firms in Japan and follows up the company’s work on activating carrier-based iTunes billing in Germany, the U.K., Russia, Switzerland, and Taiwan. In tandem with the upcoming mobile payments launch for Japan, Apple is preparing to ship mass-transit navigation support for Japan in its iPhone Maps application, the company posted on its website in July. This feature, coming in iOS 10 later this year, will allow users to find departure and arrival times for transportation across the region.

Mylan N.V. has faced intense criticism for hiking the price for the potentially life-saving drug more than 500 percent after acquiring the product in 2007. The company said Monday it will begin selling its generic version for $300 for a pair of EpiPens, in doses for adults or children. ___ Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Takata troubles worsen as truck explodes, kills Texas woman DETROIT (AP) — Air bag maker Takata Corp.'s troubles worsened Monday as the company confirmed that a truck carrying its inflators and a volatile chemical exploded last week in a Texas border town, killing a woman and injuring four others. The truck, operated by a subcontractor, crashed, caught fire and exploded Aug. 22 in the small town of Quemado, leveling the woman's house. The company says it sent people to the site and is helping authorities investigate the crash. Takata has a warehouse in nearby Eagle Pass, Texas, and it has an air bag inflator factory across the border in Monclova, Mexico. ___ Apple expected to show new iPhone at event next week SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is expected to show off a new iPhone next week when the company holds its fall product launch event in San Francisco. The tech giant announced the date for the Sept. 7 launch on Monday. Apple didn't provide any details, in keeping with its usual practice, but it traditionally announces one or two new iPhone models at its annual event. The company sold more than 214 million iPhones over the last 12 months but sales are down from a year ago. ___ Over 40 pct. of VW owners seek emissions cheating settlement DETROIT (AP) — About 210,000 owners of Volkswagens with 2-liter diesel engines that cheat on emissions tests have registered to settle with the company under the terms of a June court agreement. The figure was revealed in a federal court motion by class action attorneys seeking final approval of the settlement involving 475,000 owners. It says only 235 have asked to stay out of the settlement and pursue legal action on their own. Another 110 objections to the settlement were filed. U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer has given the $15 billion settlement preliminary approval, with a final decision expected Oct. 18. ___ American's No. 2 executive departs for United Airlines DALLAS (AP) — The president at American Airlines is leaving to take the same job with rival United Airlines. United Continental Holdings Inc. said Monday that Scott Kirby has been named president and will oversee operations, sales and other duties. Kirby, 49, was often seen as a likely successor to American Airlines CEO Doug Parker. Instead, he will add airline-industry expertise to United's management. ___ US consumer spending posts slower growth in July WASHINGTON (AP) — American consumers boosted spending at a slower pace in July, while their incomes accelerated slightly. Spending grew 0.3 percent in July following a 0.5 percent increase in June, the Commerce Department reported Monday. The slowdown had been expected given an earlier report that retail sales were flat in July. Economists are counting on solid gains in consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, to power overall growth in the second half of the year. ___ Banks lead gains on Wall Street on hopes for higher rates NEW YORK (AP) — Banks led the stock market higher Monday as investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates this year from their historically low levels. That could help banks recover from a long slump by making lending more profitable. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told a conference last week that the case for raising rates was strengthening given improvements in the economy. Raising interest rates from their rock-bottom levels, where they have been since the 2008 financial crisis, could be a good thing not only for markets but for savers. ___ FAA forecast: 600,000 commercial drones within the year WASHINGTON (AP) — There will be 600,000 commercial drone aircraft operating in the U.S. within the year as the result of new safety rules that opened the skies to them on Monday, according to a Federal Aviation Administration estimate. Commercial operators initially complained that the new rules would be too rigid. The agency responded by creating a system to grant exemptions to some of the rules for companies that show they can operate safely. On the first day the rules were in effect the FAA had already granted 76 exemptions, most of them to companies that want to fly drones at night. ___ Mondelez says it ended talks to buy Hershey NEW YORK (AP) — Mondelez says it has ended discussions to buy The Hershey Co, a combination that would have created a global powerhouse selling some of the world's best known chocolates and snacks. Hershey said in June that it rejected a preliminary takeover bid from Mondelez International Inc. valued at roughly $22.3 billion. At the time, it said that the offer provided "no basis for further discussion." A representative for Hershey did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. ___ FBI warns of possible state election-system hacks NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI is warning state officials to boost their election security in light of evidence that hackers breached related data systems in two states. In a confidential "flash" alert from its cyber division, first reported by Yahoo News and posted online by others, the FBI said it's investigating the pair of incidents and advised states to scan their systems for specific signs of hacking. The FBI said Monday that it doesn't comment on specific alerts, but added that it routinely sends out advisories to private industry about signs of cyber threats that it comes across in its investigations. ___ Pennsylvania firm launches Zika vaccine trial in Puerto Rico SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A Pennsylvania drug company announced Monday that it has launched a clinical trial of an experimental Zika vaccine in Puerto Rico, the part of the U.S. hardest hit by the mosquito-borne virus. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. will be testing its DNA-based vaccine candidate on 160 adult volunteers in Puerto Rico. If the results are promising, the company would meet with regulators next year to discuss plans to develop the vaccine, CEO J. Joseph Kim said. The search for a vaccine is particularly relevant in Puerto Rico, which as of Friday had reported more than 14,000 cases, including 1,244 among pregnant women. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.59 points, or 0.6 percent, to 18,502.99. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 11.34 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,180.38. The Nasdaq composite edged up 13.41 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,232.33. Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 66 cents to $46.98 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price oil internationally, lost 66 cents to $49.26 a barrel. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 5 cents to $1.47 a gallon, heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon and natural gas fell 2 cents to $2.85 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Tim Brugger (timbrugger) Aug 29, 2016 at 5:09PM Tim Cook celebrates the sale of the billionth iPhone earlier this year. Image Source: Apple. When Tim Cook took over the reins at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) from the iconic Steve Jobs on Aug. 24, 2011, he had some big shoes to fill. Apple's stock was flying high on the unrivaled success of the tech giant's iPhone lineup, and with each successive smartphone iteration Apple's revenue and profits continued to climb. Those days are long gone due to smartphone market saturation, at least for high-end devices, which Apple has steadfastly refused to move away from. Yes, Apple did introduce its smaller and slightly less expensive iPhone SE earlier this year, but even that sets consumers back around $400 to $500, which still leaves it out of reach for most in the world's emerging markets. That said, Apple shareholders have enjoyed a nice run during Cook's five-year tenure -- except when compared to the tech company's primary competitor Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and longtime rival Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). First, the good news Despite the inevitable slowdown of the high-end smartphone market, Apple continues to generate ridiculously high revenue and profits. Last quarter's $42.4 billion in sales and net income of $7.8 billion -- equal to $1.42 earnings per share (EPS) -- would be the envy of any of its competitors. On the revenue front, Apple's generated more than twice Alphabet's and Microsoft's $21.5 billion and $20.6 billion in sales, respectively. Problem is, Apple fans aren't used to year-over-year declines in sales and profits, though that's what they were dealt last quarter. Revenue dropped 15% in the third quarter from $49.6 billion a year ago, and EPS nosedived 23% from 2015's $1.85 per-share earnings. Cook added insult to injury by sharing guidance of "just" $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion for the current quarter, well below Q4 2015's $51.5 billion. For Apple, so-so isn't good enough, which is why its stock price is essentially flat for the year. Under Cook's leadership, the stock has climbed 121% after adjusting for stock splits and dividends. Slightly more than doubling Apple's share price since Cook took the helm is hardly a bad thing -- except when compared to Alphabet and Microsoft. Image source: Statista. The not-so-good news Alphabet's strategy of giving its Android OS away to drive its search advertising revenue has worked like a charm. While Apple was struggling through its drop in sales last quarter, Alphabet shareholders were enjoying a 21% jump in sales to $21.5 billion. The majority of Alphabet's sales are ad-driven, but even its "other revenue" segment, which includes its multiple moonshots, smart-home initiatives, self-driving cars, and similar cutting-edge forays, climbed 33%, to $2.2 billion. In other words unlike Apple, Alphabet is aggressively exploring its next big thing, while Cook's search for a non-iPhone-related revenue source continues. Which is one reason why Alphabet's stock has more than tripled since Cook became Apple's CEO. After adjusting for one-time expenses due to deferred Windows 10 sales, Microsoft also grew revenue last quarter, albeit minimally. In the spirit of Alphabet's exploration of new revenue sources, Microsoft is in the midst of successfully transitioning to becoming a dominant player in the fast-growing cloud marketplace. With over $12.1 billion in cloud sales the past 12 months, Microsoft is well on its way to putting its reliance on PCs  in the rearview mirror -- much like Apple needs to do with its crumbling high-end smartphone market. Microsoft's transformation helps explain why its stock is up 167% in the past five years, easily outdistancing Apple's performance under Cook. A negative comparison to Microsoft is the last thing many iFans wants to hear, but Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recognized a couple of years ago it was time to reinvent his company's business, and shareholders are reaping the benefits. The worst news Unfortunately for Apple, the worst news is that there are no magic bullets on the horizon. Unlike Alphabet's nanotechnology, self-driving cars, and "smart" Nest device, or Microsoft's cloud, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality solution HoloLens, Apple has no next big thing on the horizon. Until Cook and team find another iPhone-like revenue driver, Apple will continue to underperform Alphabet and Microsoft -- as painful as that is to hear for iFans.          Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Referred to as “Touch Disease,” a hardware problem causes iPhone displays to become unresponsive and feature a thin gray flickering line along the top. Now, a trio of iPhone users have filed a class action lawsuit against Apple over the issue, claiming that Apple has refused to repair devices that are affected for free… The class action suit was filed by Todd Cleary of California, Jun Bai of Delaware, and Thomas Davidson of Pennsylvania in the U.S. District Court of Northern California. Specifically, the complaint accuses Apple of violating the consumer fraud statutes in place in California, as well as the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. As for what the plaintiffs are demanding, the paperwork shows requests for Apple to repair, recall, and/or replace iPhones affected by Touch Disease, as well as to extend the warranties for all iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users for issues related to Touch Disease. The plaintiffs are also requesting unspecified damages, we well. From the filing (via MR): Apple has long been aware of the defective iPhones. Yet, notwithstanding its longstanding knowledge of this design defect, Apple routinely has refused to repair the iPhones without charge when the defect manifests. Many other iPhone owners have communicated with Apple’s employees and agents to request that Apple remedy and/or address the Touchscreen Defect and/or resultant damage at no expense. Apple has failed and/or refused to do so. As a result of Apple’s unfair, deceptive and/or fraudulent business practices, owners of the iPhones, including Plaintiffs, have suffered an ascertainable loss of money and/or property and/or value. The unfair and deceptive trade practices committed by Apple were conducted in a manner giving rise to substantial aggravating circumstances. Last week’s iFixit report claimed that the Touch Disease issue could be so widespread that “almost every” iPhone 6 and 6 Plus could be “ticking bombs just waiting to act up.” Whether or not that’s true remains to be seen, but even if it’s remotely the case, Apple could have a relatively big problem on its hands. On the other hand, this could just be another attempt by people to make a quick buck by hitting Apple with a lawsuit… Guides iPhone View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Some of the devices may even arrive later this year, the report states, citing sources familiar with Apple’s plans. The company is likely to skip over next week’s iPhone unveiling and save any Mac-related announcements for a hardware event in October, when it typically announces new iPads. Bloomberg says Apple is not planning to update the iPad lineup this fall, choosing instead to focus on software features to make its new iPad Pro more appealing to professional users. These changes include being able to annotate inside apps across the operating system with the Apple Pencil stylus. The software features may arrive in an update early next year or packaged in with the next version of iOS, due out in the fall of 2017. The new MacBook Pro could contain a keyboard display with dynamic function buttons As far as Mac upgrades go, Apple is slated to release a more up-to-date version of the MacBook Air with a USB-C port, similar to the standard MacBook released last year, while the new iMac is also said to getting a graphics boost.  There is little else in terms of hardware details on what other changes the desktop and laptop lines may receive. The 5K monitor with LG, on the other hand, would replace the now-discontinued Thunderbolt display. The biggest changes appear reserved for the MacBook Pro, which will reportedly be slimmed down to contain a flatter keyboard. The keyboard is also said to contain what Apple calls a "Dynamic Function Row," which replaces the top row of keys with a touchscreen OLED display that will alter the keys and their icons to match the current application. News of the keyboard change was reported by KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo in May, and later confirmed by Bloomberg and others.

A thinner laptop, a faster iPad display to work with Apple Pencil, and 5K monitors are among the updates coming to Apple products, unnamed sources told Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Jungah Lee. But the MacBook, which some tech bloggers had thought might come alongside the iPhone 7 in September, is more likely to be released in October, according to Bloomberg. Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty Images iPad Pro The description of the new laptop — with a digital touchscreen keyboard row — squares with earlier reports from industry blog 9to5Mac. Apple may also unveil a new iMac desktop and MacBook Air laptop, Bloomberg said. New iPad Pro features, including smoother zooming, panning and scrolling and annotations across the operating system, are slated to follow in 2017, alongside a 10.5-inch display for the device, Bloomberg said. A high-resolution stand-alone monitor may also be ahead for Apple, a source told Bloomberg, although the report did not say when that would hit the market. Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. For more on the story, see the full article at Bloomberg.com.

Some owners of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been reporting issues with the touch screen not working — and now, Apple is facing a lawsuit because of the problem, Reuters reports. People who experience the problem see a gray bar flash at the top of the screen. When the touchscreen stops working, it becomes basically impossible to use the phone. It's even been dubbed "touch disease." According to the proposed nationwide class-action lawsuit, which Reuters reports was filed on Saturday, Apple allegedly knew about the defect and didn’t fix it. As BGR explains, the issue occurs because "Apple failed to incorporate underfill or a metal shield, two ways of protecting chips on the logic board that have been seen on previous iPhones." BGR also reports that the lawsuit asks for an iPhone recall, as well as payment of damages and an extended warranty period.

Mark Schiefelbein by Jonathan Stempel Apple has been sued by owners of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus smartphones who say a design defect causes the phones' touchscreens to become unresponsive, making them unusable. According to a proposed nationwide class-action lawsuit filed on Saturday US time, Apple has long been aware of the defect, which often surfaces after a flickering grey bar appears atop the touchscreens, but has refused to fix it. The plaintiffs linked the problem to Apple's decision not to use a metal "shield" or "underfill" to protect the relevant parts, as it did on versions of the iPhone 5. "The iPhones are not fit for the purpose of use as smartphones because of the touchscreen defect," according to the complaint filed in federal court in San Jose, California. Todd Cleary of California, Jun Bai of Delaware and Thomas Davidson of Pennsylvania are the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which accuses Apple of fraud and violating California consumer protection laws. They seek unspecified damages. Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating...

Problems with iPhone 6 touchscreens were described online last week by iFixit, which labelled the issue "Touch Disease". That company sells repair parts and has previously analysed other Apple products. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, sold 166.4 million iPhones, generating $US108.5 billion ($143.4 billion) of net sales, in the first nine months of its current fiscal year.

Mylan N.V. has faced intense criticism for hiking the price for the potentially life-saving drug more than 500 percent after acquiring the product in 2007. The company said Monday it will begin selling its generic version for $300 for a pair of EpiPens, in doses for adults or children. ___ Takata troubles worsen as truck explodes, kills Texas woman DETROIT (AP) — Air bag maker Takata Corp.'s troubles worsened Monday as the company confirmed that a truck carrying its inflators and a volatile chemical exploded last week in a Texas border town, killing a woman and injuring four others. The truck, operated by a subcontractor, crashed, caught fire and exploded Aug. 22 in the small town of Quemado, leveling the woman's house. The company says it sent people to the site and is helping authorities investigate the crash. Takata has a warehouse in nearby Eagle Pass, Texas, and it has an air bag inflator factory across the border in Monclova, Mexico. ___ Apple expected to show new iPhone at event next week SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is expected to show off a new iPhone next week when the company holds its fall product launch event in San Francisco. The tech giant announced the date for the Sept. 7 launch on Monday. Apple didn't provide any details, in keeping with its usual practice, but it traditionally announces one or two new iPhone models at its annual event. The company sold more than 214 million iPhones over the last 12 months but sales are down from a year ago. ___ Over 40 pct. of VW owners seek emissions cheating settlement DETROIT (AP) — About 210,000 owners of Volkswagens with 2-liter diesel engines that cheat on emissions tests have registered to settle with the company under the terms of a June court agreement. The figure was revealed in a federal court motion by class action attorneys seeking final approval of the settlement involving 475,000 owners. It says only 235 have asked to stay out of the settlement and pursue legal action on their own. Another 110 objections to the settlement were filed. U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer has given the $15 billion settlement preliminary approval, with a final decision expected Oct. 18. ___ American's No. 2 executive departs for United Airlines DALLAS (AP) — The president at American Airlines is leaving to take the same job with rival United Airlines. United Continental Holdings Inc. said Monday that Scott Kirby has been named president and will oversee operations, sales and other duties. Kirby, 49, was often seen as a likely successor to American Airlines CEO Doug Parker. Instead, he will add airline-industry expertise to United's management. ___ US consumer spending posts slower growth in July WASHINGTON (AP) — American consumers boosted spending at a slower pace in July, while their incomes accelerated slightly. Spending grew 0.3 percent in July following a 0.5 percent increase in June, the Commerce Department reported Monday. The slowdown had been expected given an earlier report that retail sales were flat in July. Economists are counting on solid gains in consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, to power overall growth in the second half of the year. ___ Banks lead gains on Wall Street on hopes for higher rates NEW YORK (AP) — Banks led the stock market higher Monday as investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates this year from their historically low levels. That could help banks recover from a long slump by making lending more profitable. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told a conference last week that the case for raising rates was strengthening given improvements in the economy. Raising interest rates from their rock-bottom levels, where they have been since the 2008 financial crisis, could be a good thing not only for markets but for savers. ___ FAA forecast: 600,000 commercial drones within the year WASHINGTON (AP) — There will be 600,000 commercial drone aircraft operating in the U.S. within the year as the result of new safety rules that opened the skies to them on Monday, according to a Federal Aviation Administration estimate. Commercial operators initially complained that the new rules would be too rigid. The agency responded by creating a system to grant exemptions to some of the rules for companies that show they can operate safely. On the first day the rules were in effect the FAA had already granted 76 exemptions, most of them to companies that want to fly drones at night. ___ Mondelez says it ended talks to buy Hershey NEW YORK (AP) — Mondelez says it has ended discussions to buy The Hershey Co, a combination that would have created a global powerhouse selling some of the world's best known chocolates and snacks. Hershey said in June that it rejected a preliminary takeover bid from Mondelez International Inc. valued at roughly $22.3 billion. At the time, it said that the offer provided "no basis for further discussion." A representative for Hershey did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. ___ FBI warns of possible state election-system hacks NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI is warning state officials to boost their election security in light of evidence that hackers breached related data systems in two states. In a confidential "flash" alert from its cyber division, first reported by Yahoo News and posted online by others, the FBI said it's investigating the pair of incidents and advised states to scan their systems for specific signs of hacking. The FBI said Monday that it doesn't comment on specific alerts, but added that it routinely sends out advisories to private industry about signs of cyber threats that it comes across in its investigations. ___ Pennsylvania firm launches Zika vaccine trial in Puerto Rico SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A Pennsylvania drug company announced Monday that it has launched a clinical trial of an experimental Zika vaccine in Puerto Rico, the part of the U.S. hardest hit by the mosquito-borne virus. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. will be testing its DNA-based vaccine candidate on 160 adult volunteers in Puerto Rico. If the results are promising, the company would meet with regulators next year to discuss plans to develop the vaccine, CEO J. Joseph Kim said. The search for a vaccine is particularly relevant in Puerto Rico, which as of Friday had reported more than 14,000 cases, including 1,244 among pregnant women. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.59 points, or 0.6 percent, to 18,502.99. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 11.34 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,180.38. The Nasdaq composite edged up 13.41 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,232.33. Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 66 cents to $46.98 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price oil internationally, lost 66 cents to $49.26 a barrel. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 5 cents to $1.47 a gallon, heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon and natural gas fell 2 cents to $2.85 per 1,000 cubic feet.

See who is being considered for the incoming administration on our Tracking the Transition page. Mylan N.V. has faced intense criticism for hiking the price for the potentially life-saving drug more than 500 percent after acquiring the product in 2007. Advertisement The company said Monday it will begin selling its generic version for $300 for a pair of EpiPens, in doses for adults or children. ___ Takata troubles worsen as truck explodes, kills Texas woman DETROIT (AP) — Air bag maker Takata Corp.’s troubles worsened Monday as the company confirmed that a truck carrying its inflators and a volatile chemical exploded last week in a Texas border town, killing a woman and injuring four others. The truck, operated by a subcontractor, crashed, caught fire and exploded Aug. 22 in the small town of Quemado, leveling the woman’s house. The company says it sent people to the site and is helping authorities investigate the crash. Takata has a warehouse in nearby Eagle Pass, Texas, and it has an air bag inflator factory across the border in Monclova, Mexico. ___ Apple expected to show new iPhone at event next week SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is expected to show off a new iPhone next week when the company holds its fall product launch event in San Francisco. The tech giant announced the date for the Sept. 7 launch on Monday. Apple didn’t provide any details, in keeping with its usual practice, but it traditionally announces one or two new iPhone models at its annual event. The company sold more than 214 million iPhones over the last 12 months but sales are down from a year ago. ___ Over 40 pct. of VW owners seek emissions cheating settlement DETROIT (AP) — About 210,000 owners of Volkswagens with 2-liter diesel engines that cheat on emissions tests have registered to settle with the company under the terms of a June court agreement. The figure was revealed in a federal court motion by class action attorneys seeking final approval of the settlement involving 475,000 owners. It says only 235 have asked to stay out of the settlement and pursue legal action on their own. Another 110 objections to the settlement were filed. U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer has given the $15 billion settlement preliminary approval, with a final decision expected Oct. 18. ___ American’s No. 2 executive departs for United Airlines DALLAS (AP) — The president at American Airlines is leaving to take the same job with rival United Airlines. United Continental Holdings Inc. said Monday that Scott Kirby has been named president and will oversee operations, sales and other duties. Kirby, 49, was often seen as a likely successor to American Airlines CEO Doug Parker. Instead, he will add airline-industry expertise to United’s management. ___ US consumer spending posts slower growth in July WASHINGTON (AP) — American consumers boosted spending at a slower pace in July, while their incomes accelerated slightly. Spending grew 0.3 percent in July following a 0.5 percent increase in June, the Commerce Department reported Monday. The slowdown had been expected given an earlier report that retail sales were flat in July. Economists are counting on solid gains in consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, to power overall growth in the second half of the year. ___ Banks lead gains on Wall Street on hopes for higher rates NEW YORK (AP) — Banks led the stock market higher Monday as investors anticipate that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates this year from their historically low levels. That could help banks recover from a long slump by making lending more profitable. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told a conference last week that the case for raising rates was strengthening given improvements in the economy. Raising interest rates from their rock-bottom levels, where they have been since the 2008 financial crisis, could be a good thing not only for markets but for savers. ___ FAA forecast: 600,000 commercial drones within the year WASHINGTON (AP) — There will be 600,000 commercial drone aircraft operating in the U.S. within the year as the result of new safety rules that opened the skies to them on Monday, according to a Federal Aviation Administration estimate. Commercial operators initially complained that the new rules would be too rigid. The agency responded by creating a system to grant exemptions to some of the rules for companies that show they can operate safely. On the first day the rules were in effect the FAA had already granted 76 exemptions, most of them to companies that want to fly drones at night. ___ Mondelez says it ended talks to buy Hershey NEW YORK (AP) — Mondelez says it has ended discussions to buy The Hershey Co, a combination that would have created a global powerhouse selling some of the world’s best known chocolates and snacks. Hershey said in June that it rejected a preliminary takeover bid from Mondelez International Inc. valued at roughly $22.3 billion. At the time, it said that the offer provided “no basis for further discussion.” A representative for Hershey did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. ___ FBI warns of possible state election-system hacks NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI is warning state officials to boost their election security in light of evidence that hackers breached related data systems in two states. In a confidential “flash” alert from its cyber division, first reported by Yahoo News and posted online by others, the FBI said it’s investigating the pair of incidents and advised states to scan their systems for specific signs of hacking. The FBI said Monday that it doesn’t comment on specific alerts, but added that it routinely sends out advisories to private industry about signs of cyber threats that it comes across in its investigations. ___ Pennsylvania firm launches Zika vaccine trial in Puerto Rico SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A Pennsylvania drug company announced Monday that it has launched a clinical trial of an experimental Zika vaccine in Puerto Rico, the part of the U.S. hardest hit by the mosquito-borne virus. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. will be testing its DNA-based vaccine candidate on 160 adult volunteers in Puerto Rico. If the results are promising, the company would meet with regulators next year to discuss plans to develop the vaccine, CEO J. Joseph Kim said. The search for a vaccine is particularly relevant in Puerto Rico, which as of Friday had reported more than 14,000 cases, including 1,244 among pregnant women. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.59 points, or 0.6 percent, to 18,502.99. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index climbed 11.34 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,180.38. The Nasdaq composite edged up 13.41 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,232.33. Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 66 cents to $46.98 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price oil internationally, lost 66 cents to $49.26 a barrel. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 5 cents to $1.47 a gallon, heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon and natural gas fell 2 cents to $2.85 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Today Apple has started sending press invites for its next grand unveiling event. And it's going to happen on September 7, just as rumored. The invites are very simple, as you can see below. The date is the most important part of the invite. Apple will out its next generation phones on that occasion. And while recent rumors have all converged on the fact that we'll see two iPhones this fall, not three, what they will be called is still sort of a mystery. Almost the entire year every leak and rumor referred to them as iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but there have also been a few mumblings betting on iPhone 6 SE and iPhone 6 SE Plus as the official monikers for the new devices. Regardless of what they'll be called, the new iPhones should arrive with a slightly altered design (moved antenna lines and all), a new A10 chipset, and maybe even water resistance. The Plus model gets a dual rear camera arrangement and perhaps also Smart Connector support. The 3.5mm headset jack will be gone from both, while their batteries may have grown quite a bit from their predecessors'. Since the rumored unveiling date turned out to be correct, the leaked September 9 start of pre-orders could pan out too, as well as the supposed September 16 release date.

The stock of the original Apple Watch is nearly depleted and yet no new Watches are made to replenish it. There are various leaks of the new hardware, too. The next Apple Watch is rumored to reuse the original design and come in 38 and 42 mm flavors. It will be adding GPS radio and probably enhanced processing capabilities. The latest report coming from China pictures the new battery for the 42mm model. The new unit has a capacity of 1.28 Wh or 334 mAh - that's 35% increase over the 246mAh battery in the original 42mm Watch. Apple Watch 2 (or more likely Watch S) will be announced on September 7 at a special Apple event, complementing the new iPhone 7 series. It will run on watchOS 3, but we are yet to discover more on its expanded capabilities besides GPS tracking.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: BUSINESS Apple is reportedly launching new MacBook Air and iMac in October Jordan Novet@jordannovet August 29, 2016 2:56 PM Tags: Apple, iMac, IPad, iPad Pro, MacBook Air, top-stories Above: The current, non-Retina MacBook Air. Image Credit: Apple Apple is planning a more expansive refresh of its Mac portfolio, with new MacBook Air and iMac models on the way, and they could arrive as soon as October, according to a new report. What’s more, Apple is also developing a new 5K display in partnership with LG, Bloomberg reported today, citing unnamed sources. The new Macs would be in addition to the previously rumored refreshed MacBook Pro featuring a touch bar. That device is expected to boast four USB-C ports, and sure enough, USB-C will be coming to the new MacBook Air line as well, Bloomberg said. The 2015 and 2016 MacBook have also featured USB-C, albeit with no other port beside a headphone jack. Consumers will be able to buy the new iMac with an AMD graphics processing unit (GPU), the new report said — that would put the new model on par with previous models. Of all Apple’s platforms, the Mac is the oldest, and it has not received as many major updates as iOS. Apple last refreshed the iMac and MacBook Air last year, although the changes were not very significant. Apple is set to refresh the iPhone next week. Also today Bloomberg reported that the iPad will see a software update in the first half of 2017, specifically letting users do more with the Apple Pencil, which has been limited to the iPad Pro. The report did not say anything about Mac Pro or Mac Mini updates coming in the near future. The former was last updated in 2013 and the latter in 2014.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it August 29, 2016 ECONOMY Consumer spending rises for 4th month Consumer purchases advanced for a fourth straight month in July, bolstered by stronger income gains, sending the biggest part of the U.S. economy to a solid third-quarter start. The 0.3 percent rise matched forecasts and followed a 0.5 percent increase the prior month that was revised up, a Commerce Department report showed Monday in Washington. Incomes rose 0.4 percent, the most in three months. Americans’ continued spending, supported by job growth and low fuel costs, is likely to support what economists project will be a rebound in expansion this quarter after the weakest first half since 2011. If another report on Friday shows robust job gains in August, it would further boost expectations for Federal Reserve policymakers to raise interest rates next month. Adjusted for the effect of price changes, spending increased 0.3 percent, exceeding the median estimate of economists for a 0.2 percent rise. The prior month’s advance was revised upward to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent. Purchases of durable goods, which include automobiles, increased 1.9 percent in July after adjusting for inflation, the biggest gain in three months. That followed a 0.9 percent advance. Spending on non-durable goods, which include gasoline, fell 0.1 percent, the first drop since February. Household outlays on services rose 0.2 percent after adjusting for inflation. The category includes tourism, legal help, health care, and personal-care items such as haircuts, and is typically difficult for the government to estimate accurately. Disposable income adjusted for inflation grew 0.4 percent, the most this year, after a 0.2 percent gain in June. Consumption accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.1 percent annualized rate from April through June, Commerce Department figures showed Friday. — Bloomberg News TECHNOLOGY Apple’s Irish tax bill could run into billions Apple is facing a potential tax bill running into billions of euros, with the European Union poised to release a finding into the company’s dealings in Ireland as soon as Tuesday, according to people familiar with the situation. The European Commission decision is expected to say Ireland provided the iPhone maker with illegal aid through a sweetheart deal in return for creating jobs in the nation, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Ireland has vowed to fight any adverse finding. Such a ruling might heighten tensions between Europe and the United States over taxation policies, with the United States having already complained that Europe is unfairly targeting American companies and threatening global tax reforms. In preliminary findings in 2014, European competition authorities said Apple’s tax arrangements were improperly designed to give the company a financial boost. There’s a range of estimates on how much Apple might have to pay. In a worst-case scenario, Apple may face a $19 billion bill if the government ultimately loses and is forced to recoup tax from the company, according to JPMorgan Chase analyst Rod Hall. The Irish Times reported earlier Monday that the figure might not be much more than 100 million euros ($112 million), although it later revised its estimate upwards. The European Commission declined to comment on a decision that’s pending or on the timing of its announcement. Apple said it had nothing to add to previous statements rejecting suggestions it received selective treatment from Irish officials. The ministry declined to comment. — Bloomberg News Also in Business ● Zhongwang USA, backed by Chinese aluminum magnate Liu Zhongtian, said Monday it will buy U.S. aluminum company Aleris Corp in a bet by the billionaire that the nascent U.S. automotive aluminum sector will be the industry’s next big growth market. The $2.33 billion deal comes as Liu and Zhongwang International Group, the parent of Zhongwang USA, are embroiled in a dispute over U.S. import duties. ● The share that the top 1 percent of earners in the United States take from total wages has almost doubled since the 1970s, and Alexey Gorn, a researcher at Bocconi University in Milan, suggests it may have something to do with the simultaneous rise of professional recruitment firms. In a paper, presented at last week’s European Economic Association conference in Geneva, he argues that at least 40 percent of top earners’ wage growth can be traced back to headhunters offering exclusive opportunities to high-skilled workers at the best firms — along with a paycheck that less-well-trained people won’t ever see. — From news services Coming Today ● 9 a.m.: The Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller index of home prices for June and the second quarter is released. ● 10 a.m.: The Conference Board releases the consumer confidence index for August. business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

Email | 29 Aug 2016 | Print  ExtraBITS for 29 August 2016 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, Apple announces the date of its next big media event, we look back at Tim Cook’s fifth anniversary as Apple’s CEO, and John Gruber reflects on the demise of the Vesper note-taking app. Apple Event Scheduled for 7 September 2016 -- Apple has sent out invitations for its fall media event, which will be held on 7 September 2016 at 10 AM PDT at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. We’ll be watching the event’s live stream and chatting with TidBITS readers in SlackBITS; feel free to join us! We expect to see new iPhone models and possibly an update to the Apple Watch, but we’re also hoping for some additional surprises. Read/post comments Charting Tim Cook’s 5-Year Anniversary as CEO -- As of this week, Tim Cook has been the permanent CEO of Apple for five years, which gives the punditocracy an excuse to opine ad nauseam about whether Cook is Apple’s best CEO ever or a poor excuse for Steve Jobs. Our take: let the numbers speak for themselves. Charts developed by Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research show just how Apple has evolved over the past five years. You can see just how dominant iPhone unit sales and revenues are, how the Services category is growing, the importance of China to Apple’s fortunes, and more. Read/post comments John Gruber’s Postmortem of Vesper -- It’s always fascinating to read an insider’s perspective, and doubly so when it comes from someone whose day job is industry analysis. That combination makes John Gruber’s postmortem of Vesper on Daring Fireball all the more interesting for those curious about what makes some apps succeed and others fail. Vesper was a note-taking app developed by Q Branch, a company made up of Gruber, designer Dave Wiskus, and developer Brent Simmons, who is well known for apps such as Glassboard, MarsEdit, and NetNewsWire. Gruber attributed Vesper’s failure to generate enough revenue to bad timing with regard to iOS 7, shipping the iPhone app before the Mac app, competition from Apple’s Notes, and not switching to a subscription model. His evaluation should be required reading for any developer considering making a productivity app for the Apple ecosystem.

The European Union will release documentation of Apple’s dealings with Ireland that would show “Ireland provided the iPhone maker with illegal aid through a sweetheart deal in return for creating jobs in the nation,” reports Bloomberg. The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, is the branch expected to release the damning evidence. The commission found that Apple was given an unfair advantage in Ireland in 2014, but the new documentation might make earlier claims of unfair competition actionable under international trade dispute mechanisms. The new document, consisting of 130 pages of a three-year investigation into Apple’s dealings in Ireland, looks specifically into “claims that two advance tax opinions issued by Dublin violated EU law by granting Apple an advantage not available to other companies,” reports FT. Both Apple and Ireland have publicly claimed innocence. The case revolves around the fact that governments should not give preferential treatment to some companies and not others. If Apple is charged, it could face up to $19 billion in back taxes. The largest penalty so far in the EU’s history was for EDF, the French energy group, which was penalized $1.5 billion. The ruling is reportedly set to call on Dublin to do a full tax reassessment of Apple. Apple has some 5,500 employees in its Irish plant, and says its taxes reflect the cost of production, distribution, and sales, according to Business Insider. Ireland’s finance ministry says “the government‘s case is very robust,” according to the FT. It added that “the minister (of finance) has indicated previously that any adverse ruling should be appealed in the European courts and will recommend that course to cabinet.” Follow Robert on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Attorneys representing the three Apple smartphone owners named as plaintiffs in the litigation asked that the case be granted class-action status to represent anyone in the United States who has bought an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus. "This action arises from Apple's concealment of a material design defect that causes the touchscreens on the iPhones to become unresponsive and fail for their essential purpose as smartphones," the civil complaint contended. The lawsuit accused Apple of refusing to repair iPhones free of charge despite knowing that a design flaw was a fault. Apple did not respond to an AFP request for comment. According to the lawsuit, chips that handle touchscreen input were not properly secured to logic boards and failed under normal wear-and-tear. "The internet is replete with examples of blogs and other websites where consumers have complained of the exact same Touchscreen Defect within the iPhones," the complaint maintained. The lawsuit accuses Apple of a litany of violations including fraud and breach of implied warranty, and goes on to demand unspecified cash damages along with attorneys fees. Damages sought in the suit include having the court order Apple to repair, recall, and/or replace the iPhones at issue.

Apple Seeds Beta 8 of macOS 10.12 Sierra to Devs, Public Beta 7 to the World GO The new Beta update is available in the Mac App Store Aug 29, 2016 21:15 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Immediately after announcing its upcoming September 7 event, where the Cupertino company should unveil the next iPhone and Apple Watch devices, Apple seeded the eighth and probably the last Beta of the soon-to-be-released macOS 10.12 Sierra operating systems for Macs. If you are a registered developer with an active and paid Apple Developer account, you should now be able to upgrade your computer to the macOS 10.12 Sierra Beta 8 update. In case you didn't know, it contains even more bug fixes and under-the-hood improvements since the Beta 7 build, which will further enhance the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac. But wait, if you are a public beta tester, Apple has also released the Public Beta 7 update for everyone else who is not a developer building apps for Macs, so you can also update your computers to the macOS 10.12 Sierra Public Beta 7 build right now via the Mac App Store. As usual, the new Beta of macOS Sierra comes hot on the heels of the eighth Beta/Public Beta 7 of iOS 10. macOS 10.12 Sierra launches in September 2016 Presuming that everything is in place, and Apple is now wrapping up the final details before the launch of the macOS 10.12 Sierra, iOS 10, tvOS 10, and watchOS 3 operating systems, we have all the reasons to believe that the Cupertino company will let the world upgrade their devices to this new OS versions after the September 7 event. Worst-case scenario, Apple will let us breathe new life into our old devices at the end of September, but that's highly improbable, as they've always pushed the final builds of their upcoming OSes shortly after the respective event was over, even if they didn't say anything about it. So see you, guys, on September 7 for the macOS Sierra install party! #macOS 10.12 Sierra Beta 8#macOS 10.12 Sierra Public Beta 7#macOS 10.12#macOS Sierra#Apple subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Releases iOS 10 Beta 8 to Developers and Public Beta 7 to Everyone Else Apple Releases iOS 9.3.5 to Fix Important Security Issues for iPhone and iPad Apple Seeds macOS 10.12 Sierra Beta 7 to Devs, Public Beta 6 to Everyone Else Apple Releases Surprise iOS 10 Public Beta 6 Update, Beta 7 Build for Developers New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    macOS 10.12 Sierra Beta 8 released New Mac Apps Free Download Manager: Download manager and accelerator that can handle HTTP, FTP, and BitTorrent protocols, while also being able to download YouTube content CheckMark Payroll 2017: Enables you to do-it-yourself payrolls and is the ideal solution for accountants, small businesses and professional payroll services.

Apple to Unveil iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2, iOS 10, macOS Sierra on September 7 GO watchOS 3 and tvOS 10 should also be released Aug 29, 2016 21:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  It's official! Apple has sent invitations to various news outlets in the US to its upcoming fall event on September 7, as initial rumored, where the Cupertino company should unveil a bunch of new operating systems and devices. It is no secret that Apple has been working for some time on updated versions of its iOS, Mac OS, tvOS, and watchOS operating systems for iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, iMacs, Macbook Pro, Macbook Air, Apple Watch, and Apple TV devices, respectively. All of these upcoming OSes have received up to eight Beta developments builds that have been seeded since early summer 2016 to registered developers and public beta testers alike. Apple had already announced the new features that will land in the final releases of iOS 10, macOS 10.12 Sierra, watchOS 3, and tvOS 10 operating systems in about a week from the moment of writing this article, during its WWDC (Worldwide Developer Conference) 2016 event that took place in June. That's why there shouldn't be any surprises except for the official release date, as some rumors now say we'll get these updates at the end of September, and not on September 7, as expected. iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 to launch on September 7 With Apple, we never really know what to expect from its upcoming events, but based on their history, the Cupertino company should introduce a bunch of new devices, which include a new iPhone and Apple Watch. Word is that these new devices will be called iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, as well as Apple Watch 2. The specs of the former have already been leaked online this week, and if we are to believe them, there won't be any major changes. Of course, these devices will be available for pre-order shortly after the September 7 announcement, coming to select countries before the end of September, and to the rest of the world later this fall. What else could Apple announce during its forthcoming September 7 event? That we can't tell for sure, but we do know that the "See you on the 7th" event will take place at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, at 10:00 a.m.. #Apple#iPhone 7#Apple Watch 2#September 7#iOS 10 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Apple's September 7 invite new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Designed by Apple, Built by Robots: iPhone Maker Gets Rid of Human Workers more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

MacOS 10.12 Sierra packs some relatively major features such as Auto Unlock via Apple Watch, Apple Pay via iPhone, and Siri finally makes it debut on the Mac. The update is currently available for both developers and public beta testers.  It’s not recommended to install this beta unless you’re an actual developer as there’s no reverting back without data loss. Those with access to the macOS developer or public beta can download the update now in the Mac App Store.

But the device will pack better hardware, and bring over one massive change. The iPhone 7 will be the first iPhone to ship without a standard 3.5mm audio jack, and we still have no idea how Apple will deal with the matter. One solution would be wireless headphones, which Apple is reportedly working on. A new leak shows what appears to be Bluetooth EarPods that would ship with the iPhone 7. But we hope – and think – it’s fake. DON’T MISS: A closer look at the NSO Group, the organization behind the most advanced iPhone spyware ever released The following images were posed online by @the_malignant, a mysterious Twitter account that keeps leaking details about unreleased devices, including the iPhone 7, but the new pictures are rather dubious. The person who supposedly had access to these many iPhone 7 retail boxes, complete with wireless EarPods, didn’t even bother to take the headphones out for closer inspection. And there’s nothing to suggest these EarPods will look anything like the current wired EarPods that ship with iPhones. Not to mention that there doesn’t appear to be space for a second EarPod in the box. https://twitter.com/the_malignant/status/770024716983828480 The boxes seem shady, and that iPhone 7 that sits on a box isn’t necessarily the real thing either. It appears to be a clone similar to the one showed in the following images, all labeled as fakes a few days ago, by the same @the_malignant – check that QR code in the top right corner that keeps appearing in these pictures: https://twitter.com/the_malignant/status/769440570318151680 Apple will unveil its iPhone 7 on September 7th, according to recent reports, at which point we'll learn more details about the way it wants to solve issues caused by the removal of the headphone jack.

Websites across the world have announced that Apple is holding one of its famous conferences on September 7, but bosses at Apple are keeping tight-lipped about what it entails. Historically, Apple has announced new iPhone models in September - sending the rumour mill into overdrive. Although this is by no means a definite - tech websites from around the world have been invited to an Apple event at their HQ in California on September 7. For the past five years running Apple has used September events to launch new products - so those of you holding out for a new phone had best wait until then. It’s unlikely that Apple’s main iPhone 7 will be any easier on the wallet than past models. But its launch could see Apple finally change the thing that annoys people most about the iPhone. Rumours suggest that Apple is planning to ditch its 16GB storage option in favour of a more generous 32GB base model. The current iPhone 6s and 6s plus lineup offers customers a choice of 16GB, 64GB, or 128GB storage options. However, supply chain investigations by Kevin Wang, director of market research at respected analyst firm IHS Technology, suggest the iPhone 7 base model will come with with 32GB of storage. If true, we could expect other models with larger storage - 64GB and 128GB most likely - to stick with the £619 and £699 prices. While most people expect Apple’s next iPhone to be called the iPhone 7, some leaks suggest that Apple may opt for the name “iPhone 6SE” instead. The rumour comes from German tech news site Apfelpage, which spoke to Chinese supply chain sources who claim to have seen finished packaging and labels with the new name. Other rumours suggest the next iPhone will have a larger camera lens and a USB Type C connection at the bottom that will double up as the new headphone slot. The model obtained in an online video appears to closely match these rumours and there’s no 3.5mm headphone port on the base of the handset. It also has the repositioned antenna on the corners of the handset rather than across the back. But in terms of size and design, the alleged iPhone 7 looks very similar to the existing iPhone 6s. One online mock-up comes in a deep metallic blue tone - so could Apple be planning to expand its range of colours for the iPhone 7 range? Designer Martin Hajek has created several 3D renders of what he thinks the iPhone 7 could look like. Rather than the traditional Space Grey colour, Hajek has taken the Space Black finish from the Apple Watch and applied it to the phone. His realistic-looking renders also show how many of the iPhone 7 rumours might look if they were implemented in a finished product. Apple issues global IOS update after iPhone spyware alert The most persistent of rumours is that Apple will remove the headphone jack from the new iPhone and use the newer USB-C connection instead. Martin Hajek has added a pair of USB-C capable headphones in one of his shots to illustrate what that may look like. © Provided by Liverpool Echo Meanwhile an insight coming from Deutsche Bank analysts, by way of Business Insider, suggests that Apple will include a special adaptor along with the iPhone 7 instead of a pair of headphones. “A Lightning-to-audio dongle included with the iPhone 7 - not a pair of Lightning headphones,” reports the tech site. That would mean instead of plugging your headphones directly into the phone, you have to carry around an adapter with you everywhere you go. Or, use wireless headphones. We tried the new UberEXEC - and here is how it went Because the new iPhone will likely arrive with Apple’s iOS 10 software and an upgraded processor, it will offer even more power and better efficiency. Likely to be boasting a processor called the A10 chip, the iPhone 7 will surely pack more power - although it’s anyone’s guess as to how much this will translate into actual usage. According to Korean site ETNews, Apple is currently in discussion with arch-rival Samsung over supplying OLED screens for its next phone. This would shift the display over from the current LED model to a much more vibrant OLED screen. Such a move would likely make for better colour reproduction for videos and games, but might hamper battery life. 5 things we learned from Apple's launch event including the iPhone SE, iPad Pro and Apple Watch © Provided by Liverpool Echo A photo claiming to be of the iPhone 7 Plus has surfaced on Chinese website Bastille Post, adding fuel to rumours that the smartphone will feature a dual-lens camera. The picture shows a protruding, pill-shaped enclosure - which differs from the two separate circular camera openings depicted in some other online renderings. Meanwhile, a video claiming to show the flagship iPhone 7’s transparent case has been uploaded to YouTube by Unbox Therapy, showing a large cut out for the rear camera. The advantage of a dual camera is that it could allow iPhone users to snap SLR quality photos and 3D images on a smartphone. Last year, Apple bought an Israeli smart camera company called LinX Computational Imaging, which builds smartphone and tablet cameras with sensors that provide depths of field. The technology also allows for high quality images to be captured in low-light conditions. The misery of dropping your iPhone down the toilet could soon be over as the latest rumours suggest Apple’s next iPhone could be completely waterproof. According to a report in the China-based Commercial Times, Apple is working on a new “compound material” that repels water for use in its forthcoming smartphone. This new material will also reportedly remove the need for the two strips of plastic that run across the back of the current generation of iPhones to allow mobile signals to reach the antennas. This suggests that the body of the next iPhone may not be made from metal at all, but some other kind of material that allows radio waves to pass through it. Industrial designer Herman Haidin has taken a stab at predicting the next version of Apple’s handset and reckons the American tech giant could use a material known as ‘liquidmetal’. Apple acquired a patent for liquidmetal back in 2010 and uses it to make the small SIM ejector tool that comes in each iPhone box. The material itself is a type of alloy that’s tougher and more water-resistant than typical aluminium.

Apple will hold its next special event September 7 by Jeff Kampman  3:11 PM on August 29, 2016 Apple sent out a flurry of invitations to the tech press today that heralds another in a long line of its special events. This latest event will be held September 7. The tagline this time around—"See you on the 7th"—almost certainly means we'll be introduced to a new generation of iPhone hardware early next month.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps Here's what to expect from Apple's event next week HAYLEY TSUKAYAMA Last updated 08:28, August 30 2016 REUTERS The main speculation is that the company is going to break with its normal upgrade rhythm this year. Apple has confirmed it will have an event on Thursday, September 8 (NZ time) at which it is expected to introduce a new iPhone and the next version of the Apple Watch. While Apple never says what it's planning before it announces new products, this is the time of year for a new iPhone and there have been plenty of reports indicating what's expected for the next smartphone. The main speculation is that the company is going to break with its normal upgrade rhythm this year. In the past, Apple's alternated between offering major updates for the iPhone and smaller, more incremental updates. According to that schedule, Apple should be offering a significant update to the iPhone this year, and call it the "iPhone 7". The event will take place at San Francisco's Bill Graham Civic Auditorium at 5am NZ time. READ MORE: * Apple's iPhone 7 purportedly shown off in new video * Will Apple drop the headphone plug on iPhone 7? * iPhone 7: What to expect from Apple's next device But reports from analysts and other Apple watchers indicate that Apple's actually not going to offer that much of an overhaul to its phones, but will instead likely introduce two phones that look an awful lot like its current iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. A bigger change to the device is actually now expected next year, in 2017. Apple is expected to give the guts of the phone its typical overhaul, with faster chips, a better camera and maybe a larger battery, according to multiple reports. The larger version of the iPhone, which will probably be called the iPhone 7 Plus if Apple sticks with its conventions, may have two cameras on the back of the phone. Ad Feedback Despite not being a "major" upgrade on the scale of years past, Apple is expected to make at least one big change: many reports have said that Apple will do away with its headphone jack. Instead, reports have said, the company is expected to use the space now occupied by the headphone jack for a second speaker. Headphones for the iPhone may instead work with the lightning port on the bottom of the phone, which is currently only used for charging and data transfer. That would make the standard headphones that users have had for years completely useless with a new iPhone. Since the rumour first broke, there's been lots of pushback from those who say it's not a consumer-friendly move. That includes Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who said last week that Apple shouldn't ditch the headphone jack unless it also improves the sound quality over Bluetooth wireless headphones. Overall, Apple's iPhone sales in 2016 haven't been as strong as they were last year, and that's worried many investors who know that the majority of Apple's money comes from iPhone sales. If the reports are true, Apple is unlikely to get a sales bump on the scale that it normally does when releasing a overhauled iPhone. For example, those still using the iPhone 6 (or older) may find themselves unwilling to pay for more incremental updates, and may hold out for another year until the next model. Then again, Apple is nothing if not surprising -- so hopeful phone buyers shouldn't go into mourning just yet.  - The Washington Post Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: New Zealand Fire Service uses fireproof GoPro to create world first Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines Fear not, droids won't kill jobs World's first Street View skydive McDonald's hungry for NZ tech Google app scans your photo memories Tech you can expect in 2017 Serena arrives with fiance in tow App for checking moles How to prevent ads tracking you Apple dominates holiday activations Avatar-style robot takes first steps Lesser-known tips for iPhones The big tech takeaway for 2016 Mac buyers' battery freak out What to do with your old phone How to save data on holiday Ad Feedback Most popular Viewed Shared Commented 'Disgusted' residents plot to catch boy racers in the act The most deadly stretch of water in the world: Why this burbling English creek has a '100 per cent' fatality rate Grieving father happy his daughter's murderer is dead War on Melbourne's hipsters gets hairier as cafe vandalism turns nasty Woman seriously burned while trying to start her car in Whangarei United Airlines New Year's Day flight diverts to Auckland Lindy Chamberlain's dingo story wasn't believed but she was released anyway Teenager kicked off bus for carrying $20 note Surfer's close shave with huge wave in Portugal Homeless Hamilton couple 'camped by the river to be together' New Zealand's greatest gifts: Doubtful Sound Bach living: A stunning Malborough Sounds bach Bad weather and slow trade as Kaikoura reopens after quake - but it's a start Southland's Brian Cartwright builds Barbarian V8 Softail motorbike Latin McDonald's rollout cheers NZ digital marketing firm Plexure Reserve Bank stress tests show how banks would react to economic armageddon Dog attacks family trying to dress it in Christmas jumper, leaving three injured Knife-wielding thief demands cigarettes in early morning Tahunanui robbery Ditching sugar is a new year diet that might actually work Record-breaking year of earthquakes: 32,828 quakes hit New Zealand in 2016 special offers Ad Feedback National World Business Technology Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Stuff.co.nz About Us | Contact Us | View Mobile Site Subscribe Text | Follow us on Facebook and Twitter | Newspapers | Magazine subscriptions | RSS - Top Stories Services Stuff Fibre | Newspapers in Education | Advertising | Careers Classifieds Death Notices | Celebrations | Newspaper Classifieds Newspapers Dominion Post | The Press | Waikato Times | Auckland Now | Sunday News | Sunday Star-Times   Marlborough Express | Manawatu Standard | Nelson Mail | Southland Times | Taranaki Daily News | Timaru Herald Other Sites Indexed | Essential Mums | Cuisine | NZ House & Garden | NZ Fishing News | NZ Life & Leisure | NZ Gardener | Fairfax Archives Breaking news?

The European Commission decision is expected to say Ireland provided the iPhone maker with illegal aid through a sweetheart deal in return for creating jobs in the nation, the people said on condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Ireland has vowed to fight any adverse finding. Such a ruling might heighten tensions between Europe and the U.S. over taxation policies, with the U.S. having already complained that Europe is unfairly targeting American companies and threatening global tax reforms. In preliminary findings in 2014, European competition authorities said Apple’s tax arrangements were improperly designed to give the company a financial boost. There’s a range of estimates on how much Apple might have to pay. In a worst-case scenario, Apple may face a $19 billion bill if the government ultimately loses and is forced to recoup tax from the company, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Rod Hall. The Irish Times reported earlier on Monday that the figure might not be much more than 100 million euros ($112 million), although it later revised its estimate upwards. The European Commission declined to comment on a decision that’s still pending or on the timing of its announcement. Apple said it had nothing to add to previous statements rejecting suggestions it received selective treatment from Irish officials. The ministry declined to comment. Two Rulings “A state aid ruling against Ireland is likely to bring the country’s corporation tax regime back into focus,” said Dermot O’Leary, an economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. “However, the commission investigation relates to two rulings given to Apple in 1991 and 2007. So, a critical issue will be how the final decision relates to the current Irish tax code or to previously amended policy.” The commission in January ordered Belgium to recover about 700 million euros in illegal tax breaks from at least 35 companies, including Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and BP Plc. And last year, for example, Starbucks Corp. was ordered to pay 30 million euros in back taxes to the Dutch government. As of last month, Apple had $232 billion in cash, with about $214 billion of that being held overseas. The U.S. Treasury Department has pushed back hard against the state aid probes, most recently with an unusual white paper that said the Brussels-based commission had overextended its legal authority and threatened global tax reforms. U.S. Response “The United States is committed to tax fairness,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. “We want to make sure the kinds of agreements we reach with other countries are not manipulated to allow companies to shirk responsibilities.” Still, the Commission-ordered repayments could wind up costing American taxpayers under U.S. tax law, and benefit EU taxpayers, the U.S. has said. That’s because multinational corporations with large foreign operations, like Apple, are allowed to claim a credit against their U.S. tax bills for any foreign taxes paid, an offset that reduces their tax payments to U.S. coffers. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew first raised formal objections to the probes in a letter last February to top EC and EU officials, emphasizing so-called unfair targeting of U.S. companies -- a charge that European regulators deny -- and a potential damping effect on direct foreign investment.

The European Commission is set to rule this week on whether the tech giant was given unfair state aid by being allowed to negotiate its tax rate. The ruling could see Apple paying taxes for the last ten years - with one estimate from JP Morgan putting the sum at €19 billion euro. Authorities in Brussels have been investigating an alleged 'sweetheart' deal between Ireland and Apple since 2013. Ireland has always insisted its tax rate is based on law, which makes it highly transparent - but the Commission says it has evidence that in 1991 and 2007, Ireland reached a private agreement with Apple, effectively to agree how much tax Apple should pay. The complex loophole used by Apple - and many other firms - was shut under Budget 2015, which included a clampdown on so-called 'stateless corporations'. Before then, under Irish law, a firm was only liable for tax wherever its main centre of business is - but under American law, a firm is only liable for tax in whatever country it is registered. This situation meant that Apple's global operations firm - with its main business operations in the USA, filtering worldwide revenue through a firm registered in Ireland - didn't have to pay tax in either. And with other internal trading between Apple firms rolled in, its effective corporate tax rate in Ireland has often been less than 1%. Sinn Féin says the decision should not be appealed - but that before any decision is taken, the Dáil's finance committee should be recalled to discuss the outcome.

Will this change with the release of the iPhone 7? As reported by Forbes contributor Brook Crothers, Apple's iPhone 7 may be the saving grace that the company is cooking up for consumers. The report referenced a post from TechnoBuffalo about the topic regarding Galaxy Note 7 being a way better smartphone than any iPhone. The author of the post singled out each and every spec that the Note 7 has and any iPhone lacks. However, the iPhone 7 aims to change all these. Every year, Apple does a very good job of hyping all of their gadgets and devices, and the iPhone 7 will not be an exception. Crothers pointed out one survey data that proves where the consumers interest still lies. A data from Fluent showed that consumers really aren't looking for curved displays or iris scanners, which are features that are only present with the more recent Galaxy smartphone series from Samsung. What the consumers were looking for was the increased storage capacity for the iPhone 7 gaining 22 percent and improved battery life and a better processor also takes a huge chunk in the survey chart. More data can be found by checking the graph here and here. The most noticeable figure in the survey was when consumers were asked about a curved display. All in, 60 percent of those who answered the survey are not interested in such idea. As the survey result suggested, consumers mostly want a more functional with improved functions for the iPhone in general. iOS offers a large number of Apps, which aren't available on Android and this could be enough for Apple to keep a steady flow of returning customers for the iPhone 7. © 2015 - 2017Mobile & Apps, All rights reserved.

No Problem! The Cupertino based giant is due to announce its latest iteration of flagship in the coming weeks and it will come with an added surprise to some users Published By: Patrick Arruda on August 29, 2016 03:33 pm EST Facebook Google+ Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon The issue about the headphone jack which could well be missing in the new iPhone 7, expected to be launched in the coming weeks, has been publically criticized even by Apple Inc.’s Co-Founder, Steve Wozniak. However, does the matter actually have any substance? We look into the situation. The general mood around the company ditching the headphone jack for a lightening connector has been negative with the co-founder leading the voices of disapproval calling the use of an adapter to incorporate the connector into a headphone jack - an inconvenience. Mr. Wozniak also believes that the move will see a lot of customers ditching the new variant as the adapter doesn’t really make any sense as people will keep losing it all the time. However, we believe the company is looking towards the future. The technology which the company wants its customers to use is wireless, and we know it will be the one to stay in the near future. We have also seen the same move by Motorola with their latest phones having no headphone jack and come with a USB-C to 3.5mm converter. The claims of Mr. Wozniak might be true at the moment as the wireless headsets might not be able to give you the same quality of sound you’d like right now. But, the technology is getting there and it won’t be long if a big company such as Apple advocates the use of wireless technology in its products. Wireless headsets have also been getting cheaper as the technology gets more common as time progresses. According to a research conducted by NPD, Bluetooth headset sales have surpassed wired headphones in the first half of 2016 with prices also decreasing by 5%. The companies, who make the headsets, are renowned companies such as Beats, LG, Bose, Jaybird, Skullcandy which have been making wired headphones for almost as long as we can remember. There are also claims about the headsets not lasting as long due to battery problems. Companies have started looking into ways to integrate fast charging into the headsets so that as little as 10 minutes of charge would give you around 30 minutes of playback. So the companies are already working on solutions for your problems before you’ve actually had the chance to have them. However, if you still can’t get your head around the much expected move, you could be better off sticking to the previous variants of the phone, the iPhone 6S, 6S Plus or the iPhone SE.

The rumors turned out to be true. Apple is indeed unveiling the new iPhone 7 on September 7. Today, Apple has sent out invites to the media for an event on September 7 at 10am PDT. Don't Miss: NES Classic Alternatives are Cheaper The Apple media event will take place in the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. Apple is live streaming the event again. The page for the video stream is already live on apple.com. Apple fans always try to read into the design of the Apple invite. The colored light spots are likely a hint at the new dual lens camera. Despite the event being on the 7th, the new iPhone might not be called iPhone 7. Sticky rumors say it could be called iPhone 6 SE. The iPhone 7 aka iPhone 6SE will feature besides the new A10 CPU, up to 256GB storage, improved cameras and an improved iPhone 6 design. The home button is likely going to be touch sensitive. Much has leaked about the iPhone 7 and not much is left for surprise, besides which models will be getting the dual lens camera and what can it actually do. Apple is also expected to unveil the new Apple Watch 2 with GPS and Altimeter at the September 7 event.

The decision, which is likely to generate a fierce backlash from Dublin, Silicon Valley and Washington, will be Brussels’ biggest attack on alleged tax avoidance by US multinationals to date and is likely to trigger a quick appeal from both Apple and the Irish government. Margethe Vestager, Europe’s competition commissioner, is expected to declare that two deals struck in 1991 and 2007 between Apple and the Irish state broke EU competition law, giving the iPhone maker a competitive advantage not enjoyed by others. Although the amount in question is unclear, it is expected that Apple will be ordered to pay more than €1bn in taxes to Ireland to account for the alleged shortfall. The commission is expected to recommend a figure, although it will be up to the Irish state itself to calculate one. The company, which books its international sales in Ireland, allowing it to build up a $215bn (£165bn) overseas cash pile, argues that it should pay tax on its profits when it repatriates them to the US. The ruling follows a two-year investigation and a series of inquiries into alleged sweetheart deals between European states and American multinationals. In an unprecedented attack last week, the US Treasury accused the European Commission of trying to act like a “supranational tax authority” and said its actions were undermining global tax reform.

 More than 86% of the world’s iPhones can still be hacked with just a text Paul Szoldra Aug. 29, 2016, 4:29 PM 23,862 facebook linkedin twitter email print Thomson Reuters More than 86% of Apple iPhones in the world are apparently still vulnerable to a security flaw that allows a hacker to completely take over the device with just a text message, according to data from mobile and web analytics firm MixPanel. A surprising number of people have not yet updated the iPhone's mobile operating system — despite an urgent warning to do so coming from Apple last week — in light of a major security problem the company was forced to correct in iOS 9.3.5. According to MixPanel's report, which relies on partners sharing the version of iOS people are using to download their apps, only about 11% of users have updated to the latest version of iOS, while about 2% of people are on the beta version of iOS 10, which is also protected from the security issue. That means more than 86% of iOS users are still vulnerable to a malicious tool called "Pegasus," an impossible-to-detect software that can hack an iPhone using nothing more than a text message.  Apple's developer website, which was last updated on August 15, said 13% of users were using a version of iOS 8 or earlier. The website does not break out individual builds, so it's unclear what version of iOS 9 the other 87% reported are using. A spokesperson for the company declined to offer more specifics. Anything below the latest version, 9.3.5, is vulnerable to this kind of attack. Researchers Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton of Citizen Lab worked with Lookout Security to discover and document the flaw, which was disclosed last Wednesday. It allows an attacker to install sophisticated spying tools that can activate a person's camera and microphone, track their movements, and log all messages. They called it a "Trident," since it used three "zero-day" vulnerabilities — bugs that were unfixed and unknown — which Apple had to scramble to fix. The researchers disclosed the problem to Apple before publishing their findings, and the company issued an urgent update to iOS. People who install Apple's new iOS 9.3.5 version will no longer be vulnerable to this issue, and the company is urging all its users to immediately update.  You can update your iPhone by going to Settings > General > Software Update.

Home News Entertainment & Events Movies & TV Dining Music & Arts Lifestyle Home News Entertainment & Events Movies & TV Dining Music & Arts Lifestyle Lifestyle Apple announces media event for highly anticipated iPhone 7 By Amanda Cooper | August 29, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share 0 comments We have been hearing about the iPhone 7 since the iPhone 6 came out. With teasers of new features, updated storage, and a sleeker design, we have all been awaiting the release of the newest Apple creation. It looks like we are about to finally put the rumors to rest because Apple has finally released media invites to the launch of the new iPhone 7. The event will be held at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on Wednesday, September 7th.  Apple will unveil its newest phone and discuss the newest features and updated design. The event could also be the host to discuss the newest MacBooks and a second generation Apple Watch. Pre orders for the phone will begin a couple days after the media launch, and not long after that, Apple lovers will start lining up to get their hands on the newest Apple device in stores. Rumors for the past year have surfaced that the new phone will no longer have a headphone jack, and that all headphones going forward will need to be wireless. Other rumors include a waterproof phone, discarding the home button, and better lenses and imaging for the camera. Many people are hoping for better battery life, smaller devices, new colors, and higher storage for the new phone, but we are guessing fans will be happy either way with any new features Apple decided to integrate (but maybe not the headphone jack…). Along with the newest phone, many people are awaiting the newest iOS 10 software update for all Apple phones. The newest updates could range from different internal designs for the phones to new features and apps. Starting on September 7th, we will all start to really see what the anticipated iPhone 7 will feature, and most importantly when we can get our hands on one.

As expected, the event will take place on September 7. Like last year, the iPhone event will be at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. Image: Apple The company is expected to unveil the iPhone 7. There are also reports we could see an update to the MacBook Pro line (it's about time) and even Apple Watch. Really though, we're expecting this to be about the iPhone, as is the early September ritual. Apple is widely expected to be getting rid of the headphone jack, something even Steve Wozniak is annoyed about. But I'm very curious to hear about Apple has to say about the benefits of a headphone-jack free iPhone, if it indeed gets announced. And this is fun: Gizmodo will actually be there live at the event, bringing you all the latest news and information.

It forces telcos to retain metadata on mobile and broadband users for at least two years. The data would assist in criminal and terrorism investigations. Now the Government wants to open the data up to be used for civil lawsuits. It called for public to comment on the issue right before Christmas (cheeky bastards) and public comment submissions close January 13. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter? Subscribe Have a tip?

New iPhone, expected tomorrow, will ditch headphone jack Chris Keall Wednesday September 7, 2016 11 Share Apple's current lineup: The iPhone 6s Plus, 6s and SE Play NBR radio on Will you buy an iPhone 7? Yes 28% No, it doesn't tempt me from my current iPhone 44% No, I'll stick with my Android 28% Total votes: 693 UPDATE: US media reports say Apple's new iPhone, due to be unveiled tomorrow morning NZT, will ditch its headphone jack. It's said that earbuds will ship with the new iPhone that will plug into its Lightning port (hitherto only used for charging or connecting to a computer). Apple will immediately start selling an adapter for connecting a standard 3.5mm headphone to a Lightning port, stories say. Punters will also have the option to shell out for Bluetooth wireless headphones. Leaks also indicate the "iPhone 7" (as it may or may not be called) will have a second camera, which is said to assist with zoom. There will be two models, with the dual camera restricted to the larger "iPhone 7 Plus". Also expect to see a bump in minimum onboard storage from 16GB to 32GB, a "click-less home button" that registers pressure but doesn't physically move, and a faster processor (the better to power that dual camera). One analyst says the new model will also get IPX7 waterproofing (that is the same as the Apple Watch and the ill-fated Samsung Galaxy Note 7. In terms of colours, the current rose gold, gold, and silver models will remain, apparently, but space gray will be replaced by a "dark black" option and a separate "piano black" model with a glossy finish. "Piano black" will initially be restricted to higher-end models. EARLIER: New iPhone tipped as Apple sends invites to Sept 7 event: what to expect Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone — and possibly the second generation of the Apple Watch — at a September 7 (Sept 8 NZT) event in San Francisco. As usual, the company has kept invites vague, but year-in, year-out a new iPhone has been announced around this time. In recent years, Apple has also followed a two-year pattern of a major upgrade every second year, with a tweaked model in between. Thus, the September 7 event should be a big-bang "iPhone 7" upgrade. But the The Wall Street Journal says Apple will break its cycle and only introduce subtle changes at the Monday-week preview (a faster processor, a bump from 16GB to 32GB onboard memory for the entry-level model, a better camera and a new dark blue colour are tipped). If so, it will disappoint fans. The company's last major iPhone overhaul was in 2014, when the company super-sized its display with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (which were followed by the 6s, 6s Plus and the smaller SE in 2015). The Journal reckons Apple is holding off on major iPhone changes until next year, which will be the handset's 10th anniversary? New Apple Watch? It's also possible that Apple will preview the Apple Watch 2 on September 7 (the first model was first demo'd two years ago and has now been in the market for around 18 months. The rumour mill holds the second-generation will have a similar form factor. A GPS chip f
