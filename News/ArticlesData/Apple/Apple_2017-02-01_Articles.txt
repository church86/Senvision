Courtesy Okanagan Specialty Fruits Genetically engineered crops are nothing new. But emerging technology that allows scientists to alter plants more precisely and cheaply is taking genetically engineered plants from the field to the kitchen. The first version of the Arctic Apple, a genetically modified Golden Delicious, is headed for test markets in the Midwest in February, according to the company that produced it. It is the first genetically engineered apple, altered so that when it is cut, it doesn't turn brown from oxidation. Okanagan Specialty Fruits, based in British Columbia, Canada, wouldn't say exactly where the apples will first be sold, but says the target consumers are those interested in convenience. "The rapid expansion of the fresh-cut industry – bagged carrots, ready-made salads – has led to explosive growth of fresh cut produce," says Neal Carter, president of the company. "I can cut this up for my kid's lunch box ... and it doesn't go brown and they'll actually eat it." The Arctic Apple is one of the first foods often termed a "genetically modified organism" (GMO) to be marketed to consumers, not at farmers. And it's a sign of how the science of genetic engineering is evolving. The first genetically engineered crops were global commodities like corn, soybeans and cotton. They were "transgenic," meaning they were resistant to pesticides or insects after scientists transferred new DNA into the plants. "We were taking DNA sequences from another, often non-plant species, and moving it into plants," says Sally Mackenzie, a plant geneticist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. In contrast, new crops are "cisgenic." They work within a plant species' own genome. "The next generation of technologies, those being implemented now — including the new apple – we're not introducing foreign DNA any longer," Mackenzie says. The Arctic Apple uses a technology called RNA interference, sometimes called gene silencing. The target is the gene in the apple that controls production of the enzyme that makes it turn brown. When scientists add an extra strand of RNA, that gene is effectively switched off, or silenced. "We're basically down-regulating a gene that's already within that apple," Mackenzie says. "So I see that as entirely different. And I think it's important for the average consumer to recognize technologies have moved on." Advances like gene silencing and other gene editing methods, like CRISPR technology, make biotech plant-breeding cheaper and more precise than the first generation of genetically engineered crops. New technologies are also less expensive for companies when it comes to federal regulations, as the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration require fewer costly tests. Huge companies like Monsanto have dominated the industry, Mackenzie says, in part because of the high cost of regulations. Old biotech crops were aimed at big commodities in large part because it was a sure way to recoup that investment. Engineered plants that don't introduce new genes don't face the same regulatory hurdles. Groups critical of GMO technology want to see stronger regulations in order to evaluate potential long-term impacts of biotech crops on health and the environment. Federal agencies are reviewing their rules around GMOs to catch up with the technology. Under the current regulatory structure, however, it is more economically viable, Mackenzie says, for smaller biotech companies to market their own innovations. "You're going to see more and more traits coming out that are really consumer friendly, designed to respond to consumer demand," Mackenzie says. Corn will still get plenty of attention from plant breeders, but more companies may shift their focus from field to fridge. Most genetically engineered crops are processed into ingredients in foods, so when we eat them they are a few steps removed from the field – think soybean oil in salad dressing or corn syrup in soda. When the Arctic Apple hits the produce aisle, however, it will be one of the first GMOs to reach consumers directly, but it is not the only one. A virus-resistant Rainbow papaya is already on the shelf. So is Simplot's bruise-resistant russet, called the Innate potato. The fruit company Del Monte has approval for a pink pineapple engineered to carry more lycopene, an antioxidant that supports the body's defense system. The labels on packages of Arctic Apples won't say much about GMOs. They will have a tell-tale snowflake logo, and a QR code that can be scanned with a smartphone to reach a website with information about the science. That fits within the framework of a GMO labeling law passed by Congress last year, but it makes genetic engineering in food less obvious than many consumer groups have called for. The vast majority of consumers support clear labels on foods that contain GMO ingredients, just as the vast majority of scientists agree that they are safe to eat. For stores that may sell biotech fruits and vegetables, it pays to be up front with shoppers that these foods are genetically engineered. "Transparency is what everything is about," says Joan Driggs, editorial director of Progressive Grocer which covers the grocery business. "Any retailer or manufacturer has to be transparent with their customer." The big question for the biotech industry: Once consumers know how these apples are created, will they care? The Arctic Apple's test run will last through March. Okanagan Specialty Fruits expects a wider commercial release this fall.

Apple soared after it said iPhone sales improved in its latest quarter. Stocks jumped in morning trading after payroll provider ADP said hiring by private employers grew stronger in January. Bond prices climbed. But the market's gains thinned, partly because investors sold shares of companies that pay big dividends as bond yields rose. Stocks briefly turned higher after the Fed's announcement, but that also faded. The only constant was the big gain for Apple, which pushed technology companies higher. The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged, just as investors expected. The central bank noted that the job market is getting stronger and inflation is gradually rising, but said it wants more time to monitor the economy. That's what investors expected. Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, noted that the central bank just increased rates in December and the Trump administration's spending and fiscal plans still haven't been spelled out. "They'll wait until they actually know what's going to happen," she said of the Fed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.85 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,890.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.68 points to 2,279.55. The Nasdaq composite, which has a high concentration of technology companies, gained 27.86 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,642.65. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks dipped 0.60 points to 1,361.23. Most stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange fell. Apple made its biggest one-day jump six months after its first-quarter profit and sales were better than analysts expected. The company said consumers snapped up its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and that ended the first-ever slump in iPhone sales. Apple stock rose $7.44, or 6.1 percent, to $128.79. Apple was singlehandledly responsible for the Dow gain and it helped take technology stocks higher. Investors haven't focused on company earnings recently because of the flood of political news and other factors, but Warne said results like Apple's will help the market. "The fact that we're seeing solid earnings and they're coming in better than expected ... will help sustain stocks over time," she said. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices reported a profit when analysts expected a loss, and its sales were greater than expected. Its stock climbed $1.69, or 16.3 percent, to $12.06. The ADP jobs survey was better than expected, and the construction, manufacturing, health care and shipping industries all added jobs at a solid pace. The U.S. government will release its own monthly jobs report Friday. Investors reacted to the hiring report by selling bonds, which are relatively safe investments that are in greater demand when the economy seems weaker. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.48 percent from 2.44 percent. Stocks that pay large dividends traded lower as bond yields rose. Dominion Resources dropped $4.43, or 5.8 percent, to $71.85. Dominion also released a weak quarterly report. Oil prices stayed within a small range. U.S. crude added $1.07, or 2 percent, to close at $53.88 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, gained $1.22, or 2.2 percent, to $56.80 a barrel in London. U.S. oil has stayed between roughly $52 and $55 a barrel for the last two months.  The S&P 500's energy company index fell for the fifth day in a row. It's down almost 3.5 percent over that time and has sunk 7 percent since Dec. 13. Lightweight aluminum products maker Arconic surged after its largest shareholder said the company needs new leadership. Elliott Management nominated five potential directors to Arconic's board. The company said it stands by CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and that Elliott's moves are not in the best interest of all shareholders. Since Arconic split from Alcoa on Nov. 1, Arconic stock was almost flat and Alcoa has jumped almost 70 percent. Arconic gained $2.55, or 11.2 percent, to $25.28. The dollar rose to 113.09 yen from 112.76 yen. The euro fell to $1.0744 from $1.0803. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $1.58 a gallon. Heating oil added 4 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $1.67 a gallon. Natural gas rose 5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $3.17 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold slipped $3.10 to $1,208.30 an ounce. Silver lost 9 cents to $17.45 an ounce. Copper fell 2 cents to $2.71 1 pound. Stocks in Europe got a boost from the hiring survey and a report that said manufacturing in China grew at its fastest pace in two years in January. Heavy government spending and more lending by banks helped keep the economy steady. Germany's DAX added 1.1 percent while the CAC 40 of France rose 1 percent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain picked up 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.6 percent after a skid on Tuesday. The Kospi in South Korea jumped 0.6 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.2 percent.

The company sold more units in the holiday quarter, yet profit fell. A saturating market and slowing innovation aren't helping margins. Yet the prospect of a new phone and the ability to sell additional services are bright spots that should keep investors on board. Apple's figures are astonishing, with quarterly revenue hitting $78 billion and profit dialing in at $17.9 billion. Only a handful of American companies earn more in a year than Apple did in the quarter. Yet its fortunes are tied up in handsets, with the iPhone accounting for nearly 70 percent of sales. With perhaps 2.5 billion smartphones now being used around the world, according to various estimates, it's getting harder to find new customers. The company's revenue rose only 3 percent from the same period last year.

Apple shares rose 6.1 percent to $128.75, its highest close in a year and a half. This made it the biggest positive influence on the three major indexes, which would have all ended in the red for the day without Apple's boost. In its first meeting since President Donald Trump took office, the Fed's policy-setting committee said job gains remained solid and was upbeat on inflation, signaling conviction that the economy was on a good footing. The lack of detail on when the next rate hike could come weighed on financial shares, which had been positive through most of the session. The S&P 500 financial sector edged up 0.04 percent. "Confidence in the economy was reflected in the more emphatic (Fed) statement with regard to inflation," said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International Group in Nassau, Bahamas. He said the Fed suggested a wait-and-see approach when it came to the fiscal stimulus expected to be triggered by the Trump administration. Data earlier in the day showed U.S. factory activity accelerated to a more than two-year high in January and private employers boosted hiring last month. However, stocks struggled to gain momentum and the S&P 500 avoided its fifth session of consecutive declines by the slightest margin. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 26.85 points, or 0.14 percent, to end at 19,890.94, the S&P 500 gained 0.68 point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,279.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 27.87 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,642.65. Dow component Exxon slipped 1.1 percent after a string of price target cuts from brokerages. The oil major had reported results on Tuesday. Johnson Controls fell 3.4 percent to $42.50 after its quarterly organic sales growth fell short of its estimate. On the upside, Facebook shares added almost 2 percent in extended trading following higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. During the regular session, Advanced Micro Devices rallied 16.3 percent to $12.06 in nearly four times its usual daily volume a day after reporting results. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 135 new highs and 27 new lows. About 7.59 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The segment had $7.17 billion in revenue for the period, the third-largest category behind the iPhone's $54.38 billion in revenue and the Mac's $7.24 billion in revenue.  "Services are becoming a larger part of our business and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year," said CEO Tim Cook during a call with investors, also noting that he expects the business to double in the next four years.  While the iPhone continues to drive Apple's revenue, investors are increasingly looking for diversification in the company's business after three straight quarters of iPhone sales declines last year. Apple bucked the trend during its fiscal first quarter, which encompassed the shopping-heavy holiday season. Spurred on by the September introduction of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple sold 78.3 million units and grew iPhone revenue by 5 percent.  But a 22 percent decline in iPad sales highlights why Apple is investing in its services segment, which presents future opportunities for growth. The App Store, which saw a record $3 billion in purchases in December, drove the services revenue increases last quarter. Apple also touted that it has facilitated 150 million paid memberships to its own services and other third-party subscription services. One of those is its Apple Music offering, a $10-per-month music streaming rival to Spotify. Apple Music currently has 20 million subscribers but it will be key to helping Apple growth the overall services segment.  That's one reason why the tech company is looking to bolster Apple Music by increasing its investment in original programming, including a "Carpool Karaoke" spinoff. "We have put our toe in the water," Cook said of Apple's original programming efforts. Though the company is said to be looking for a handful of buzzy scripted TV shows or movies, Cook added that Apple will learn from its early projects "and we'll go from there."  Customers will likely watch that original programming on the Apple TV set-top box. Although Apple doesn't break out Apple TV sales, revenue in the other products category that encompasses Apple TV, Apple Watch, and Beats headphones was down 8 percent to $4 billion for the quarter.   Cook told investors that he is pleased with early performance of the the device, which got a major overhaul last year, and has more features planned. "It's given us a clear platform to build off of," he added.  For the quarter, Apple reported overall revenue of $78.4 billion, up 3 percent year-over-year. It also reported quarterly earnings of $3.36 per share. Wall Street analysts, as polled by Thomson Reuters, was looking for fiscal first-quarter revenue of $77.4 billion and earnings of $3.22 per share.  It is expecting fiscal second-quarter revenue between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion.  This story originally appeared on The Hollywood Reporter.   FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos Business Apple surges on iPhone sales; stock indexes wobble WEDNESDAY, FEB. 1, 2017, 1:37 P.M. By Marley Jay Associated Press Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS NEW YORK – Investors didn’t react much to a strong hiring survey or the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged Wednesday, and U.S. stocks finished little changed Wednesday. Apple soared after it said iPhone sales improved in its latest quarter. Stocks jumped in morning trading after payroll provider ADP said hiring by private employers grew stronger in January. Bond prices climbed. But the market’s gains thinned, partly because investors sold shares of companies that pay big dividends as bond yields rose. Stocks briefly turned higher after the Fed’s announcement, but that also faded. The only constant was the big gain for Apple, which pushed technology companies higher. The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged, just as investors expected. The central bank noted that the job market is getting stronger and inflation is gradually rising, but said it wants more time to monitor the economy. That’s what investors expected. Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, noted that the central bank just increased rates in December and the Trump administration’s spending and fiscal plans still haven’t been spelled out. “They’ll wait until they actually know what’s going to happen,” she said of the Fed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.85 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,890.94. The Standard & Poor’s 500 inched up 0.68 points to 2,279.55. The Nasdaq composite, which has a high concentration of technology companies, gained 27.86 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,642.65. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks dipped 0.60 points to 1,361.23. Most stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange fell. Apple made its biggest one-day jump six months after its first-quarter profit and sales were better than analysts expected. The company said consumers snapped up its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and that ended the first-ever slump in iPhone sales. Apple stock rose $7.44, or 6.1 percent, to $128.79. Apple was singlehandledly responsible for the Dow gain and it helped take technology stocks higher. Investors haven’t focused on company earnings recently because of the flood of political news and other factors, but Warne said results like Apple’s will help the market. “The fact that we’re seeing solid earnings and they’re coming in better than expected … will help sustain stocks over time,” she said. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices reported a profit when analysts expected a loss, and its sales were greater than expected. Its stock climbed $1.69, or 16.3 percent, to $12.06. The ADP jobs survey was better than expected, and the construction, manufacturing, health care and shipping industries all added jobs at a solid pace. The U.S. government will release its own monthly jobs report Friday. Investors reacted to the hiring report by selling bonds, which are relatively safe investments that are in greater demand when the economy seems weaker. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.48 percent from 2.44 percent. Stocks that pay large dividends traded lower as bond yields rose. Dominion Resources dropped $4.43, or 5.8 percent, to $71.85. Dominion also released a weak quarterly report. Oil prices stayed within a small range. U.S. crude added $1.07, or 2 percent, to close at $53.88 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, gained $1.22, or 2.2 percent, to $56.80 a barrel in London. U.S. oil has stayed between roughly $52 and $55 a barrel for the last two months. The S&P 500’s energy company index fell for the fifth day in a row. It’s down almost 3.5 percent over that time and has sunk 7 percent since Dec. 13. Lightweight aluminum products maker Arconic surged after its largest shareholder said the company needs new leadership. Elliott Management nominated five potential directors to Arconic’s board. The company said it stands by CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and that Elliott’s moves are not in the best interest of all shareholders. Since Arconic split from Alcoa on Nov. 1, Arconic stock was almost flat and Alcoa has jumped almost 70 percent. Arconic gained $2.55, or 11.2 percent, to $25.28. The dollar rose to 113.09 yen from 112.76 yen. The euro fell to $1.0744 from $1.0803. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $1.58 a gallon. Heating oil added 4 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $1.67 a gallon. Natural gas rose 5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $3.17 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold slipped $3.10 to $1,208.30 an ounce. Silver lost 9 cents to $17.45 an ounce. Copper fell 2 cents to $2.71 1 pound.

Have you ever thought "man, I wish my headphones told me their battery life whenever I switched them on?" Have you ever thought "I wish I could listen to all my music through one earphone, so I don't need to wear both?" Apple's new AirPods solve a lot of these problems. Problems I'm not entirely sure needed to be solved, but problems nonetheless. What Is It? Image: Apple Maybe that intro was a little bit harsh. I do genuinely love the Apple AirPods after a month or so of playing with them, but Apple's approach to innovating with these tiny wireless earbuds has taken some interesting turns along the way. Announced with some fanfare by Apple alongside the iPhone 7, Apple's AirPods look just like the company's $29 regular EarPods, but without the wires. Put like that, it sounds like the smallest difference possible, but the amount of effort that has gone into building these tiny, entirely wireless, battery powered (and wirelessly charging) earphones is obvious. Despite being no larger than the cheap, unpowered EarPods, each AirPod has five hours of claimed battery life — seriously? where do you even fit any battery in these things — and can charge four more times fully from the 24-hour playback life of the ovoid, white carry case they're sold inside. Of course, they come at a price premium. Quite a price premium: you'll pay $229 for the AirPods in Australia. AirPods use Apple's new, in-house-designed W1 chip: a layer of fancy smarts on top of powerful Class 1 Bluetooth — which itself means long range, high quality, all-round-good wireless performance — that adds a bunch of genuinely useful features for iPhone owners. For one, battery life is improved massively over regular Bluetooth, especially while the headphones are in standby mode. You have to have an iPhone or other iOS device to take full advantage of the AirPods, make no mistake, but if you do you'll be able to pair the AirPods just by opening their case near your phone. Then have that instant pairing shared to any other Apple device you own. And every time you take the AirPods out of their case, You can use both AirPod earphones simultaneously and have stereo audio pumped into both of the left and right headphone channels — y'know, like normal headphones — but if you only take a single AirPod out of its Lightning-powered carry case, you'll get both audio channels intelligently routed to it. The same is true for voice calls, because each of the AirPods has an ambient noise cancelling mic setup that detects your voice but blocks out the audio from external sources. You can't, from what I've experienced, set both AirPods to receive dual mono audio — so you can't share one headphone with a friend and both listen to the same music at the same time. What's It Good At? Image: Apple The initial pairing process, and each subsequent Bluetooth connection you make, is utterly seamless (on an iPhone, at least — more on Android later). To first set up the AirPods with your iPhone, literally all you need to do is hold the AirPods' case near your iPhone and flip open the top cover — you'll then get a pop-up sliding up on your iPhone's screen telling you that "Cam's AirPods" (in my case) are connected, with three battery indicators — one for the charging case, and one for each of the left and right channels. This is more useful than it seems, because the utility of the AirPods means that you will spend time with only a single earbud in — and it's useful to know which of your earbuds has more juice than the other. Of course, recharging them just dropping them back into their magnetic housing and waiting. For a tiny set of earbuds, the Apple AirPods sound pretty good. The internal battery and amp in each skinny little earbud provides noticeably more bass than a regular set of wired (Lightning or old-school 3.5mm) EarPods, and the overall sound signature is quite measured and even for a set of open-air earphones. Treble is very clear at low to moderate volumes, although maybe a little too sharp towards higher volumes, and this contributes to voice calls sounding very, very good on the AirPods. Take note, though: for a tiny set of earbuds is the caveat here. There are Bluetooth earbuds, completely wireless ones, that sound better — like the $329 Jabra Elite Sport, mostly because they're physically larger. The simplicity of the AirPods' earbuds and charging case belies a lot of the design and effort that has gone into their construction and creation. Each action has a purpose, whether it's flipping open the sturdy protective charging case's lid to kick off that Bluetooth handshake, or sliding out one of the AirPods to put into your ears. Just about the biggest complaint I have with the AirPods' design is that it can be sometimes hard to grasp the slick plastic earbuds to slip them out of the strongly magnetic carry case. There's a single tactile function that the AirPods have — a double-tap on each earbud can either be used to play/pause audio, or to activate Siri. Siri is more versatile, sure, but I found play/pause more useful for the purpose that I use the AirPods for most. And that's before taking into account the usefulness of putting Siri right up in your ear at all times. Now, Siri isn't the perfect digital assistant, but it's not bad if you know the right language with which to ask a question or if you have your entire life (calendar, contacts, and so on) within the Apple ecosystem. The biggest problem I've had with voice-powered AI like Siri and Google Assistant in the past has been the quality of the microphone that they use to pick up your voice — if it's on your phone, and your phone's not near your face, that's a big impediment. AirPods bring always-on Siri to your iPhone in a way that hasn't really existed before now, especially if you use the double-tap feature to activate Siri rather than having to awkwardly mumble "Hey Siri" in public all the time. Fit, too, is good in that they're not jammed in my ear, but they're not going to fall out feel that Apple's EarPods have always had. Because you don't have the slight extra weight and tug of any wires at the base of the earbuds, they don't move around during wear. The AirPods just sit comfortably in my probably-perfectly-normally-sized ears. If you're touching your ears all the time — towelling off sweat on my face while exercising is the most obvious example I can think of — the AirPods will move around a little. You learn quickly enough to be careful not to bump them out. Some people love the way Apple earbuds fit, some people hate them. I've always been more of a fan of securely inserted in-ear monitors, but I'd happily wear the AirPods for a couple of hours at a time without them feeling intrusive or annoying. Battery life from the AirPod earbuds themselves is good enough at five hours (claimed; I got closer to three and a half or four hours during my testing, mostly at volumes over half power) to suit intermittent listening throughout the workday. You could commute to work, listen to a couple of podcasts or hours of music, then commute home on a single charge if you were careful. Excessive use of Siri or louder volumes will sap precious minutes from your battery life, though. The real star is the battery charging case, which has nearly five full recharges for each AirPod hidden away; I found that I only had to recharge the battery case once a week at most during my month-long time with the AirPods, and I never got an explicit low-battery warning to do so from my iPhone. What's It Not Good At? The AirPods look cool when they're not in your ears. They're beautifully designed. When they are in your ears, the illusion is destroyed. I've had so many comments about the AirPods' distinctive look that I've lost count, and they've predominantly been negative. In any in situ photo of the AirPods you can capture, they look like a regular set of Apple EarPods with the wires Photoshopped out. And honestly, sometimes they look like someone has stuck a couple of cotton buds in their ears and is walking around oblivously. I've seen a few sets of AirPods out in the wild in the last month, and sometimes they look just fine, but sometimes they just look a bit weird. They're also expensive when you consider their $229 price tag primarily against their sound quality — surely the most important factor in choosing a pair of headphones. There's no doubting that they sound better than a regular, passive set of EarPods, but the AirPods still have that Apple earbud sound to them —- bass that sounds a little bit hollow, treble that can be a little bit sharp and fatiguing at higher volumes. They sound OK, but I'd recommend you try a pair before buying if at all possible. The biggest impediment to the AirPods is how much outside noise they allow in, which means you have to raise the volume to near maximum to hear clearly in a loud environment. A photo posted by Campbell Simpson (@csimpson) on Dec 18, 2016 at 5:38pm PST And sometimes that can be a problem, because the maximum volume of the AirPods isn't hugely loud. Sitting in a reasonably quiet office typing this review with the AirPods in my ear listening to music, I've got my iPhone's marker for the AirPods volume pushing dangerously close to full power — three or four notches off the highest setting. If you want clear audio from a podcast, you'll need to push that volume dial one notch higher again to compensate for a little bit of a dip in the AirPods' lower midrange frequencies where most voices sit. Interestingly, voice calls don't suffer from this problem, being boosted by default to an excellent volume with near-perfect clarity. That five hour claimed battery life is, for the most part, good enough to get you through any reasonable listening period. But there are some instances where it isn't quite up to snuff. I find myself at the gym for around a three-hour period when I go, for example, and if I've been listening to music before I go, I'm pushing it dangerously close to running out of juice at the same time for both body and AirPods. Running the AirPods' tiny internal batteries from maximum to minimum power over and over, too, gives me a little concern for their longevity over a couple of years or more. It's best to think of the AirPods as headphones for the commute to and from the office and a quick trip to the gym, not an entire non-stop workday five days a week. It's almost not even worth mentioning, but at the same time it's important to realise that if you're buying the AirPods to primarily use them on a non-Apple device, you lose a lot of their functionality. Pairing on Android is definitely straightforward — press the button on the AirPods' case, find it in your phone's Bluetooth list — but it's not as seamless as on iOS. You also lose the always-on Siri (there's no always-on "OK Google") and auto-pausing when you take one or both of the AirPods out of your ears. They do the whole music part perfectly well, but you don't get those higher functions that make the AirPods (more) worth it with an iPhone. Should You Buy It? Image: Apple Yes and no. If you're considering buying AirPods, you probably already have a modern iPhone, and in that case it's very easy to recommend the AirPods as a compact, portable, extremely convenient addition to your Apple-powered repertoire. The ease of use of flipping open that little case and having your entirely wireless earphones instantly connected to and piping music or podcasts from your iPhone is hard to beat; even Beats' own Solo 3, which use the same W1 chip, take the tap of a button to power on and connect. AirPods are just about as trouble-free as Bluetooth has ever been, on any device I've ever used. On Android, this is slightly less true. For voice calls, again considering the size and weight and portability and form factor of the AirPods, it's hard to go past them. Dual microphones and jaw-sensing smarts means that you can have a lucid conversation in a loud environment, and the combination of AirPods and iPhone has clearly been optimised to make live voice sound just about as good as possible. For music, the AirPods sound good for their size, but you can absolutely find better sounding earphones — wired — for less money. Or, you can spend more and get wireless earbuds that sound better. The compromise in the AirPods' sound design is obvious — how do you make something so tiny sound good and produce loud sound and not run out of juice in a matter of minutes? — but it's a reasonable compromise for Apple to have made. At the end of the day, you're paying a lot of money — $229 is a lot of money — for earphones that don't sound amazing. They don't do anything hugely different to any other Bluetooth headphones — there's no massive quantum leap in sound quality or battery life or connectivity or utility. And the AirPods' form means compromises in battery and maximum volume. And sometimes they look kinda weird. But I'm hanging on to my pair as long as possible, because if you have an iPhone, it's hard to find a pair of earphones — wired or wireless — that just works as seamlessly as the AirPods do. And for the kind of listening that I do these days — passing the time with a podcast on the train, or making a long voice call back to Australia when I'm travelling overseas, or struggling through a session at the gym — seamless is a valuable thing. Comments MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 16, 2017, 1:24pm It sounds like they took a lot of ideas from the Jabra Stone BT headset - http://www.jabra.com.au/products/bluetooth/jabra_stone3/jabra_stone3_dark - I had one about four years ago and it was very handy in the car. Reply 0 dazzler @dazzler3622 Jan 16, 2017, 1:45pm Can you choose when to charge them or does it happen automatically every time you put them in the case? If it's the latter, I would imagine the battery life will drop dramatically after a year of normal use because that would involve 2-3 partial charges per day and Li Ion batteries decay after about 500 full charges. Last edited January 16, 2017 1:46 pm Reply 0 targeting compoita @poita Jan 16, 2017, 1:52pm With modern charging circuits, partial charging doesn't really affect the longevity of Lithium Ion batteries. Reply 0 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR Jan 16, 2017, 1:59pm Partial charges don't kill Li-ions like they did Nimh, but discharges do. They're not huge batteries, and I'm just concerned about using them up over a couple of years. Reply 0 phil @phil Jan 16, 2017, 2:42pm I reckon that by the time there's any noticeable drop in battery life one of several things will happen; Apple will have stopped supporting them, the user will have moved on to whatever shiny Apple replace them with, or the user will have lost one/both of the 'pods.

Reply 4 nizmo_man @nizmo_man Jan 16, 2017, 3:51pm maximum volume of the AirPods isn't hugely loud As a train user, good. Reply 1 mosesvii @mosesvii Jan 16, 2017, 4:09pm I've owned a bunch of Bluetooth headsets, until using the AirPods I didn't appreciate just how much of a difference there is with no cord to connect the ear pieces. It really is freeing. Half the time you forget your wearing the AirPods. I didn't think I'd love them nearly as much as I do. Reply 1 Warren @wazman21 Jan 16, 2017, 4:11pm As cool as these seem, I just cannot abide by the $229 price tag. That seems egregious even for Apple - makes Beats look more affordable by comparison, though (perhaps part of the plan). Reply 1 pepee63 @pepee63 Jan 16, 2017, 5:02pm Personally, I'd spend my money on after market Bluetooth earbuds. They'll be cheaper and better sounding. Reply 0 jjcf @jjcf Jan 17, 2017, 11:51am yeah nah. there isn't a single pair of BT earphones in this class that don't sound like ass. That includes the Jaybirds that tech sites circlejerk over. Last edited January 17, 2017 11:53 am Reply 1 oomlot @oomlot Jan 16, 2017, 6:06pm As a train commuter, I need noise isolation to stop from, you know, going crazy from all the people who don't have it, or don't realise how loud they're being this early in the morning. I wouldn't even consider these without isolation. I don't see the point of headphones if you can hear other things. Reply 0 MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 17, 2017, 10:13am And I don't really see the point if you can't, which is why I rarely use headphones of any description outside my living room or studio. Situational awareness will save your life one day. Reply 1 gnomad42 @gnomad42 Jan 16, 2017, 9:09pm I've found a problem with corded earbuds where my motorbike helmet slowly tugs the buds out of the ear canal because of friction with the cords. Has anyone tried these with a motorbike helmet yet? No cords might solve the problem, but will they be pulled out just getting the helmet on? Reply 0 roundtable @roundtable Jan 17, 2017, 8:48am I'm more concerned with my helmet grabbing the bottom of the earbuds when I'm trying to take the helmet off. Having those little things forced into my ear canal when I cannot reach in to prevent it seems like some sort of first world torture device. I foresee AirPod wearing motorcyclists riding to the nearest fire station to have their helmets cut off (not really, but I have wondered about it). Reply 0 scottorque @scottorque Jan 17, 2017, 9:52am I wore mine on my 40 min moto commute yesterday and they work just fine under the motorbike helmet. Great in fact but while I could activate Siri by tapping the side of my helmet "she" couldn't understand me when going faster than walking pace. I thing I was most worried about - the Airpods getting snagged when I took the helmet off came as a pleasant surprise. These are probably the most secure ear phones I've ever used under a helmet. They didn't budge. Recommended for moto use! Reply 0 MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 17, 2017, 10:13am People wear ear buds on motorcycles!?! Do you have a death wish? Reply 1 phil @phil Jan 17, 2017, 10:51am People have the radio on in cars... Reply 0 MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 17, 2017, 1:49pm Yes, which is all the more reason for motorcyclists to be hyperaware, not completely oblivious. Reply 0 roundtable @roundtable Jan 17, 2017, 1:16pm I mostly use them as expensive ear plugs. The music is very low, so I can still hear the traffic around me quite fine. As a motorcycle-only commuter for more than 16 years, my hearing is likely to have been damaged by now without some form of hearing protection. Either way - I definitely wouldn't recommend people ride with the music blaring. Reply 0 scottorque @scottorque Jan 17, 2017, 2:39pm Yes - we can do two things at once. I see people on their phones every single day in traffic and I wish it was just texting. I hate Facebook even more now that I've witnessed so many looking at it whilst driving. The Airpods work particularly well as they don't block all sound so I can hear the tunes as well as important stuff like other road users. Reply 0 phil @phil Jan 17, 2017, 10:50am Have a look at something like the Gear Icon X http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-iconx/ You may find they don't get wobbled free. Reply -1 TwysT Guest Jan 17, 2017, 5:24pm I bought a set of Shure SE215's for use under my helmet. Excellent sound quality and the cable goes over then around the back of your ear. Easy to get a helmet on and off without disturbing them. To the comment about having a death wish, Before getting these headphones, I would wear ear plugs to cut down on the wind noise. Anything over 80km/h and I would get a ringing in my ears for hours afterwards without them. Wearing the earbuds reduces the wind noise as much as ear plugs did but allows me to hear general road noise better. Also lets me stream radio for traffic reports.

Shows how useless of a purchase they would be and I'm sure it's the same on the new Beats. Reply 0 steveb944 Guest Jan 17, 2017, 3:51am Thanks for the heads up on no auto-pausing for Android. Means the new Beats don't support it either which makes them all useless. Reply -1 stargrinder @stargrinder Jan 17, 2017, 9:19am Considering it's apple, I don't find the price point that offensive. I paid $300 for my QC25s and they are well worth it. If the Airpods have features you want, why not. Just don't lose them :P Reply 0 fortalyst @fortalyst Feb 2, 2017, 10:15am I have tried a few sets of bluetooth earbuds over the years but none of the ones I used worked well for me - they'd cut out/chop the sound while walking down the road, they'd not sit perfectly in one ear and the other ear would sound differently, they'd fall out of my ears when I got slightly sweaty at the gym or when I'd go for a run, and they'd be terribly unpredictable as far as battery life goes. When the AirPods came out I was mainly excited because I figured it would push more innovation by manufacturers & I'm glad they did because on my recent trip to USA I randomly found a Skullcandy shop which had the Ink'd 2.0 Wireless series which I tried & I've gotta say they're the best purchase I've made in a long time. The sound quality reminds me of my Sennheiser CX300 earbuds, the battery lasts 8 hours and they're comfortable, sit well in the ear & work fantastically. Check them out if you're looking for a good pair around the $100 mark Reply 0 Pivik Guest Feb 2, 2017, 12:34pm Have you ever thought "where have my earphones gone?" Reply 0 Join the discussion!

(AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi) HONG KONG (AP) — Asian markets wavered and the dollar lost some steam Thursday after the Fed kept its key lending rate on hold as expected at its latest policy meeting. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.7 percent to 19,008.00 while South Korea's added 0.1 percent to 2,080.61. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.6 percent to 23,188.86 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1 percent lower to 5,647.60. Markets in mainland China were closed for the final day of a weeklong holiday. CENTRAL BANKING: The Federal Reserve left a key interest rate on hold after its latest policy meeting, as investors had expected. Policymakers signaled that they still expect to gradually raise rates but gave no clear timeline. Markets are keeping an eye on the outcome of the Bank of England's policy meeting expected later in the day, though no change is expected. Story continues below video × Advertisement U.S. DATA: Factory activity expanded at the fastest rate in more than two years in January, according to a monthly survey by the Institute for Supply Management. Meanwhile, employment strengthened at U.S. companies for the same month, according to a survey by ADP. The reports add further evidence that the world's biggest economy continues to improve but investors may be growing wary of risky investments in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected policy announcements since taking office. MARKET VIEW: "Donald Trump's presidency comes with greater than normal risks," Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, said in a report. Eventually, "pragmatic pro-growth policies are likely to ultimately dominate populist policies. However, the Trump honeymoon with investors is likely over with a short term period of correction/volatility likely to continue in shares, bond yields and the U.S. dollar." WALL STREET: Major U.S. benchmarks were little changed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1 percent to close at 19,890.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 eked out a tiny gain to end at 2,279.55. The Nasdaq composite added 0.5 percent to 5,642.65. CURRENCIES: The dollar eased to 112.72 yen from 112.98 yen in late trading Wednesday. The euro crept up to $1.0789 from $1.0778. ENERGY: U.S. crude oil futures slipped 30 cents to $53.58 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract added $1.07, or 2 percent, to close at $53.88 a barrel on Wednesday. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, lost 22 cents to $56.58 a barrel in London.

According to the report, the new Mac chip may be used for low-power tasks that currently rely on Intel’s chip to process. The report does not detail a full switch to ARM chips for the Mac, however, noting that Macs will still rely on Intel processors unlike iPhones and iPads which are totally ARM-based. Issues with Intel preparing new chips in time to be used with Macs has fueled speculation that Apple could eventually switch to ARM-based chips in the future. For now, the new ARM chip would potentially be used for dedicated tasks like maintaining background app activity which could preserve battery life. The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer’s low-power mode functionality, they said. […] Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac’s low-power mode, a feature marketed as “Power Nap,” to the next-generation ARM-based chip. The report specifies that Apple may be planning to introduce the new chip in updated MacBook Pros as soon as this year. The new chip may first become available in an upgraded version of the MacBook Pro laptop planned for later this year, the people said. Relying on a dedicated chip for specific tasks could be a benefit to battery life which has been an issue with Apple’s latest MacBooks Pro models. iPhone, for example, features a dedicated co-processor that focuses on step tracking and listening for the ‘Hey Siri’ voice prompt. Apple already includes a custom ARM chip called the T1 with its latest MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar and Touch ID. Separately, new models of the MacBook Pro are expected to take advantage of Intel’s new Kaby Lake generation chips and and step up to 32 GB of RAM on notebooks which has not yet been an option. Apple is also expected to be preparing new iMacs with updated specs including USB-C after the last refresh occurred over a year ago.

Apple shares rose 6.1 percent to $128.75, its highest close in a year and a half. This made it the biggest positive influence on the three major indexes, which would have all ended in the red for the day without Apple's boost. In its first meeting since President Donald Trump took office, the Fed's policy-setting committee said job gains remained solid and was upbeat on inflation, signaling conviction that the economy was on a good footing. The lack of detail on when the next rate hike could come weighed on financial shares, which had been positive through most of the session. The S&P 500 financial sector edged up 0.04 percent. "Confidence in the economy was reflected in the more emphatic (Fed) statement with regard to inflation," said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International Group in Nassau, Bahamas. He said the Fed suggested a wait-and-see approach when it came to the fiscal stimulus expected to be triggered by the Trump administration. Data earlier in the day showed U.S. factory activity accelerated to a more than two-year high in January and private employers boosted hiring last month. However, stocks struggled to gain momentum and the S&P 500 avoided its fifth session of consecutive declines by the slightest margin. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 26.85 points, or 0.14 percent, to end at 19,890.94, the S&P 500 gained 0.68 point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,279.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 27.87 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,642.65. Dow component Exxon slipped 1.1 percent after a string of price target cuts from brokerages. The oil major had reported results on Tuesday. Johnson Controls fell 3.4 percent to $42.50 after its quarterly organic sales growth fell short of its estimate. On the upside, Facebook shares added almost 2 percent in extended trading following higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. During the regular session, Advanced Micro Devices rallied 16.3 percent to $12.06 in nearly four times its usual daily volume a day after reporting results. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 135 new highs and 27 new lows. About 7.59 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Apple shares surged on Wednesday (Feb 1) following a strong earnings report, lifting US stocks as the Federal Reserve signalled it still expects only gradual interest rate increases. Apple, the biggest company by market capitalisation, powered up 6.7 per cent after reporting record revenues on Tuesday after the market close of US$78.4 billion in the first quarter due to its highest-ever volume of iPhone sales at 78.3 million. The Apple rally shored up the Dow Jones Industrial Average which added 26.85 points (0.14 per cent) to 19,890.94 The broad-based S&P 500 ended up 0.68 points (0.03 per cent) at 2,279.55, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite gained 27,86 points (0.5 per cent) to 5,642.65. The Fed offered a fairly optimistic outlook on the economy, but said it still expects US growth to "warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate." Gregori Volokhine, president of Meeschaert Capital Markets described the statement as a stay-the-course stance. "They're remaining dovish," he said. Earlier, US data showed strong increases in private sector hiring and manufacturing sector activity in January. General Motors and Ford dropped 1.3 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively, after both reported lower US auto sales in January. GM's sales dropped 3.8 per cent compared to the same month of 2016, while Ford was down one per cent. Advanced Micro Systems surged 16.3 per cent after fourth-quarter revenues jumped 15 per cent to US$1.1 billion. Sports apparel and shoe company Under Armour fell 2.2 per cent after S&P lowered its ratings on worries about the weak retail environment in North America. The company released disappointing earnings that sent shares tumbling 23.4 per cent on Tuesday. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Apple (AAPL.O) shares rose 6.1 percent to $128.75, its highest close in a year and a half. This made it the biggest positive influence on the three major indexes, which would have all ended in the red for the day without Apple's boost. In its first meeting since President Donald Trump took office, the Fed's policy-setting committee said job gains remained solid and was upbeat on inflation, signaling conviction that the economy was on a good footing. The lack of detail on when the next rate hike could come weighed on financial shares, which had been positive through most of the session. The S&P 500 financial sector .SPSY edged up 0.04 percent. "Confidence in the economy was reflected in the more emphatic (Fed) statement with regard to inflation," said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International Group in Nassau, Bahamas. He said the Fed suggested a wait-and-see approach when it came to the fiscal stimulus expected to be triggered by the Trump administration. Data earlier in the day showed U.S. factory activity accelerated to a more than two-year high in January and private employers boosted hiring last month. However, stocks struggled to gain momentum and the S&P 500 avoided its fifth session of consecutive declines by the slightest margin. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 26.85 points, or 0.14 percent, to end at 19,890.94, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.68 point, or 0.03 percent, to 2,279.55 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 27.87 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,642.65. Dow component Exxon (XOM.N) slipped 1.1 percent after a string of price target cuts from brokerages. The oil major had reported results on Tuesday. Johnson Controls (JCI.N) fell 3.4 percent to $42.50 after its quarterly organic sales growth fell short of its estimate. On the upside, Facebook (FB.O) shares added almost 2 percent in extended trading following higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. During the regular session, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) rallied 16.3 percent to $12.06 in nearly four times its usual daily volume a day after reporting results. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 135 new highs and 27 new lows. About 7.59 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Apple has held the top position in Brand Finance's list for the past five years; however, this year Brand Finance found that Apple 'over-exploited the goodwill of its customers' leading to a 27% drop in brand value. ----- Apple has for the last five years held sway as the world’s most valuable brand. Apple was once a paragon of branding excellence. It has a meticulously constructed, sleek and innovative visual identity that runs consistently through all its products, services and retail sites. Its mono-brand structure created marketing efficiencies and helped to cement its logo as an icon of the 21st century. Reliability, user-friendly interfaces, knowledgeable staff and, most importantly, its transformative technology meant that the brand fulfilled its promises. Loyalty and advocacy reached cultish proportions with fans waiting days outside Apple stores for the latest release. However, Apple’s evangelists are beginning to lose their faith. The snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost to the point of invisibility. Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected. Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline. Its brand has lost its luster and must now compete on an increasingly level playing field not just with traditional rival Samsung, but a slew of Chinese brands such as Huawei and OnePlus in the smartphone market, Apple’s key source of profitability. Brand Finance’s analysts had remained bullish about Apple’s potential to recover its lost momentum, but the rot has now truly set in, with brand value falling 27% since early 2016 to US$107 billion, which sees it lose its status as the world’s most valuable brand. Apple’s loss has been Google’s gain. Six years after it last held the title in 2011, Google is now the world’s most valuable brand with a value of US$109 billion. ----- Has Apple's brand value dropped in your eyes? Let us know in the comments! You can find the full Brand Finance report linked below. Read More Follow iClarified Comments (8) Add Comment krusty22 - February 2, 2017 at 5:27am I've been feeling this lack of "new great products" from Apple coming for quite some time. It's like all "big things" that come and go. If take the iPhone for example and ask myself honostly what has really changed since the iPhone4.. I cant think of much. Yes, it's been made bigger, each release has a faster cpu (a faster cpu means nothing if the applications and os overheads cancel the speed out.. basically the experience is similar to previous released iphones). Yes they made force touch.. whoopty doo - GIMMICK. Every release has a better camera - thats not innovation, it's just putting a camera in the iPhone which they could have done with earlier releases anyway. My point is.. I have not experienced life changing technology in and iPhone since iPhone4. The main issue is the Cost. iPhone is waaay over priced for what we're getting. In my country (South-Africa) the top model iPhone goes for $1600..CRAZY!! I truly hope Apple will once again rise up to the challange and starting putting out "greatness" again.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple is working on custom ARM-based Mac chips for future laptop models Yoni Heisler BGR NewsFebruary 1, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share After nearly falling into bankruptcy in the late 90s, Apple under the masterful command of Steve Jobs began to take a keen interest in owning as much of the underlying technology in its products as possible. In turn, rumors of Apple designing its own chips for the Mac — something it already does for the iPhone — have persisted for quite some time, especially as Apple’s prowess in the chip-design space has progressed. Don't Miss: The Galaxy S8, iPhone 8, and Google Pixel 2 will all share one key component In a new Bloomberg report which signals that Apple is aggressively trying to lessen its reliance upon Intel, Mark Gurman and Ian King relay that engineers at Apple are hard at work designing a new ARM-based chip for upcoming laptop models that will reportedly live alongside Intel processors. The chip itself is said to be a variant of the T1 SoC Apple first introduced on the recently released TouchBar MacBook Pro. While the T1’s duties aren’t exactly all-encompassing — it handles TouchBar and Touch ID related functions — Apple new chip is being designed to carry more of the system load for certain tasks. Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac’s low-power mode, a feature marketed as “Power Nap,” to the next-generation ARM-based chip. This function allows Mac laptops to retrieve e-mails, install software updates, and synchronize calendar appointments with the display shut and not in use. The feature currently uses little battery life while run on the Intel chip, but the move to ARM would conserve even more power, according to one of the people. Apple of course is always looking for ways to increase power efficiency, especially given that the company still remains intent on rolling out increasingly svelte devices, a design choice which inherently limits the battery capacity of its notebooks. Looking ahead, there is no indication that Intel chips will be leaving the Mac anytime soon. Still, it’s a safe bet that abandoning Intel at some point in the future is a scenario being tossed around among Apple executives, especially given the frustration Apple has experienced with Intel with respect to various processor delays.

Mac & i 01.02.2017 16:39 Uhr Leo Becker vorlesen (Bild: dpa, Armin Weigel) Apple lagert immer mehr Daten und Funktionen in die iCloud aus. Ist das richtig so oder eher bedenklich? Anzeige Apple iPhone 7 32GB schwarz ab € 639,99 Apple integriert iCloud immer tiefer und umfassender in iOS und macOS: Inzwischen landen sogar sämtliche Dateien aus dem Dokumente- und Schreibtisch-Verzeichnis auf Apples Servern, wenn der Nutzer beim Einrichtungsassistenten von macOS Sierra nicht genau hinschaut. Das ist praktisch, wenn man unterwegs eine Datei benötigt, die nur auf dem Schreibtisch des heimischen Macs existiert. Zugleich stoßen Nutzer aber immer wieder auf Probleme mit iCloud, beispielsweise Versionskonflikte in synchronisierten Dokumenten – und nicht jeder Datenabgleich lässt sich einfach abschalten. Wie sinnvoll und nützlich ist es, dass Apple immer mehr Daten in iCloud speichert? Ist es nicht eher bedenklich, wenn E-Mail-Kontakte und Anruflisten im Dienste der Bequemlichkeit automatisch auf fremden Servern landen? Im neuen Mac & i Heft 1/2017, das ab Donnerstag am Kiosk ausliegt, diskutieren die Redakteure Ben Schwan und Immo Junghärtchen das Thema. Idealfall: Dokumente und Daten stets verfügbar "Bei Kalendern, Kontakten und Pages-Dateien wechsle ich fliegend vom iPad zum Mac. Safari-Verlauf und Lesezeichen stehen mir auf allen Apple-Rechnern ebenso zur Verfügung wie E-Mail-Konten und -Signaturen. Selbst die Textersetzungen finden den Weg vom Mac zum iPhone: sie dort jeweils selbst anzulegen, wäre extrem nervig", meint Junghärtchen, entsprechend wichtig sei die iCloud-Integration. "Die Web-Apps sind Gold wert, so kann ich unterwegs sogar auf dem Windows-PC beim Kumpel meine Pages-Texte überarbeiten, und ohne den Dienst "iPhone finden" wäre ich aufgeschmissen. Die iCloud ist in meinen Augen die sicherste und zuverlässigste Lösung und hat sich trotz kleinerer Rückschläge mein Vertrauen verdient", betont Junghärtchen. Unnachvollziehbare Probleme schrecken ab Kollege Schwan sieht das anders, ihm macht iCloud Angst: "Welche Daten wo liegen, wann sie synchronisiert werden und warum manchmal nicht, erschließt sich nicht. Kontakte und Kalender sind zu oft unterschiedlich. Manchmal hängt der Dienst einfach, ohne dass Apple das auf den eigens eingerichteten Hinweisseiten zugibt." Ähnliche Probleme gebe es etwa auch mit der iCloud-Fotomediathek. Entsprechend lasse sich die umfassende Verwendung von iCloud derzeit kaum empfehlen: "Meinem 76-jährigen Vater, einem begeisterten Apple-Fan, habe ich abgeraten, den Dienst zu aktivieren. Die wenigen Vorteile, die er erhält, sind den Stress, den er sich möglicherweise einhandelt, nicht wert", erläutert Schwan. Was meinen Sie? Leistet iCloud hilfreiche Dienste oder bereitet der Dienst eher Probleme? Diskutieren Sie mit bei Mac & i: Pro & Contra: Geht die iCloud zu weit?

The Global 500 research, compiled annually by business valuation company Brand Finance, looks at how much a firm's brand is likely to be worth in terms of money and power over the coming months, based on categories including emotional connection, financial stability and sustainability. It found that Google's value had jumped 24% in the past year while Apple's dropped 27% - allowing the search engine to take the top spot. Google's brand value is estimated at $109,470m, while Apple is just behind at $107,141m. This is despite new company figures released on Tuesday which showed iPhone sales returned to growth at the end of 2016 following three previous quarters of decline. Speaking to Sky News, Brand Finance's chief executive David Haigh said the Global 500 report looks at the future of a company, rather than the past. "Our valuation reflects a consensus view among analysts that [Apple] have reached a zenith, and they appear to be plateauing or possibly going downwards." Online retail giant Amazon maintained its third place position with a brand valuation of £106,369m. Microsoft, Samsung and Facebook all made the top 10, clinching fifth, sixth and ninth places respectively. When looking at the power a brand possesses, however, Lego has overtaken Disney to regain the number one position it lost last year. Haigh points to the fact that Lego has recently diversified outside of its traditional market as a reason for its success, branching into areas such as film and gaming. Ferrari, Visa and Nike are among the other companies to feature in the list of the top 10 most powerful brands.

The major averages spent much of the day lingering near the unchanged line before closing modestly higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed its counterparts, climbing 27.86 points or 0.5 percent to 5,642.65. The Dow inched up 26.85 points or 0.1 percent to 19,890.94 and the S&P 500 crept up 0.68 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 2,279.55. The higher close by the major averages came following the Federal Reserve's widely expected decision to leave interest rates unchanged. The Fed's accompanying statement was little changed from the previous meeting, with the central bank noting that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. The statement did include a new sentence indicating that measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late. The Fed reiterated that the path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Early in the session, significant buying interest was seen in reaction to upbeat U.S. economic data as well as strong quarterly results from tech giant Apple (AAPL). Payroll processor ADP released a report before the start of trading showing stronger than expected private sector job growth in the month of January. The report said private sector employment jumped by 246,000 jobs in January after climbing by a revised 151,000 jobs in December. Economists had expected an increase of about 168,000 jobs compared to the addition of 153,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month. A separate report from the Institute for Supply Management showed growth in the manufacturing sector accelerated to the fastest rate in over two years in the month of January. The ISM said its purchase managers index rose to 56.0 in January from a revised 54.5 in December, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in the manufacturing sector. Economists had been expecting the index to inch up to 55.0. With the bigger than expected increase, the ISM's manufacturing index reached its highest level since November of 2014. Despite the pullback by the broader markets, shares of Apple surged up by 6.1 percent after the iPhone and iPad maker reported fiscal first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Sector News Semiconductor stocks saw significant strength on the day, resulting in a 1.7 percent advance by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. The index regained some ground after closing lower in the two previous sessions. Chip maker Advance Micro Devices (AMD) posted a standout gain after reporting a narrower than expected fourth quarter loss and providing upbeat first quarter revenue guidance. Considerable strength was also visible among railroad stocks, which moved back to the upside following recent weakness. Reflecting the strength in the sector, the Dow Jones Railroads Index climbed by 1.3 percent. On the other hand, interest rate-sensitive utilities stocks came under pressure following the upbeat economic data. The Dow Jones Utilities Average slumped by 1.9 percent after ending the previous session at its best closing level in well over two months. Within the utilities sector, Dominion Resources (D) posted a steep loss after reporting weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings. Telecom, commercial real estate, and software stocks also moved to the downside over the course of the trading session. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index advanced by 0.6 percent, while Australia's All Ordinaries Index rose by 0.5 percent. The major European markets also moved to the upside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index surged up by 1 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries gave back some ground after trending higher over the past few sessions. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, rose by 2.3 basis points to 2.474 percent. Looking Ahead Trading on Thursday may be impacted by reports on weekly jobless claims and labor productivity, although activity is likely to be somewhat subdued ahead of the monthly jobs report on Friday. On the earnings front, Facebook (FB), Metlife (MET), and Allstate (ALL) are among the companies releasing their quarterly results after the close of today's trading. Merck (MRK), ConocoPhillips (COP), and Nokia (NOK) are also due to report their results before the start of trading on Thursday. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Main Economic Events In Europe In February -- A Preview Fed Meets First Time Under New Regime – Economic Preview for Week of Jan. 30 The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Previous Story Next Story More Commentary -Global Asian Shares Mixed As China Raises Interest Rates European Shares Seen Opening On Subdued Note Sensex, Nifty Lack Direction In Early Trade Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Cautious Trades Sensex, Nifty Seen Flat To Higher Thai Stock Market May Snap Losing Streak Indonesia Stock Market May Run Out Of Steam Losing Streak May Continue For Hong Kong Shares China Shares May Open Under Pressure Taiwan Stock Market May See Soft Start On Friday Singapore Stock Market Draws Flat Lead Malaysia Stock Market May Be Stuck In Neutral Mild Consolidation Tipped For South Korea Shares Stocks Close Roughly Flat Following Choppy Trading Day - U.S. Commentary Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction Ahead Of Jobs Report - U.S. Commentary <<Previous        64 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Metro AG Stock Down On Weak Q1 Profit; Backs FY17 Sales Growth View Scotiabank Spending $1 Bln On Digital Tech Longtime Micron Tech CEO Mark Durcan To Retire Amazon Profit Rises, But Shares Fall On Revenue Miss Netflix Program To Browse Movies With Your Mind Merck Q4 Adj.

Last May we reported that Apple and the owner of the property that the Apple Store sits on, Boston Properties, were at odds over renewing the lease. Back then we reported that "when it comes to a permanent expansion: Apple doesn't want to pay the asking price and feels it is 'entitled' to the prime retail spot because it 'made' it a global tourist draw. Property owner Boston Properties has no interest in rolling over for Apple." Today it appears that it's been settled.   Bloomberg reports today that "Apple Inc. is more than doubling the size of its renowned store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, bringing a boost to a retail corridor that's suffered from Trump Tower congestion and persistently high vacancies in the past year.   The technology giant will expand the store -- known for its distinctive glass cube -- to 77,000 square feet (7,150 square meters) from about 32,000 square feet, Douglas Linde, president of Boston Properties Inc., said on the company's earnings conference call Wednesday. The Boston-based landlord is co-owner of the General Motors Building at 767 Fifth Ave., which houses the Apple location.   Boston Properties has been working to fill empty retail space at the property. Linde referred to Apple as "that mystery tenant we've been talking about for over a year."   Apple spokesman Nick Leahy said the company anticipates an 'incredible' new Fifth Avenue store, 'where our customers will enjoy new services and experiences in a much larger space.'"   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The record sales and profits helped the world's most valuable public company turn around from what had been a mostly disappointing year. The tech giant struggled through most of 2016 as the iPhone, which remains Apple's biggest revenue generator, had appeared to show signs of reaching a saturation point around the world. In each of its previous three quarters, Apple had reported sales declines on a year-over-year basis. For the final three months of 2016, however, Apple said its revenue rose 3 percent from $75.9 billion in the year-earlier period. Its earnings per share increased 2.4 percent over the same period from $3.28. Apple's results topped estimates from analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, who had forecast Apple to earn $3.22 a share on $77.4 billion in revenue. Apple had earlier said it expected sales for the quarter to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. Gene Munster, partner and director at technology research firm Loup Ventures, said Apple's results "were good enough" to stave off some of the concerns that had grown around Apple over the last year. Apple's better-than-expected results inspired investors' enthusiasm for Apple stock, as the company's shares rose 6 percent to $128.75 on Wednesday. Speaking on a conference call to discuss the results, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple "broke multiple records" during the quarter, including setting company bests for sales from iPhones, Macs and services. Buoyed by holiday season sales, Apple said it sold more than 78 million iPhones during the past three months of 2016, a 5 percent increase over the same period in 2015. Cook said strong sales of Apple's new iPhone 7 Plus stoked the iPhone's performance and that customer "demand exceeded supply during the quarter." Mac sales revenue rose 7 percent, to $7.24 billion, while services sales climbed by 18 percent, to $7.2 billion. Cook repeated that Apple believes revenue from services will boost the division to the size of a Fortune 100 company this year. Services include sales from the App Store, iCloud storage plans, Apple Care service plans and monthly subscriptions to the Apple Music streaming service. "We feel great about this momentum," Cook said. "Our goal is to double the size [of services] in the next four years." Apple's only major product line to see a decrease in sales was the iPad, as revenue fell by 22 percent from a year ago, to $5.53 billion. Cook said he still felt "optimistic" about the iPad and that the tablet still has room to grow.

Shares of the iPhone maker surged 6% on Wednesday to their highest level since July 2015. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is now up an impressive 11% so far this year, blowing past the rest of the stock market. Apple's latest rally was triggered by this week's strong earnings report that raised hopes on Wall Street about the potential for blockbuster demand for the next generation of iPhones. Not only did Apple post its first sales increase in a year, but Tim Cook & Co. sent positive signals about demand heading into the rumored release of iPhone 8 later this year. Timothy Acuri, a Cowen & Co. analyst who covers Apple, predicted in a research report that there will be a "powder-keg fueled super cycle this fall" for the iPhone. Apple said the number of iPhone users is growing by "strong double-digits" right now. "That's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's big driver for our services business," Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, said during Tuesday's conference call. Apple's services division, which includes Apple Pay and AppleCare, enjoyed an 18% pop in sales last quarter to exceed $7 billion. Related: Apple's long losing streak is over Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba was so encouraged by Apple's iPhone growth that he upgraded his price target on the stock to $135. (Apple closed at $121.35 on Tuesday but has since surged as high as $128.48). "This is clearly helpful. Apple has a very sticky and loyal customer base. People who end up in Apple's family are there for a long time," Lamba said. Apple hasn't officially named its new iPhone yet, but Lamba believes it will be iPhone 8. Expectations are high about the new iPhone in part because this year marks the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone launch. The key will be whether the new iPhone packs powerful enough features after complaints that the last few iterations didn't include improvements dramatic enough to justify upgrading. "The more we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate," Apple's CFO said. Related: Apple has $246 BILLION in cash, nearly all overseas Hopes for compelling features and strong demand for the iPhone is why Cowen & Co.'s Acuri believes Wall Street "continues to grossly underestimate" Apple's ability to grow profits the next few quarters. Despite all the hopes for the iPhone 8, Apple still faces a number of challenges. Apple execs admit that the strong U.S. dollar hurts the company by making products sold overseas more expensive for foreigners. While the greenback surged after the election, it has since cooled off considerably. Apple is still also contending with what remains an oversaturated smartphone market. Apple won't be able to rely on help from Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 fiasco for much longer. Still, Cowen & Co. believes it's almost a "layup" that Apple shares rise to $135 over the next 12 years. Acuri said he can "easily" see Apple jumping to $145 or even $150.

That was despite, as IDC notes, a first full year of decline for iPhone with a 7% drop year-over-year for 2016: “This was a year that brought us the first down year for iPhone, yet Apple closed out the holiday quarter by surpassing Samsung for the top spot in the smartphone industry. We also witnessed year-over-year declines in some emerging regions like the Middle East and Latin America where high growth was expected. To round it all off, we now have a three horse race at the top of the market as Huawei cracked the double-digit share mark for the first time ever.” Apple’s iPhone sales of 78.3 million units in the fourth quarter was a 4.7% year-over-year increase for the quarter, but Apple also benefited from a rare 14th week this year that it noted during its earnings call with investors yesterday. While Apple mentioned the 14th week, giving the company an extra week of iPhone sales that could have potentially accounted for the record units shipped, the company said the added benefit was offset by channel inventory growth, a stronger U.S. dollar, and year-ago revenue that included a 1-off $584 million patent infringement payment. “We had the benefit of a 14th week during the quarter this year, but this was offset by four factors. First, this year we grew China inventory significantly less than a year ago. Second, iPhone 7 launched earlier in the September quarter compared to the iPhone 6s launch the previous year, creating a more difficult comparison for the December quarter this year. Third, the stronger U.S. dollar affected total revenue growth this year by 100 basis points. And fourth, our year-ago revenue included the benefit of a one-off $548 million patent infringement payment. Also, strong customer interest left us in supply/demand imbalance for several of our products throughout the quarter this year.” Samsung, in comparison, shipped 77.5 million units during the important holiday quarter, a 5.2% drop from the same quarter last year. And third-place Huawei shipped 45.4 million, accounting for a 38.6% year-over-year increase in sales as other Chinese manufacturers OPPO and vivo took the 4th and 5th spots both with over 100% year-over-year increases. But while Apple surpassed Samsung in the fourth quarter, Samsung comes out on top for 2016 overall with 311.4 million units shipped versus 215.4 million for Apple in second position and 139.3 million for Huawei in third: IDC notes in its full report that Samsung’s decline in the fourth quarter meant its worldwide market share dropped below 20% for the first time in four years.

Investors didn't expect rates to rise, but stocks remained in a holding pattern until after the decision was announced. Apple jumped to its highest price in more than a year after it said iPhone sales improved in its latest quarter. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average added 33 points, or 0.2 percent, to 19,897 as of 12:33 p.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 remained at 2,279. The Nasdaq composite added 25 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,640. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks held steady at 1,361. VIDEOS TOP JOBS APPLE'S CORE: Apple is heading toward its biggest daily jump in almost three years after it said consumers snapped up its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus over the last three months. That ended the first-ever slump in iPhone sales, and Apple's first-quarter results were stronger than analysts expected. Its stock rose $8.62, or 7.1 percent, to $129.97, its highest price in about 18 months. The big gains for Apple, the world's most valuable publicly-traded company, took technology stocks higher. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices also climbed $1.56, or 15 percent, to $11.93. AMD reported a profit when analysts expected a loss, and its sales were greater than expected. FED STANDS PAT: The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged, just as investors expected. The central bank noted that the job market is getting stronger and inflation is gradually rising, but said it wants more time to monitor the economy. THE QUOTE: Investors had assumed rates would stay the same this month. Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, noted that the central bank just increased rates in December and the Trump administration's spending and fiscal plans still haven't been spelled out. "They'll wait until they actually know what's going to happen," she said of the Fed. JOB GAINS: A survey showed private U.S. employers hired new workers at a faster pace in January, a sign that the economy could be getting stronger. The hiring was greater than expected, and the construction, manufacturing, health care and shipping industries all adding jobs at a solid pace. The U.S. government will release its own monthly jobs report Friday. "Economic growth appears to be strengthening even though fourth-quarter growth came in weak," said Warne, of Edward Jones. BONDS: Investors reacted to the hiring report by selling government bonds, which are relatively safe investments that are in greater demand when the economy seems weaker. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 2.47 percent from 2.44 percent. Financial stocks rose, as higher interest rates allow banks to charge more money for lending. Lincoln National climbed $1.48, or 2.2 percent, to $68.99 and JPMorgan Chase rose 72 cents to $85.35. Stocks that pay large dividends traded lower as bond yields rose. Dominion Resources dropped $4.26, or 5.6 percent, to $72 after a weak quarterly report. ENERGY: Oil prices stayed within a small range. U.S. crude added $1.07, or 2 percent, to close at $53.88 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, gained $1.12, or 2 percent, to $56.70 a barrel in London. U.S. oil has stayed between roughly $52 and $55 a barrel for the last two months. The S&P 500's energy company index is on track to fall for the fifth day in a row. It's down 3 percent over that time and has sunk 7 percent since Dec. 13. ALUMINUM ACTIVISM: Lightweight aluminum products maker Arconic surged after its largest shareholder said the company needs new leadership. Elliott Management nominated five potential directors to Arconic's board. The company said it stands by CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and that Elliott's moves are not in the best interest of all shareholders. » Next page...

(AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi) HONG KONG (AP) — Asian markets wavered and the dollar lost some steam Thursday after the Fed kept its key lending rate on hold as expected at its latest policy meeting. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.7 percent to 19,008.00 while South Korea's added 0.1 percent to 2,080.61. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.6 percent to 23,188.86 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1 percent lower to 5,647.60. Markets in mainland China were closed for the final day of a weeklong holiday. CENTRAL BANKING: The Federal Reserve left a key interest rate on hold after its latest policy meeting, as investors had expected. Policymakers signaled that they still expect to gradually raise rates but gave no clear timeline. Markets are keeping an eye on the outcome of the Bank of England's policy meeting expected later in the day, though no change is expected. U.S. DATA: Factory activity expanded at the fastest rate in more than two years in January, according to a monthly survey by the Institute for Supply Management. Meanwhile, employment strengthened at U.S. companies for the same month, according to a survey by ADP. The reports add further evidence that the world's biggest economy continues to improve but investors may be growing wary of risky investments in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected policy announcements since taking office. MARKET VIEW: "Donald Trump's presidency comes with greater than normal risks," Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, said in a report. Eventually, "pragmatic pro-growth policies are likely to ultimately dominate populist policies. However, the Trump honeymoon with investors is likely over with a short term period of correction/volatility likely to continue in shares, bond yields and the U.S. dollar." WALL STREET: Major U.S. benchmarks were little changed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1 percent to close at 19,890.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 eked out a tiny gain to end at 2,279.55. The Nasdaq composite added 0.5 percent to 5,642.65. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

(STC), the kingdom’s biggest operator, is the Arab world’s most valuable brand, while Emirates, the world’s largest airline, continues to be most valuable brand in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to Brand Finance’s Global 500. The Global 500, an annual ranking from the leading valuation and strategy consultancy, ranks brands by monetary value and also calculates the most “powerful” brands, as defined by the companies whose enterprise value is most positively impacted by the strength of their brand. In order to determine a brand’s value, Brand Finance first evaluates factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, loyalty, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation to determine the ‘strength’ or ‘power’ of a brand. Brand power determines the proportion of overall business revenue that is contributed by a brand. STC of Saudi Arabia moved up to 252nd place in the rankings, making it the Middle East’s most valuable brand. The company’s brand value rose 11% during 2016 to $6.2 billion. The increase was primarily driven by STC ‘humanizing’ its marketing campaigns, and reengaging with its stakeholders with a fresh, more personable outlook. Despite an oil slump, a stronger US dollar and a slowing global economy that has impacted consumer appetite for air travel globally, Emirates secured 264th place in the rankings with a brand value of $6.1 billion. The company retained its spot as the UAE’s most valuable brand due to the carrier’s breadth of service, customer centric approach and wide global network. The company’s Brand Strength Index score even increased from 85 out of 100 in 2016 to 87 out of 100 in 2017, securing it a AAA rating once again. Brand Strength Index is the part of Brand Finance’s assessment, designed to calculate the underlying strength of a brand. It includes an analysis of marketing investment, brand equity (the goodwill accumulated with customers, staff and other stakeholders) and finally the impact of those on business performance. Etisalat, the biggest of two telecom providers in the UAE, rose to 293rd place, up from 404th place in 2016. The company’s brand value increased 45% on last year to $5.5 billion. The rise in value was on the back of growing user numbers, innovation (i.e. Etisalat was the first Middle Eastern brand to trial 5G) and strong profit results in 2016. Qatar National Bank, Qatar’s largest bank by assets, entered the survey for the first time securing 441th place with a brand value of $3.8 billion. The company’s brand value rose 56% year-on-year driven by its continued robust financial performance and its successful international expansion. Qatar National Bank now operates in more than 30 countries across three continents. Andrew Campbell, Managing Director of Brand Finance Middle East, said: “Middle Eastern brands continue to make their mark in the Global 500. The brand value of the four companies from the region represented in our 2017 ranking grew on average by 23% year-on-year, which reflects the scale of their achievements when it comes to driving brand awareness, recognition and advocacy. We expect more brands from the Middle East to enter our Global 500 in time as oil prices readjust and companies from the region continue to expand into new geographic markets.” Google replaced Apple as the world’s most valuable brand, with a brand value of $109.5 billion. Google’s brand value rose during 2016 by 24% (from $88.2 billion) whilst Apple’s declined from $145.9 billion to $107.1 billion. Google last occupied the position of the world’s most valuable brand in 2011. The company remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income. Advertising revenues were up 20% in 2016 as budgets are increasingly directed online and Google finds more lucrative revenue streams from digital consumers. Campbell added: “Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. New iterations of the iPhone have delivered diminishing returns and there are signs that the company has reached a saturation point for its brand. The Chinese market, where Apple has enjoyed a dominant market share, is becoming far more competitive with local players entering the market in a meaningful way. Samsung has also been successful in taking market share and financial analysts are projecting declining revenues and margins.” Lego (196) has regained its status as the world’s most powerful brand, with a brand strength score of 92.7. Much of it success owes to its media licensing deals and partnerships which have driven growth and introduced the likes of Lego Star Wars, Lego Harry Potter and Lego Batman. The Lego Batman Movie will premiere in February with further movies planned for the franchise. This will contribute significantly to Lego’s already significant licensing income but, as importantly, the exposure – to both children and adults – will reinforce Lego’s brand strength for years to come. Google (1), Nike (28), Ferrari (258) and Visa (57) complete the rest of the top 5 most powerful brands in the world, with the latter seeing an 8 percentage point gain in brand strength – the most of any company in the top 10. Campbell further said: “A powerful brand can protect a company’s value during turbulent market conditions or challenging times for a business. The share price resilience of Samsung and Wells Fargo, after a difficult year, is testimony to how a brand can help a company ride out a storm. This is why a brand is such an important intangible asset and should be valued as such. Particularly during M&A scenarios, the fact that brand values are not factored into company accounts can mitigate against fair value being paid. Sellers ought to recognize the full worth of their brand, whilst buyers ought to factor in how far the asset of a brand can be stretched and monetized.” Financial services companies comprise 20% of the Global 500 and, this year, China has been the big winner. Growth in brand value in China can broadly be attributed to the growth of the Chinese middle class and its maturing consumer economy. The brand value of Wells Fargo (13) fell 6% after a turbulent year for the brand and was replaced as the most valuable financial brand in the world by ICBC (10). However, it only fell 3 places on the overall ranking of most valuable brands, remaining the US’s most valuable banking brand, due to its deep roots across the country and its market share. Payment service providers Visa (57) and Mastercard’s (110) brand value grew by 81% and 58% respectively in 2016, as their core markets continued to move towards a cashless society and become increasingly reliant on the two companies’ services. Walt Disney (24) fell from the position of the world’s most powerful brand to number 6 in the power rankings. This may be because its 2016 Star Wars release was a spin-off and less successful than 2015’s reboot of the main franchise, one of the highest grossing films of all time. Furthermore, Disney’s biggest films of 2016 are all associated with sub-brands rather than Disney itself – Star Wars: Rogue One (Lucasfilm), Finding Dory (Pixar), Captain America Civil War (Marvel). Disney remains a hugely powerful brand and will be closely watched during 2017 when the eighth installment of Star Wars is released and could propel the brand up the rankings again. Of the 40 telecoms brands in the Global 500, AT&T (4) overtook Verizon (7) as the most valuable brand. Its geographical and acquisitive growth in South America and Mexico has been rewarded with continued growth in brand value and an increase in market share in the respective regions. Spectrum (83) is the highest new entrant of the Global 500. The brand created by Charter Communications which describes itself as the fastest growing TV, Internet and voice provider, counts the acquisition with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks under its name. The behemoths of the non-alcoholic drinks industry, Coca-Cola (27) and Pepsi (67) have fallen by 13 and 12 places respectively as they continue to struggle against the trend towards healthier alternatives and greater scrutiny around marketing sugary drinks to children. Sprite (388) was the only of company in this category to grow its brand value over the past year (from $3.8 billion to $4.4 billion). Brands offering energy drinks, appear to be protected as Red Bull (227) and Gatorade (372) continue to increase their brand strength rating (by 1 and 3 index points respectively) with their marketing efforts continuing to focus on extreme sports and performance athletes. The global fast food outlets McDonald’s (16), KFC (257) and Domino’s Pizza (427) continue to drop down the rankings in the world’s most valuable brands, with heavy competition in an increasingly fragmented market with healthier challenger brands offering greater choice for consumers. McDonald’s has fallen by 4 places in the rankings with its brand value decreasing by 9%, while KFC and Domino’s Pizza declined by 27% and 16% respectively. The largest improvement within the sector, with a 45% increase in its brand value, came from Tim Horton’s (192), the fast food restaurant based in Canada, known for its coffee and doughnuts. Parent company, Restaurant Brands international, which also owns Burger King (329), has announced plans for expansion abroad with the Philippines and the UK tipped to be targets. Boeing (78) and Lockheed Martin (193) were big gainers in brand value in 2016, rising by 17% and 32% respectively, while Northrop Grumman was a new entrant to the Global 500 at 418. In an increasingly uncertain world and with a newly elected President committed to military spending, American defense and aerospace companies have benefitted. Conversely, Airbus (153) has been a big loser within the category. Its fall in brand value of 10% can be linked to the poor reception of its latest model, the Airbus A380, the company’s failure to meet some orders and reductions in staff. — SG SOURCESaudi Gazzette TAGS Etisalat STC SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleSantner wants repeat of tight bowling Next articlePremier League clubs make first transfer profit Ajaz Ali RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Mobily offers Connect Roaming packages this school vacation Jawwy from STC launches ‘Ahlan’ to woo young Saudis Honeywell showcases IIOT solutions at Sabic STC ’16 NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply February 2017 S M T W T F S « Jan       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28   STAY CONNECTED 1,540,763FansLike 42,325FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts Remarkable Discoveries Feb 3, 2017 When it snows in the Saudi north Feb 3, 2017 Drug test for marriage Feb 3, 2017 Why Makkah’s marble flooring is cool to touch Feb 3, 2017 Syria safe zones: Why, where and at what cost?

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → Apple Cafes  February 1, 2017February 1, 2017 ⌘ Permalink Apple had a lot of whacky ideas in the 1990s, but the weirdest one may be the Apple Cafe concept. Apple Cafes were announced in 1997, and were set to open in Los Angeles, New York, London, Tokyo and beyond. Here’s Jeff Pelline, writing for CNET: “The time is right,” said Satjiv Chahil, senior vice president of marketing for Apple, in a telephone interview. “Cybercafes are in. The technology finally is reaching out to ‘the rest of us.’ This will be a place to showcase our products in the real world.” The cafes could also help solve the “shelf-space problem” that Apple has in raising the profile of its products against Microsoft and others. Details such as how much people will pay for Net access still have to be worked out, he said. The L.A. location was going to be 15,000 square feet of dining, browsing the web and videoconferencing. Here’s Pelline again: The deal is part of Apple’s effort to license its brand name more widely and, at the same time, promote its computer products. In the company’s eyes, cybercafes offer the perfect venue. They are thriving through the United States and Europe as many users find that they can surf the Net and socialize at the same time. Some cybercafes charge a membership fee, such as $10 per year, and offer Net access for 18 cents per minute. With 20 years of hindsight, this idea is pretty laughable. Internet cafes enjoyed a very brief moment of success before fading away. Apple would solve its “shelf-space problem” with the Apple Store, launched by Steve Jobs and Ron Johnson in 2001.1 Thankfully the plan was scrapped by December 1997. I think we all know who killed it. images via GUIFX and copyright Landmark Entertainment Group Of course, since then, the Apple Stores have evolved heavily, with some flagship locations offering space to meet and hang out. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → RSS Sponsorship: The best way to advertise on 512 Pixels is via the RSS feed.

Home News Business Apple woos new iPhone fans as current owners await... | Feb 01, 2017  |  Vote 0    0 Apple woos new iPhone fans as current owners await upgrade Apple The Associated Press file photo Apple is expected to unveil a major upgrade to the iPhone later this year, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the phone's launch. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Alex Webb Apple attracted a swathe of new iPhone customers over the holiday period, auguring well for a more significant upgrade to its flagship product this year — and the services revenue that these devices are increasingly generating. The shares climbed to the highest price in more than 17 months. Existing iPhone users upgraded to the latest iPhone 7 models at about the same rate as the iPhone 6S a year earlier, chief executive officer Tim Cook said in a conference call with analysts. Yet Apple still managed to sell 3.5 million more phones in the three months ended Dec. 31, indicating growth was driven by new customers. The iPhone 7 represented a modest update to its predecessor, the 6S, adding water resistance, an improved camera, battery life and processor while retaining similar styling. Expectations are mounting for a more significant upgrade to Apple's flagship product later this year, which is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone's launch. That may persuade more existing iPhone users to open their wallets for the next model. "When we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate," chief financial officer Luca Maestri said. Apple's research and development budget is growing apace, hinting at new innovations or products in the works. R&D spending jumped 19 per cent to $2.9 billion in the first quarter. Samsung Electronics recalled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone in September after a fault that caused some batteries to burst into flames. That reduced competition in the market for large, high-end smartphones and likely helped attract new customers, according to New York-based BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk. "Once they get you in their ecosystem, they've got a far better shot at getting you to buy another one of their phones," Piecyk said. "If anything, the fact that it wasn't stickiness and services and upgrades makes you feel better about future growth." Americans are taking longer to upgrade their smartphones, partly because wireless carriers have phased out plans that offer discounts for new devices every two years. That puts more pressure on handset makers to find new customers — something Apple pulled off in late 2016. Last year, Apple suffered a rare year-over-year revenue decline, as iPhone sales tumbled, particularly in China, where competitors such as Oppo and Vivo introduced cheaper phones with similar performance. In the first fiscal quarter, sales in mainland China grew, excluding the effect of a strong U.S. dollar, Cook said. Cook's response to last year's sales decline was to push more services, such as Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. These businesses are more profitable than iPhones and iPads, and they increase the chances customers will buy future Apple gadgets because users' apps and data are tightly woven into the company's operating systems. Services revenue grew 18 per cent to $7.2 billion in the most recent period. Apple said it aims to double the annual total to more than $50 billion by fiscal 2021. "The App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth," Maestri said. "A lot of it comes from the fact that our installed base of devices around the world continues to grow very well."

 Apple soars after its huge earnings beat Kif Leswing Feb. 1, 2017, 4:02 PM 3,668 facebook linkedin twitter email print Drew Angerer/Getty Images Wall Street certainly liked Apple's first fiscal quarter earnings. Apple stock was up about 6.13% on Wednesday, finishing the regular trading session at $128.79, the day after the company reported a huge beat. That means that Apple's market capitalization rose by about $35 billion on Wednesday — just about Ebay's entire value, to put it in perspective. Apple said on Tuesday that iPhone sales grew for the first time in a year, and also reported revenue of $74.8 billion, a record for the company. In response, several Wall Street analysts, including those at Pacific Crest, RBC Capital Markets, and Oppenheimer & Company, raised price targets for the company. Apple is currently at a 52-week high.  Here's the chart:  Google Finance   Visit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

A strong dollar forces firms to raise prices in overseas markets.PHOTO: AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE PublishedFeb 2, 2017, 5:00 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Purchase Article Permalink: http://str.sg/4s4t Copy iPhone 7 sales numbers and profit of almost $25 billion send its shares up 3 per cent SAN FRANCISCO • Apple reclaimed the throne as the world's top smartphone seller for the first time in five years on Tuesday, beating out rival Samsung in units shipped for the holiday quarter and boosting revenues with a strong showing for its new, top-of-the-line iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone sales numbers and a profit of almost US$18 billion (S$25.4 billion) both handily beat Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up 3 per cent in after-hours trading. But the gains were tempered by Apple's cautious outlook for the current quarter, which it mainly attributed to the strong US dollar. A strong dollar hurts companies like Apple that sell a majority of their products overseas by forcing them to raise prices, which depresses unit sales, or sacrifice margins. Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec 31 last year, up from 74.78 million the year before. Analysts, on average, had expected 77.42 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. That beat Samsung Electronics' 77.5 million smartphone sales in the quarter, according to tech data firm Strategy Analytics, the first time that has happened since the fourth quarter of 2011. The results, which reflected the first full quarter of iPhone 7 sales, come at a time when global demand for smartphones is slowing and cheaper Android alternatives are flooding the market. Apple may also have benefited from Samsung's much-publicised recall of its fire-prone Galaxy Note7. FIGURES FOR QUARTER ENDED DEC 31 78.29m Number of iPhones sold. $18b Net profit in US dollars. $7.17b Services revenue in US dollars. Apple is heavily dependent on the success of iPhones, which account for more than two-thirds of its total revenue. Analysts and investors have already set their sights on Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone, which is expected to feature better touchscreen technology, wireless charging and a shift to a higher-resolution organic light- emitting diode display. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said demand was especially high for the larger iPhone 7 Plus in the fiscal first quarter. Revenue in the services business - which includes the App Store, Apple Pay and iCloud - jumped 18.4 per cent to US$7.17 billion, helped by the popularity of games, including Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run, and increased revenue from subscriptions. Apple is still looking for major new sources of growth as Apple TV struggles to set itself apart from competitors and its plans to enter the autonomous driving market take shape. The company said Apple Watch sales set a record last quarter, but provided no numbers.

Posted on February 1, 2017 by admin If you decide to buy your Apple product from a retailer instead of an Apple store, you have many options to choose from. Two of the most popular choices are Amazon and MacMall. Amazon is definitely a popular retail giant, but some people may hesitate to buy from MacMall. Obviously, they are not as popular. Continue reading to learn more about the two companies. Amazon When an Apple product launches, it takes some time before other retailers are granted the opportunity to sell copies. Nonetheless, whenever people decide to buy a newly launched product at a later date to get big savings, they are most likely going to buy from Amazon. Indeed, the company has been around for many years, and they do have a good reputation. You do not have to pay for the taxes, the shipping is free of charge, and you can get good customer service in case something wrong happens along the process. Amazon sells a variety of Apple products. Their product list is incredibly huge, so if you want to purchase additional accessories, you can definitely do so. In fact, you can even purchase unrelated items and avoid the hassle of paying different online merchants. MacMall For those who have not heard of MacMall, it is a legitimate company and a subsidiary of PC Mall. It is one of the most trusted Apple product retailers. You can find some of the craziest and cheapest Apple product deals on their merchant website. The only negative comment you usually hear about the company is their customer service. If you encounter a problem with your purchase, call support and try to explain the issue without getting irate. The company can offer very cheap prices on Apple items because they buy the products in bulk. They have an extensive list of other products on sale as well. They have external hard drives, speakers, phone accessories, laptop accessories, and many more. Therefore, if you want to save big on Apple products and accessories, visit their site. You can also save more money by using a MacMall coupon. Final Word Amazon and MacMall are trusted retailers of Apple products. If you can find a better deal on MacMall, then buy from MacMall. If you find a cheaper alternative on Amazon, then do not hesitate to buy from them as well. Just remember that you can always get better and cheaper deals when you use a MacMall coupon.

Wednesday, February 1, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Apple’s Q1 2017 Results Apple (Hacker News): Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 first quarter ended December 31, 2016. The Company posted all-time record quarterly revenue of $78.4 billion and all-time record quarterly earnings per diluted share of $3.36. These results compare to revenue of $75.9 billion and earnings per diluted share of $3.28 in the year-ago quarter. Jason Snell: There was a time when every quarter was a record for Apple, but after last year’s rough year of regression (following a record-smashing 2015), it wasn’t a sure thing that we’d see more of those for a while. But for the holiday quarter of calendar-year 2016, Apple beat its own advance guidance and reported a record revenue of $78.4 billion. John Voorhees: Below, we’ve compiled a graphical visualization of Apple’s Q1 2017 financial results. Dr. Drang has moving averages. Jeff Johnson: Most Apple fiscal quarters are 13 weeks long. Once in a while, however, they need a 14 week quarter. You might call it a “leap quarter”. […] What a difference a week makes! Rather than record revenue, we have another down quarter for Apple. The lone bright spot was services; everything else was a year/year decrease. Marco Arment (tweet): Apple and commentators can keep saying the iPad is “the future of computing,” and it might still be. But we’re starting its seventh year in a few months, and sales peaked three years ago. What if the iPad isn’t the future of computing? Marco Arment: I’d say the iPad’s biggest constraints are the OS’ file and window limitations, and the health of apps, both first- and third-party. Unfortunately, these aren’t quick fixes, and the result of “fixing” them might just be reimplementing the Mac poorly. The replacement-cycle problem: How many iPads are mostly used for video playback? Will they be replaced with a $300 iPad or $50 Fire Tablet? Nick Heer: On the flip side of that coin, what if Apple treated the iPad as the future of computing, instead of upscaling iPhone features to fit the iPad’s display, or hardly paying attention to it for an entire year? Would customers respond to an earnest attempt? John Gruber: The peak years (2013 and 2014) were inflated because it was an untapped market. Steve Jobs was right, there was room for a new device in between a phone and a laptop, and the iPad was and remains an excellent product in that space. But people don’t need to keep buying new iPads. I think the replacement cycle is clearly much more like that of laptops than that of phones. […] The other factor is that the conceptual space between phones and laptops has shrunk. iPhones have gotten a lot bigger, and MacBooks have gotten thinner and lighter. Jason Snell: The iPad has 85 percent of the market of tablets priced over $200. The important facts here: Apple’s not interested in selling a sub-$200 iPad, and so that means it’s doing spectacularly well in the market. The market’s just contracting. So this isn’t necessarily about the rejection of the iPad—it could be about flagging enthusiasm for the entire category of premium tablets. […] The number of people buying the iPad for the first time is very strong, according to Cook, which means that the tablet market isn’t actually saturated. Benjamin Mayo: So many basic computing tasks are convoluted and messy on the iPad we know today. Tasks like tweeting an image embedded into a webpage in Safari, playing background music without getting interrupted, collating a handful of attachments from different recipients and sending them off in a new mail message, and so many other things that people want to do every day. Heck, it’s still not possible to look at two emails side-by-side. Update (2017-02-02): David Sparks: In my mind, the issue is that users are not pushing the iPad harder to do more work for them, which would naturally end up in users wanting to buy newer, faster, and better iPads. Put simply, I think the issue is software. […] At last year's iPad Pro event Apple made a big deal about how the iPad is powerful enough to replace a PC laptop. I believe for a lot of people that could be true. But it's not quite there yet because of the software limitations.

It really matters. Replicate the Mac on the iPad as best as you can, and you're still left with the same damn form factor. Michael Tsai February 1, 2017 4:36 PM @Chucky Good point. AdamC February 1, 2017 11:27 PM The iPad is not the future of computing but mobile is.... And the Apple Watch will not be replacing the iPhone and for those who think so try to surf the net with it if you can. Lukas February 2, 2017 2:37 AM >Replicate the Mac on the iPad as best as you can, and you're still left with the same damn form factor. Perhaps Apple should release something like an iPad-based Surface Book. Chucky February 2, 2017 2:58 PM "Perhaps Apple should release something like an iPad-based Surface Book." Wouldn't the proper analogy be a Surface Book that runs macOS and also runs iOS apps? Stay up-to-date by subscribing to the Comments RSS Feed for this post.

Wednesday, February 1, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] iOS to Drop Support for 32-bit Apps Peter Steinberger: RIP 32-bit emulation mode in iOS 11? Andrew Cunningham: Beta builds of iOS 10.3, the first of which was issued last week, generate warning messages when you try to run older 32-bit apps. The message, originally discovered by PSPDFKit CEO and app developer Peter Steinberger, warns that the apps “will not work with future versions of iOS” and that the app must be updated by its developer in order to continue running. The apps still run in iOS 10.3, but it seems likely that iOS 11 will drop support for them entirely. […] Apple has required 64-bit support for all new app submissions since February of 2015 and all app update submissions since June 2015, so any apps that are still throwing this error haven’t been touched by their developer in at least a year and a half[…] Roman Loyola (Hacker News): The switch to 64-bit only support means that older iOS devices built on 32-bit architecture will not be able to upgrade to the new iOS. This includes the iPhone 5, 5c, and older, the standard version of the iPad (so not the Air or the Pro), and the first iPad mini. saurik: The Ars Technica article on this issue cuts to the heart of why this is so devastating: there is tons of software--software which was really interesting and I dare say “seminal” for this important era of computing; and which is not old or outdated by any sane standard--that this destroys access to going forward, for essentially no benefit. Apple insisted that they get to curate something of critical value, but they don’t comprehend the moral weight of that responsibility, and now want to just go around burning down their Apple-branded libraries. It makes me sad, but there definitely is a benefit to Apple and (a smaller one) to users. cameldrv: I’m not sure that this means what the article says it means. Apple was selling the iPhone 5C in India until less than a year ago. Dropping support for the new OS that soon would be uncharacteristic for the iPhone. Instead, they may simply be dropping support for 32 bit apps on a 64 bit CPU. Having to support 64 bit and 32 bit apps one a single device forces them to ship two versions of every shared library, and is probably annoying for them in various types of interprocess communication, because, for example, CGFloat and integer types are different sizes. danudey: The fact that those apps are still 32-bit means they’re unmaintained. The fact that they’re unmaintained means that they’re likely to break at some arbitrary OS update anyway. Even common apps like Tweetbot, by reputable developers, will break on a new major version, so your app that hasn’t been updated in years is probably going to die off soon anyway. The only way to make sure to keep those apps open is to keep from updating iOS, and if you do that this doesn’t affect you anyway. 64-Bit Datacide iOS iOS 10 iOS 11 1 Comment 1 Comment Lukas February 2, 2017 2:43 AM Are there any iOS preservation efforts going on outside of piracy? We can still run software designed for the first Macs, and a lot of that software is still available. It might be time to think about how we can ensure that the same applies to iOS a decade or two in the future. As an aside, apparently, the Super Mario Bros. version sold by Nintendo for Nintendo's own Wii Virtual Console was actually a pirated ROM that Nintendo downloaded from the Internet. Nintendo's internal efforts at preserving their own history is so abysmal that it was easiest for them to just download a ROM from the Internet. Something to keep in mind.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.6 percent to 23,188.86 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1 percent lower to 5,647.60. Markets in mainland China were closed for the final day of a weeklong holiday. CENTRAL BANKING: The Federal Reserve left a key interest rate on hold after its latest policy meeting, as investors had expected. Policymakers signaled that they still expect to gradually raise rates but gave no clear timeline. Markets are keeping an eye on the outcome of the Bank of England's policy meeting expected later in the day, though no change is expected. U.S. DATA: Factory activity expanded at the fastest rate in more than two years in January, according to a monthly survey by the Institute for Supply Management. Meanwhile, employment strengthened at U.S. companies for the same month, according to a survey by ADP. The reports add further evidence that the world's biggest economy continues to improve but investors may be growing wary of risky investments in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected policy announcements since taking office. MARKET VIEW: "Donald Trump's presidency comes with greater than normal risks," Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, said in a report. Eventually, "pragmatic pro-growth policies are likely to ultimately dominate populist policies. However, the Trump honeymoon with investors is likely over with a short term period of correction/volatility likely to continue in shares, bond yields and the U.S. dollar." WALL STREET: Major U.S. benchmarks were little changed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.1 percent to close at 19,890.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 eked out a tiny gain to end at 2,279.55. The Nasdaq composite added 0.5 percent to 5,642.65. CURRENCIES: The dollar eased to 112.72 yen from 112.98 yen in late trading Wednesday. The euro crept up to $1.0789 from $1.0778. ENERGY: U.S. crude oil futures slipped 30 cents to $53.58 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract added $1.07, or 2 percent, to close at $53.88 a barrel on Wednesday. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, lost 22 cents to $56.58 a barrel in London. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Apple stunned Wall Street Tuesday afternoon, when it reported fiscal Q1 earnings that set new quarterly unit and revenue records in key product segments, and its highest-ever earnings per share. Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts that the company set all-time revenue and unit records for its iPhone and Apple Watch brands, all-time revenue records for its Mac and Services businesses, and all-time revenue records for four of its five geographic sectors. The company sold a record 78.3 million iPhones during the quarter, up 5 percent from the year-ago period. Earnings rose to US$3.36 a share for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $3.28 in the year ago quarter, beating the company's own guidance and Wall Street analyst estimates, and setting a new record. Revenue during the quarter reached $78.4 billion, compared with revenue of $75.9 billion in the year-ago quarter, exceeding the company's guidance range and also setting a new record, Cook noted. High Phone "iPhone had a tremendous quarter thanks to exceptional demand that beat our own internal expectations," Cook told analysts. The company had especially strong demand for its dual camera iPhone 7 Plus, which accounted for a higher portion of product demand for plus models than the company previously has seen, he said. Demand exceeded supply during the quarter; however, it came back into balance by January. Apple's Services business reported $7.2 billion in revenue, its best ever, up 18 percent from a year ago. The App Store had its best month ever in December, with $3 billion in purchases. The company's International operations accounted for 64 percent of quarterly revenue, with new all-time records set in most developed and emerging markets, according to CFO Luca Maestri. However, business in Greater China was down 12 percent, and mainland China was even with a prior record number, slowed by the strong U.S. dollar, slower inventory growth and other factors. Apple forecast fiscal second quarter revenue of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion on gross margins of 38-39 percent. Operating expenses are expected to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion, while the tax rate is expected to be 26 percent. One Hit Wonder? Apple outdid itself after three consecutive quarters of revenue decline, raising speculation over whether it was a one-time phenomenon or a trend. "This is good news for Apple, but I have to wonder if it would have been this good without a Samsung Galaxy meltdown like we experienced over the past several months," said telecom analyst Jeff Kagan. "This may have scared plenty of Samsung users to Apple, at least for the short term," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Apple was no doubt able to capitalize on the problems that Samsung had with the Note 7 recall," said Todd Day, senior industry analyst for mobile & wireless communications at Frost & Sullivan. "With Samsung being the No. 1 seller of smartphones, any churn the company has in customers is likely to push a majority of those customers over to Apple," he told the E-Commerce Times. Apple may have been helped by the Samsung Note 7 recall, but it's unlikely that it was a major driving factor, said Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst for worldwide mobile device trackers at IDC. Apple Watch Cook, who late last year criticized IDC's report about Apple Watch market share numbers, said holiday demand for the product was so strong that the company could not meet it. The Apple Watch is the best selling smartwatch in the world, he added, with the highest customer satisfaction in the category by a wide margin. The success of the company's watch underscores its ability to learn from past mistakes, said IDC's Ubrani told the E-Commerce Times. "A new UI, new watch, GPS, and most importantly a lower starting price have gone a long way in enticing new buyers," he said. Apple also has made inroads in the commercial segment for the watch, which will add to its success, Ubrani added. The Apple Watch may be the leader of the pack in its category, but it's not a major driver of the company's financial success, suggested Frost's Day. "Wearable sales aren't as strong as expected," he pointed out, but "those sales still make up a much smaller percentage of Apple's overall market sales and revenue." iPhone Pricing "Apple's impressive performance was directly tied to the strong performance of iPhone 7 Plus," said Brent Iadarola, mobile and wireless communications vice president at Frost & Sullivan. "Strong Phone 7 Plus sales provided a significant boost to the overall average selling price of the iPhone," he told the E-Commerce Times. "As price points of Android devices continue to decline, Apple has demonstrated the ability to maintain, and even increase, their iPhone ASP -- to $695 in the last quarter," Iadarola pointed out. "Innovative pricing options continue to change the landscape for smartphones in North America, in particular, as most major carriers have introduced lease or installment purchasing options," he explained. "This contributed to a surge in the adoption of higher-priced mobile devices in the region." David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey.

Unlike the updates we frequently see with iPhones and iPads, this firmware update isn’t accompanied by any kind of patch notes. That makes it fairly difficult to figure out what, exactly, is changing with this update. The folks over at Apple Insider were able to get one of their Apple contacts to tell them that this update features “miscellaneous minor bug fixes,” but beyond that, Apple isn’t getting all that specific. In any case, some of you might be wondering how you actually update AirPods, seeing as how there’s no real interface to go along with them. READ MORE: Apple AirPods ReviewThe good news is that for many of you, the process should be automatic. The only way to be sure that your AirPods have updated is by connecting them to your phone and then going into the Settings menu. From there, navigate into “General” and then into “About.” Select the AirPods option and there you’ll find their current firmware version. If you check the firmware only to find that they haven’t been updated yet, the process of making sure they grab the latest firmware is a simple one. Just make sure that your AirPods are connected to your phone and that your phone is nearby. Then, connect your AirPods charging case to a charger and the update process should begin automatically. There isn’t any visual indication that your AirPods are being updated, so you’ll just have to double check the firmware version again after a few minutes to make sure it’s been applied. If you’ve been experiencing any bugs while using your AirPods, hopefully this firmware updates put an end to them. Without a set of patch notes, however, it’s difficult to know just which bugs are being quashed.

Rhonda Schaffler Feb 1, 2017 3:31 PM EST Apple ( AAPL)  may have had a blowout quarter, but it wasn't enough to keep it in first place as the world's top global brand. According to valuation and strategy consultant Brand Finance's annual Global 500 report, Alphabet's  ( GOOGL)  Google is now the most valuable brand, dethroning Apple after five straight years. The report uses methodology including financial performance and sustainability, among other factors.  David Haigh, CEO of Brand Finance, says Google dominates search and saw revenues increase 20% in 2016, while Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. He also points to new competitors for Apple in the Chinese market. China figures predominately in Brand Finance's report, with China's bank brands now worth more than those in the U.S.  Chinese bank ICBC made the top ten most valuable brands, while no American financial institution is on the list. Following Google and Apple, the most valuable brand list includes  Amazon ( AMZN) , AT&T ( T) , Microsoft ( MSFT) , Samsung ( SSNLF) , Verizon ( VZ) , Walmart ( WMT)  and Facebook ( FB) . Brand Finance also released a list of the world's most powerful brands, which placed Lego in the top spot. Haigh says Lego has made a brilliant transition into the digital space with games and videos, and is storming ahead of its competitors.

KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany's DAX was flat at 11,663 while the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2 per cent to 4,805. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.6 per cent higher at 7,153. U.S. stocks were heading for a soft open, with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures down 0.2 per cent. TRUMP TURBULENCE: Investors were rattled by the latest news from the Trump administration, including a phone call in which he warned Mexico's president he might send in troops and another about a tense exchange with Australia's leader over refugees. Following the Trump rally in the wake of his election victory last November, stock gains appear to be petering out with investors getting jittery in light of Trump's dramatic policy announcements since taking office. MARKET VIEW: "Trump's presidency comes with greater than normal risks," Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, said in a report. Eventually, he said "pragmatic pro-growth policies are likely to ultimately dominate populist policies." However, Oliver added that "the Trump honeymoon with investors is likely over with a short term period of correction/volatility likely to continue in shares, bond yields and the U.S. dollar." CENTRAL BANKING: On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold after its latest policy meeting — as investors had expected. Policymakers signalled that they still expect to gradually raise rates but gave no clear timeline. Meanwhile, the Bank of England kept its main interest rate on hold at a record low of 0.25 per cent on Thursday but revised up its growth forecasts for the British economy, which has held up better than many forecasters predicted in the aftermath of last June's vote to leave the European Union. DEUTSCHE DOWN AGAIN: Germany's biggest lender, Deutsche Bank, saw its share price fall by around 5 per cent after the company posted another hefty loss in 2016. The bank reported a loss of 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) for all of 2016. Much of that loss was due to a fourth-quarter deficit of 1.89 billion euros largely related to the sale of its Abbey Life unit and costs associated with legal fines and penalties. ASIA'S DAY: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 1.2 per cent to 18,914.58 as the stronger yen weighed on exporters, while South Korea's Kospi dipped 0.5 per cent to 2,071.01. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.6 per cent to 23,184.52 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1 per cent lower to 5,645.40. Markets in mainland China were closed for the final day of a weeklong holiday. CURRENCIES: The euro rose 0.3 per cent to $1.0810 while the dollar fell 0.6 per cent to 112.36 yen. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 15 cents to $54.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, advanced 38 cents to $57.18 a barrel in London.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile There’s a perfectly good reason why Apple removed its anti-theft iPhone tool Chris Smith @chris_writes January 31st, 2017 at 2:26 PM Share Tweet Multiple reports on Monday revealed that Apple silently killed a special anti-theft tool that can help users avoid buying stolen iPhones or other devices that might be locked with iCloud. Apple’s Activation Lock checker is a simple site that lets you enter a device’s IMEI or Serial Number (both of them unique identifiers) to see whether the Activation Lock protection has been disabled. Don't Miss: Watch a Tesla Model S P100D set a new world record for a quarter-mile run A stolen iPhone that has the Activation Lock protection enabled can’t be used by thieves or anyone who buys it. A legitimate iPhone seller would remove the iCloud Activation Lock before making the sale. For the buyer, this simple tool would make it easier to check whether the Activation Lock has been eliminated or not well ahead of making the purchase. But it turns out there’s a real reason Apple removed it without saying anything on the matter. It seems that hackers may have abused it to unlock stolen devices that were protected by Activation Locks. A video first shared by MacRumors, but posted on YouTube in July 2016, shows how a person could use the Activation Lock to discover a valid IMEI, obtain a verification, and then use that verification to trick Apple’s servers into unlocking a non-functional iPhone or iPad. If true, this would certainly explain why Apple is taking action without making any announcements. This Activation Lock hack might also account for the series of reports that detailed a strange Activation Lock error. Soon after the iPhone 7 launched, some users discovered that their brand new devices were locked with unknown iCloud accounts, even though they were never used before. That said, the actual process of unlocking a stolen iPhone is somewhat complicated and involves taking the phone apart, removing the logic board, and then removing the flash storage from the device. Yes, this is the kind of procedure that might permanently damage a stolen iPhone or iPad, which means your average smartphone thief might not be able to do it — check out the full video below to see it in action.

Courtesy Okanagan Specialty Fruits hide caption toggle caption Courtesy Okanagan Specialty Fruits Arctic Apples are genetically engineered to produce less of the enzyme that turns sliced apples brown. Courtesy Okanagan Specialty Fruits Genetically engineered crops are nothing new. But emerging technology that allows scientists to alter plants more precisely and cheaply is taking genetically engineered plants from the field to the kitchen. The first version of the Arctic Apple, a genetically modified Golden Delicious, is headed for test markets in the Midwest in February, according to the company that produced it. It is the first genetically engineered apple, altered so that when it is cut, it doesn't turn brown from oxidation. Okanagan Specialty Fruits, based in British Columbia, Canada, wouldn't say exactly where the apples will first be sold, but says the target consumers are those interested in convenience. "The rapid expansion of the fresh-cut industry – bagged carrots, ready-made salads – has led to explosive growth of fresh cut produce," says Neal Carter, president of the company. "I can cut this up for my kid's lunch box ... and it doesn't go brown and they'll actually eat it." The Arctic Apple is one of the first foods often termed a "genetically modified organism" (GMO) to be marketed to consumers, not at farmers. And it's a sign of how the science of genetic engineering is evolving. Article continues after sponsorship The first genetically engineered crops were global commodities like corn, soybeans and cotton. They were "transgenic," meaning they were resistant to pesticides or insects after scientists transferred new DNA into the plants. "We were taking DNA sequences from another, often non-plant species, and moving it into plants," says Sally Mackenzie, a plant geneticist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. In contrast, new crops are "cisgenic." They work within a plant species' own genome. The Salt GMOs Are Safe, But Don't Always Deliver On Promises, Top Scientists Say "The next generation of technologies, those being implemented now — including the new apple – we're not introducing foreign DNA any longer," Mackenzie says. The Arctic Apple uses a technology called RNA interference, sometimes called gene silencing. The target is the gene in the apple that controls production of the enzyme that makes it turn brown. When scientists add an extra strand of RNA, that gene is effectively switched off, or silenced. "We're basically down-regulating a gene that's already within that apple," Mackenzie says. "So I see that as entirely different. And I think it's important for the average consumer to recognize technologies have moved on." Advances like gene silencing and other gene editing methods, like CRISPR technology, make biotech plant-breeding cheaper and more precise than the first generation of genetically engineered crops. New technologies are also less expensive for companies when it comes to federal regulations, as the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration require fewer costly tests. Huge companies like Monsanto have dominated the industry, Mackenzie says, in part because of the high cost of regulations. Old biotech crops were aimed at big commodities in large part because it was a sure way to recoup that investment. Engineered plants that don't introduce new genes don't face the same regulatory hurdles. Groups critical of GMO technology want to see stronger regulations in order to evaluate potential long-term impacts of biotech crops on health and the environment. Federal agencies are reviewing their rules around GMOs to catch up with the technology. Under the current regulatory structure, however, it is more economically viable, Mackenzie says, for smaller biotech companies to market their own innovations. "You're going to see more and more traits coming out that are really consumer friendly, designed to respond to consumer demand," Mackenzie says. Corn will still get plenty of attention from plant breeders, but more companies may shift their focus from field to fridge. Most genetically engineered crops are processed into ingredients in foods, so when we eat them they are a few steps removed from the field – think soybean oil in salad dressing or corn syrup in soda. When the Arctic Apple hits the produce aisle, however, it will be one of the first GMOs to reach consumers directly, but it is not the only one. A virus-resistant Rainbow papaya is already on the shelf. So is Simplot's bruise-resistant russet, called the Innate potato. The fruit company Del Monte has approval for a pink pineapple engineered to carry more lycopene, an antioxidant that supports the body's defense system. The labels on packages of Arctic Apples won't say much about GMOs. They will have a tell-tale snowflake logo, and a QR code that can be scanned with a smartphone to reach a website with information about the science. That fits within the framework of a GMO labeling law passed by Congress last year, but it makes genetic engineering in food less obvious than many consumer groups have called for. The Salt Americans Don't Trust Scientists' Take On Food Issues The vast majority of consumers support clear labels on foods that contain GMO ingredients, just as the vast majority of scientists agree that they are safe to eat. For stores that may sell biotech fruits and vegetables, it pays to be up front with shoppers that these foods are genetically engineered. "Transparency is what everything is about," says Joan Driggs, editorial director of Progressive Grocer which covers the grocery business. "Any retailer or manufacturer has to be transparent with their customer." The big question for the biotech industry: Once consumers know how these apples are created, will they care? The Arctic Apple's test run will last through March. Okanagan Specialty Fruits expects a wider commercial release this fall.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Shirley Siluk. Updated February 1, 2017 10:40AM SHARE ALSO SEE Google Chrome iOS Chromium Browser Open Source Apple Technology News For the first time, developers have open source access to Google's Chrome code for iOS. Google built its Chrome browser on source code from its Chromium open source project, but until now that code repository hasn't included Chrome for iOS. That was because to build the Chrome browser for Apple's mobile operating system, Google needed to use two rendering engines: its own Blink engine and Apple's WebKit engine. While WebKit has been open source since 2005, Google faced "extra complexities" in having to support both engines in its code for iOS, so the company hadn't previously made it open source. By contrast, Chrome for Android has been almost entirely open source since 2015. Before that, the Chromium open source project was focused mostly on the Chrome browser for desktops. Years of Code Changes To Get Here "Historically, the code for Chrome for iOS was kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project due to the additional complexity required for the platform," Googler Rohit Rao wrote yesterday on the Chromium blog. "After years of careful refactoring, all of this code is rejoining Chromium and being moved into the open source repository." By open-sourcing the Chrome for iOS code, Google has made it possible for developers to compile that code just as easily as they can for other versions of Chrome. That will also help speed up development times for new applications built on the Chrome for iOS code. Rao noted that getting to this point has taken some time because of the fact that Chrome for iOS uses both the WebKit and Blink engines. "That created some extra complexities which we wanted to avoid placing in the Chromium code base," Rao said. "Given Chrome's commitment to open source code, we've spent a lot of time over the past several years making the changes required to upstream the code for Chrome for iOS into Chromium. Today, that upstreaming is complete, and developers can compile the iOS version of Chromium like they can for other versions of Chromium." Browser Rendering Improvements On Monday, Google also said that it had rolled out several changes to Chrome's rendering pipeline over the past few months that are designed to help Web site images in the Chrome browser "load faster, run smoother, and use less power." Those changes mean Chrome "now more intelligently skips redundant tasks, chooses optimal rendering algorithms, and better utilizes system hardware," Google painting professional Chris Harrelson said in a blog post. The improvements to Chrome are designed to make it not just faster, but smarter, Harrelson noted. Previously, on a Web page with frequent Document Object Model changes, for example, Chrome would have redrawn any image tiles if some pixels had changed. Now, Harrelson said, "If only a few pixels have changed, it's faster to copy the entire tile from the previous frame and then update the new pixels. Chrome can now intelligently choose the redraw pipeline that will be faster, reducing tile redraw time by up to 40 [percent]." The goal with Chrome's rendering updates is to help Web site displays load at an optimal rate of 60 frames per second, which "feels fast and responsive to users," Harrelson said, adding that additional improvements with that same goal are in the works. "The rendering pipeline is only one piece of the puzzle, and we've got a lot more coming," he said.

Google's New Pixel Smartphone Shines Next Article > Apple Releases watchOS Beta with Theater Mode, SiriKit By Shirley Siluk / Top Tech News. Updated January 31, 2017. Released to developers yesterday, the beta version of the latest software for the Apple Watch adds new features such as the ability for theater-goers to keep their devices silent and the devices' screens dim. The new release also expands the ability of users to use Siri, Apple's intelligent digital assistant, on their watches. The first version of watchOS 3 was released in September with the launch of Apple Watch Series 2. The beta version of watchOS 3.2 introduces new dimming and mute capabilities through Theater Mode. That mode not only makes it easier for users to quickly mute the sound of their Apple Watches to avoid disturbing fellow theater-goers, but also prevents the screens of their devices from automatically waking and brightening when they raise their wrists. Apple's latest software update also adds SiriKit to allow developers to provide more Siri-based capabilities through third-party apps built for the Apple Watch. The addition of SiriKit also makes it possible for watch owners to use the digital assistant to book rides, send messages, make payments and handle other tasks. Haptic Notifications in Theater Mode The developer documentation for watchOS 3.2 was first published by Apple last week. While the beta software is now available to developers, it's unclear when the update will be released to the general public. With the new Theater Mode, users will be able to "quickly mute the sound on their Apple Watch and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise," Apple said in its software documentation. While the device remains dim and quiet in Theater Mode, users can continue to receive updates via haptic notifications, i.e., vibrating alerts. To check on a notification while the watch is in Theater Mode, users can either tap the screen or press the device's Digital Crown navigation tool. Q1 Results Due Later Today In September, Apple also opened up its digital assistant to third-party app developers for the iPhone and iPad when it released iOS 10. Such apps have also been supported on the Apple Watch, but to date users haven't been able to control the functions of those apps using Siri's help. With the introduction of SiriKit for the beta version of watchOS 3.2, developers can now build new intelligent capabilities into their Apple Watch apps. Siri will be able to understand and respond to user commands in a number of domains, including messaging, payments, ride booking, workouts, calling and photo searches. Meanwhile, Apple is preparing to announce its Q1 2017 financial results during a conference call at 5 p.m. Eastern time today. In its previous quarterly report, released in October, the company reported Q4 revenues of $46.8 billion, including more than $28.1 billion from iPhone sales and nearly $2.4 billion from the sales of Apple Watch, Apple TV, iPod, Beats and accessories.

Credit: Apple iPhone and a Samsung smartphone More like this Apple crosses Samsung in smartphone market, helped by Note7 debacle Samsung's smartphone share hit by Note7 debacle, stiff competition Chinese smartphone vendors show sales gains as Apple, Samsung decline Video Review: Huawei's Mate 9 gives good value for the price Apple iPhones beat out Samsung smartphones both globally and in the U.S. in the final quarter of 2016, even though both vendors saw declines in shipments for the entire 2016 calendar year, research firm IDC reported Wednesday. It was the first full year that Apple has seen a decline in the iPhone shipments since it was launched in 2007, the analyst firm said. Up-and-coming Huawei, based in China, finished third globally for both the quarter and the year. The numbers were also in line with a report released by research firm Strategy Analytics on Tuesday. "The roller coaster year of 2016 proves that no manufacturer is safe in their position in the smartphone market, especially as some markets crash and others rise," said IDC analyst Ryan Reith in an email. Even though Apple and Samsung were down for the year, growth is still predicted for smartphones in 2017 and beyond, Reith said. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] "The smartphone continues to be the go-to device for computing across all age brackets and forms of economies globally," he said. "As long as consumers continue to replace their phones every two years or so, the industry growth should remain positive." Reith said IDC hasn't seen any indication that smartphone customers are lengthening their replacement cycles "despite the notion that the industry is stale." Annual global smartphone growth was 10.4% in 2015, but dropped to 2.3% in 2016, with signs of a turnaround expected in 2017, IDC said. The yet-to-be announced 10th anniversary iPhone will push a rebound in iPhone shipments this year, IDC said. For Apple, 2016 marked the first full year of declining shipments for the iPhone, with a 7% decline over all of 2015. That meant that Apple shipped 215 million iPhones globally in 2016. Even so, Apple shipped 78.3 million iPhones in the fourth quarter, a record for the quarter, giving it a strong 4.7% increase over the same quarter in 2015. Samsung finished first for all of 2016 with 311 million smartphones shipped globally, but just barely fell behind Apple for the quarter, with 77.5 million shipped globally. The South Korean company's recall of 3 million Note7 smartphones because of overheating batteries had an impact, but the Galaxy S7 and J-series phones were nonetheless successful, IDC said, without giving shipment figures for either. Samsung's fourth quarter share fell below 20% for the first time in four years. Huawei was third with 45 million smartphones shipped in the quarter and 139 million for the year. The fourth quarter was the first time Huawei captured double-digit market share with 10.6% of total shipments. Oppo and Vivo, both based in China, finished in fourth and fifth place, respectively, for both the quarter and the year. Both companies saw smartphone shipment growth above 100% for 2016, with Oppo gaining 133% and Vivo gaining 103%. IDC analyst Anthony Scarsella said that for the Chinese vendors to knock off Apple or Samsung at the top, they must increase their markets beyond their home turf. Samsung will not be announcing its Galaxy S8 smartphone at Mobile World Congress in late February, the company revealed last week. The company does intend to show tablets and other devices at MWC, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. Several reports, including from the normally reliable VentureBeat, have pegged the launch of the Galaxy S8 to March 29 in New York City. Shipments are then expected to start in April. Meanwhile, Huawei and LG Electronics reportedly plan to show off smartphones at MWC on Feb. 26, as usual. Several reports have revealed mockups of the upcoming LG G6, but a spokesman said Wednesday that nothing official has been released. LG has done fairly well in the U.S. market, finishing third for the fourth quarter behind Apple and Samsung, Reith said. But LG finished seventh globally in the fourth quarter. LG has positioned itself as a competitor to Samsung phones, with both running the Android OS, but Reith said, "LG is losing ground on the industry, not just to Samsung." Because the U.S. is LG's biggest market, it gets compared to Samsung often, he said. In an apparent jab at the Note7 overheating disaster, LG told the Korea Herald in January that its upcoming G6 will use "heat pipes" made of copper to disperse heat away quickly from the G6. Similar technology is already used in many laptops. "We will significantly improve the safety and quality of our new flagship smartphones as more consumers seek safe smartphones," an LG official was quoted as saying at the time. Reith said if LG tries to argue its phones "won't burn you," in comparison to Samsung devices, the tactic won't stick with consumers. Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, said both Apple and Samsung will continue to "outmuscle" other smartphone vendors, including LG, with expensive marketing and advertising in 2017 and beyond. "Their message [at Apple and Samsung] is so loud that nobody else breaks through," Entner said. "LG builds excellent devices, but that's no longer enough. You have to market them."

Seven of the S&P 500’s 11 primary sectors were lower on the day, continuing a recent bout of fragility seen this week. While tech and health-care shares both rose 0.7%, providing a boost to the tech-heavy Nasdaq, other sectors were sharply lower. Real-estate stocks fell 1.1%, while utilities lost 1.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03% rose 26.85 points, or 0.1%, to finish at 19,890.94, with Apple contributing about 50 points to the blue-chip gauge. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.06% advanced 0.35 points to close at 2,279.22. The benchmark index had earlier risen as much as 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.11% rose 27.86 points, or 0.5%, to finish at 5,642.65. Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.17% late Tuesday posted results that beat expectations, prompting a number of analysts to raise their price targets on the tech giant. The company’s results were helped by stronger-than-forecast iPhone sales. The Cupertino, Calif., company also posted a 19% rise in services revenue. The stock finished up 6.1% in its biggest one-day pop since July 27. “Apple had a terrific report, and the highlight was that iPhone growth was driven by new customers, as opposed to just upgrades. Some of that is no doubt due to Samsung, but customers are sticky for Apple; it tends to keep them,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. Standing pat on interest rates, the U.S. central bank announced after a two-day monetary-policy meeting that the economy was still on a moderate growth path but that business investment remained soft. “It’s key that the Fed remains patient,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, in an interview. With three rate hikes mentioned back in December, and the market expecting two this year, the Fed didn’t say anything Wednesday to alter thinking, with a measured approach and an eye on inflation, he said. Stocks have mostly been in an upward trend since the shock of Donald Trump’s November election victory, but that rally has shown signs of stalling of late amid uncertainty over the specifics and rollout of some of his administration’s policies. In the latest economic data, the private sector added 246,000 jobs in January, far more than had been expected, according to ADP. “The market has settled into a range as some recent data has been lackluster, so it is nice to see this way over estimates, especially since it’s the jobs situation that’s holding up the economy and has been for a while,” Kaufman said, though he added that he expected markets to consolidate their recent gains in February. Separately, construction spending fell 0.2% in December, while manufacturers grew in January at the fastest pace in more than two years. The market also is awaiting the closely followed Friday jobs report, which includes government employment. Other tech giants were also rising: Facebook Inc. FB, -1.79% closed up 2.2% and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.26% finished up 4.4%. Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.36% GOOGL, +0.37% lost 0.1% on the day. Ford Motor Co. shares F, -0.32% declined 0.3% after reporting its January sales, while General Motors Co. GM, -1.13% fell 1.3%. Pitney Bowes Inc. shares PBI, -1.52% dropped 17% after the office-equipment company missed Wall Street estimates for the quarter and cut its outlook. Automatic Data Processing Inc. shares ADP, +1.12% fell 5.7% after the company lowered its outlook. Arconic Inc. shares ARNC, -0.32% rallied 11% after Elliott Management Corp. launched a campaign to shake up the board and management of the aerospace and auto-parts company. The ICE Dollar Index DXY, +0.08% was up 0.2% at 99.72. Other markets: Markets in Asia closed mixed, with Shanghai’s exchange still closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. European markets rallied after a round of better-than-expected earnings reports. Oil prices CLH7, +0.62% settled up 2% following a pullback in domestic crude production, while gold GCJ7, -0.34% finished down by 0.3% at $1,208.30 an ounce. Sara Sjolin contributed to this report.

Courtesy Okanagan Specialty Fruits hide caption toggle caption Courtesy Okanagan Specialty Fruits Arctic Apples are genetically engineered to produce less of the enzyme that turns sliced apples brown. Courtesy Okanagan Specialty Fruits Genetically engineered crops are nothing new. But emerging technology that allows scientists to alter plants more precisely and cheaply is taking genetically engineered plants from the field to the kitchen. The first version of the Arctic Apple, a genetically modified Golden Delicious, is headed for test markets in the Midwest in February, according to the company that produced it. It is the first genetically engineered apple, altered so that when it is cut, it doesn't turn brown from oxidation. Okanagan Specialty Fruits, based in British Columbia, Canada, wouldn't say exactly where the apples will first be sold, but says the target consumers are those interested in convenience. "The rapid expansion of the fresh-cut industry – bagged carrots, ready-made salads – has led to explosive growth of fresh cut produce," says Neal Carter, president of the company. "I can cut this up for my kid's lunch box ... and it doesn't go brown and they'll actually eat it." The Arctic Apple is one of the first foods often termed a "genetically modified organism" (GMO) to be marketed to consumers, not at farmers. And it's a sign of how the science of genetic engineering is evolving. Article continues after sponsorship The first genetically engineered crops were global commodities like corn, soybeans and cotton. They were "transgenic," meaning they were resistant to pesticides or insects after scientists transferred new DNA into the plants. "We were taking DNA sequences from another, often non-plant species, and moving it into plants," says Sally Mackenzie, a plant geneticist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. In contrast, new crops are "cisgenic." They work within a plant species' own genome. The Salt GMOs Are Safe, But Don't Always Deliver On Promises, Top Scientists Say "The next generation of technologies, those being implemented now — including the new apple – we're not introducing foreign DNA any longer," Mackenzie says. The Arctic Apple uses a technology called RNA interference, sometimes called gene silencing. The target is the gene in the apple that controls production of the enzyme that makes it turn brown. When scientists add an extra strand of RNA, that gene is effectively switched off, or silenced. "We're basically down-regulating a gene that's already within that apple," Mackenzie says. "So I see that as entirely different. And I think it's important for the average consumer to recognize technologies have moved on." Advances like gene silencing and other gene editing methods, like CRISPR technology, make biotech plant-breeding cheaper and more precise than the first generation of genetically engineered crops. New technologies are also less expensive for companies when it comes to federal regulations, as the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration require fewer costly tests. Huge companies like Monsanto have dominated the industry, Mackenzie says, in part because of the high cost of regulations. Old biotech crops were aimed at big commodities in large part because it was a sure way to recoup that investment. Engineered plants that don't introduce new genes don't face the same regulatory hurdles. Groups critical of GMO technology want to see stronger regulations in order to evaluate potential long-term impacts of biotech crops on health and the environment. Federal agencies are reviewing their rules around GMOs to catch up with the technology. Under the current regulatory structure, however, it is more economically viable, Mackenzie says, for smaller biotech companies to market their own innovations. "You're going to see more and more traits coming out that are really consumer friendly, designed to respond to consumer demand," Mackenzie says. Corn will still get plenty of attention from plant breeders, but more companies may shift their focus from field to fridge. Most genetically engineered crops are processed into ingredients in foods, so when we eat them they are a few steps removed from the field – think soybean oil in salad dressing or corn syrup in soda. When the Arctic Apple hits the produce aisle, however, it will be one of the first GMOs to reach consumers directly, but it is not the only one. A virus-resistant Rainbow papaya is already on the shelf. So is Simplot's bruise-resistant russet, called the Innate potato. The fruit company Del Monte has approval for a pink pineapple engineered to carry more lycopene, an antioxidant that supports the body's defense system. The labels on packages of Arctic Apples won't say much about GMOs. They will have a tell-tale snowflake logo, and a QR code that can be scanned with a smartphone to reach a website with information about the science. That fits within the framework of a GMO labeling law passed by Congress last year, but it makes genetic engineering in food less obvious than many consumer groups have called for. The Salt Americans Don't Trust Scientists' Take On Food Issues The vast majority of consumers support clear labels on foods that contain GMO ingredients, just as the vast majority of scientists agree that they are safe to eat. For stores that may sell biotech fruits and vegetables, it pays to be up front with shoppers that these foods are genetically engineered. "Transparency is what everything is about," says Joan Driggs, editorial director of Progressive Grocer which covers the grocery business. "Any retailer or manufacturer has to be transparent with their customer." The big question for the biotech industry: Once consumers know how these apples are created, will they care? The Arctic Apple's test run will last through March. Okanagan Specialty Fruits expects a wider commercial release this fall.

Apple shares rose 7.4 percent to $130.31 after touching $130.35, its highest in 18 months. The advance made it the biggest positive influence on the three major indexes, which would all be negative for the day without Apple's boost. In its first meeting since President Donald Trump took office, the Fed's policy-setting committee said job gains remained solid and was upbeat on inflation, signaling conviction that the economy was on a good footing. The lack of detail on when the next rate hike could come weighed on financial shares, which had been positive through most of the session. "Confidence in the economy was reflected in the more emphatic statement with regard to inflation," said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International Group in Nassau, Bahamas. He said the Fed's statement suggested a wait-and-see approach when it came to the fiscal stimulus expected to be triggered by the Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 20.29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,884.38, the S&P 500 lost 1.02 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,277.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.61 points, or 0.44 percent, to 5,639.40. The S&P is struggling to cap a four-session losing streak, its largest since before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Dow component Exxon slipped 1.3 percent after a string of price target cuts from brokerages. The oil major had reported results on Tuesday. Johnson Controls fell 3.1 percent to $42.63 after its quarterly organic sales growth fell short of its estimate. The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 116 new highs and 21 new lows.

News Games Reviews How To Culture HOMEPAGE News Smartphone Tablet/Laptop/PC Apps Accessories Security Business Games Mobile Games PC Games Xbox Nintendo PS4 Reviews Gadget Review Apps Review Games Review How to Culture TV Shows Movies TAG iOS 10.3, Apple, iPhone, iPad, Apple AirPods, Apple ID, iCloud, Find My iPhone Apple iOS 10.3 Features, Uses and Updates: New Apple ID Setting, Find my Airpods Feature Introduced 31 January 2017, 10:38 pm EST By Nens Mitchell Mobile & Apps With the new iOS 10.3, iPhone and iPad users can enjoy a number of new features like locating their missing AirPods and having a new Apple ID Profile.  ( MacRumors/YouTube Screenshot ) An iOS 10.3 beta version has provided Apple users a sneak peak on what to expect for the next operating system update. Many are already excited with the features teased for this iOS upgrade. Apple ID profile According to AppAdvice, the iOS 10.3 comes with a new Apple ID profile which can be found on the Setting application of iPhones and iPads. From the Settings tab, users can see the security settings, payment info and other contact information. The page for the Apple ID Profile also reveals what devices utilize the user's Apple ID including the model, serial number and even version of the operating system. This will also be useful for Apple Pay customers since details for the feature are also included. Other uses Also, the iOS 10.3 update allows iPhone and iPad owners to monitor their iCloud storage. They can also manage their storage capacity to accommodate more photos, videos and other needed items. Finding missing AirPods Aside from this new Apple ID Profile, CIO noted that there is also a tool to aid users to find or locate their Apple AirPods, the wireless earphones recently introduced by Apple. This will allow owners of the AirPods to track their wireless device in case it goes missing. To be able to do this, users would need to open their Find My iPhone application then play a music on their AirPod. They would be able to hear the sound of their device and easily locate it. How to locate? However, CIO explains that the wireless earphones should be within the Bluetooth range of the iPad or the iPhone. If it is not or has drained power, owners can still track through the Find My iPhone app the last "known location" of the device. The official version of the iOS 10.3 is set to be released this March 21. What other useful features do you want for the next OS update? © 2015 - 2017Mobile & Apps, All rights reserved.

Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac Apple is quietly rolling out a new AirPods firmware update with version number 3.5.1. The update is installed automatically when AirPods are in their charging case and connected to an iOS device. It’s not yet clear what this update does because Apple is yet to provide AirPods users with any release notes. In fact, you probably won’t even notice it has been installed unless you check your AirPods’ firmware version number in the Settings app. However, it’s thought the update could address some of the complaints raised by users over unreliable Bluetooth connectivity — particularly when connected to an iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus — and battery drain when the AirPods are stored in the charging case. Teething troubles aside, AirPods have been incredibly well received by critics and early adopters since making their debut. They are praised not only for their sound quality, but also the new W1 chip, which makes pairing super-simple and provides better connectivity (most of the time). You can check the firmware version of your AirPods by opening the Settings app, tapping General, then About, then AirPods. If you’re yet to receive version 3.5.1, ensure your AirPods are in the charging case and connected to an iOS device over Bluetooth.

Steven Tillman Well, Apple is basically able to print its own money. I think they’ll be fine. Jan Morren Well, quietly is the right word for it then. I haven’t seen any update, but wasn’t complaining in the first place. I just adore these little gems! They just work! Last Sunday I went for a run, and took them along with just the Apple Watch Series 2 at my wrist, and the Airpods were my music companions. Switching to these things on any Apple device is soooo simple. I have them always in my pocket, in case I like to listen some music. Glenn Gore Eh, get back to me when I can actually go into an Apple Store, Best Buy, pretty much ANYWHERE, and buy a pair of these things. Apple might as well be selling them via 1-day popup vending machines like Snapchat does their Specs, but I really don’t think Apple can make enough of them to do that either. I stopped checking iStockNow on Erfon’s recommendation after seeing no indication of real availability for weeks. These things are reaching vaporware status now.

Emily Fortuna / Twitter Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement Business is anything but usual for some of America's largest companies, as they question — or blatantly decry — President Trump's immigration ban. Google, Amazon, Starbucks, and Facebook are just a few of the big names to have stepped forward and denounce Trump's executive order, which restricts the entry of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, and indefinitely bans Syrian refugees altogether. In the latest scuffle, Apple CEO Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday his company was considering taking legal action to have Trump's executive order reversed, noting that hundreds of Apple staff had been affected by the travel ban. "More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds," Cook told the WSJ. "That's what makes us special. We ought to pause and really think deeply through that." The following Fortune 500 companies have either publicly challenged or expressed concern over the order: Amazon Apple Citigroup Expedia Facebook Ford Goldman Sachs Alphabet Intel JPMorgan Chase MasterCard Microsoft Netflix Nike Procter & Gamble Salesforce Twitter, Square, Airbnb, Github, Etsy, Lyft, Uber, Tesla, and TripAdvisor have also protested the ban, as have pharmaceutical companies sych as Allergan and Perlara. Actions Speak Louder Than Words With so many firms lending their voice to the cause, it must be asked: Is each company genuinely invested in seeing the ban dissolved because of their values — or are some brands just riding the wave of a big marketing moment? The answer is multi-faceted: On one hand, any U.S. company speaking out against the president is taking a risk; on the other hand, it comes down to what actions these brands take beyond their statements. "A lot of people do approve the ban, so these companies are taking a risk just by taking a stance against it," said Margaret Wolfson, founder and creative director at River + Wolf. "But there seem to be three levels involved: The first is in making a statement that brands you as a compassionate believer in American values; the second is in employers looking out for their employees so they feel protected, and the third level — the hardest of all because of the logistics it entails — is going beyond the verbal to the visceral and investing time, energy, and money." Google, Starbucks, Lyft, and Airbnb, are among those companies putting their money where their values are, so to speak. Related: Silicon Valley Has Visceral Reaction to Trump's Ban "We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the United States," a Google spokesperson told NBC News. "We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere." To make its views not only known, but felt, Google created a $4 million crisis fund for those affected by the ban, pledging $2 million that can be matched by up to $2 million from employees to fund organizations such as the ACLU and the International Rescue Committee. Starbucks announced it was developing plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks operates. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment, instead referring to chairman and CEO Howard Schultz's public letter to Starbucks partners. Lyft has pledged to donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment beyond co-founder and CEO Logan Green's three tweets and Lyft's ACLU blog post. Soon after the ban was issued, Airbnb announced that it would provide free temporary housing to refugees and others impacted by the ban. "This initiative is a part of Airbnb's longstanding commitment to addressing the needs of refugees," said an Airbnb spokesperson, citing the company's past pledge to match up to $1 million donations to UNHCR. Also to be noted is Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos' assertion that Amazon is prepared to support a lawsuit against Trump and his administration over the order, while Twitter's Jack Dorsey released a short film about Syrian refugee and entrepreneur Yassin Tehrou. Thinking on a Global Level Companies campaigning against the ban may not only be looking to protect American values, but their global relationships as well. "A lot of organizations that have and will come out against [Trump's ban] are global firms that need support in other parts of the world," said Ronald Hill, a professor of marketing and business law at Villanova School of Business. "I wouldn't be surprised if global firms coming out against it do business in areas such as Western Europe that have high Muslim populations. You have to think from a global and not just a local perspective." Hill anticipates that more businesses will be chiming in against the ban, particularly those that have a history of prioritizing corporate social responsibility — despite the backlash they may receive. "Some fashion companies came out in support of people with AIDS relatively early on when there was still backlash against that," said Hill. "This is a continuation of that corporate social responsibility, but it's a new, unexplored avenue." How the Work Pays Off While companies embark upon this new avenue, organizations such as the ACLU are prospering more than ever. "Historically, the ACLU doesn't get much support from companies. We're often viewed as a thorn in the government's side because we challenge them on issues," Mark Wier, chief development officer at the ACLU, told NBC News. "But we are seeing some companies create formalized gifts, and hundreds of thousands of small businesses have offered to share proceeds of sales." From last Friday, when Trump issued the immigration ban, to the following Monday, Wier says that the ACLU raised a record $35 million. Related: Celebs and VIPs Donate to ACLU to Fight Trump "We've never seen that kind of outpouring so quickly," said Wier, adding that the ACLU will use the funding to hire over 100 employees including litigators, advocates, and communications specialists. "We need to power up the grid up we've already established with more force," said Wier. "Since the ACLU was able to get a stay on that executive order in federal district court, people are really seeing that it is possible to do something — and to actually win."

New, 10 comments It’s taking a page from Amazon by Julia Alexander Feb 1, 2017, 1:15pm EST tweet share pin Stephen Lam/Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri confirmed yesterday the company’s Services division was more profitable than ever, bringing in more than $3 billion in December alone through the App Store. As a result, Cook said Apple was looking to double its profits in that sector by offering more exclusive and original content. While the company has already made a name for itself with exclusive apps, games and albums on Apple Music, the next step is television. Original television content that’s made and produced by Apple isn’t new. The tech giant announced in July it was working on a couple of new series that would be exclusive to Apple Music subscribers and Apple TV owners. Apple confirmed it had bought the rights to a spinoff of late night host James Corden’s popular segment Carpool Karaoke. The show, which will star a different driver-passenger couple each episode, will be available to Apple Music subscribers. This is Apple’s first foray into original, mainstream television content, and much like Apple Music, it will be an experiment for the company. Apple Music suffered from a couple of issues that initially led to fewer expected subscriptions after it launched, like poor user interface design and lack of access to downloaded tracks. Through consistent fixes and updates, however, Apple has noticed an increase in membership. “We have grown over the past three quarters,” Maestri said. “We’ve had great success with our original content and exclusives and that’s an area we can grow in.” Cook echoed Maestri’s sentiments, adding Services (which also includes Apple Pay, iTunes and other licensing deals) has become a much bigger part of the company’s business than they originally anticipated. “Services are becoming a larger part of our business and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year,” Cook said. Related Want to know where TV is headed? Take a look at music streaming services What does all of this mean? To put it bluntly, Apple’s bets are paying off. While the company saw an initial loss following the launch of Apple Music, through exclusive offers with major artists (Taylor Swift, Drake, Frank Ocean) and access to exclusive radio shows (Former BBC Radio host Zane Lowe) it’s become profitable. Apple is getting ready to apply this business model to television, with the end goal to have premium series like Westworld, Stranger Things and other prestigious shows. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Apple executives are hoping to launch premium television content through Apple Music as early as this year. Based on the financial success the company saw in its last quarter, the time frame makes sense. Much like Apple Music, it seems like the company is ready to go all in on TV, even if it means taking a few losses. It’s not the first company that would venture into original TV programming, either. Amazon started its Studios division in 2010 and started producing premium television content. Since then, the company has won multiple Golden Globe and Emmy awards for series like Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle. Also like Apple, Amazon has begun to license hit series, offering the shows as an exclusive to Prime members. Another important trait that Amazon and Apple share is using premium and exclusive content to leverage sales of other products. In June, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said they noticed a big co-relation between people who signed up for Amazon Prime as a way to view original series and an increase in purchases on the e-retail site. Essentially, Bezos and his team were able to use the promise of original content to get consumers to spend more time on Amazon and buy more products. It’s not farfetched to assume Apple has similar goals up its sleeves. Having exclusive content available through Apple Music or Apple TV could potentially mean an increase in sales for products like the Apple Watch, iPads, Apple TV set top boxes and, of course, iPhones. By offering the exclusivity of content through exclusive hardware, Apple wins in every regard. If in the future Apple can refer to itself as an Emmy or Golden Globe-winning studio, it’s just an added level of prestige. Although Cook or Maestri didn’t specifically mention television in their comments on services, everything is building up to this moment from the company. The second series, Carpool Karaoke, is expected to premiere shortly, with episodes being released on a weekly basis, but there isn’t a set date at this time.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About News Image Source: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock Apple considers legal action against Trump’s immigration ban Chris Smith @chris_writes February 1st, 2017 at 11:21 AM Share Tweet After telling employees a few days ago that Apple did not support Donald Trump’s stance against immigration, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook said he’s considering legal options against Trump. Don't Miss: The Galaxy S8, iPhone 8, and Google Pixel 2 will all share one key component Cook told The Wall Street Journal that hundreds of Apple employees have been affected by the order and that he continues to contact “very, very senior people in the White House” to tell them why repealing the executive order benefits Apple and the country. Cook also said that he receives plenty of emails from concerned Apple staff detailing “heart-wrenching stories” related to the Muslim ban. “These are people that have friends and family. They’re co-workers. They’re taxpayers. They’re key parts of the community,” Mr. Cook said, detailing a case of an employee who’s about to have a child and the future grandparents have Canadian and Iranian citizenship and won’t be able to meet the baby. “More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds. That’s what makes us special,” Cook said. “We ought to pause and really think deeply through that.” Cook did not say what legal options Apple is pursuing, but he did say that “we want to be constructive and productive.” It’s unclear who Cook is talking to in the White House, but the CEO already met Trump following his election. Furthermore, a few days ago, Cook had dinner with Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner in Washington D.C.

Economy Fed Is In No Rush To Hike With Eyes On Trump Agenda The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at its first policy meeting of 2017. (© doganmesut/stock.adobe.com) JED GRAHAM 2/01/2017 Reprints The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady on Wednesday, as expected, as it waits for clearer evidence that rising economic confidence will fuel an upturn in growth. The Fed, which was unanimous in its decision, noted that "business fixed investment has remained soft" although "measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late." "The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate," the Fed said in a statement. Treasury yields trimmed their gains and stocks wobbled up and down after the Fed signaled no rush to hike, meaning it's unlikely the next hike will come at the mid-March meeting. Apple (AAPL) pushed the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite slightly higher. Apple itself rose more than 7% following its strong holiday quarter earnings late Tuesday. The S&P 500, fractionally lower before the Fed announcement, closed slightly higher. Investors had been on guard for more hawkish signals after strong economic reports on Wednesday morning. The Institute for Supply Management Index rose 1.3 points last month to 56, the fastest pace since November 2014 and well above the 50 neutral level. Meanwhile, payroll firm ADP estimated that U.S. companies added 246,000 jobs in January, much stronger than the 168,000 that Wall Street expected. Those reports outweighed news that General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) saw sales fall in January after a big December. GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler shares fell slightly on the stock market today. Signs of faster growth and prospects for higher interest rates, good for banks' net interest margins, helped lift bank stocks in Wednesday trading. Bank of America (BAC) rose 1.1%, while U.S. Bancorp (USB) advanced 0.7% to an all-time high. IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's agenda faces a large degree of uncertainty. If the WTO found the border tax backed by House Republicans — and increasingly by the White House — to be illegal, the GOP would face three difficult choices that could throw the ruling party into crisis. Fed policymakers caught markets off-guard in December when a number of them built President Trump's planned fiscal stimulus into their hawkish forecast for three rate hikes in 2017. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that it's not clear the economy needs stimulus to reach full employment. But after a tumultuous first week and a half of his presidency, Fed policymakers are likely done trying to predict what Trump will do and how his policies will affect the economy. Now the Fed, like investors, is in wait-and-see mode to watch what can get through Congress, when it will affect the real economy, and whether Trump's immigration and trade policies curb or offset the force of his pro-growth moves. For now, markets still expect just two rate hikes in 2017, coming in June and December. After the Fed's announcement, markets were pricing in just 17.7% odds that the next hike will come on March 15.

Riding on the success of iPhone 7 and Apple Watch, the Cupertino-based company on Wednesday announced an all-time record revenue of $78.4 billion -- with a record quarterly earnings per diluted share of $3.36 -- for the first quarter of 2017 that ended on December 31. The results compare to revenue of $75.9 billion and earnings per diluted share of $3.28 in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 64 per cent of the quarter's revenue, the company said in a statement. Apple shares rose three per cent in after-hours trading following the results. "We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "Revenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline," he said. Apple faced falling revenue for three consecutive quarters as Chinese competition hit sales of its flagship iPhone series. But iPhone7 changed Apple's fortune in 2017 first quarter. The company sold 78.3 million iPhones, up from 74.8 million a year before. "It reported revenue of $54.3 billion from iPhone sales, along with $7.2 billion from the Mac, $5.5 billion from the iPad and $4 billion from other products, including the Apple Watch," BBC reported. "Our outstanding business performance resulted in a new all-time record for earnings per share, and over $27 billion in operating cash flow," said Luca Maestri, Apple's CFO. "We returned nearly $15 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter, bringing cumulative payments through our capital return program to over $200 billion," Maestri added. Revenues from its services division -- including the App Store, Apple Music and iCloud -- were $7.1 billion.

Search Technology Forget peak iPhone: Apple proves experts wrong with highest ever sales (Photo: Getty) Apple reported far healthier than expected iPhone sales Rhiannon Williams 12:10 Wednesday February 1st 2017 Apple has defied expectations by reporting its highest-ever quarterly revenue, driven by iPhone sales reaching an all-time high. The Californian company shifted a staggering 78.3m iPhones during the fourth financial quarter of 2016, beating its previous sales high of 74.8m units this time last year. Sales of the iPhone 7 Plus were particularly strong, chief executive Tim Cook confirmed. Analysts had previously voiced concerns Apple had reached “peak-iPhone” after sales of the smartphone fell for the first time in its history last February, and continued to do so for two consecutive quarters. The iPhone 7 Plus (Photo: Rhiannon Williams) The company reported $78.4bn (£62.3bn) in quarterly revenue – its highest to date –  $54.3bn of which came from iPhone sales alone. Sales of Mac laptops and desktop computers brought in $7.2bn, while iPads made $5.5bn. The Apple Watch and other products, which include iPods, its wireless AirPods and Apple TV, raked in $4bn. The App Store, Apple Music and iCloud, Apple’s services branch, made $7.1bn, coming close to edging out the Mac as its secondary source of income. This was largely driven by the App Store, sales from which were up 43 per cent year-on-year. Strong iPhone 7 sales help Apple shrug off gloomy forecast Mr Cook said iPhone, services, Mac and Apple Watch set revenue records, but declined to reveal sales figures or specified revenue from the latter. iPad, however, sold 13.1m units, a 19 per cent year-on-year drop and 22 per cent fall in revenue. (Photo: Getty) Apple Watch sales were the highest to date during Christmas, Tim Cook said While Apple’s sales are always traditionally higher in the Christmas quarter, the lukewarm reception to the iPhone 7 when it was released in September led analysts to predict sales of around 77.4m, which it beat by a healthy margin. While the iPhone 7 Plus was praised for its dual camera system, the general consensus among analysts and reviewers was that the 7 generation was too similar to its 6s predecessor to result in a significant sales uptick. iPhone sales, which account for two-thirds of Apple’s annual revenue, are critical to the company’s continued success. General global smartphones sales are also beginning to slow, as fewer people buy phones for the first time and tend to upgrade less frequently. (Photo: Getty) Apple magic: Tim Cook has steered the company back to iPhone revenue highs Apple may have benefited slightly from Samsung’s Note 7 debacle, but it is unlikely to have made a major difference. Consumers looking to invest in a premium Note 7, which cost £700 during the brief window it was on sale, were more likely to buy another Android-running handset than an iPhone. All eyes will turn to Apple in September, when it is expected to reveal the iPhone 8 – the company’s 16th model, released 10 years after Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone to much fanfare. The iPhone 8 is expected to represent a more radical departure in design, ditching the circular home button and incorporating wireless charging technology. Rumours continue to circulate surrounding Apple’s plans to take on Netflix with its own streaming service, combining original content and partnerships with big US TV providers like HBO and ESPN, which could stand to bolster future services revenue. Apple expects to sell around 53.4m iPhones in the current quarter, which accounts from January until March, according to analyst FactSet, a 10m rise from the same period last year. iPhone 8: the 10th anniversary iPhone The iPhone 8 will be Apple’s 16th model, and will be released a full 10 years after the very first model back in 2007. As a result, Apple is expected to pull out all the stops in an effort to impress potential customers who may have felt last year’s iPhone 7 was too similar to the iPhone 6s and 6 before it. iPhone sales have fallen in the past year as the smartphone market has become more saturated, and the company will be hoping its next model will prove a smash hit. iNews https://inews.co.uk Get daily news updates Subscribe to the newsletter Sign up today The i's Essential Daily Briefing We know that sometimes it’s easier for us to come to you with the news.

For the first fiscal quarter ending December 31, Apple reported an all-time high quarterly revenue of $78.4 billion, up from $75.9 billion pulled during the first quarter of 2016. While nearly $32 billion of that came from the Americas, the company shared that 64 percent of overall revenue came from international markets. iPhone sales also shattered internal records, likely thanks in no small part to a busy holiday season, bringing in just over $54 billion in revenue thanks to the 78.29 million units sold during Q1. While sales of Apple’s smartphone were only boosted slightly from the 74.78 million units and $51.6 billion brought in during the first quarter of 2016, Q1 2017 marked the end of a streak that previously saw declining year-over-year iPhone sales for three consecutive quarters.  Revenue for the Mac, Apple Watch, and Services also hit all-time highs, though the iPad struggled to keep up with Apple's other products during the holiday season. The tablet was notably the only piece of hardware that didn't see an increase in sales year-over-year, with iPad sales netting $5.5 billion in revenue this past quarter versus the $7.1 billion of 2016's first quarter.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Samsung catches flak from exploding phones as… Samsung catches flak from exploding phones as Apple retakes lead in mobile By Adam Ismail — February 1, 2017 10:46 AM Subscribe Share Tim Cook holds the billionth iPhone at an employee meeting in Cupertino. Apple Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Getting Android users to switch to iOS, combined with rising App Store revenue, could encourage developers to bring their latest and greatest apps to iOS first. Apple set the pace for smartphone market share in the fourth quarter of 2016, narrowly edging out its main rival, according to new data from independent research firm Strategy Analytics. During the final three months of the year, Apple shipped 78.3 million devices, up from 74.8 million during the same period in 2015. Rival Samsung shipped roughly 800,000 less — allowing Apple to seize the lead for the fiscal quarter with 17.8 percent of global market share, compared to Samsung’s 17.7 percent. More: Apple manages to sell a record 78 million iPhones in the first fiscal quarter Strategy Analytics notes that Samsung’s fourth-quarter shipments were down 3.8 million year-over-year, which the firm attributed to the Galaxy Note 7 battery controversy. The South Korean company’s 17.7 quarterly share and 20.8 annual share are its lowest since 2011. Despite the slide, Samsung still managed to sell 309 million smartphones in 2016, while Apple moved 215 million. Strategy Analytics Insights from Apple’s earnings call on Tuesday support the claim that the company benefited from Samsung’s botched launch. CEO Tim Cook shared that 50 percent of Apple’s sales in China during what it terms the first quarter of 2017 (the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016) went to switchers and first-time buyers, as opposed to existing iPhone users, and that the total install base “continues to grow [in China], in the strong double digits.” Apple’s boost in market share was mirrored by a strong quarter for the company’s Services segment, which encompasses digital content revenue streams like the App Store and Apple Music. Over the same span, the division earned $7.17 billion — a growth of 18 percent from the $6.05 billion earned the previous year. Beyond Apple and Samsung, other players in the smartphone industry have seen key gains. Third-place Huawei broke double-digits in market share for the first time ever, reaching 10.2 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 8.1 percent in the closing months of 2015. Oppo followed with its own historic reporting period, doubling its share of the global market year-over-year to 6.7 percent, good for fourth position. Although the top two companies overall shipped less devices throughout the entirety of last year than they had in 2015, Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and others picked up the slack to make 2016 a record year for smartphone sales. Manufacturers shifted 50 million more units in 2016 compared to the previous year, making for a total of 1.49 billion sold globally.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Budget 2017 Arun Jaitley Kaabil Raees Donald Trump Home Money US STOCKS-S&P 500 down for 5th session, Apple spike lifts Nasdaq Shares1 Thu, 2 Feb 2017-01:45am , Reuters The S&P 500 moved in and out of negative territory on Wednesday, buoyed by gains in Apple shares and after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, while painting a relatively upbeat picture of the U.S. economy. Apple shares rose 7.4 percent to $130.31 after touching $130.35, its highest in 18 months. The advance made it the biggest positive influence on the three major indexes, which would all be negative for the day without Apple's boost. In its first meeting since President Donald Trump took office, the Fed's policy-setting committee said job gains remained solid and was upbeat on inflation, signaling conviction that the economy was on a good footing. The lack of detail on when the next rate hike could come weighed on financial shares, which had been positive through most of the session. "Confidence in the economy was reflected in the more emphatic statement with regard to inflation," said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International Group in Nassau, Bahamas. He said the Fed's statement suggested a wait-and-see approach when it came to the fiscal stimulus expected to be triggered by the Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 20.29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,884.38, the S&P 500 lost 1.02 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,277.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.61 points, or 0.44 percent, to 5,639.40. The S&P is struggling to cap a four-session losing streak, its largest since before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Dow component Exxon slipped 1.3 percent after a string of price target cuts from brokerages. The oil major had reported results on Tuesday. Johnson Controls fell 3.1 percent to $42.63 after its quarterly organic sales growth fell short of its estimate. The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 116 new highs and 21 new lows.

U.S. stocks are moving higher early Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2017, after a survey showed U.S. employers hired new workers at a faster pace in January, a sign that the economy could be getting stronger. Technology stocks are climbing after Apple said iPhone sales improved in its last quarter, which sent its stock to its highest price in more than a year. Stocks are building on a late surge from a day earlier. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK – U.S. stock indexes are hardly moving Wednesday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged. Investors didn’t expect rates to rise, but stocks remained in a holding pattern until after the decision was announced. Apple jumped to its highest price in more than a year after it said iPhone sales improved in its latest quarter. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average added 33 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 19,897 as of 2:33 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 remained at 2,279. The Nasdaq composite added 25 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5,640. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks held steady at 1,361. APPLE’S CORE: Apple is heading toward its biggest daily jump in almost three years after it said consumers snapped up its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus over the last three months. That ended the first-ever slump in iPhone sales, and Apple’s first-quarter results were stronger than analysts expected. Its stock rose $8.62, or 7.1 per cent, to $129.97, its highest price in about 18 months. The big gains for Apple, the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company, took technology stocks higher. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices also climbed $1.56, or 15 per cent, to $11.93. AMD reported a profit when analysts expected a loss, and its sales were greater than expected. FED STANDS PAT: The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged, just as investors expected. The central bank noted that the job market is getting stronger and inflation is gradually rising, but said it wants more time to monitor the economy. THE QUOTE: Investors had assumed rates would stay the same this month. Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, noted that the central bank just increased rates in December and the Trump administration’s spending and fiscal plans still haven’t been spelled out. “They’ll wait until they actually know what’s going to happen,” she said of the Fed. JOB GAINS: A survey showed private U.S. employers hired new workers at a faster pace in January, a sign that the economy could be getting stronger. The hiring was greater than expected, and the construction, manufacturing, health care and shipping industries all adding jobs at a solid pace. The U.S. government will release its own monthly jobs report Friday. “Economic growth appears to be strengthening even though fourth-quarter growth came in weak,” said Warne, of Edward Jones. BONDS: Investors reacted to the hiring report by selling government bonds, which are relatively safe investments that are in greater demand when the economy seems weaker. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 2.47 per cent from 2.44 per cent. Financial stocks rose, as higher interest rates allow banks to charge more money for lending. Lincoln National climbed $1.48, or 2.2 per cent, to $68.99 and JPMorgan Chase rose 72 cents to $85.35. Stocks that pay large dividends traded lower as bond yields rose. Dominion Resources dropped $4.26, or 5.6 per cent, to $72 after a weak quarterly report. ENERGY: Oil prices stayed within a small range. U.S. crude added $1.07, or 2 per cent, to close at $53.88 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, gained $1.12, or 2 per cent, to $56.70 a barrel in London. U.S. oil has stayed between roughly $52 and $55 a barrel for the last two months. The S&P 500’s energy company index is on track to fall for the fifth day in a row. It’s down 3 per cent over that time and has sunk 7 per cent since Dec. 13. ALUMINUM ACTIVISM: Lightweight aluminum products maker Arconic surged after its largest shareholder said the company needs new leadership. Elliott Management nominated five potential directors to Arconic’s board. The company said it stands by CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and that Elliott’s moves are not in the best interest of all shareholders. Since Arconic split from Alcoa on Nov. 1, Arconic stock is almost flat and Alcoa has jumped more than 60 per cent. Arconic gained $2.48, or 10.9 per cent, to $25.22. CURRENCIES: The dollar gained strength after the jobs survey. It rose to 113.30 yen from 112.76 yen. The euro fell to $1.0755 from $1.0803. METALS: The price of gold slipped $3.10 to $1,208.30 an ounce. Silver lost 9 cents to $17.45 an ounce. Copper fell 2 cents to $2.71 1 pound. OVERSEAS: Stocks in Europe got a boost from the ADP survey and a report that said manufacturing in China grew at its fastest pace in two years in January. Heavy government spending and more lending by banks helped keep the economy steady. Germany’s DAX added 1.1 per cent while the CAC 40 of France rose 1 per cent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain picked up 0.1 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.6 per cent after a skid on Tuesday. The Kospi in South Korea jumped 0.6 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.2 per cent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and serves on its Board of Directors. Before being named CEO in August 2011, Tim was Apple's Chief Operating Officer and was responsible for all of the company's worldwide sales and operations. By Matt Egan NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Apple is suddenly on fire again. Shares of the iPhone maker surged 6% on Wednesday to their highest level since July 2015. Apple is now up an impressive 11% so far this year, blowing past the rest of the stock market. Apple's latest rally was triggered by this week's strong earnings report that raised hopes on Wall Street about the potential for blockbuster demand for the next generation of iPhones. Not only did Apple post its first sales increase in a year, but Tim Cook & Co. sent positive signals about demand heading into the rumored release of iPhone 8 later this year. Timothy Acuri, a Cowen & Co. analyst who covers Apple, predicted in a research report that there will be a "powder-keg fueled super cycle this fall" for the iPhone. Apple said the number of iPhone users is growing by "strong double-digits" right now. "That's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's big driver for our services business," Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, said during Tuesday's conference call. Apple's services division, which includes Apple Pay and AppleCare, enjoyed an 18% pop in sales last quarter to exceed $7 billion. Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba was so encouraged by Apple's iPhone growth that he upgraded his price target on the stock to $135. (Apple closed at $121.35 on Tuesday but has since surged as high as $128.48). "This is clearly helpful. Apple has a very sticky and loyal customer base. People who end up in Apple's family are there for a long time," Lamba said. Apple hasn't officially named its new iPhone yet, but Lamba believes it will be iPhone 8. Expectations are high about the new iPhone in part because this year marks the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone launch. The key will be whether the new iPhone packs powerful enough features after complaints that the last few iterations didn't include improvements dramatic enough to justify upgrading. "The more we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate," Apple's CFO said. Hopes for compelling features and strong demand for the iPhone is why Cowen & Co.'s Acuri believes Wall Street "continues to grossly underestimate" Apple's ability to grow profits the next few quarters. Despite all the hopes for the iPhone 8, Apple still faces a number of challenges. Apple execs admit that the strong U.S. dollar hurts the company by making products sold overseas more expensive for foreigners. While the greenback surged after the election, it has since cooled off considerably. Apple is still also contending with what remains an oversaturated smartphone market. Apple won't be able to rely on help from Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 fiasco for much longer. Still, Cowen & Co. believes it's almost a "layup" that Apple shares rise to $135 over the next 12 years. Acuri said he can "easily" see Apple jumping to $145 or even $150. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Register for an Exam Today> Google Chrome for iOS Is Now Open Source By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 01 2017 For the first time, developers have open source access to Google's Chrome code for iOS. Google built its Chrome browser on source code from its Chromium open source project, but until now that code repository hasn't included Chrome for iOS. That was because to build the Chrome browser for Apple's mobile operating system, Google needed to use two rendering engines: its own Blink engine and Apple's WebKit engine. While WebKit has been open source since 2005, Google faced "extra complexities" in having to support both engines in its code for iOS, so the company hadn't previously made it open source. By contrast, Chrome for Android has been almost entirely open source since 2015. Before that, the Chromium open source project was focused mostly on the Chrome browser for desktops. Years of Code Changes To Get Here "Historically, the code for Chrome for iOS was kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project due to the additional complexity required for the platform," Googler Rohit Rao wrote yesterday on the Chromium blog. "After years of careful refactoring, all of this code is rejoining Chromium and being moved into the open source repository." By open-sourcing the Chrome for iOS code, Google has made it possible for developers to compile that code just as easily as they can for other versions of Chrome. That will also help speed up development times for new applications built on the Chrome for iOS code. Rao noted that getting to this point has taken some time because of the fact that Chrome for iOS uses both the WebKit and Blink engines. "That created some extra complexities which we wanted to avoid placing in the Chromium code base," Rao said. "Given Chrome's commitment to open source code, we've spent a lot of time over the past several years making the changes required to upstream the code for Chrome for iOS into Chromium. Today, that upstreaming is complete, and developers can compile the iOS version of Chromium like they can for other versions of Chromium." Browser Rendering Improvements On Monday, Google also said that it had rolled out several changes to Chrome's rendering pipeline over the past few months that are designed to help Web site images in the Chrome browser "load faster, run smoother, and use less power." Those changes mean Chrome "now more intelligently skips redundant tasks, chooses optimal rendering algorithms, and better utilizes system hardware," Google painting professional Chris Harrelson said in a blog post. The improvements to Chrome are designed to make it not just faster, but smarter, Harrelson noted. Previously, on a Web page with frequent Document Object Model changes, for example, Chrome would have redrawn any image tiles if some pixels had changed. Now, Harrelson said, "If only a few pixels have changed, it's faster to copy the entire tile from the previous frame and then update the new pixels. Chrome can now intelligently choose the redraw pipeline that will be faster, reducing tile redraw time by up to 40 [percent]." The goal with Chrome's rendering updates is to help Web site displays load at an optimal rate of 60 frames per second, which "feels fast and responsive to users," Harrelson said, adding that additional improvements with that same goal are in the works. "The rendering pipeline is only one piece of the puzzle, and we've got a lot more coming," he said.

Trump's Android Phone a Hack Risk? Next Article > Apple Releases watchOS Beta with Theater Mode, SiriKit By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: JANUARY 31 2017 Released to developers yesterday, the beta version of the latest software for the Apple Watch adds new features such as the ability for theater-goers to keep their devices silent and the devices' screens dim. The new release also expands the ability of users to use Siri, Apple's intelligent digital assistant, on their watches. The first version of watchOS 3 was released in September with the launch of Apple Watch Series 2. The beta version of watchOS 3.2 introduces new dimming and mute capabilities through Theater Mode. That mode not only makes it easier for users to quickly mute the sound of their Apple Watches to avoid disturbing fellow theater-goers, but also prevents the screens of their devices from automatically waking and brightening when they raise their wrists. Apple's latest software update also adds SiriKit to allow developers to provide more Siri-based capabilities through third-party apps built for the Apple Watch. The addition of SiriKit also makes it possible for watch owners to use the digital assistant to book rides, send messages, make payments and handle other tasks. Haptic Notifications in Theater Mode The developer documentation for watchOS 3.2 was first published by Apple last week. While the beta software is now available to developers, it's unclear when the update will be released to the general public. With the new Theater Mode, users will be able to "quickly mute the sound on their Apple Watch and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise," Apple said in its software documentation. While the device remains dim and quiet in Theater Mode, users can continue to receive updates via haptic notifications, i.e., vibrating alerts. To check on a notification while the watch is in Theater Mode, users can either tap the screen or press the device's Digital Crown navigation tool. Q1 Results Due Later Today In September, Apple also opened up its digital assistant to third-party app developers for the iPhone and iPad when it released iOS 10. Such apps have also been supported on the Apple Watch, but to date users haven't been able to control the functions of those apps using Siri's help. With the introduction of SiriKit for the beta version of watchOS 3.2, developers can now build new intelligent capabilities into their Apple Watch apps. Siri will be able to understand and respond to user commands in a number of domains, including messaging, payments, ride booking, workouts, calling and photo searches. Meanwhile, Apple is preparing to announce its Q1 2017 financial results during a conference call at 5 p.m. Eastern time today. In its previous quarterly report, released in October, the company reported Q4 revenues of $46.8 billion, including more than $28.1 billion from iPhone sales and nearly $2.4 billion from the sales of Apple Watch, Apple TV, iPod, Beats and accessories.

That sounds serious, and would definitely have you click. Once you do, you read an article written by "Liza Lovdahl-Gormsen" without any sources, which is basically an almost word-for-word rehash of letters and answers from Tim Cook about the tax deal. The lack of sources and Tim Cook-ery tone of the piece should set off thousands of huge and loud alarm bells in anyone's mind, but it isn't until the very last paragraph of the "article" that the reader stumbles upon this: Liza Lovdahl-Gormsen is director of the Competition Law Forum and senior research fellow in competition law. This article was commissioned from her by Apple and supplied to The Irish Times Pathetic and disingenuous at best, intentionally misleading and ethically reprehensible at worst. The fact that the biggest, richest, and most powerful company in the world has to resort to this kind of unethical behaviour should tell you all you need to know about how certain Apple is of its own claims about the tax deal.

Investors are thrilled with Apple’s latest results, but much of what Tim Cook had to say last night was aimed at consumers. Barron’s Next reads between the lines. By Alex Eule Updated Feb. 1, 2017 4:15 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple CEO Tim Cook on stage during the company's company's Oct. 27 MacBook announcement. Last night, Cook told investors that Macs had their best-ever quarter of sales. Photo: Getty Images Apple investors are feeling good about last night’s earnings report. Shares -- up 5.6% Wednesday -- are having their best day since July of last year. If the gains hold up, it would be Apple’s highest close in 18 months. Most of the excitement is around strong iPhone sales, but Tim Cook had other interesting things to say during Apple’s investor call last night. Here are some of the highlights from Cook, with some additional context from Barron’s Next (in italics): iPhones: “While iPhone 7 is our most popular model, we saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which was a higher portion of the new product mix than we’ve ever seen with Plus models in the past. Demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded supply throughout the quarter, and we came into supply/demand balance in January.” The real test comes later this year, when Apple releases its next iPhone, marking the smartphone’s 10th anniversary. As the stock makes gains, investor expectations for the debut head ever higher. Macs: “The Mac not only returned to growth but generated its highest quarterly revenue ever. Our latest data shows that most Mac customers are buying their first Mac, with the vast majority of them coming from a Windows PC. The new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is an outstanding example of the innovation made possible by integrating world-class hardware and software.” Innovation, perhaps. But the new Macbooks have faced more than their usual share of criticism, including a rather lukewarm review from Consumer Reports about the battery life of the devices. Apple has since provided a software update that Consumer Reports says fixed the issue. Apple Watch: “It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, both units and revenues, with holiday demand so strong that we couldn’t make enough...it is the gold standard for smartwatches.” We still don’t know how many watches Apple has actually sold and third-party data have indicated weakness. AirPods: “We’re also thrilled with the response to AirPods...They’re far ahead of anything else on the market today, and we’re working hard to catch up with the incredible demand.” In our view, the AirPods represent Apple innovation at its best. HomeKit -- Apple’s home automation platform “Now when I say good morning to Siri, my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace.” In terms of home use, Siri remains way behind Amazon and Google, whose voice assistants have become cult-like phenomenons.

Over the quarter Apple sold 39,000 metric tons of iPhones, the equivalent of 630 modern battle tanks. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | February 1, 2017 -- 19:00 GMT (11:00 PST) | Topic: iPhone Apple sold a record 78.29 million iPhones over the 1Q 17 quarter. That's a lot of iPhones. So many that quite a few people have said that they just can't get their heads around it. What's Hot on ZDnet The five industries leading the IoT revolution Robots and AI: Should we treat them like pets, or people? IBM's Watson wants to help you do your taxes at H&R Block Google pushes ahead to make its cloud better for Windows enterprise users Let's break it down. Must read: Five things you shouldn't buy from Apple That means that for the 98 days that spanned the quarter Apple sold 798,877 iPhones a day, or 33,286 every hour, or 554 every minute. That works out at more than nine iPhones sold a second, for every second during that 98-day period. And remember that each of those iPhones sold for an average of $695. Assuming that each boxed iPhone weighs approximately 500g, give or take, that's over 39,000 metric tons of iPhones, which is the equivalent of about 630 Abrams M1A2 battle tanks. That's a lot of product to shift in little over three months. And remember, the components for these have to be shipped to the assembly plants, assembled, and then shipped out around the world. iPhones are shipped out of the assembly factories by FedEx using Boeing 777 freighters, each of which can carry 100 metric tons. Doing the math that means it takes almost 400 flights over that three-month period to shift the iPhones. And remember we're just talking about a single product line, and it doesn't include iPads or MacBooks or iMacs or anything else that Apple sells. And each iPhone ships with EarPods ,a regional charger, a Lighting cable, and a booklet which, well, I'm not sure what's in the booklet because I don't think I've ever read it (who has time for that, am I right?). Think 78 million is a lot? Consider that since its release Apple has manufactured, shipped, and sold over a billion iPhones. The scale of the supply chain and distribution network, not to mention the assembly, testing and quality control, for so many handsets is truly mind-boggling.

The value of Google’s brand was put at £86.7billion, an increase of 24 per cent on the previous year. Apple’s slumped 28 per cent to £84billion. Alamy 2 Google has taken over as most valuable brand in the world The 2017 rankings came from Brand Finance, whose chief David Haigh said: “Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. “New versions of the iPhone delivered diminishing returns. “There are signs the company has reached saturation point for its brand.” The consultants’ report said Google remained largely unchallenged in its main search business with ad revenues up a fifth. Coca-Cola was down 11 places to 27th and Pepsi fell 13 to 67th as scrutiny around the marketing of sugary drinks to kids gained pace. Alamy 2 Apple have lost the top spot after five years But Visa (up 44 places to 57th) and MasterCard (up 55 places to 110th) gained in the move to a cashless society.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 1, 2017 at 1:19PM The first quarter of an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fiscal year is usually the company's peak quarter, as it follows the launch of Apple's latest flagship iPhone device. The iPhone generates the bulk of the company's revenue, and so the quarter in which Apple sees the most iPhone shipments is the quarter in which it sees its greatest revenue. Apple's iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple. Although there were rumors that Apple was seeing relatively tepid demand for its latest iPhone models -- the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus -- the company's financial performance tells a different tale. Apple reported shipping a record 78.29 million iPhones in the first quarter, handily beating its previous quarterly record of just shy of 75 million units. CEO Tim Cook said that it saw "exceptional demand" for iPhones that "beat [Apple's] own internal expectations." This robust unit demand didn't come at the expense of average selling prices, either -- iPhone average selling prices in the quarter came in at just a hair under $695. Just as the iPhone business is the star of the company's most recent earnings report, the iPhone 7 Plus appears to be the star of the iPhone business. iPhone 7 Plus is a smash hit Cook said that the iPhone 7 is the company's "most popular model," but he highlighted the fact that the company saw "especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus." Demand was so strong, in fact, that Cook says that the iPhone 7 Plus made up "a higher portion of the new product mix than [Apple has] ever seen with Plus models in the past." To further drive the point home, even given the stronger-than-expected unit shipment performance during the quarter, Apple reported that "demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded supply throughout the quarter" and that the company only "came into supply/demand balance in January." And, finally, it's worth pointing out that Apple is seeing this unexpectedly strong iPhone 7 Plus demand even though it priced the devices at a $20 premium to where it had priced previous iPhone Plus models (which previously carried $100 premiums over their non-Plus counterparts). Clearly, Apple's customer base likes what the company did with the iPhone 7 Plus and was willing to pay a premium for the added features. In the past, Apple had differentiated its Plus models with larger, sharper displays as well as some very minor camera enhancements (i.e., optical image stabilization). However, this time around, in addition to the usual points of differentiation, Apple included a dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus which enabled an interesting optical zoom feature. The key lesson here is that if Apple brings interesting innovations and features to premium products and tries to charge a premium for those features, then it may very well get paid for those features. Open sesame At this point, it's obvious what Apple should do next -- introduce even higher-priced iPhones with even more interesting features and points of differentiation. Apple shouldn't go wild adding in every feature under the sun, but its product definition and marketing teams should now have the freedom to go ahead and build products with higher cost structures that are intended to sell at higher price points. Such products, launched in conjunction with models priced at the more "typical" price points, could be quite successful for the company. In fact, current rumors suggest that Apple is planning to launch two straightforward successors to this year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and then higher up in the product stack, the company may launch an iPhone with a curved OLED display and other goodies. If the upcoming OLED iPhone is a fundamentally compelling product -- and I think it will be -- then I could see Apple successfully charging even more for it than it does for its top iPhone 7 Plus models. The next couple of years could be very interesting for Apple's iPhone product line and, ultimately, its business! Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Prices rose above $US,6000 a metric ton in London. Some 99 per cent of members voted in favour of a strike, which could start on Monday, according to a statement from Union Number 1. Its 2492 members represent about 95 per cent of Escondida's workers. The project is the world's largest copper mine, and is forecast to produce about 1.1 million tonnes in the 12 months to June 30, according to BHP.

More videos BHP faces Chile copper mine strike The latest developments in BHP Billiton's negotiations with workers at the company's Escondida copper mine in Chile. Copper has surged to the highest since 2015 as demand recovered and investors anticipated higher infrastructure spending from Donald Trump's new administration. Citigroup has warned of the increased risk of strikes this year as workers seek pay rises, with almost a fifth of global mine capacity facing contract renewals. While there's still time for an 11th-hour agreement under Chilean law, a strike at Escondida would serve as a precedent for another 15 contracts up for renewal in the country, according to BTG Pactual. "The strength of the vote closes the door to any attempt by the company to introduce its disastrous plans to lower costs through making the workforce cheaper," the union said in the statement. "If Escondida imposes its policies, it will pave the way for other companies to do the same." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link A strike at Escondida would add to expectations of more disruption in copper this year after a benign 2016 UBS Group analyst Daniel Morgan said. Photo: Martin Leissl A request for comment from BHP wasn't immediately answered. A strike at Escondida would add to expectations of more disruption in copper this year after a benign 2016 UBS Group analyst Daniel Morgan said by phone from Sydney. About 1 million tonnes of output, or 5 per cent of supply, may be disrupted in 2017 compared to around 600,000 tonnes last year, he said. Advertisement Three-month copper - which has risen about 32 per cent over the past 12 months - ended at $US5991 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange on Tuesday, the highest close since June 2015 as the Escondida vote was under way. On Wednesday, the metal gained as much as 0.3 per cent to $US6007, before closing down 0.7 per cent at $US5947 a tonne. Union not seeking extension The potential stoppage at Escondida coincides with an interruption to supplies from Indonesia's Grasberg, the world's second-biggest mine, where exports of concentrate have been halted amid a dispute between Freeport-McMoRan, the world's biggest publicly traded copper producer, and the government. A halt to shipments from Grasberg, flooding and road disruption around Freeport's Cerro Verde mine in Peru, and some shipping delays because of poor weather in northern Peru are among issues impacting supply, Morgan said. "The copper price does seem to be supported," he said. UBS forecasts the metal to average about $US6600 a ton this year. In talks through January at Escondida, the company offered workers no wage increase and a reduction of benefits, according to the union, while workers demanded a 7 per cent pay rise and a bonus of 25 million Chilean pesos ($US39,000). In a statement on January 24, Melbourne-based BHP said it has kept full health-care coverage for workers and added new benefits. Chilean rules give both sides two days to ask for an extension of five working days to continue negotiating. If they do, talks would run until next week, when an additional five-day extension could be requested. The union doesn't plan to request an extension, spokesman Carlos Allendes said by telephone. "If the company requests the extension it has to use it to put forward concrete proposals," he said. "If it uses these extra days to propose the same, it will be mocking workers, but if we see real advances then we would agree to extend the negotiation five more days." Last month, a strike at Yamana Gold's El Penon gold-silver mine in Chile ended after the Toronto-based company offered to pay a 13 million-peso bonus, a 30,000-peso salary increase this year and 10,000-peso raises in 2018 and 2019, according to Chile's Mining Federation. Workers in six unions at Codelco's Chuquicamata mine signed a 27-month contract in December that included a signing bonus of 4.35 million pesos but no real increase in wages. The bonus was about 40 per cent below the previous contract. Advertisement HuffPost Australia James Packers' Crown Resorts Facing A ...

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's Great Quarter Spills Over to Winning the Smartphone Race during the Holiday Quarter | Main | Jury Awards Gaming Industry Giant ZeniMax $500 Million in case against Oculus VR and its Founder Luckey Palmer » February 01, 2017 While Apple's CEO see's 'Some Exciting Things' coming to the iPad, others see nothing but Doom and Gloom   In a single blow, Apple's Q1 2017 financial results crushed the collective negative financial analyst community to point of embarrassment. Apple delivered a nice pie for each of their faces and joyfully rubbed it in as they broke yet another revenue record yesterday with iPhone 7 sales shocking all estimates, even Apple's own internal estimates. Of course there were a few missteps in the quarter, one of them being Apple's iPad which VentureBeat was all too pleased to pounce on in a new report this morning titled "iPad in free fall after sales plunged 22% in Q1."   VentureBeat (VB) reported that "The company said it sold 13.1 million iPads, down 22 percent from the 16.1 million it sold during the holiday season last year. iPad revenue was $5.5 billion, down 19 percent from $7.1 billion a year ago." You could check out Apple's iPad unit sales in the chart above. I highlighed Q1 2017 vs. Q1 2016 two columns over to make it easy to see.   VB further noted that "Last year, the iPad was comfortably Apple's No. 2 product after the iPhone. Now, it's fourth, behind the iPhone, Macs, and Services — even the 'Others' category (Beats, Apple Watch, Apple TV) has almost closed the gap.   The gathering gloom over the iPad deepens further when you consider that three years ago during the holiday period, Apple sold 26 million of them." You could read the VentureBeat report here for more.   As Apple's iPad units fell 22% it just so happens that Microsoft's Surface line gained 29% this quarter. The percentages make it sound like a direct correlation but that's not true. The 29% for Surface growth would roughly work out to 240,000 units at $1000. Of course Microsoft's lowest price is $1000 with most in the $1200 - $1800 range. So that probably translates to a wild estimate of about 185,000 – 200,000 units, and that's being generous. Apple's 29% accounted for a drop of 3,024 million units. So no, Microsoft's Surface didn't make a dent in Apple's iPad market.   In addition, Apple's CFO quoted NPD market research yesterday during Apple's conference call. At the 17: 40 mark of the conference call Luca Maestri stated that NDP's statistics pointed to Apple's iPad having 85% of U.S. market share in tablets priced above $200. So does that sound like a gloomy statistic to you? No, of course not.   Apple's CEO talked about the iPad starting at the 51 minute mark of their conference call and made it clear that they underestimated the demand for the iPad in the holiday quarter and more importantly, had a shortage issue with one of their suppliers that held back sales for the quarter.   Cook added that "if I kind of zoom out of the 90 day clock [meaning looking beyond a single quarter by quarter focus] … we have some exciting things coming on iPad. I still feel very optimistic where we could take the product." Whatever the "shortage" issue was and still is, Cook said it's going to effect Q2 as well. But again he reiterated that beyond the 90 day clock he is very bullish on iPad.   On the tablet front we learn this morning that Samsung is preparing to unveil new tablets during a press conference on Feb. 26, the day before the Mobile World Congress trade show begins.   In the big picture no one really has a clue what they'll be introducing beyond the basics. Yet they could use this event to introduce their new Viv-driven digital assistant called Bixby. Will they save that for their new Galaxy S8 or launch it on their tablet? Another new feature could be adding the curved display edges like they offer on their Edge smartphones.   Apple has a few patent pending ideas for future iPads with a few interesting ones at that, but you just can't count on patents until they actually launch. All we know is that Cook believes that there are "some" exciting things for iPad on the horizon.   The biggest threat to Apple's iPad kingdom in 2017, in my view, could come from the new Windows 10 + Qualcomm platform that is exciting new players to jump on board this train. Players such as Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi, beyond their traditional PC OEM's like HP, Dell, Asus and others, are on board to deliver new mobile products this year that will be thrown into the tablet sector.    These OEMs will be launching Surface and SurfaceBook-like products which will shift many notebooks into the Hybrid Tablet category and drag Apple's market share down measurably over the next few years if these hybrids prove to be successful. This could be a challenge that Apple may decide to counter. A newly granted patent surfaced this week illustrated that Apple is still working on a cellular MacBook. So who knows, maybe it's an iOS based notebook that's a variant of the iPad Pro models. A hard cover iPad versus a softcover with keyboard.   If anything, the challenge from Microsoft's war on the iPad is likely to cause some sparks to fly this year and that's always fun to see play out. Good competition usually gives birth to new ideas that could shake up a sector. The tablet sector could use a little shock therapy in order to get it to the next level. So stay tuned as this could be an interesting year for iPad.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The Cupertino site has been dubbed “the spaceship” because of the UFO-shaped building at the centre of what will be a predominately green site, also complete with a new auditorium for future Apple live events. A popular past time for many local Apple fans is to document the progress of the construction, which is being overseen by design boss Jony Ive, using drones. The latest monthly update shows the solar panels on the spaceship roof, which are nearly all in place now, as well as the impressive auditorium and fitness centre and their surrounding grounds.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business Super Bowl Ads     IOS 11 Expected To Be Launched Without 32-bit Support Posted: Feb 1 2017, 11:30am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Technology News     According to a new alert in iOS 10.3 beta version, Apple will be excluding 32-bit app support in iOS 11. This popup alert unanimously becomes a part of all the 32-bit applications. Every time a user downloads and opens this app, the system will invoke the popup that will warn the user that the application will be rendered incompatible in future versions of the iOS firmware. Don't Miss: The Best CES 2017 Gadgets This is also a wakeup call for developers that they will have to patch all their applications for 64-bit support and only create 64-bit applications in the future. 64-bit architecture was debuted in Apple’s mobile devices in 2013 when iPhone 5S was announced. The new architecture was not just limited to Apple’s engineers. Third-party software developers were also allowed to create and test their applications in 64-bit architecture. Soon the 64-bit applications were accepted by the App Store for evaluation and after being approved, they were allowed to be released to the costumers. Of course, many of the developers deemed it as a good practice to create 64-bit instance of their application along with 32-bit because not only 64-bit architecture offered more features but it was speculated that 32-bit architecture will be discarded at some point. RIP 32-bit emulation mode in iOS 11? pic.twitter.com/byMFuJPuVN— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) January 31, 2017 That point has arrived and yet several software developers have only-32-bit instances of their applications, which will soon be incompatible. In the start of 2015, Apple made it mandatory for developers to submit 64-bit support with the traditional 32-bit support for all the new applications since then. Halfway through 2015, Apple issued another guideline that all the application updates were to be submitted in both, 32-bit and 64-bit versions. All these guidelines are issued for the comfort of the developers. These mandatory orders will make sure that by the release of iOS 11, the App Store is filtered from 32-bit applications, making it equally beneficial for the developers and Apple itself. While the popup alert itself acts as an information source for the users that will enlighten the users about the big change about to take place in the architecture of their operating system.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile The iPhone 8 Will Cost Apple $50 Million For OLED Displays And Affect Margins Claims Analyst By Ramish Zafar Jan 31, 2017 22Shares Share Tweet Submit With the rumor mill’s focus shifting to the Samsung Galaxy S8, leaks related to the iPhone 8 have decreased. Apple will launch three devices this year, according to the rumor mill. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will see the usual ‘S’ upgrades. To mark the lineup’s 10th year anniversary, Cupertino will also launch an iPhone 8. It’s this device which will breathe fresh air in the lineup. The iPhone hasn’t seen much love from the market lately, as Apple’s revenues start to drop due to excessive reliance on the device. Today, we’ve got some more news for the iPhone 8. Take a look below to find out more. Analysts Expect OLED Orders For The iPhone 8 To Chip Away At Apple’s Margins For The Quarter Apple’s earnings for the year end 2016 are due in two hours. As is the norm, analysts and market watchers have started to release their estimates on what to expect from one of the most valuable companies in the world. Times have been tough for Apple, as the company’s revenues fell for the first time in 13 years in 2016. Now, with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus being moderate successes, this trend will stay its course. To make up for lost ground, Apple, just like Samsung will launch a massively overhauled iPhone 8 this year. The device will make the much overdue upgrade to OLED and feature a complete design overhaul. Current whispers from the rumor mill suggest that, just like the Galaxy S8, the iPhone 8 won’t feature a home button either. It’s interesting how Samsung and Apple manage to stay exactly toe to toe when it comes to flagship upgrades.   Advertisement   The fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 8 will be virtual, and will be embedded in the device’s screen. Furthermore, the device will also feature an edge to edge screen. Now, Tim Arcury of Cowen & Company believes that OLED orders for the iPhone 8 will make up for a $50 million expense on the company’s income statement. This will cause the company’s gross margins to stay at 39% YoY. Arcuri also believes that the margins would have increased if it wasn’t for this expense, as component costs decrease with time. With earnings due in just two hours, we’ll find out soon enough whether he’s on the mark. The iPhone 8 has seen a lot of rumors for a device that’s due in eight months. An interesting point on the device will be Cupertino’s processor choice. 10nm’s due this year but with three models, will Apple differentiate the iPhones based on performance? Or will design and other features be enough? We will find out soon enough. Till then, stay tuned and let us know what you think in the comments section below.   Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The value of Google’s brand was put at £86.7billion, an increase of 24 per cent on the previous year. Apple’s slumped 28 per cent to £84billion. Alamy 2 Google has taken over as most valuable brand in the world The 2017 rankings came from Brand Finance, whose chief David Haigh said: “Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. “New versions of the iPhone delivered diminishing returns. “There are signs the company has reached saturation point for its brand.” The consultants’ report said Google remained largely unchallenged in its main search business with ad revenues up a fifth. Coca-Cola was down 11 places to 27th and Pepsi fell 13 to 67th as scrutiny around the marketing of sugary drinks to kids gained pace. Alamy 2 Apple have lost the top spot after five years But Visa (up 44 places to 57th) and MasterCard (up 55 places to 110th) gained in the move to a cashless society.

By noon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 3.05 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 19,867.14. The S&P 500 fell 3.83 points, or 0.17 per cent, to 2,275.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 12.87 points, or 0.23 per cent, to 5,627.65, Xinhua news agency reported. After Tuesday's closing bell, Apple announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 first quarter ending December 31, 2016. The tech giant posted all-time record quarterly revenue of $78.4 billion and all-time record quarterly earnings per diluted share of $3.36. The company's shares jumped over 5 per cent around midday Wednesday following the release of its better-than-expected quarterly results. The Fed was also in the spotlight, which is scheduled to release its latest policy decision after the conclusion of its two-day meeting Wednesday afternoon. Analysts widely hold that the Fed won't hike rates at this meeting, but it will still be watched closely for more clues on the timing of the next rate increase. At its December meeting, the US central bank raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, the first and only time in 2016, and indicated a faster rate hike pace in 2017. On the economic front, US private sector employment increased by 246,000 jobs from December 2016 to January 2017, well above the market consensus of 168,000, said the January ADP National Employment Report Wednesday. On Tuesday, US stocks closed mixed as Wall Street digested a batch of generally negative quarterly results from notable companies. --IANS vgu/ SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

Apple’s market share for Q4 2016 was 17.8%, a whole 0.1% lead over Samsung’s 17.7% making it the top global smartphone vendor. Image Courtesy of Strategy Analytics However the hit to Samsung’s sales is attributed to recall of 2.5 million of its most popular flagship offering the Galaxy Note7 over faulty batteries which could have easily secured Samsung’s lead. This stimulated some Samsung customers to migrate to Apple as is seen from the announcement made by Tim Cook that the iPhone 7 Plus, which is roughly the same size as the discontinued Note7, is their best selling ‘Plus’ iPhone ever. But the year has just begun and Samsung is set to announce the Galaxy S8 around March this year which will pull out all the stops to redeem its dented reputation while Apple also will be bringing in (hopefully) something new for its 10 year anniversary since the first iPhone. Fierce competition is also coming in from the return of Nokia who had the Nokia 6 selling out in 60 seconds posing a significant threat to the titans of the business. advertisement share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Apple, Nokia, Samsung Previous Post « NetOne capped OneFusion, WhatsApp & Facebook data because some subscribers were abusing it Next post TelOne begins US$98 million network project, promises better services, new products like social media bundles » 4 Comments Fatso says: February 1, 2017 at 1:08 PM Apple is the oracle.Didi you get yesterday’s q2 financials Reply Charles Muzonzini says: February 1, 2017 at 1:19 PM ” Apple’s market share for Q4 2016 was 17.8%, a whole 1% lead over Samsung’s 17.7% making it the top global smartphone vendor.” 0.1% not 1% Reply Hyung Samsung says: February 1, 2017 at 2:01 PM Apple will have its moment in the sun but our tri-star overlord shall rise again to even greater heights!

While you were sleeping: Apple stock rallies Feb. 2 (BusinessDesk) – The US dollar rose while Wall Street was mixed, with Apple shares rallying on its better-than-expected sales of its latest iPhone model. US Federal Reserve policy makers are wrapping up a two-day meeting, and investors will scrutinise their statement for clues on the pace of interest rate rises amid the latest economic data and the rocky start for President Donald Trump. The Fed is not expected to raise rates this time. The latest US economic data on factory activity and jobs were better than expected. The ADP National Employment Report showed US private employers added a higher-than-expected 246,000 jobs in January, up from 151,000 in the previous month. Separately, an Institute for Supply Management report showed its national factory activity index rose to a reading of 56.0 in December, a two-year high. “The economy is off to the races with the wind at its back,” Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York, told Reuters. “The Fed will lift rates three times in 2017 for sure, and maybe they might need to add a rate hike or start the year earlier with a policy firming in March.” Wall Street was mixed. In 1.11pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.4 percent. In 12.56pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index inched 0.1 percent lower. “We’re in a very stable market with a lot of cross-currents. Fourth-quarter earnings seem to be okay,” Chuck Self, chief investment officer at iSectors in Appleton, Wisconsin, told Reuters. “However, political uncertainty is making it hard for investors to have conviction in the market.” The Dow moved higher on gains in shares of Apple, which recently traded 6.5 percent higher. Meanwhile shares United Technologies and those of Exxon Mobil posted the largest percentage declines in the Dow, recently down 1.4 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. Apple posted quarterly revenue that beat expectations, reporting that sales rose 3.3 percent to US$78.4 billion in the last three months of 2016. “We were surprised by the strength of iPhone 7 Plus where we were actually short of supply throughout the quarter,” Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Bloomberg. “We’ve been able to come into supply-demand balance in January.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.6 percent gain from the previous close, bolstered by earnings from Volvo and Siemens. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index added 0.1 percent, France’s CAC 40 Index climbed 1 percent and Germany’s DAX Index increased 1.1 percent.

(Reuters/Beck Diefenbach) Share Written by Ashley Rodriguez Obsession Glass February 01, 2017 Apple doesn’t have a solid TV strategy yet. But CEO Tim Cook thinks he can see the writing on the wall—the much loathed cable-TV bundle is on its deathbed. Speaking on the earnings call after Apple posted a record first quarter, Cook said (emphasis added): The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry that I fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down is, one, we started the new Apple TV a year ago, and we’re pleased with how that platform has come along. We have more things planned for it but it’s come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clear platform to build off of. Apple is on the fourth generation of the Apple TV. It now has an app that makes recommendations across streaming-video services and has a universal search function; it is currently limited by only allowing you to find a program across a limited selection of third-party services, but it has the potential to become the online equivalent to a TV Guide for all programming. (The company is also developing a library of original content tied to its Apple Music subscription.) Media experts have been forecasting the death of the traditional TV bundles for years (BTIG Research media analyst Rich Greenfield tweets with the hashtag “#goodluckbundle”)—and it hasn’t happened yet. But there has definitely been some movement, as Cook pointed out. Popular cable networks like ESPN are losing subscribers because of unbundling, cord-cutting is becoming more common, TV brands like HBO offer their own subscriptions on platforms like Apple TV, and streaming services like Netflix are hitting member records. So far, bundling hasn’t as yet disappeared in the US. It’s just taken on new forms. Companies like Verizon have released slimmed-down packages that allow customers to cherry pick the channels they pay for. Dish Network’s SlingTV, Sony’s Playstation Vue, and AT&T’s DirecTV Now, among others, offer live and on-demand TV packages through the internet. And Hulu and YouTube are expected to introduce live TV offerings this year. None of these packages seem to top the user experience that you get with cable yet. But they have their benefits—they’re more affordable, the video quality is improving, and their customer-support teams can’t possibly be as miserable to deal with as those at the cable company. But with Apple, and now Facebook, expanding into the TV business, a real contender that could take down cable might soon emerge.

Anytime. Anywhere. Google Chrome for iOS Is Now Open Source By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Business Report PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 01 2017 For the first time, developers have open source access to Google's Chrome code for iOS. Google built its Chrome browser on source code from its Chromium open source project, but until now that code repository hasn't included Chrome for iOS. That was because to build the Chrome browser for Apple's mobile operating system, Google needed to use two rendering engines: its own Blink engine and Apple's WebKit engine. While WebKit has been open source since 2005, Google faced "extra complexities" in having to support both engines in its code for iOS, so the company hadn't previously made it open source. By contrast, Chrome for Android has been almost entirely open source since 2015. Before that, the Chromium open source project was focused mostly on the Chrome browser for desktops. Years of Code Changes To Get Here "Historically, the code for Chrome for iOS was kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project due to the additional complexity required for the platform," Googler Rohit Rao wrote yesterday on the Chromium blog. "After years of careful refactoring, all of this code is rejoining Chromium and being moved into the open source repository." By open-sourcing the Chrome for iOS code, Google has made it possible for developers to compile that code just as easily as they can for other versions of Chrome. That will also help speed up development times for new applications built on the Chrome for iOS code. Rao noted that getting to this point has taken some time because of the fact that Chrome for iOS uses both the WebKit and Blink engines. "That created some extra complexities which we wanted to avoid placing in the Chromium code base," Rao said. "Given Chrome's commitment to open source code, we've spent a lot of time over the past several years making the changes required to upstream the code for Chrome for iOS into Chromium. Today, that upstreaming is complete, and developers can compile the iOS version of Chromium like they can for other versions of Chromium." Browser Rendering Improvements On Monday, Google also said that it had rolled out several changes to Chrome's rendering pipeline over the past few months that are designed to help Web site images in the Chrome browser "load faster, run smoother, and use less power." Those changes mean Chrome "now more intelligently skips redundant tasks, chooses optimal rendering algorithms, and better utilizes system hardware," Google painting professional Chris Harrelson said in a blog post. The improvements to Chrome are designed to make it not just faster, but smarter, Harrelson noted. Previously, on a Web page with frequent Document Object Model changes, for example, Chrome would have redrawn any image tiles if some pixels had changed. Now, Harrelson said, "If only a few pixels have changed, it's faster to copy the entire tile from the previous frame and then update the new pixels. Chrome can now intelligently choose the redraw pipeline that will be faster, reducing tile redraw time by up to 40 [percent]." The goal with Chrome's rendering updates is to help Web site displays load at an optimal rate of 60 frames per second, which "feels fast and responsive to users," Harrelson said, adding that additional improvements with that same goal are in the works. "The rendering pipeline is only one piece of the puzzle, and we've got a lot more coming," he said.

Trump's Android Phone a Hack Risk? Next Article > Apple Releases watchOS Beta with Theater Mode, SiriKit By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Business Report PUBLISHED: JANUARY 31 2017 Released to developers yesterday, the beta version of the latest software for the Apple Watch adds new features such as the ability for theater-goers to keep their devices silent and the devices' screens dim. The new release also expands the ability of users to use Siri, Apple's intelligent digital assistant, on their watches. The first version of watchOS 3 was released in September with the launch of Apple Watch Series 2. The beta version of watchOS 3.2 introduces new dimming and mute capabilities through Theater Mode. That mode not only makes it easier for users to quickly mute the sound of their Apple Watches to avoid disturbing fellow theater-goers, but also prevents the screens of their devices from automatically waking and brightening when they raise their wrists. Apple's latest software update also adds SiriKit to allow developers to provide more Siri-based capabilities through third-party apps built for the Apple Watch. The addition of SiriKit also makes it possible for watch owners to use the digital assistant to book rides, send messages, make payments and handle other tasks. Haptic Notifications in Theater Mode The developer documentation for watchOS 3.2 was first published by Apple last week. While the beta software is now available to developers, it's unclear when the update will be released to the general public. With the new Theater Mode, users will be able to "quickly mute the sound on their Apple Watch and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise," Apple said in its software documentation. While the device remains dim and quiet in Theater Mode, users can continue to receive updates via haptic notifications, i.e., vibrating alerts. To check on a notification while the watch is in Theater Mode, users can either tap the screen or press the device's Digital Crown navigation tool. Q1 Results Due Later Today In September, Apple also opened up its digital assistant to third-party app developers for the iPhone and iPad when it released iOS 10. Such apps have also been supported on the Apple Watch, but to date users haven't been able to control the functions of those apps using Siri's help. With the introduction of SiriKit for the beta version of watchOS 3.2, developers can now build new intelligent capabilities into their Apple Watch apps. Siri will be able to understand and respond to user commands in a number of domains, including messaging, payments, ride booking, workouts, calling and photo searches. Meanwhile, Apple is preparing to announce its Q1 2017 financial results during a conference call at 5 p.m. Eastern time today. In its previous quarterly report, released in October, the company reported Q4 revenues of $46.8 billion, including more than $28.1 billion from iPhone sales and nearly $2.4 billion from the sales of Apple Watch, Apple TV, iPod, Beats and accessories.

By Shawn Langlois Published: Feb 1, 2017 6:21 p.m. ET Share ‘The YOLO Wolf did nothing wrong’ YouTube By ShawnLanglois Social-media editor Well, either it was an elaborate ruse perfectly crafted for the fake news age, or there’s some furry Canadian out there licking his wounds after getting caught on the wrong side of an extremely ill-timed Apple AAPL, -0.17%  trade. Regardless, it made for great internet. It all started a few days ago with a 5,000-word explanation by a guy named F.S. Comeau that detailed how he was risking hundreds of thousands of dollars in hopes of making millions. From there, he took it to YouTube, where he live-streamed the event on Tuesday, while wearing a wolf mask, to about 15,000 viewers. It was weird, uncomfortable, hilarious and sad all at once. Comeau sipped champagne through a straw, promised bottles of maple syrup to his followers, howled through his wolf mask, and ultimately lamented the direction of Apple shares after the company’s strong earnings report. Viewers were quick to call “BS,” pointing out that the trade screen he pulled up was just a demo account. And, indeed, it was. But Comeau stuck to his story. “I was streaming my demo account online as I did not want to accidentally reveal my account number and address,” he said in an email Tuesday night. “People are just looking for a reason to be outraged.” Comeau clung to his hopes that Apple would reverse course and his $240,000 options play would pay off. No such luck so far. Apple is on track for its best day in months.

For the love of glory, Winston Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt once wore it.” So yes, as The Fly put it: Godspeed, YOLO Wolf.

Opinion iPad: Big revenue drop shows it’s not a replacement for the Mac iPad revenue dropped again, while Mac sales increased.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Why did Mac sales decline 10% in 2016? Why is Apple letting Macs rot on the tree? Why has Apple marginalized the Mac? Video 4 great gifts for mobile professionals Apple announced its financial results yesterday, and the company did quite well. But there was one product that showed remarkable weakness and it wasn’t the Mac. iPad revenue dropped a whopping 22 percent in the holiday quarter! Roger Fingers reports for AppleInsider: For the holiday quarter, iPad sales fell to just over 13 million units from more than 16.1 million in the year ago period, Apple revealed in official data released on Tuesday. Accordingly, iPad revenue was down 22 percent from just over $7 billion to about $5.5 billion. With some exceptions, iPad sales have been shrinking for the past few years. Compared with the first quarter of 2015, in fact, the company shipped over 8 million fewer units. The iPhone saw shipments of about 78.3 million during the most recent quarter, up 5 percent. Mac units were up 1 percent to just under 5.4 million. All told, the company hit record quarterly revenue of $78.4 billion. More at AppleInsider Take note of the fact that Mac sales were up one percent, while iPad revenue continued to drop. Why is this significant? Well if you listen to Tim Cook and others, you’d have thought that the iPad was well on its way to replacing the Mac as many people’s primary computing device. That obviously isn’t the case, and I hope the folks running Apple finally realize now that the iPad is not a replacement for the Mac and won’t be for the foreseeable future. Many of Apple’s customers still need Macs and aren’t willing to settle for an iPad as a replacement. Don’t get me wrong here, I love my iPad Pro. It’s a great device and I use it every day. But I cannot work on my iPad Pro, I need a Mac to get things done. iOS still has not matured to the point where it can replace macOS for me, and I don’t see it improving enough in the near future for me to dump my Mac. Apple, of course, has angered many longtime Mac users by regarding the iPhone and other products as being more important than the Mac. Hardware updates to the Mac have lagged, and nobody even knows if the Mac Pro and Mac mini will ever get updated again. So Apple would do well to realize that the Mac is still one of its most important products, and it should make sure that it publishes a road-map for the Mac and then updates its Mac line regularly and predictably. Apple’s customers have voted with their dollars, and it’s crystal clear that very few of them believe that the iPad is a replacement for the Mac. If people could replace their Macs with iPads, iPad sales would be up and Mac sales would be down instead of the other way around. Is anybody at Apple listening? Somehow I doubt it. Instead we'll probably get more propaganda from the company pushing the iPad as a Mac replacement when a new version of the iPad is ready for release. Hey, if you keep saying something over and over again, maybe someday it will be true, right? I'm not the only one who took note of the drop in iPad sales, AppleInsider readers also shared their thoughts in a discussion thread. So I'll leave you with this selection of comments from the AppleInsider forum: bcubed1979: “For God's sake, revitalize the Mac lineup, introduce something truly differentiating for the iPhone and make the iPad more versatile (more MacOS -like). At some point, it would be great to have one AppleOS for all devices. ” MplsP: “…iOS is so crippled when it comes to actual productivity work that I can't really consider it. If all you're doing is consuming, then staying in the mac ecosystem isn't as important. I wish Apple would update iOS to be more than just a smart phone OS scaled up for a tablet.” Bestkeptsecret: “I expect the replacement cycle will be very similar to Macs. It is no surprise that Mac sales this quarter exceeded iPad sales. There was a new Mac released. I expect iPad sales to be slightly higher in the quarter that they release a new model. But on across a year, I'd expect Mac and iPad sales to be somewhat similar.” Appex: “Apple should make a true Mac tablet with Intel x86 inside, USB ports, visible file system, etc.” Robin Huber: “Not everyone wants a laptop in tablet clothing. My aging original iPad Air was due for replacement and I hoped for the lighter and better version of the Air 2. Instead, an artist's studio that was even heavier than my old Air. I just want to consume content, not create it. So, I am sitting on my wallet until Apple offers an iPad for the rest of us. No wonder sales are down.” Rogifan_new: “No new models released last fall and no software changes. If iPad doesn't get some software love this year these numbers will continue to decline at at least in the consumer space. iPad's problem is not hardware it's software. But my fear is Apple doesn't recognize that because enterprise sales are still strong. But most likely enterprises are using custom apps and using the device as a general purpose computer. Give me a file system and drag and drop for split screen and I'd be very happy, I know some want windowing and cursor but to me that's perhaps a step to far and starting to turn it into a Mac.” More at AppleInsider Did you miss a post?

However, the Nasdaq, which is more weighted towards technology stocks, was lifted by a 6.4 percent rise in Apple following the company's strong earnings and iPhone sales. A rate hike is not the likely outcome of the Fed's first meeting under President Donald Trump as the central bank awaits more clarity on his policies. But investors will dissect the statement, expected at 2:00 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), to see how the policymakers view the economy under Trump and whether a recent spate of strong economic data alters their take on futures hikes. "We're in a very stable market with a lot of cross-currents. Fourth-quarter earnings seem to be okay," said Chuck Self, chief investment officer at iSectors LLC in Appleton, Wisconsin. "However, political uncertainty is making it hard for investors to have conviction in the market." Investors has paid close attention to Trump's comments and decisions, which have caused volatility. His latest move to restrict travel to the United States unleashed uncertainty and losses on Wall Street in the past few days. At 12:57 p.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was up 17.9 points, or 0.09 percent, at 19,881.99, the S&P 500 was down 1.96 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,276.91 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 19.79 points, or 0.35 percent, at 5,634.58. Investors hope quarterly earnings support valuations, especially after a post-election rally pushed Wall Street to record highs. Fourth-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 7.1 percent - the best growth in nine quarters - according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, investors are struggling with the question of whether the rally has gotten ahead of itself, Self said. The S&P 500 is trading at 17.6 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. The impact of robust private payrolls data also appeared to fizzle out. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with energy's 1.2 percent loss dragging the broader index. Utilities, which pay high dividends and are considered bond proxies, lost 1.7 percent. Dow component Exxon slipped 1.4 percent after a string of price target cuts. The oil major had reported results on Tuesday. While Apple provided the biggest boost to the three indexes after its stock hit an 18-month high, Microsoft fell 1.6 percent and dragged down the S&P and the Nasdaq. Pitney Bowes plunged 18 percent after the mail equipment maker posted fourth-quarter profit and revenue that missed analysts' expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,647 to 1,189. On the Nasdaq, 1,418 issues fell and 1,376 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 30 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 106 new highs and 16 new lows.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Tim Cook teases new Apple iPhone, smart home, more Chris Davies - Feb 1, 2017 5 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit An exciting new iPhone, advanced wearables, and a seamless smart home: Tim Cook was light on specifics but not short on the big picture as he described Apple’s year to come. Speaking on his company’s financial results call, in the afterglow of a record-breaking quarter which saw iPhone sales beat expectations and Mac turn around its decline, Cook name-checked a number of areas Apple will focus on moving forward. Even for struggling sectors like tablets, the CEO is buoyant. Despite naysayers’ predictions, Apple’s Q1 2017 turned out to be a blockbuster. The company announced $78.4bn in revenue, up a healthy $2.5bn from the same three-month period ending December a year ago. Operating cash flow exceeded $27bn, and Apple pumped nearly $15bn back into its share repurchase scheme and into investor dividends. Though the headline figures are impressive, it’s the individual performance in segments many observers predicted might struggle that have given Apple its glow. iPhone sales, which some suggested would struggle because of controversial decisions like dropping the legacy headphone jack, were in fact record-setting. 78.3m iPhones were sold in the quarter, with the iPhone 7 Plus a particular success; indeed, Apple was caught by surprise by just how many people wanted the phablet, and supplies were constrained through much of the period. Mac sales, too, were a shock to some. Despite predictions that the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar wouldn’t meet with favor among the power users so eager for an upgrade, the computers set a revenue record for the company. 5.4 million Macs were sold, in fact, and Apple believes it could’ve sold more had the newest MacBook Pro not been constrained throughout the quarter. Still, with iPhone contributing 69-percent of Apple’s fortunes, investors were keen to hear what Apple was working on as the next potential blockbuster. Part of that will be accessories, and while Apple is ramping up production of its AirPods wireless earbuds to meet lingering demand, it’s also looking ahead to how it can make more use of the W1 wireless chipset that’s inside. There’s “huge growth potential for wearables going forward,” Cook argued. As we found in our own testing of the AirPods, one of the reasons the wireless ‘buds are so successful is that the W1 chip makes pairing and managing audio so straightforward. That streamlining of connectivity could be just as useful in automotive settings – Cook said CarPlay, the iPhone-based infotainment system that’s now supported by every major automaker, is being used by a million drivers – and in the smart home. There, too, Cook had comments. The CEO described how he already uses HomeKit, Apple’s unifying smart home system, to interact with his connected devices each day. “When I say good morning to Siri,” he explained, “my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace.” HomeKit has faced criticism from some quarters, primarily for Apple’s requirement that compatible devices contain custom silicon which adds to the overall bill-of-materials. However, given the increasing attention being paid to smart home and IoT security, that strategy is looking more and more sensible. As researchers predict an uptick in the number of IoT hacks – including the potential for households to be “held ransom” by malware affecting their connected lights, locks, appliances, and more – and privacy advocates voice concerns about just how much data we’re sharing about ourselves and with who, if Apple can leverage that focus on privacy and safety it could reframe Amazon and Google as driving adoption at the cost of security. Without iPhone, of course, there’d be no modern Apple. Asked whether he believed the smartphone segment had reached a saturation point, and that only incremental improvements could be expected moving forward, Cook was contrary. Amid widespread speculation of an “iPhone 8” later this year that will commemorate the anniversary of Apple’s device in style, he teased even more features to come. “I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game,” Cook suggested. “I think there’s lots more to do. Every year, I think it becomes more important to people’s lives, there’s more things people are doing with it.” Unsurprisingly, Cook wouldn’t be drawn on what, exactly, that might entail in terms of keynote features. Nonetheless, with chatter of wireless charging, more unusual form-factors – including rumors of a transparent iPhone, even – and further development of the dual-camera setup on the iPhone 7 Plus, there’s plenty Apple could do in hardware still. Just expect whatever that is to have even greater tie-ins with services. Not only did the App Store make more than double the revenue of the Google Play store in the 2016 calendar year, but Apple is aiming to double its overall services business over the next four years. Cook wouldn’t spill on whether that meant investing in homegrown video content in the manner of Netflix and Amazon – though he pointed to iTunes music exclusives – but it’s clear that Apple’s vision of tomorrow involves more than just the Mac on your desktop and the iPhone in your pocket.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Dow closes up 27 points on Apple's surge Wednesday Feb 1, 2017 at 12:41 PM Feb 1, 2017 at 4:34 PM The Associated Press NEW YORK — Investors didn't react much to a strong hiring survey or the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged Wednesday, and U.S. stocks finished little changed Wednesday. Apple soared after it said iPhone sales improved in its latest quarter. Stocks jumped in morning trading after payroll provider ADP said hiring by private employers grew stronger in January. Bond prices climbed. But the market's gains thinned, partly because investors sold shares of companies that pay big dividends as bond yields rose. Stocks briefly turned higher after the Fed's announcement, but that also faded. The only constant was the big gain for Apple, which pushed technology companies higher. The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged, just as investors expected. The central bank noted that the job market is getting stronger and inflation is gradually rising, but said it wants more time to monitor the economy. That's what investors expected. Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, noted that the central bank just increased rates in December and the Trump administration's spending and fiscal plans still haven't been spelled out. "They'll wait until they actually know what's going to happen," she said of the Fed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.85 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,890.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.68 points to 2,279.55. The Nasdaq composite, which has a high concentration of technology companies, gained 27.86 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,642.65. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks dipped 0.60 points to 1,361.23. Most stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange fell. Apple made its biggest one-day jump six months after its first-quarter profit and sales were better than analysts expected. The company said consumers snapped up its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and that ended the first-ever slump in iPhone sales. Apple stock rose $7.44, or 6.1 percent, to $128.79. Apple was singlehandledly responsible for the Dow gain and it helped take technology stocks higher. Investors haven't focused on company earnings recently because of the flood of political news and other factors, but Warne said results like Apple's will help the market. "The fact that we're seeing solid earnings and they're coming in better than expected ... will help sustain stocks over time," she said. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices reported a profit when analysts expected a loss, and its sales were greater than expected. Its stock climbed $1.69, or 16.3 percent, to $12.06. The ADP jobs survey was better than expected, and the construction, manufacturing, health care and shipping industries all added jobs at a solid pace. The U.S. government will release its own monthly jobs report Friday. Investors reacted to the hiring report by selling bonds, which are relatively safe investments that are in greater demand when the economy seems weaker. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.48 percent from 2.44 percent. Stocks that pay large dividends traded lower as bond yields rose. Dominion Resources dropped $4.43, or 5.8 percent, to $71.85. Dominion also released a weak quarterly report. Oil prices stayed within a small range. U.S. crude added $1.07, or 2 percent, to close at $53.88 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, gained $1.22, or 2.2 percent, to $56.80 a barrel in London. U.S. oil has stayed between roughly $52 and $55 a barrel for the last two months.  The S&P 500's energy company index fell for the fifth day in a row. It's down almost 3.5 percent over that time and has sunk 7 percent since Dec. 13. Lightweight aluminum products maker Arconic surged after its largest shareholder said the company needs new leadership. Elliott Management nominated five potential directors to Arconic's board. The company said it stands by CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and that Elliott's moves are not in the best interest of all shareholders. Since Arconic split from Alcoa on Nov. 1, Arconic stock was almost flat and Alcoa has jumped almost 70 percent. Arconic gained $2.55, or 11.2 percent, to $25.28. The dollar rose to 113.09 yen from 112.76 yen. The euro fell to $1.0744 from $1.0803. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $1.58 a gallon. Heating oil added 4 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $1.67 a gallon. Natural gas rose 5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $3.17 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold slipped $3.10 to $1,208.30 an ounce. Silver lost 9 cents to $17.45 an ounce. Copper fell 2 cents to $2.71 1 pound. Stocks in Europe got a boost from the hiring survey and a report that said manufacturing in China grew at its fastest pace in two years in January. Heavy government spending and more lending by banks helped keep the economy steady. Germany's DAX added 1.1 percent while the CAC 40 of France rose 1 percent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain picked up 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.6 percent after a skid on Tuesday. The Kospi in South Korea jumped 0.6 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.2 percent.

Apple Tops Samsung in the Fourth Quarter to Close Out a Roller Coaster Year for the Smartphone Market, According to IDC February 01, 2017 11:06 AM Eastern Standard Time FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The holiday quarter of 2016 capped off another positive year of smartphone growth despite concerns about the overall market slowing. According to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, smartphone vendors shipped a total of 428.5 million units during the fourth quarter of 2016 (4Q16), resulting in 6.9% growth when compared to the 400.7 million units shipped in the final quarter of 2015. For the full year, the worldwide smartphone market saw a total of 1.47 billion units shipped, marking the highest year of shipments on record, yet up only 2.3% from the 1.44 billion units shipped in 2015. Large markets like China, the United States, and Brazil all ended the year on a strong note helping to keep worldwide volumes in positive territory. "There's no question that 2016 marked a memorable year for the smartphone industry in many ways," said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. "This was a year that brought us the first down year for iPhone, yet Apple closed out the holiday quarter by surpassing Samsung for the top spot in the smartphone industry. We also witnessed year-over-year declines in some emerging regions like the Middle East and Latin America where high growth was expected. To round it all off, we now have a three horse race at the top of the market as Huawei cracked the double-digit share mark for the first time ever." Despite the changes that 2016 brought upon the market, including annual growth dropping from 10.4% in 2015 to just 2.3% in 2016, IDC expects a few turnarounds in 2017. First, IDC is forecasting a rebound in iPhone shipments with the yet to be announced tenth anniversary iPhone. Second, the Middle East and Africa (MEA) and Latin America regions are expected to return to growth in 2017. And, as a result of the aforementioned as well as several other driving factors, growth in 2017 should improve slightly from 2016's results. "As the two leading players continue to battle for the top spot, several Chinese vendors have solidified their position as valid contenders," said Anthony Scarsella, research manager with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. "The top three Chinese vendors (Huawei, OPPO, and vivo) are persistently applying pressure on Samsung within China thanks to a vast portfolio of affordable, well-built devices. Not only is this pressure coming at the low-end, but high-end devices like the P9, Mate 8, R9s, and XPlay6 haven proven viable options for consumers looking to upgrade or save money without sacrificing quality. However, it is worth noting that despite the success of these brands within China, they will need to find growth beyond their home turf to eventually knock off either Samsung or Apple at the top." Smartphone Vendor Highlights: Apple reclaimed the top spot thanks largely to the success of the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Despite a strong fourth quarter, 2016 marked the first full year of declining shipments for the iPhone with a 7% year-over-year drop. Apple shipped a record 78.3 million units in the fourth quarter, up 4.7% from the same quarter one year ago. Although the iPhone 7 did not feature a drastically different industrial design from its predecessor, it did bring yet another significantly improved processor, more robust camera, water resistance, and new color/finish options. Much like Samsung, all eyes will be on Apple's next flagship, and all signs point to something very special for the tenth anniversary of this iconic product. Samsung dropped to second in the worldwide smartphone market with shipments declining 5.2% compared to last year. The Korean giant shipped 77.5 million units in 4Q16, down from the 81.7 million units shipped last holiday quarter. On the year, Samsung shipped 311.4 million smartphones worldwide, which was down 3% from the 320.9 million shipments in 2015. Despite the Note 7 debacle and growing pressure from Chinese vendors, Samsung still managed to find success with its S7 and popular J-series of devices in numerous markets. The challenging holiday quarter, however, did bring its worldwide market share below 20% for the first time in over four years, leaving no better time for the pending arrival of its next flagship product, the Galaxy S8. Huawei retained the number three position while gaining worldwide market share in 4Q16. The quarter marked the first time the Chinese giant captured double-digit share with 10.6% of the total shipment volume. Huawei shipped 45.4 million units in the quarter, up 38.6% from the 32.7 million shipped in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year, Huawei shipped 139.3 million units, up 30.2% from the 107 million units shipped in 2015. The P series and Honor sub-brand drove essential volume in China as well as other countries in Asia and beyond. With proven success in China and many European countries, Huawei now has its sights set on the U.S. Whether or not the U.S. market becomes a serious playing field for Huawei is yet to be determined, but the recent release of the Mate 9 in the U.S. has surely caught the attention of both Apple and Samsung at the high end, while Honor brand devices will continue to drive the mid-tier. OPPO continued its push to reach the top of the market with its fourth straight quarter of greater than 100% year-over-year growth. OPPO shipped 31.2 million smartphones in the holiday quarter, which was up 117% from the 14.4 million smartphones shipped in 4Q15. The focus for OPPO over the past year has been international expansion outside of China and so far it has been successful at this. Beyond China, Southeast Asia and India have been the focal points for OPPO's growth in 2016 supported by intense marketing campaigns and new product launches. The company also began ramping up its presence in the Middle East and if momentum can pick up, a strong 2017 could be ahead. vivo remained the number five vendor with 24.7 million smartphones shipped in the holiday quarter, which was up from the 12.1 million shipped last holiday season. Over the year, vivo shipped a total of 77.3 million smartphones, up 103% from the 38 million last year. The majority of the shipments continue to be in China, however, and much like OPPO, vivo has been extremely aggressive with its marketing in a number of countries in Asia as it looks to extend its global reach.   Top Five Smartphone Vendors, Worldwide Shipments, Market Share, and Year-Over-Year Growth, Q4 2016 Preliminary Data (Units in Millions) Vendor     4Q16 Shipment Volume     4Q16 Market Share     4Q15 Shipment Volume     4Q15 Market Share     Year-Over- Year Change 1.

Credit: Dado Ruvic/Reuters Related Top Apple stories of 2016 8 most significant tech gadgets of 2016: Winners and losers Samsung Galaxy S8: Leaks, rumors and fake news Video What is Wi-Fi beamforming and MU-MIMO? During Apple’s earnings report last night, CEO Tim Cook did not mention why Apple squeaked by with 3 percent revenue growth. Almost every product category he spoke about was predicated with the words “record setting.” But a closer look reveals, Cook’s praise might be overstated, and Apple’s quest to produce another iPhone-scale new product to reignite growth continues. Radio Free Mobile’s Richard Windsor explained in an early-morning report from London what Cook did not. iPhone shipments at higher prices were driven by the defection of Samsung Galaxy Note customers due to the recall of the Note 7. Windsor has a unique perspective earned from over a decade as a bulge-bracket financial analyst with Nomura Securities. He speaks and writes about financial forecasts, as well as market and company ecosystems that the product-driven tech news streams do not cover because this type of information is very hard to come by. + Also on Network World: Apple’s Q1: iPhone 7 slays in a record-setting $78.4 billion quarter + The nine financial analysts from banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan who were granted one question during Apple’s quarterly conference calls do not release their reports except to clients who have millions of dollars under management. Reuters and Bloomberg might get a carefully crafted tidbit to avoid security regulators, but unless a reporter has a rich friend who shares the banks’ research, reporters do not have access to this perspective. Windsor reports that the iPhone was the main driver. In particular, the large-screen iPhone Plus saw its biggest contribution to the revenue mix ever. About 78.3 million iPhones shipped at a greater average selling price (ASP) of $695 compared to the 76.3 million units shipped last year at an ASP of $688. Samsung Note 7 users switch to iPhone 7 and Google Pixel Adding two and two together—the increase in large-screen iPhone 7 Plus shipments and the increase in overall revenue mix—Windsor concludes that Apple’s report of a year-over-year quarterly revenue increase was due to the crossover of high-end Android users burned by the fiery Note 7, even though the switch forced them to repurchase iOS versions of all their Android apps. An estimated 2.5 million Note 7 users were affected. Apple won an estimated 2 million with the iPhone, and Google gained about a half million with its Pixel. The Note 7 fiasco was a one-time windfall for Apple unlikely to repeat because Apple was late to the game with its first-generation large-screen iPhone 6 two and a half years ago, long after the large screen phablet form factor left the barn. By having only a 4-inch iPhone for too long, Apple missed the shift of high-end Android users to large-screen devices that began way back in 2007 with the 5-inch HTC Advantage. Galaxy Note users are unique. They are visually thinking, high-end loyal consumers of the Note’s form factor and stylus who withstood the negative connotations of the word phablet when this form factor first emerged. It is unlikely these users will return because of the investment they made learning iOS and buying new iOS versions of their apps, even if Samsung produces a Note 8 so reliable that it could withstand the treads of a Sherman Tank. Though bad for Samsung, the effect is contained because Note users are more loyal to the form factor than the Samsung brand and the volume of Note form factor shipments is tiny compared to Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S7. Note and Galaxy S consumers operate in parallel, not together. Windsor sums up the Note 7 Apple windfall with a note of irony, saying: “Although Google has failed to win those users over to Pixel, it will still benefit as RFM research indicates that iOS users generate far more advertising revenues for Google than Android users in the same demographic groups.” Base on Apple’s guidance in the second quarter, year-over-year revenues and shipments are expected to decline in the second quarter of 2017.

Annie Palmer Feb 1, 2017 10:06 AM EST Apple (AAPL)  lifted itself out of three straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines when it beat on its top and bottom lines for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 late Tuesday.  After Tuesday's closing bell, Apple posted adjusted earnings of $3.36 per share on revenue of $78.4 billion, higher than Wall Street's expectations for earnings of $3.22 per share and $77.3 billion in revenue.  Shares of Apple were climbing 5% to $127.53 on Wednesday morning.  The tech powerhouse curtailed investors' concerns over sluggish iPhone sales, noting that it sold 78.3 million iPhones during the key holiday shopping quarter, higher than the 77 million predicted by analysts. Sales of Apple's flagship smartphone were helped by demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, the larger version of the phone with dual cameras.  "While iPhone 7 is our most popular model, we saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which was a higher portion of the new product mix than we've ever seen with Plus models in the past," said Apple CEO Tim Cook on the company's earnings call.

Apple's growing Services unit, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, iTunes and Apple Pay, saw its revenues jump 13% year over year to $7.17 billion, exceeding Wall Street's expectations for $6.91 billion in revenue. Cook said on the earnings call that he expects Services revenues to "be the size of a Fortune 100 company" in 2017.  Mac sales were also up during the quarter, with 5.37 million units sold compared to the 5.31 it sold during the same quarter last year. iPad sales were much dimmer, however, as Apple reported its 12th straight quarter of annual iPad sales declines. During the quarter, Apple sold 13.1 million iPads, down from the 16.1 million iPads it sold in the same period last year.  Apple's Other Products category, which includes sales of the Apple TV, Apple Watch and Beats products, had a less-than-stellar quarter. Revenue fell 8% year over year to $4.02 billion in the period. Apple CFO Luca Maestri told the Financial Times that the Apple Watch had the "best quarter we've ever had," but that the Apple TV, which the company said it has greater plans for, saw year-over-year declines.  Following the results, Wall Street remained largely bullish on the tech concern, with many issuing stock price target increases. Here's what they had to say about the quarter:  Andy Hargreaves, Pacific Crest Securities (overweight, price target raised to $140 from $127) "Despite a $20 price increase versus the iPhone 6s Plus, demand for the iPhone 7 Plus oustripped supply and exceeded the high-end mix in previous cycles. This suggests inelasticity at the high end of Apple's customer base, which increases our confidence that the company can raise price even further with a third high-end SKU in the next iPhone cycle." Simona Jankowski, Goldman Sachs (buy, $133 PT) "Apple's solid F1Q beat was driven by upside in iPhone, Mac and Services, offset by a miss in iPad. Higher iPhone units and ASPs reflected stronger demand for the iPhone 7 Plus. Positively, Greater China revenue declines narrowed to -12% y/y, with mainland China revenues flat y/y and up 6% in constant currency. The beat would have been strong had it not been for a supplier shortage in the iPad, which contributed to a $1.3 billion iPad revenue miss. We view Apple's F2Q revenue guide as better than feared." Sherri Scribner, Deutsche Bank (hold, PT raised to $115 from $108)  "We believe investors' focus has already shifted to the second half of fiscal 2017 and the iPhone 8 launch, suggesting weaker guidance will be overlooked. While many investors expect a strong iPhone 8 launch, we remain concerned about slowing global smartphone growth and elongating refresh cycles in mature markets longer term. Given the recent run in the shares, we see limited upside from current levels and maintain our hold."

We know why Tim Cook is smiling. Image: mashable By Lance Ulanoff2017-02-01 15:53:06 UTC Analysis A good quarter for a company can make critics forget what they were talking about. In the days leading up to Apple’s first quarter 2017 earnings report, which encompasses last year’s holiday buying season, many pundits were engaged in hand-wringing over Apple’s fortunes and futures. Questions included: How big a decline would we see in iPhone sales? Was the MacBook Pro and its lack of traditional ports a complete disaster? Could Apple ever innovate again? No one predicted the blockbuster quarter Apple ended up with, which included a record-breaking $78.4B in revenue. The champion product was none other than the once-flagging iPhone, specifically the bigger, pricier iPhone 7 Plus. We’d heard about supply shortages when Apple introduced the phone last fall, but most assumed this was due to orchestrated scarcity to inflate interest and keep demand high. In reality, demand was very high all on its own. SEE ALSO: iPhone 8 concept combines camera with Apple logo During the earnings call on Tuesday night, Apple boasted double-digit growth for iPhone sales in virtually every market. The company sold an astounding 78 million iPhones last quarter. And Apple CEO Tim Cook noted “the amazing success of the iPhone 7 Plus.” In other words, Apple rode to this unprecedented success at least in part on the back of a smartphone that looks a lot like last year’s model (and 2015's) and where the innovation is mostly found under the hood (as is often the case now). One has to assume that water resistance and the double cameras that enable one-button optical zoom (and that awesome Portrait Mode) were more of a turn-on than many thought. Apple continues to win not by out-innovating competitors, but by grinding away at its corral of excellent products, polishing them with smart, new features that enhance but never confuse. It’s a rational, risk-averse approach to success. Apple might remove a port, but it won’t introduce a curved phone. It knows what its customers like and what they can withstand. The insanely good iPhone 7 Plus sales prove that Apple accurately predicted the negative impact of removing the 3.5mm jack (with there essentially being no impact at all). A little help from a rival The company has surely benefited from Samsung’s astounding Note7 flameout, but thankfully not by using that company’s hardships to drive people to Apple’s alternatives. Tim Cook never mentioned what happened to Samsung, perhaps smartly recognizing that the high road would allow Note7 refugees to come willingly to Apple’s shores. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus success acted as a kind of "Johnny Appleseed" for other parts of Apple’s business. Even if the iPhone business wasn’t growing, Apple is crazy rich. “IPhone sales are a big driver for the services business,” noted Apple CFO Luca Maestri during the earnings call. That's not a surprising statement: iPhones needs apps, music and content. The App Store, Apple Music and iTunes deliver that.  Eighteen percent year-over year growth in the service business this quarter is proof of that impact and, with Apple saying that the number of people transacting in the App Store is doubling, a sign that Cook may get his predicted doubling of Apple's service business within four years, especially if it does go deeper into original content and adds a TV subscription service to the mix. If there is pent-up demand for the iPhone 8, one can only imagine what will happen to the company's services business if that phone ships next fall. Even if the iPhone business wasn’t growing, Apple is crazy rich. The company’s heap of cash is also an indication that Apple will continue to buy innovation where it can’t find it internally. Naturally, $246 billion can buy a lot of relatively small companies (Twitter?) and maybe some big ones (Tesla, anyone?). (I'm basing this on cost to acquire, not the actual size of the companies.) Mac in black Another indication of just how well things are going for Apple is the Mac business. Its unit sales grew by a tiny 1% year-over-year, which might be seen as condemnation of Apple’s MacBook Pro port strategy. However, Mac revenue increased more robustly quarter-over-quarter, resulting in a 26% Mac revenue bump. Cook indicated on Tuesday that there were some supply constraints with the MacBook Pro with touch bar. If that didn’t exist, perhaps the Mac picture would’ve been even sunnier. Apple's MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Image: Lili Sams/Mashable Even in the wearable markets, Apple appears to be winning. Though the company refuses to break out sales numbers, Cook said the Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch in the world and added that the company couldn’t make enough of them to meet demand. The Apple Watch sales figures are grouped  into “Other Products,” which fell 8 percent year-over-year. However, there was a massive spike, 70 percent quarter-over-quarter, which could be attributed to the smartwatch. Also blended into that number are the new AirPods, but they arrived late in the quarter and may have had little impact. Even the iPad, which has been free-falling for years, saw a bit of a turnaround in the last quarter. With the allure of large-screen iPhones like the iPhone 7 Plus, I don’t think iPads will fully come back, but Apple is working hard with the iPad Pro line to reposition the tablet as an office and even enterprise tool. It may succeed and, as ever, Tim Cook promised “exciting things” on the horizon for the iPad. Is Apple as innovative as it once was? That’s probably a question of perception. After all, its best innovations — the iPod, iPad and even arguably the Mac (it was the first consumer computer with a graphical user interface) — were all smart re-imaginings of other people’s failed, stalled or still-in-the lab product ideas. Apple will introduce new features and products and maybe even product categories in 2017. But it may be time to accept that Apple’s greatest innovation is figuring out how to build, maintain and grow a wildly successful consumer electronics business. It’s not as sexy as boundless product innovation, but it works.  BONUS: Elon Musk's Hyperloop dream is closer to becoming a reality Topics: Apple, Apple Watch , earnings, Gadgets, Mashable Must Reads, iPhone, iPhone 7, iphone 7 plus, Mobile, Tech, tim cook About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Political Reporter For Dailymail.com Published: 12:47 EST, 1 February 2017 | Updated: 18:16 EST, 1 February 2017 e-mail 42 shares 233 View comments Apple's chief executive Tim Cook is contemplating legal action against President Donald Trump's travel ban.  Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Cook spoke of the hundreds of Apple employees who have been affected by the president's executive order – which the White House is not calling a 'ban,' after referring to it as a ban –  that halted travel from seven Muslim-majority countries.  Since the order was signed last Friday, Cook said he's received emails from Apple employees filled with 'heart-wrenching stories.'  Scroll down for video  Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company is contemplating legal action against Donald Trump's executive order barring travel from seven Muslim-majority countries Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook (right) met with President-elect Donald Trump  (left) at Trump Tower in December and is pushing the White House to reverse the ban  One example he shared with the Journal was that of an employee who's expecting a child, whose grandparents will have Canadian and Iranian citizenship.  The executive order could prohibit them from meeting the new baby.  'These are people that have friends and family,' Cook said. 'They're co-workers. They're taxpayers. They're key parts of the community,' the top tech executive articulated.  What Cook didn't elaborate on, was how Apple planned to take legal action against the order, saying simply, 'we want to be constructive and productive.'  On Monday, another top name in tech, Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos – who also owns the Washington Post – sent an email to employees pledging the company's full legal and lobbying resources would go toward fighting the ban.  'We reached out to congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle to explore legislative options,' Bezos explained to employees.  Apple CEO Tim Cook (far right) said he's been talking to 'very, very senior people in the White House' to reverse the ban, but would consider joining a lawsuit against it too  'Our legal team has prepared a declaration of support for the Washington state attorney general who will be filing suit against the order,' the businessman continued. 'We are working other legal options as well.'  Cook has been trying to reach out to the executive branch directly. He told the Wall Street Journal that he's tried to talk to 'very, very senior people in the White House.'  While Trump criticized Apple during the presidential campaigning, lambasting the tech giant for producing much of its wares overseas, Cook has since gotten together with Trump, including at a meeting for tech leaders on December 14 at Trump Tower.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Cook said that Apple was “considering legal options” to challenge the order and would seek to do so in a “constructive and productive” way. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Cook added that he had been affected by a range of “heart-wrenching stories” of Apple employees who have been affected by the order, which was signed by Trump last Friday. The order halts immigration from terror-prone countries for 90 days until “proper vetting measures are put in place.” The affected countries include Syria, Somalia, Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Libya. “These are people that have friends and family. They’re co-workers. They’re taxpayers. They’re key parts of the community,” Cook said. “More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds. That’s what makes us special. “We ought to pause and really think deeply through that,” he continued. In considering legal action against the order, Apple follows the lead of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also confirmed his company was exploring legal options against the order. A range of other technology companies have opposed the executive order in recent days. Firms such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Uber, and Netflix have all publicly condemned the order, whilst promoting the impact of mass immigration on their businesses. In the run up to November’s election, it was revealed by WikiLeaks that Cook was at one point considered by the Clinton campaign as a potential running mate for the Democrat candidate. As part of Trump’s transition efforts, Cook met with Trump alongside a range of Silicon Valley executives in Trump Tower to discuss the future of the technology industry under the new administration. Trump criticised Apple heavily during the election campaign for their failure to cooperate with the FBI in the San Bernardino terror case, even calling for a boycott of the company. He also criticised the company for moving many of their manufacturing operations to China. However, recent reports have suggested that Apple is considering moving some of its iPhone production back to America in an effort to appease Donald Trump’s desire to stop American companies from moving manufacturing abroad.

"We ought to pause and really think deeply about that.” ADVERTISEMENT Cook declined to specify Apple’s possible legal options, vowing only that “we want to be constructive and productive.” The tech CEO added, however, it was “a simple decision to oppose the executive order.” “These are people that have friends and family,” Cook said of Apple employees affected by Trump’s order. "They’re co-workers. They’re taxpayers. They’re key parts of the community.” Cook added he had received numerous “heart-wrenching stories" from Apple employees affected by Trump’s decision. Trump signed an executive order Friday imposing a 90-day ban on travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen. The measure also halted general refugee admissions into the U.S. for 120 days and paused Syrian refugee resettlement indefinitely due to that country's ongoing civil war. The White House says the order is necessary to protect national security, noting that the Obama administration had put the seven countries on a list of countries where terrorism was a concern.  Cook blasted the order Saturday, saying immigration had proved essential to Apple’s thriving corporate climate. “It is not a policy we support,” he reportedly wrote in an email to staff.

Click Qualcomm Lawsuit Was 'Last Resort,' Apple CEO Says Apple CEO Tim Cook says his company had no choice but to file a lawsuit against Qualcomm because the mobile chipmaker was overstepping its legal bounds. (ZUMAPRESS.com/Newscom) PATRICK SEITZ 2/01/2017 Reprints Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook says his company had no choice but to file a lawsuit against Qualcomm (QCOM) because the mobile chipmaker was overstepping its legal bounds. On his earnings conference call with analysts late Tuesday, Cook discussed why Apple is taking its supplier to court. "I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort," Cook said. "And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we didn't see another way forward." Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in U.S. federal district court on Jan. 20, alleging that Qualcomm demanded onerous terms for its technology and sought to punish Apple for cooperating in a government antitrust probe. Apple said Qualcomm has withheld $1 billion in rebate payments to Apple as retribution for the iPhone maker's participation in an investigation by South Korea's antitrust regulator. IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm stock has a mediocre IBD Composite Rating of 49. It ranks No. 25 out of 38 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. For more information on Qualcomm, visit the IBD Stock Checkup. "They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with," Cook said. "And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason and the more expensive it would be therefore for us to innovate." Cook drew an analogy to reinforce his point. "It's somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into," Cook said. "This doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts." Apple's lawsuit was filed three days after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm and accused it of using anticompetitive tactics to maintain its monopoly in baseband processors used in wireless devices. Apple also has filed legal action against Qualcomm in China. Apple shares jumped 6.1% to close at 128.79 on the stock market today, after the company posted better-than-expected December quarter earnings. Qualcomm finished the day down 0.5% to 53.15. On Tuesday, Qualcomm stock touched a more than six-month low of 52.83.

(AAPL) Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services! Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Resurrecting the Cursed Windows RT? View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced HomeKit — its strategy for becoming the center of the smart home — in June 2014. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) revealed its Alexa-powered Echo smart speaker that November. Source: Apple/Amazon While there are currently several dozen HomeKit compatible smart home products, Amazon’s Alexa is now connected to thousands of smart products and services and has spread from the Echo to third-party devices. On the surface, it looks as though Amazon has outmaneuvered and thoroughly trounced Apple. But despite the seemingly insurmountable lead and momentum, AAPL could still end up beating AMZN in this smart home race. Here’s how. Apple Chose the Closed Approach With HomeKit Apple tends to be extremely cautious. Its software is designed to be user-friendly and secure. iPhone apps can’t just be downloaded from anywhere; they need to go through the official App Store and that requires approval by AAPL. Third-party hardware needs to be certified by Apple before it can be marketed as being iOS-compatible. It’s that “walled” approach that has made the iPhone more secure than smartphones running Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android operating system. With the iPhone and Siri — Apple’s voice assistant — at the center of Apple’s smart home strategy, that focus on security, compatibility and ease of use carried over to HomeKit. Manufacturers who want to make their smart devices HomeKit-compatible face a daunting series of requirements. As pointed out in a recent Reuters article on differing smart home approaches, this includes being forced to buy a special HomeKit chip, being limited to approved (and more expensive than average) Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips and even extends to manufacturing being limited to factories that are certified by Apple. End-to-end encryption is mandatory. Once a HomeKit product is ready, it faces extensive testing by Apple engineers to ensure compatibility. Then it may be sold. That process alone can take three to five months. So you have additional costs, the procedural red tape and a delay. It’s easy to understand why Apple currently lists only 75 or so HomeKit-compatible devices. And half of those are either different color options or regional variations of the same product. Amazon Alexa Is Open for Business Amazon took a radically different approach with its Echo speaker and Alexa. The company openly courted third-party companies to develop Alexa “skills” or software-enabled interactions with an Amazon Alexa-powered device. A skill can be the ability to tell Alexa to order an Uber. It could also be telling Alexa to turn on your home’s smart lights or to start your electric car. The process is simple. Amazon provides an example showing how to build an Alexa skill in 60 minutes, and that includes the time needed to create a developer account. Submit the skill to AMZN for a quick verification, and it’s published. That’s how Amazon Alexa tripled its available skills in just three months last year, hitting 3,000 in September. If that sounds impressive, by CES 2017 in January, it had hit more than 7,000 Alexa skills.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton    5456316 Apple is mulling over whether to pursue legal action to try to overrule the Trump administration’s executive orders restricting immigration. CEO Tim Cook said that he is in constant contact with “very, very senior people in the White House” because he wants to convince the administration that reversing the executive orders would not only be good for Apple, but for the country in general, reports The Wall Street Journal. Apple submitted 4,639 “labor condition applications” for H1B visas and 2,096 “labor certifications” for a green card from fiscal year 2014 to 2016, according to Myvisajobs.com. The California-based tech company had 66,000 employees in the U.S. as of 2014, according to its own records. “More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds,” Cook said, according to The WSJ. “That’s what makes us special. We ought to pause and really think deeply through that.” Cook’s most recent comments were supplementary, since he previously sent a letter to employees clarifying his and the company’s position on immigration. “Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,” Cook wrote, according to The Verge. “Apple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship.” He met with President Donald Trump in December with a number of other tech executives like Eric Schmidt from Google parent company Alphabet and Jeff Bezos of Amazon. (RELATED: Tim Cook Statement On Trump Meeting Mirrors The Election Cycle) Bezos said that he is considering exploring “other legal options” in response to Trump’s temporary immigration ban. (RELATED: Ivanka And Jared Had Dinner With Apple CEO, Clinton Foundation Board Member) In fact, Apple is certainly not alone, since a consortium of tech companies and their leaders were expected to meet Tuesday to discuss how to combat Trump’s new policy, with the prospect of filing or supporting lawsuits challenging the restrictions. (RELATED: Immigrant-Rich Tech Industry Responds To Trump’s Immigration Ban) The city attorney of San Francisco, an area home to much of the tech industry in the U.S. and a large portion of the tech hub Silicon Valley, filed a federal lawsuit against Trump on Tuesday, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When will Apple release the 5th-gen Apple TV? Interface changes Apple TV streaming service Complete guide to 4th-gen Apple TV (2015) When will Apple release the next Apple TV - the 5th-generation Apple TV, or Apple TV 5 - in the UK? And what new features, tech specs, UK price and design changes should we expect from the new 5G Apple TV for 2017? The fourth-gen Apple TV - the first Apple TV device to allow users to install apps - was unveiled by Apple at the iPhone 6s launch event on 9 September 2015, and went on sale weeks later. More than 16 months later, we're eagerly looking ahead to the launch of the next, fifth-gen (5G) Apple TV. Indeed, there are already rumours that a next-generation Apple TV might arrive in 2017: perhaps even a special model to celebrate the Apple TV's 10th birthday. In this article we gather all the evidence related to the fifth-gen Apple TV's release date, as well as reporting on all the rumours and clues about the 2017 Apple TV's new features, tech specs, UK price and design changes. However, if you're still interested in the Apple TV that's available right now, we've got plenty of information about the 2015 Apple TV, including pricing and the best places to buy. And don't forget our Apple TV buying guide 2017. Read next: How to set up the new Apple TV | New Apple TV vs old Apple TV | Apple TV tips UK Updated, 1 February 2017, to include Q1 2017 financial results revealing a drop in Apple TV sales; January 2017, to discuss the chances of an anniversary update as the Apple TV turns 10; and to include the news that the third-gen Apple TV has been discontinued. New Apple TV 2017 release date rumours UK: When will Apple release the 5th-gen Apple TV? We expect Apple to release the next-gen Apple TV in 2017 to tie in with the product's 10th anniversary, but there has been no official announcement. Here's when the four generations of Apple TV launched: 1st-gen Apple TV: January 2007 2nd-gen Apple TV: September 2010 3rd-gen Apple TV: March 2012 4th-gen Apple TV: September 2015 Evidently, Apple updates its Apple TV less often than its iPhones, iPads and Macs: there was a three-and-a-half-year wait between the first and second models, and between the third and fourth. Based on that, it would be reasonable to expect the 5th-gen Apple TV to appear in 2018 or even 2019, and we certainly don't have firm evidence to dispute that. But our instincts tell us that the Apple TV's position and status in the company's portfolio of products has changed. It used to be a sideline and a hobby, but with the growing importance of streaming media and smart-home applications, and with the arrival on the platform of games and its own App Store, Apple TV is moving to centre stage. And we're not the only ones to think Apple is likely to start updating the TV more frequently from now on. A report (link for subscribers only) in DigiTimes last year predicted that the fifth-generation Apple TV would go into trial production as early as December 2015, with volume production starting in the first quarter of 2016. Changes were said to include a dramatically improved hardware performance and new functions "to help it no longer serve only as a set-top box". Read next: 14 best Apple TV alternatives | Best Apple TV buying guide 2017 Apple discontinues third-gen Apple TV Apple has officially discontinued the third-generation Apple TV after being on sale since 2012. The move from Apple forces users to invest in the upgraded fourth-gen Apple TV, which starts at £139 compared to the £59 price-tag of the third-gen device. The third-gen Apple TV didn't feature tvOS or the App Store, but was used as a budget option for users that only wanted to stream content to their TVs.   The choice to remove the third-gen Apple TV from the Apple TV lineup suggests, to us at least, that the wheels are in motion and that the fifth-gen Apple TV will be making an appearance sooner, rather than later. Q3 2016 earnings call comments: 'Something bigger' on the way Tim Cook made non-specific but intriguing comments about the future of the Apple TV at Apple's Q3 2016 earnings conference call. He made it very clear that Apple has big plans for its TV division, and plans to build "something bigger" with the product and surrounding ecosystem. Near the end of the hour-long call, a question was posed by Kulbinder Garcha, the managing director of Credit Suisse: "I think about some of the comments you've made about the TV market and how it's been stuck in the sixties and seventies, and the experience hasn't changed," Garcha said. "I understand that you've got the Apple TV box out, but in terms of driving actual video-on-demand services, is that something Apple wants to do themselves, do you want to partner, could you even build content? How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity, as opposed to, here's an Apple box and we sell some units but it's not that meaningful to the overall company in terms of size?" Tim Cook's reply was enigmatic. "The introduction of Apple TV and tvOS in last October and the subsequent OS releases and what's coming out this fall… think of that as building the foundation for what we believe can be a broader business over time," he said. "I don't want to be more precise than that but you shouldn't look at what's there today and think we've done what we want to do. We've built a foundation that we can do something bigger off of." Apple TV sales down year-on-year but Cook hints at big TV plans Apple recorded record profit when it presented its Q1 2017 earnings, with iPhone and Mac sales both on the up with the iPhone having its best quarter ever. However, while the iPhone and Mac were on the up, the 'others' category which includes the Apple Watch, accessories, dongles and most importantly, the Apple TV, reported a loss. The category reported 8 percent losses year-on-year despite the launch of a new Apple Watch and AirPods. Tim Cook claims that the Apple Watch set company records for unit sales and revenue, meaning the Watch isn't the problem. In fact, Apple CFO Luca Maestri told the Financial Times outright that one reason was falling Apple TV sales.  However, during the same earnings call, Tim Cook hinted at bigger Apple TV-focused ambitions. "We've come a long way in a year and it gives us a platform to build off of," he said during the call. "We are learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways we could play it." New Apple TV 2017 release date: WWDC 2016 and tvOS 10 Back in spring 2016 we argued that the 5G Apple TV was unlikely to be launched at WWDC 2016, since the event came round less than a year after Apple rolled out the fourth-gen model and none of the previous Apple TVs had launched in summer. Indeed, Apple launched no new hardware at the event whatsoever. But the new version of the Apple TV's operating system, tvOS 10, got considerable stage time. As we often observe when discussing new iPhones and iPads, many of the most significant updates come not from new hardware but from free software updates. Siri gets some big improvements in tvOS's new update: it can now search the Apple TV's movie and TV database with more complex queries. It can search YouTube, too, and any live streaming channels can be launched by saying "watch" and then the name of the channel. There's a new dark mode for Apple TV, which makes the background black instead of the bright white we're used to. And the Apple TV Remote app has been redesigned; it now offers all the Siri remote features and can be used for Siri queries using the built-in mic. One last thing Apple didn't mention, but has since come to light in Apple support documents, is that the requirement for Siri Remote compatibility for Apple TV games has been relaxed. That means they can focus on MFi game controllers, which are much more game-friendly than the Siri remote. See: Best Apple TV game controllers. Read our Complete guide to tvOS's new features for more information on the software update. New Apple TV 2017 release date: 10th-anniversary Apple TV Looking again at those launch dates above, we feel like the tenth anniversary of the Apple TV, which we passed on 9 January 2017, might be a tempting occasion for a big update. Apple tends to dislike historical wallowing - famously refusing to build a museum in its new headquarters because "we're focused on the future, not the past" - but there is a precedent for an anniversary product in the form of the Twentieth Anniversary Mac (number 4 in our article The 5 weirdest Macs of all time). Read next: Best Apple TV game controllers | Best Apple TV games | Best Apple TV apps New Apple TV 2017 release date rumours: Apple's 27 October event While many assumed that we would see the introduction of the fifth-generation Apple TV at Apple's October 2016 event, the event focused mainly on the new MacBook Pro. The New MacBook Pro features a Touch Bar, offering contextual controls depending on the app you're using. You can find out more about the 2016 MacBook Pro here: New MacBook Pro 2016 review. The Apple TV wasn't completely out of the spotlight, though, as Apple introduced the TV app for the Apple TV and iOS devices. The app looks to integrate streaming content from a number of providers, but is US-only at first. Those in the US can expect the app to appear as part of a software update in December, while those in the UK have no solid release date just yet.  New Apple TV 2017 rumours UK: Interface changes An Apple TV owner's user experience is largely dictated by the software side of things. How will Apple change the Apple TV interface? New cross-provider programming guide interface Apple's next big plan for its Apple TV isn't new hardware: it's a software-based programme guide. That sounds boring, but it's potentially a powerful way of improving user-friendliness for those who are signed up to multiple content providers. The first foundation of this strategy was laid with the announcements of tvOS 10 at WWDC in June. tvOS 10 includes a new feature known as 'single sign in', whereby a user can sign in once, with a single login and password, and tvOS will then automatically sign into a whole raft of services for them: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and so on. Nice and convenient. But for many of us who do use multiple TV and movie services, a bigger issue than multiple sign-ins is simply keeping track of everything that's available to watch. Each service will have its own ways of highlighting new, popular or user-tailored recommendations, but having to open up two, three or even more apps to check out what's on offer when planning an evening's viewing is a slight pain. This is where Apple comes in. The company is really good at stuff like this: forging relationships with content providers and creating a simple and trusted umbrella interface enabling users to browse and access everything they want. That was what iTunes was so good at, and the iOS App Store is successful in that regard too. We just hope the new Apple TV programming guide has strong search. The App Store still has disappointing search, with worthless spammy apps that are good at SEO ranking above legitimate apps on relevant search terms. The two scenarios aren't quite the same - there isn't really such a thing as spam TV - but Apple still needs to find a way to foreground higher-quality content so it isn't drowned out by the volume. For more information about upcoming changes to the Apple TV's interface, take a look at our complete guide to tvOS 10. New Apple TV 2017 release date rumours UK: Apple TV streaming service Rumours that Apple will launch a TV streaming service have been around for a while. If you'd like more of an in-depth discussion of this topic, take a look at our separate article about Apple's streaming service plans. Unfortunately for anyone who was looking forward to the launch of the service, it sounds like it will be further delayed as Apple continues to negotiate with the TV networks in the US. The December 2015 report from Bloomberg claims that Apple is putting its plans for the streaming service on hold because the cable companies and networks are proving resistant to the idea. In fact, Apple may ditch the idea altogether, focusing instead on offering the tvOS platform for media companies to sell their content directly to consumers via the App Store, according to the Bloomberg report. Bloomberg reckons the reason for the resistance is Apple's demand for content at a price the networks aren't happy with. CBS CEO Les Moonves, who has often commented on the rumoured service, has also claimed that Apple has put the streaming service plans "on hold", according to Bloomberg. Previously Moonves had hinted that the rumoured Apple TV steaming service would arrive in 2015. The revelation came during an earlier interview with Bloomberg TV in which he suggested his company would soon come to an arrangement with Apple. Moonves said: "Apple is having conversations with everyone about doing their own streaming services. We have had those conversations, as have the other networks. Do I think something will happen? Probably, but I don't know when." This isn't the first time Moonves has made comments about the rumoured service. Earlier this year he made a similar revelation in an interview at a Re/code conference, giving the impression that he was in ongoing conversations with Apple.

KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany's DAX was flat at 11,663 while the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2 per cent to 4,805. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.6 per cent higher at 7,153. U.S. stocks were heading for a soft open, with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures down 0.2 per cent. TRUMP TURBULENCE: Investors were rattled by the latest news from the Trump administration, including a phone call in which he warned Mexico's president he might send in troops and another about a tense exchange with Australia's leader over refugees. Following the Trump rally in the wake of his election victory last November, stock gains appear to be petering out with investors getting jittery in light of Trump's dramatic policy announcements since taking office. MARKET VIEW: "Trump's presidency comes with greater than normal risks," Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, said in a report. Eventually, he said "pragmatic pro-growth policies are likely to ultimately dominate populist policies." However, Oliver added that "the Trump honeymoon with investors is likely over with a short term period of correction/volatility likely to continue in shares, bond yields and the U.S. dollar." CENTRAL BANKING: On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold after its latest policy meeting — as investors had expected. Policymakers signalled that they still expect to gradually raise rates but gave no clear timeline. Meanwhile, the Bank of England kept its main interest rate on hold at a record low of 0.25 per cent on Thursday but revised up its growth forecasts for the British economy, which has held up better than many forecasters predicted in the aftermath of last June's vote to leave the European Union. DEUTSCHE DOWN AGAIN: Germany's biggest lender, Deutsche Bank, saw its share price fall by around 5 per cent after the company posted another hefty loss in 2016. The bank reported a loss of 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) for all of 2016. Much of that loss was due to a fourth-quarter deficit of 1.89 billion euros largely related to the sale of its Abbey Life unit and costs associated with legal fines and penalties. ASIA'S DAY: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 1.2 per cent to 18,914.58 as the stronger yen weighed on exporters, while South Korea's Kospi dipped 0.5 per cent to 2,071.01. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.6 per cent to 23,184.52 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1 per cent lower to 5,645.40. Markets in mainland China were closed for the final day of a weeklong holiday. CURRENCIES: The euro rose 0.3 per cent to $1.0810 while the dollar fell 0.6 per cent to 112.36 yen. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 15 cents to $54.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, advanced 38 cents to $57.18 a barrel in London.

Earnings: Why Shares Are Trading Higher Here's how one key factor is turning investors bullish on Apple stock. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Feb 1, 2017 at 12:33PM Following the company's first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are up sharply on Wednesday. At the time of this writing, Apple stock is trading at about $123, up more than 5% for the trading day. The move helped the stock hit a new 52-week high. Apple stock's move higher on Monday adds to the increasingly bullish sentiment toward the stock recently. In the past six months, shares are up about 23%, easily outperforming the S&P 500's 5% gain during the same period. Investor optimism toward Apple stock recently is likely due to a wide range of factors, including its conservative valuation, speculation about a major redesign for Apple's expected iPhone launch this fall, and Samsung's recall of its Galaxy Note 7. But one trend in Apple's business is likely serving as a primary driver for the company's rising stock price: a rebound in iPhone sales. iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. Rebounding iPhone sales To understand why recently rebounding iPhone sales are so important to investors, it's important to realize how steeply iPhone sales were declining on a year-over-year basis just a few quarters ago. Metric Q3 2016 Q2 2016 iPhone unit sales growth (YOY) (15%) (16%) iPhone revenue growth (YOY) (23%) (18%) Total revenue (YOY) (15%) (13%) Fiscal quarters shown. Data retrieved from Apple's earnings releases. Table by author. At the iPhone segment's worst point last year, unit sales and revenue in the company's fiscal third quarter of 2016 declined 15% and 23%, respectively, dragging total revenue 15% lower compared to the year-ago quarter. As Apple was reporting significant year-over-year declines in its largest product segment, investors were concerned about how the product segment would perform over the longer term. But as early as Apple's fourth-quarter earnings report in October, it was clear that the tech giant's iPhone business could soon end a three-quarter streak of year-over-year declines in total revenue. The company guided for first-quarter revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion, up from $75.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. Considering that iPhone accounts for over 60% of Apple's trailing-12-month revenue, this meant management was optimistic about the company's new September-launched iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Sure enough, iPhone sales rebounded. Fiscal quarters shown. Data retrieved from Apple's earnings releases. Chart by author. Apple's first-quarter earnings release this week confirmed the company's return to iPhone growth, with Apple reporting year-over-year iPhone unit and revenue growth of 5%, helping the company's total revenue rise 3%. Can iPhone growth persist? The big question going forward, of course, is whether Apple's iPhone business can keep growing. In the near term, it looks like management expects another quarter of growth. Apple said it expected total second-quarter revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion, up from $50.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. With iPhone accounting for the bulk of Apple's total revenue, this guidance for growth in total revenue likely means management expects growth for the iPhone, too. Beyond Apple's second quarter, however, it's not as certain that Apple's iPhone sales growth can be sustained throughout fiscal 2017. However, a return to growth for iPhone 7 -- a product with a three-year-old form factor -- is promising news, highlighting how well the company's products continue to resonate with customers. Combining Apple stock's conservative valuation with growth in the company's biggest product segment, it's easy to see why investors are optimistic about the stock's potential, recently.

Apple on January 31, 2017 reported that its profit for the past quarter slipped 2.6 percent to $17.9 billion even as iPhone sales jumped to a new high. Revenue in the quarter climbed to an all-time record $78.4 billion compared with $75.9 billion in the same period a year earlier, the company said in its earnings update for the fiscal first quarter. Photo by Josh Edelson/AFP SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Apple on Tuesday, Jan 31, reported a rebound in iPhone sales to lift the tech giant to record revenue in the past quarter in quarterly results that eased concerns of slowing growth. The results showed strong demand for Apple's iPhone 7 models launched last year, with demand outpacing supply. (Read: Specs Rundown: The Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus) Revenue climbed to an all-time record $78.4 billion compared to $75.9 billion in the same period a year earlier, the company said in its earnings update for the quarter ending in December. Compared with the same quarter a year earlier, profit dipped 2.6% to $17.9 billion. Apple shares were up nearly 3% to $124.80 in after-market trades that followed release of the earnings results. Apple said that it sold 78.3 million iPhones – the most ever in a quarter – up 5% from the same prime holiday shopping period the prior year. The sales made Apple the world's top smartphone vender in the final 3 months of last year, overtaking Samsung, according to industry tracker Strategy Analytics. The growth promised to assuage concerns by investors that iPhone sales, which account for the bulk of Apple's revenue, were softening due to 3 quarters of sequential decline. "We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way," said Apple chief executive Tim Cook. The California-based company said it "set all-time revenue records for iPhone, services, Mac and Apple Watch." The amount of money taken in from online services and digital content grew strongly, led by unprecedented buying at Apple's online App Store, according to Cook. "I have not yet done the numbers, but I think Apple had the best quarter in the history of humanity," Asymco analyst Horace Dediu said in a comment fired off on Twitter. Apple, however, saw revenue in its important China market drop 12% to $16.2 billion, according to the earnings report. The company's performance in China improved from the previous quarter but was hampered by a strong US dollar, according to Apple. Cook said he was encouraged, though Apple still faces challenges in mainland China. Apple also intends to "invest significantly" in India, he told analysts during an earning call. iPhone 7 'a success' Neil Saunders, managing director of the research firm GlobalData Retail, said Apple's strong report eased concerns it had hit a bump in growth. "The iPhone 7 will be a much steadier contributor and we would argue that the new model has been a success," Saunders said in a note to clients. "It is clear that Apple did enough to stimulate interest and persuade many consumers to upgrade." But Saunders said that Apple "competitors, including Google and Amazon, are still nipping at its heels with new products and ideas – so it needs to speed up, even if it is just to stand still." Some analysts say Apple remains too dependent on the iPhone and that it needs to better diversify revenue amid a sputtering smartphone market and intense competition. Smartphone lives The success of the iPhone sets the stage for Apple to be at the heart of smartphone lifestyles in which people synch with homes, security systems, cars, health care and more with mobile devices. It also puts Apple in position to make money from digital content, services, or online commerce. "Our ecosystem is broadening to more and more of the areas where people spend their time: at the gym, on the go, in the home, and on the job," Cook said. Apple said services revenue grew 18% from a year ago to $7.2 billion, while "other" products including the Apple Watch, brought in $4 billion. "Apple's dependence on sales of hardware to drive revenue is a future pitfall for the company," said Colin Gillis of BGC Financial. In response to an analyst query, Cook said that he was "optimistic" about the potential for tax reform that could entice Apple into repatriating some of the more than $200 billion in profit it keeps outside the US. Cook said such a scenario would be good for Apple and the country, but declined to expand on how the company might spend the money. – Rappler.com Filed under:consumer electronics•iPhone 7•iPhone sales•smartphones•Apple.

Apple CEO Tim Cook told the paper this week that hundreds of employees of the company have been affected by the executive order, which bans refugees and travelers with passports from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Cook said that he had received a number of emails from employees directly affected by the order, including an expecting parent whose family won’t be able to visit the baby because of their Iranian passports. Cook went on to say that he has been in contact with senior people at the administration, urging them to repeal the executive order. Apple’s CEO isn’t alone in opposing the travel ban. Over the weekend, a number of tech executives spoke out in public messages and emails to their workforce. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings called the ban “un-American” in a sharply worded Facebook post, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey called it “wrong” and said its impact was “real and upsetting.” Other companies speaking out included Google, Facebook and AirBnB. Related Google Employees, Executives Rally Against Trump Immigration Order In some cases, the protest didn’t just come from the top. At Google, an estimated 2000 employees across multiple offices participated in rallies Monday to protest the ban. During a rally at the company’s headquarter in Mountain View, Calif., Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that there shouldn’t be any compromises on human rights. “We need to stand together,” he said. “The fight will continue.” Cook didn’t reveal which legal options he is weighing, but Apple wouldn’t be the only tech company to go to court against the executive order. Both Amazon and Microsoft have filed letters in support of a Washington State lawsuit against the ban. Filed Under: Apple Muslim ban Tim Cook Want to read more articles like this one?

After all, all the protests in the world don’t amount to much more than opportunities for liberals to cry and act like drama queens on camera, but it will require REAL MONEY to take on this cabal of reptilian billionaires currently pretending to be “in touch” with the American people, and the more Trump’s disgusting policies impact the bottom lines of the businesses he claims to be supporting and saving, the more reasons they’ll have to fight back.

INNOVATE Apple's 1st Quarter Results Prove Innovation Has Nothing to Do With R&D Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones in the last quarter, more than ever before. However, the trend continues to show a decline in innovation. Here is the real story. By Yoram Solomon Dr. Yoram Solomon is a creativity and innovation speaker and the author of Un-Kill Creativity: How Corporate America Can Out-Innovate Startups. Solomon has published five books and many articles, and was named one of the top 40 innovation bloggers for 2015 (No. 12). He is a former professor of technology and industry forecasting at the University of Texas at Dallas, and a National Speakers Association member. He holds nine patents and many innovation awards, and was named “TI’s great innovator.” In 2015, he was elected to the Plano Independent School District board. @yoram Founder, Large Scale Creativity@yoram WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Yes, there is no doubt that Apple just had its best quarter ever. After three consecutive quarters of decline in sales, Apple sold more iPhones (78.3 million compared to 74.8 million a year ago) and more Macs (5.4 million compared to 5.3 million a year ago), although less iPads (13.1 million compared to 16.1 million a year ago). It resulted in record quarterly revenue of $78.4 million compared to $75.9 million a year ago, and $46.9 million in the previous quarter). The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) continues to rate Apple as the most innovative company for the 11th year in a row. The company hasn't lost its top spot for even one year. However, a deeper dive into Apple's financials shows a slightly different story. In the first year that BCG ranked Apple as the most innovative company, 2005, Apple's revenue increased 68.3% and its profit increase 383% compared to the previous year, while the investment in Research and Development only increased 9.2%, which really meant a decrease in percentage of sales from 6% of sales the year before, and 8% the year before that. 68.3% revenue growth is phenomenal, considering that Apple had already generated $8.3 billion the year before. The growth in 2005 was fueled mainly by the introduction of the iPod a few years earlier. iPod sales grew 409% from 2004, and 370% the year before. The kind of hyper growth you could expect from the introduction of a disruptive product. What about 2016? Apple's revenue actually declined 7.7% in 2016 from $234 billion to $216 billion. Its profit declined even faster, 14.4% from $53.4 billion to $45.7 billion in 2016. And what about the investment in Research and Development? That actually increased from $8 billion (3% of sales) in 2015 to $10 billion (5% of sales) in 2016. Apple's investment in R&D increased 25% year over year, while revenue declined almost 8%. "R&D investment takes a while to show results," you might say, but Apples R&D investment grew by more than 30% in each of the previous 7 years (35%, 34%, 35%, 32%, 39%, 36%, 34%). How long is it before that investment pays off? The last time Apple's R&D investment grew less than 30% annually was in 2009. And in the first quarter of 2017? While sales increased 3.3% over the first quarter of 2016, R&D investment increased by 19.4% for the same period. The conclusion. The conclusion is simple: investment in Research and Development is not the same as innovation. The introductions of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad were radical. Those were game changers. Apple TV and Apple Watch were not. Spending more money on Research and Development is not the answer. Reviving the Culture for Creativity that Apple used to have is. Oh, and one more thing--the Boston Consulting Group may want to revisit how it ranks the most innovative companies... Like this column?

In the videos, Long alludes to his former work for Apple. Apple's "Get a Mac" campaign became famous for the way in which it tried to present the benefits of Mac computers over Windows machines. Long, playing the role of the Mac, started each advert with the tagline "Hello, I'm a Mac." Co-star John Hodgman, performing as a Windows PC, was then introduced. The campaign has gone down in history as one of Apple's standout marketing efforts. It promoted Mac as a popular, casual computer that's easy to use, contrasting it with Microsoft's complex and vulnerable Windows. Long hasn't appeared in another Apple ad since the campaign ended in 2009. He's now returning to technology advertisements with Huawei, having been specially sought out for his work on Get a Mac. Huawei is the third largest smartphone company in the world but is struggling to grow itself into a truly global business. The company is trying to get its phones known in the U.S. but sales are still low compared with the market leaders. Huawei evidently intends to fight Apple with the company's former ad actor, creating its own line of light-hearted videos to extol the virtues of its handsets. Although the format of the campaign is different, it still focuses on the same premise: Long casually lists the product's features, using humour to make it memorable. While there are no explicit statements of Long's former role, there are several references to Apple's campaign. At one point Long says "I have a tonne of experience in tech," alluding to his work on Get a Mac. The ad agency that's creating the campaigns apparently wanted Long to directly mention Apple. However, the actor convinced them to tone it down for a less pronounced effect. Huawei was also looking for a subtle dig at Apple, rather than an obvious attack. "The original concept 'was a much more emboldened approach to call out the previous relationship with Apple,' but Long and the client encouraged them to find 'a nice middle ground where that idea is inferred as opposed to explicitly stated," industry site Campaign reports. Although the videos are light-hearted, they do signify Huawei's commitment to gaining the same traction in the U.S. that it has achieved in China. The company usurped Apple as the country's top smartphone brand in 2015 and has continued to gain market share since. Apple has seen similar success in its home market though, last night blowing away analyst expectations by reporting record-breaking quarterly iPhone sales. Huawei needs Long's ad campaign to convince sceptical U.S. smartphone buyers to take a chance on a brand that's still very much emerging outside of Asia. The company will be widely promoting the adverts to increase consumer awareness of its name. Two videos have already been published, focusing on Huawei's Mate 9 Android smartphone and MateBook Windows 10 laptop.

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Friday February, 3, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business > Asia Other Vietnam Thailand Taiwan Singapore Philippines Pakistan NZ Malaysia Korea Japan Indonesia India HK China Australia Markets Taiwan to become 14th country to get Apple Pay By Christine Chou, The China Post  February 2, 2017, 12:19 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ Mobile payment service Apple Pay will soon be available in Taiwan, the U.S. consumer electronics giant Apple Inc. officially announced on Wednesday. The company said on their website that the service will allow consumers in Taiwan to use their iPhones and Apple Watches to make payments, but have not yet revealed the exact date services will start. It said shoppers would only need to place a finger on their Touch ID sensor and hold their iPhone within an inch of the contactless reader to complete a transaction. Apple Watch users could double-click the side button and hold the display within an inch of the contactless reader, then wait for a gentle tap that signals the purchase has been made. Seven major banks will support the service in Apple Pay's initial launch in Taiwan — including Cathay United Bank, CTBC Bank, E. Sun Commercial Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank, Taishin International Bank and Union Bank of Taiwan, confirmed Apple. Apple Pay, which allowed for contactless payments via iOS apps, was introduced on the global market in September 2014. Taiwan will be the 14th location to have the Apple Pay system, following the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, China, France, Russia, Switzerland, New Zealand, Spain, Singapore and Japan. The news comes after Samsung Electronics announced last November that it would release its rival digital wallet service Samsung Pay in Taiwan, some time in the first half of this year. Samsung said what differentiates it from Apple's system is theirs can be used on existing contactless payment equipment, so retailers would not have to purchase an additional machine. However, market watchers expect most shop owners to install Apple's system, given the prevalence of iOS devices in Taiwan. Currently, Google's Android Pay — another widely anticipated electronic payment service — is only available in the U.S. and U.K but they have announced they will expand to other territories, including Hong Kong and Singapore. Google has not revealed if or when it will launch the service in Taiwan.

If anything, the numbers Apple released Tuesday highlight the company's growing dependence on the iPhone, whose sales tower above Apple's other current offerings. The company hasn't managed to come up with another breakthrough product since its chief visionary, Steve Jobs, died in 2011. Meanwhile, Apple's rivals have been rolling out new products in other promising fields such as augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Apple currently trails in those areas, although many analysts believe the company may try to catch up with products featuring those trendy technologies later this year. No matter what's coming down the pike, the iPhone remains a huge moneymaker. Its success is the main reason Apple boasts a market value of US$640 billion — more than any other company. The iPhone is also driving the rapid growth of Apple's services division, which makes money from fixing devices, selling music streaming subscriptions and commissions on sales of mobile apps. Apple's services revenue surged 18 percent to US$7.2 billion in the past quarter, putting it on pace generate enough annual revenue by itself to rank among the world's largest companies. IPhones on the Rise Again ... Barely But selling more iPhones has been getting tougher as more people hold on to older models for longer periods and competitors such as Samsung and Google entice customers with sleek devices running on Android software. The trend led to three consecutive quarters in which iPhone sales fell compared to the prior year, causing Apple's total revenue to sag as well. Apple bounced back in the quarter ending in December, buoyed by a positive response to the late September release of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. That device featured a better camera, which drew rave reviews, and no jack for headphones, which irked some consumers and befuddled others. Apple shipped 78.3 million iPhones in the latest quarter, a 5 percent increase compared to the previous year. It benefited from a year-end quarter consisting of 14 weeks, one more than the previous year period. If not for the calendar quirk, the iPhone sales slump might not have ended. Apple sold an average of 5.6 million iPhones per week in the latest quarter compare to 5.7 million iPhones per week in the previous year. About 17 percent of all iPhones are now 7 models, according to Localytics, which tracks activity on mobile devices. Most of the rest are older iPhone 6 or iPhone 5 models. Apple could have sold more of the iPhone 7 Plus, which boasts a bigger screen and an extra camera, but the company misgauged demand and didn't make enough to meet customer demand, CEO Tim Cook said during a conference call. 1|2|Next Page>> SHARE CLOSE Blogger Google+ Live Journal Plurk Stumble Upon   Tweet PREVIOUS ARTICLE Apple's good news NEXT ARTICLE Indonesia to seek higher pay for its domestic workers in Taiwan Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Delta Air reportedly will stop serving Taiwan in May 2 Asus unveils ZenFone with Daydream, Google Tango 3 Debate resurfaces in wake of assault 4 McDonald's sells China operations to consortium for US$2.08 billion 5 Taiwan sends coffee procurement delegations to Central America 6 Japan's Takeda in US$5.2 billion deal for US cancer drugmaker 7 Hon Hai not to withdraw China investments 8 Taiwan Cement chief dies after fall 9 Trump in Asia: Region poised for change as new era dawns 10 Trump's 'America First' could affect Taiwan's exports: MOEA Subscribe  |   Advertise  |   RSS Feed  |   About Us  |   Career  |   Contact Us Sitemap  |   Top Stories  |   Taiwan  |   China  |   Business  |   Asia  |   World  |   Sports  |   Life  |   Arts & Leisure  |   Health  |   Editorial  |   Commentary Travel  |   Movies  |   TV Listings  |   Classifieds  |   Bookstore  |   Getting Around  |   Weather  |   Guide Post  |   Student Post  |   Terms of Use  |   Sitemap   Copyright © 1999 – 2017 The China Post.

Last quarter the company spent $2.8 billion on R&D. That's up from $2.4 billion in the year ago quarter. In 2016, Apple spend $10.39 on R&D, its highest annual spend ever. When asked about the increase in R&D spending last year, CEO Tim Cook said: "The products that are in R&D, there is quite a bit of investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping or derivations of what is currently shipping. So I don’t want to talk about the exact split of it, but you can look at the growth rate and conclude that there’s a lot of stuff that we’re doing beyond the current products." Apple has been rumored to be working on an electric self driving car, augmented reality glasses, chip and sensor design, wireless charging, and numerous other technologies.

AP Photo Stocks dip after an early gain Wednesday By: The Associated Press February 1, 2017 0 Stocks are down slightly Wednesday after an early rally ran out of steam. Technology stocks are up after Apple said iPhone sales improved in its last quarter, which sent its stock to its highest price in more than a year. Most other stocks are trading lower. Companies that pay big dividends, like utilities, are taking some of the biggest losses. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average lost 2 points to 19,861 as of 12:20 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274. The Nasdaq composite added 12 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,626. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks declined 3 points, or 0.2 percent, to $1,359. The market has made only small moves in recent days as investors wait for the Federal Reserve to wrap up its latest policy meeting later Wednesday. APPLE POLISHED: Apple jumped to its highest price in a year and a half after it said consumers snapped up its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus over the last three months. That ended the first-ever slump in iPhone sales, and Apple’s first-quarter results were stronger than analysts expected. Its stock rose $7.32, or 6 percent, to $128.67. The big gains for Apple, the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company, took technology stocks higher. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices also climbed $1.42, or 13.6 percent, to $11.79. AMD reported a profit when analysts expected a loss, and its sales were greater than expected. JOB GAINS: A survey showed private U.S. employers hired new workers at a faster pace in January, a sign that the economy could be getting stronger. The hiring was greater than expected, and the construction, manufacturing, health care and shipping industries all adding jobs at a solid pace. The U.S. government will release its own monthly jobs report Friday. BONDS: Investors reacted to the hiring report by selling government bonds, which are relatively safe investments that are in greater demand when the economy seems weaker. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 2.50 percent from 2.44 percent. Financial stocks rose, as higher interest rates allow banks to charge more money for lending. Lincoln National climbed $1.53, or 2.3 percent, to $69.04 and JPMorgan Chase rose 66 cents to $85.29. Stocks that pay large dividends traded lower as bond yields rose. Dominion Resources dropped $4.26, or 5.6 percent, to $72 after a weak quarterly report. THE PITS: Mailing equipment and software company Pitney Bownes slid $2.71, or 17.1 percent, to $13.21 after its quarterly sales fell short of expectations and its profit forecast disappointed Wall Street. ENERGY: Oil prices stayed within a small range. U.S. crude added 19 cents to $53 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, gained 32 cents to $55.90 a barrel in London. U.S. oil has stayed between roughly $52 and $55 a barrel for the last two months. The S&P 500’s energy company index is on track to fall for the fifth day in a row. It’s down 4 percent over that time and has sunk 7 percent since Dec. 13. ALUMINUM ACTIVISM: Lightweight aluminum products maker Arconic surged after its largest shareholder said the company needs new leadership. Elliott Management nominated five potential directors to Arconic’s board. The company said it stands by CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and that Elliott’s moves are not in the best interest of all shareholders. Arconic makes lightweight engineered products for aerospace and autos, which some investors saw as more promising than Alcoa’s mining and smelting business. But since the companies split on Nov. 1, Arconic stock is almost flat and Alcoa has jumped more than 60 percent. Arconic gained $2.11, or 9.3 percent, to $24.84. CURRENCIES: The dollar gained strength after the jobs survey. It rose to 113.43 yen from 112.76 yen. The euro fell to $1.0752 from $1.0803. OVERSEAS: Stocks in Europe got a boost from the ADP survey and a report that said manufacturing in China grew at its fastest pace in two years in January. Heavy government spending and more lending by banks helped keep the economy steady. Germany’s DAX added 1 percent while the CAC 40 of France rose 0.9 percent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain picked up 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.6 percent after a skid on Tuesday. The Kospi in South Korea jumped 0.6 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.2 percent.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | February 1, 2017 -- 17:23 GMT (09:23 PST) | Topic: iPad Apple CEO Tim Cook says that he remains "bullish," but the numbers suggest that this is little more than putting a brave face on things. Must read: Five things you shouldn't buy from Apple The problem facing the iPad is that it's past its peak. In fact, "peak iPad" was three years ago, when in 1Q 14 Apple sold 26 million iPads. It's been downhill from there, with little blips of increased interest around the holiday period. Comparing the last quarter to "peak iPad" three years ago, iPad sales have halved. Here's what sales look like: iPad quarterly sales Apple should be worried about that. Why? Because the chart should be all too familiar to the company. Here are quarterly sales of another Apple product that once seemed unstoppable but is now pretty much forgotten - the iPod. iPod quarterly sales See the similarities? You should. But in fact, the iPad's trajectory is worse than that of the iPod. While iPod sales never got as high that that of the iPad - it hit a peak of 22.7 million in 1Q 09 - it took the iPod four years (or 16 quarters) before sales halved. The iPad has reached that point in three years. Best iPhone or iPad apps (February 2017) SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 25 NEXT PREV See also: Is Apple out of the woods?

Shares of the iPhone maker surged 6% on Wednesday to their highest level since July 2015. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is now up an impressive 11% so far this year, blowing past the rest of the stock market. Apple's latest rally was triggered by this week's strong earnings report that raised hopes on Wall Street about the potential for blockbuster demand for the next generation of iPhones. Not only did Apple post its first sales increase in a year, but Tim Cook & Co. sent positive signals about demand heading into the rumored release of iPhone 8 later this year. Timothy Acuri, a Cowen & Co. analyst who covers Apple, predicted in a research report that there will be a "powder-keg fueled super cycle this fall" for the iPhone. Apple said the number of iPhone users is growing by "strong double-digits" right now. "That's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's big driver for our services business," Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, said during Tuesday's conference call. Apple's services division, which includes Apple Pay and AppleCare, enjoyed an 18% pop in sales last quarter to exceed $7 billion. Related: Apple's long losing streak is over Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba was so encouraged by Apple's iPhone growth that he upgraded his price target on the stock to $135. (Apple closed at $121.35 on Tuesday but has since surged as high as $128.48). "This is clearly helpful. Apple has a very sticky and loyal customer base. People who end up in Apple's family are there for a long time," Lamba said. Apple hasn't officially named its new iPhone yet, but Lamba believes it will be iPhone 8. Expectations are high about the new iPhone in part because this year marks the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone launch. The key will be whether the new iPhone packs powerful enough features after complaints that the last few iterations didn't include improvements dramatic enough to justify upgrading. "The more we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate," Apple's CFO said. Related: Apple has $246 BILLION in cash, nearly all overseas Hopes for compelling features and strong demand for the iPhone is why Cowen & Co.'s Acuri believes Wall Street "continues to grossly underestimate" Apple's ability to grow profits the next few quarters. Despite all the hopes for the iPhone 8, Apple still faces a number of challenges. Apple execs admit that the strong U.S. dollar hurts the company by making products sold overseas more expensive for foreigners. While the greenback surged after the election, it has since cooled off considerably. Apple is still also contending with what remains an oversaturated smartphone market. Apple won't be able to rely on help from Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 fiasco for much longer. Still, Cowen & Co. believes it's almost a "layup" that Apple shares rise to $135 over the next 12 years. Acuri said he can "easily" see Apple jumping to $145 or even $150.

Keris Alison Lahiff Feb 1, 2017 12:11 PM EST Wall Street turned mixed as an Apple (AAPL) -inspired tech rally failed to offset weakness elsewhere on Wednesday. A sharp selloff in utilities stocks pushed the S&P 500 into the red. Trading in crude oil was volatile after a weekly reading on inventories showed a sharp increase. U.S. stockpiles rose in the past week by nearly three times as much as expected. The energy sector was one of the worst performers on Wall Street. Automakers reported a drop in vehicle sales in January. Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler  (FCAU) saw sharp declines in their car sales last month, while a drop in overall sales at General Motors (GM) caused inventories to surge. Manufacturing activity climbed in January to its strongest level in more than two years. The sector rebounded from the pressures of weak demand and a strong dollar that hampered growth last year.

Asian markets wavered and the dollar lost some steam Thursday after the Fed kept its key lending rate on hold as expected at its latest policy meeting. (AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi) LONDON - Global stock markets were uneven Thursday as investors shied away from riskier assets amid renewed concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany's DAX was flat at 11,663 while the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2 per cent to 4,805. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.6 per cent higher at 7,153. U.S. stocks were heading for a soft open, with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures down 0.2 per cent. TRUMP TURBULENCE: Investors were rattled by the latest news from the Trump administration, including a phone call in which he warned Mexico's president he might send in troops and another about a tense exchange with Australia's leader over refugees. Following the Trump rally in the wake of his election victory last November, stock gains appear to be petering out with investors getting jittery in light of Trump's dramatic policy announcements since taking office. MARKET VIEW: "Trump's presidency comes with greater than normal risks," Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, said in a report. Eventually, he said "pragmatic pro-growth policies are likely to ultimately dominate populist policies." However, Oliver added that "the Trump honeymoon with investors is likely over with a short term period of correction/volatility likely to continue in shares, bond yields and the U.S. dollar." CENTRAL BANKING: On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold after its latest policy meeting — as investors had expected. Policymakers signalled that they still expect to gradually raise rates but gave no clear timeline. Meanwhile, the Bank of England kept its main interest rate on hold at a record low of 0.25 per cent on Thursday but revised up its growth forecasts for the British economy, which has held up better than many forecasters predicted in the aftermath of last June's vote to leave the European Union. DEUTSCHE DOWN AGAIN: Germany's biggest lender, Deutsche Bank, saw its share price fall by around 5 per cent after the company posted another hefty loss in 2016. The bank reported a loss of 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) for all of 2016. Much of that loss was due to a fourth-quarter deficit of 1.89 billion euros largely related to the sale of its Abbey Life unit and costs associated with legal fines and penalties. ASIA'S DAY: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 1.2 per cent to 18,914.58 as the stronger yen weighed on exporters, while South Korea's Kospi dipped 0.5 per cent to 2,071.01. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.6 per cent to 23,184.52 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1 per cent lower to 5,645.40. Markets in mainland China were closed for the final day of a weeklong holiday. CURRENCIES: The euro rose 0.3 per cent to $1.0810 while the dollar fell 0.6 per cent to 112.36 yen. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 15 cents to $54.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, advanced 38 cents to $57.18 a barrel in London. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

More videos Bank halts political donations The National Australia Bank has stopped donating to political parties, concerned about the public perception. Westpac gave $87,000 to the Liberal Party, compared with $81,000 to Labor in 2015-16, according to the Australian Electoral Commission's annual returns released on Wednesday. The major parties will be looking to alternative big-business donors, with Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and NAB vowing to stop the practice in 2016. Related Content Turnbull's multimillion-dollar donation to remain secret for another year Swallow the money: PM's donations delay is foolish and unconscionable NAB, which donated $91,000 to the Liberals and $72,000 to the ALP, said it "recognises that it has an important role to play in the Australian political process and in the development and promotion of policy". But it added the bank had stopped donations to political parties so it could focus on supporting the community directly. Advertisement The 2016 total was already down on the previous year, when the big four gave $520,000 to the Liberals and Nationals and $236,000 to the ALP. Australia's biggest miners have also pulled back from political donations, with BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto not submitting a return to the AEC.

Woodside donated $123,500 to the ALP and $126,980 to the Liberals. Chevron, which has developed the world's biggest LNG terminal off the coast of Western Australia, gave $15,500 to Labor but gave $39,000 to the WA Liberal Party.   Some of the biggest pockets in the business world looked past the major parties, with Flight Centre founder Graham "Skroo" Turner continuing his financial support for Sustainable Australia, a micro-party formerly known as the Sustainable Population Party. Mr Turner gave Sustainable Australia $212,000 via his personal company Gainsdale, while his fellow Flight Centre founder Geoff Harris gave the party $220,000 via his company 26 Summers. Mr Turner said he donated to the party because he and his wife were interested in wildlife preservation and land rehabilitation, and they believed overpopulation was one of the main causes of unsustainability.   "Unsustainability is not just about population, but overpopulation is the main cause of the destruction, of course, and that's why we're interested in Sustainable Australia," Mr Turner said.   Mr Harris' former wife, Susan, pledged $300,000 to Sustainable Australia. J.J. Richards & Sons, the largest privately owned waste management company in Australia, donated $25,000 to the Australian Liberty Alliance, whose policies include fighting the "Islamisation of Australia".   Ramsay Healthcare remains a big Coalition donor, giving $45,000 to the federal divisions of the Liberals and Nationals. Frank Lowy's Westfield Corporation gave $160,000 to both sides. Village Roadshow donated $636,000 to the two major parties, with $325,000 going to the Liberal Party. In the casino sector, Star Entertainment, owner of Sydney's Star Casino and Jupiters on the Gold Coast, gave $44,00 to the Liberals and $33,000 to Labor. James Packer's Crown Resorts gave combined donations of $60,000 to the Liberals in WA, where his company owns the Burswood casino. Follow us on Facebook 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Kee Jr. Published: Feb 2, 2017 1:02 p.m. ET Share The iPhone maker had scant growth, even though it had an extra business week in the three months through December Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook By ThomasH. Kee Jr. (Updates story originally published Feb. 1 to add weekly EPS and revenue numbers for easy comparison.) After Apple released financial results Tuesday, the headlines were clearly bullish. The iPhone maker had resumed growing after three straight quarters of sales declines; earnings beat analysts’ estimates; and the outlook, while modest, is at least looking brighter. Not so fast. In the fourth quarter of 2015 (what the company calls its fiscal first quarter), there were 13 weeks in which revenue and earnings were generated, one less than in the most recently reported period. See this table and this story. On a prorated basis, Apple AAPL, -0.17% would have needed to report earnings per share of about $3.53, higher than its reported EPS of $3.38 a share, to account for the extra week of business. (Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected $3.22.) Likewise, revenue would have to have come in at about $81 billion versus the reported $78.4 billion, which was a meager 3% increase anyway. Here are the facts, broken down so they’re easy to read: During 14 weeks in Q4 2016, Apple earned $3.36/share on $78.351 billion in revenue. During 13 weeks in Q4 2015, Apple earned $3.28/share on $75.872 billion in revenue. The weekly EPS calculations: Q4 2016 EPS weekly results EPS/14 = $3.36/14 = $0.24 per week. Q4 2015 EPS weekly results EPS/13 = $3.28/13 = $0.252 per week. The mathematical conclusion, given this weekly EPS comparison, is that Apple grew at a 4.76% slower rate in Q4 2016 than in Q4 2015. ((0.24 - 0.252)/0.252) And the weekly revenue calculations: Q4 2016 revenue weekly results: Revenue/14 = $78.351/14 = $5.5965 billion per week. Q4 2015 revenue weekly results: Revenue/13 = $75.872/13 = $5.8363 billion per week. The mathematical conclusion: Apple grew at a 4.11% slower rate in Q4 2016 than in Q4 2015. ((5.5965 - 5.8363)/5.8363) Admittedly, Apple’s weekly revenue run rate dwarfs the annual run rates for most companies. But the same valuation metrics still apply, and we need to ask ourselves if the company is growing. The issue here is the confusing headlines. Conclusion: Apple did not grow in Q4 2016 versus Q4 2015. In fact, the rate contracted. The only reason it seems as if Apple grew is that there was an extra week added to Q4 2016 results that was not there in Q4 2015. So the company had 7.6% more time to add to revenue and EPS, but instead the net result was a weekly run rate contraction of 4.11% and 4.76%, respectively. In addition, the company had lower guidance. Turning to opinion: This was a reporting period in which archrival Samsung suffered greatly, and Apple had the chance to reap the rewards. But it didn’t. Total iPhone shipments climbed only 5% in the three months through December as Samsung issued a recall for its flagship Galaxy Note 7. It turns out that Samsung shipped 77.5 million smartphones in the period, almost the same as Apple. That’s a concern for us. Still, Apple adds massive amounts of cash to the balance sheet every quarter, which is obviously a good thing. But as long as the company cranks out cash instead of using it effectively, earnings growth will be discounted. Alas, the stock trades near 15 times earnings, less than the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.06% Finally, from a technical perspective, Apple’s stock is close to our stated longer-term resistance level. The company’s shares rose 6.1% to $128.75 on Wednesday, the biggest gain since July. On Thursday, the stock fell about 0.4%. Accordingly, we believe that the giddy reaction to the earnings results are overblown, investors are not looking at the situation properly and, although the cash generated by the company is solid, we do not believe a multiple of near 15 times earnings is justified given little to no EPS growth. The multiple, in our estimation, should be closer to 10 times earnings. And with that, we believe Apple is a better candidate for a short sale. Thomas H.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Apple tops Samsung as top smartphone vendor in Q4 2016, record 1.47 billion smartphones shipped in 2016 – IDC Apple has beat Samsung to claim the top position as the top smartphone vendor based on shipments in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to a report by Research Firm IDC (International Data Corporation). Apple, as it announced earlier today shipped 78.3 million smartphones during the quarter grabbing 18.3% market share compared to Samsung who shipped 77.5 smartphones grabbing 18.1% market share.  “For the full year, the worldwide smartphone market saw a total of 1.47 billion units shipped, marking the highest year of shipments on record, yet up only 2.3% from the 1.44 billion units shipped in 2015. Large markets like China, the United States, and Brazil all ended the year on a strong note helping to keep worldwide volumes in positive territory.” said IDC. Regarding the future growth in smartphone segments, IDC said: Despite the changes that 2016 brought upon the market, including annual growth dropping from 10.4% in 2015 to just 2.3% in 2016, IDC expects a few turnarounds in 2017. First, IDC is forecasting a rebound in iPhone shipments with the yet to be announced tenth anniversary iPhone. Second, the Middle East and Africa (MEA) and Latin America regions are expected to return to growth in 2017. And, as a result of the aforementioned as well as several other driving factors, growth in 2017 should improve slightly from 2016’s results. Chinese players Huawei, OPPO and vivo grabbed third, fourth and fifth spots for Q4 2016 with 10.6%, 7.3% and 5.8% market share and for the whole year, respectively. OPPO grew 116.6% YoY in Q4 2016 and 132.9% in 2016 compared to 2015. Even vivo grew 103.2% in 2016 compared to 2015. Samsung is the top smartphone vendor for the whole 2016 with 21.2% market share beating Apple with market share of 14.6%.

(Evan Vucci/AP) By Levi Sumagaysay | lsumagaysay@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: February 1, 2017 at 8:50 am | UPDATED: February 1, 2017 at 1:39 pm Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company is considering legal options against Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration, as tech industry resistance to it continues to grow.

Donald Trump vs. Arnold Schwarzenegger in Prayer Breakfast spat Why Trump’s call to Australian leader was ‘worst by far’ Cook, who in a memo to employees soon after the president’s ban last week said the company “wouldn’t exist without immigration,” said hundreds of employees have been affected, according to the Wall Street Journal. “These are people that have friends and family. They’re co-workers. They’re taxpayers. They’re key parts of the community,” Cook told the Journal in an interview Tuesday, saying he has received “heart-wrenching” emails from his employees. The CEO — like other tech executives who have spoken out against Trump’s ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees, a move the new administration says is needed to fight terrorism — also said the ban affects Apple’s global business. It’s important that Apple’s employees “look like the world,” Cook said, considering the company sells its devices in 180 countries. It was “a simple decision to oppose the executive order,” he told the Journal. Also this week, Amazon and Expedia filed declarations of support for Washington state’s lawsuit against Trump’s order, and GitHub organized a meeting of tech companies to consider how they could legally support resistance. Other big U.S. tech companies that have said their employees are affected by the order include Google — whose employees and executives have protested the bans — and Microsoft. Cook, who was among the executives present at Trump’s tech forum in December despite a complicated relationship with the then-president-elect over Trump’s statements about Apple, also said he is contacting “very, very senior people in the White House” to stress to them that the immigration ban is against the nation’s best interests. “More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds,” Cook said. “That’s what makes us special. We ought to pause and really think deeply through that.” Tags:  Apple Donald Trump Trump Administration Levi Sumagaysay Levi Sumagaysay is editor for the Bay Area News Group in charge of the SiliconBeat.com technology blog and Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter.

Technology stocks climbed after Apple said iPhone sales improved in its last quarter, which sent its stock to its highest price in more than a year. By Marley Jay, Associated Press | PUBLISHED: February 1, 2017 at 8:39 am | UPDATED: February 1, 2017 at 11:35 am NEW YORK — Stocks are little changed Wednesday after an early rally ran out of steam. Technology stocks are up after Apple said iPhone sales improved in its last quarter, which sent its stock to its highest price in more than a year. Most other stocks are trading lower and utilities are falling the most. A survey showed private U.S. employers hired new workers at a faster pace in January, a sign that the economy could be getting stronger. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average gained 15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,878 as of 11:05 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,276. The Nasdaq composite added 15 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,629. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 3 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,364.

The market has made only small moves in recent days as investors wait for the Federal Reserve to wrap up its latest policy meeting later Wednesday. JOB GAINS: A survey by payroll services provider ADP said private U.S. employers added far more jobs than expected in January. The gain of 246,000 jobs was the most in a single month since June. The hiring was widespread, with the construction, manufacturing, health care and shipping industries all adding jobs at a solid pace. That was a positive sign for the economy. Investors sold government bonds, which are relatively safe investments that are in greater demand when the economy seems weaker. The U.S. government will release its own monthly jobs report Friday. APPLE POLISHED: Apple jumped to its highest price in a year and a half after it said consumers snapped up its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus over the last three months. That ended the first-ever slump in iPhone sales, and Apple’s first-quarter results were stronger than analysts expected. Its stock rose $6.83, or 5.6 percent, to $128.18. The big gains for Apple, the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company, took technology stocks higher. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices also climbed $1.22, or 11.8 percent, to $11.59. AMD reported a profit when analysts expected a loss, and its sales were greater than expected. BONDS: U.S. government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 2.50 percent from 2.44 percent. Financial stocks rose, as higher interest rates allow banks to charge more money for lending. Lincoln National climbed $1.07, or 1.6 percent, to $68.58 and JPMorgan Chase rose 92 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $85.55. THE PITS: Mailing equipment and software company Pitney Bownes slid $3.02, or 19 percent, to $12.90 after its quarterly sales fell short of expectations and its profit forecast disappointed Wall Street. ENERGY: Oil prices continued to trade in a small range. U.S. crude added 44 cents to $53.25 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, gained 59 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $56.17 a barrel in London. U.S. oil has stayed between roughly $52 and $55 a barrel for the last two months. The S&P 500’s energy company index is on track to fall for the fifth day in a row. It’s down 3 percent over that time and has sunk 7 percent since Dec. 13. ALUMINUM ACTIVISM: Lightweight aluminum products maker Arconic surged after its largest shareholder said the company needs new leadership. Elliott Management nominated five potential directors to Arconic’s board. The company said it stands by CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and that Elliott’s moves are not in the best interest of all shareholders. Arconic makes lightweight engineered products for aerospace and autos, which some investors saw as more promising than Alcoa’s mining and smelting business. But since the companies split on Nov. 1, Arconic stock is almost flat and Alcoa has jumped more than 60 percent. Arconic gained $2.03, or 8.9 percent, to $24.76. CURRENCIES: The dollar gained strength after the jobs survey. It rose to 113.62 yen from 112.76 yen. The euro fell to $1.0753 from $1.0803. OVERSEAS: Stocks in Europe got a boost from the ADP survey and a report that said manufacturing in China grew at its fastest pace in two years in January. Heavy government spending and more lending by banks helped keep the economy steady. Germany’s DAX added 1 percent while the CAC 40 of France rose 0.9 percent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain picked up 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.6 percent after a skid on Tuesday. The Kospi in South Korea jumped 0.6 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.2 percent.

The major averages have recently been lingering near the unchanged line. Currently, the major averages are turning in a mixed performance. While the S&P 500 is down 3.65 points or 0.2 percent at 2,275.22, the Dow is up 4.00 points or less than 0.1 percent at 19,868.09 and the Nasdaq is up 12.94 points or 0.2 percent at 5,627.73. The initial strength on Wall Street came in reaction to upbeat U.S. economic data as well as strong quarterly results from tech giant Apple (AAPL). Payroll processor ADP released a report before the start of trading showing stronger than expected private sector job growth in the month of January. The report said private sector employment jumped by 246,000 jobs in January after climbing by a revised 151,000 jobs in December. Economists had expected an increase of about 168,000 jobs compared to the addition of 153,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month. A separate report from the Institute for Supply Management showed growth in the manufacturing sector accelerated to the fastest rate in over two years in the month of January. The ISM said its purchase managers index rose to 56.0 in January from a revised 54.5 in December, with a reading above 50 indicating growth in the manufacturing sector. Economists had been expecting the index to inch up to 55.0. With the bigger than expected increase, the ISM's manufacturing index reached its highest level since November of 2014. Despite the pullback by the broader markets, shares of Apple remain up by 5.8 percent after the iPhone and iPad maker reported fiscal first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Traders may have been reluctant to continue buying stocks ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy announcement this afternoon. While the Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, traders are likely to keep a close eye on the accompanying statement. Sector News Following the upbeat economic data, interest rate-sensitive utilities stocks have come under considerable selling pressure on the day. The Dow Jones Utilities Average has slumped by 1.9 percent after ending the previous session at its best closing level in well over two months. Within the utilities sector, Dominion Resources (D) is posting a steep loss after reporting weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings. Significant weakness has also emerged among gold stocks, as reflected by the 1.5 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index. The weakness in the sector comes as gold for April delivery is falling $4.60 to $1,206.80 an ounce. Energy, software, and telecom stocks have also moved to the downside on the day, while strength remains visible among brokerage and semiconductor stocks. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index advanced by 0.6 percent, while Australia's All Ordinaries Index rose by 0.5 percent. The major European markets also moved to the upside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index surged up by 1 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries have come under pressure on the heels of the upbeat economic data. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 4.5 basis points at 2.296 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Main Economic Events In Europe In February -- A Preview Fed Meets First Time Under New Regime – Economic Preview for Week of Jan. 30 The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Previous Story More Commentary -Global Asian Shares Mixed As China Raises Interest Rates European Shares Seen Opening On Subdued Note Sensex, Nifty Lack Direction In Early Trade Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Cautious Trades Sensex, Nifty Seen Flat To Higher Thai Stock Market May Snap Losing Streak Indonesia Stock Market May Run Out Of Steam Losing Streak May Continue For Hong Kong Shares China Shares May Open Under Pressure Taiwan Stock Market May See Soft Start On Friday Singapore Stock Market Draws Flat Lead Malaysia Stock Market May Be Stuck In Neutral Mild Consolidation Tipped For South Korea Shares Stocks Close Roughly Flat Following Choppy Trading Day - U.S. Commentary Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction Ahead Of Jobs Report - U.S. Commentary <<Previous        64 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Metro AG Stock Down On Weak Q1 Profit; Backs FY17 Sales Growth View Scotiabank Spending $1 Bln On Digital Tech Longtime Micron Tech CEO Mark Durcan To Retire Amazon Profit Rises, But Shares Fall On Revenue Miss Netflix Program To Browse Movies With Your Mind Merck Q4 Adj.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) Apple is exploring its legal options as the iPhone maker and other tech giants decry President Trump's executive order on immigration. Apple CEO Tim Cook tells The Wall Street Journal he continues to contact senior White House officials to reconsider the order, impacting hundreds of the company's employees. "More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds," Cook tells the Journal. "That’s what makes us special." The comments from Cook echo an email sent to employees soon after Trump signed the executive order. "Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do," Cook wrote. The executive order blocks travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries — Libya, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — for at least 90 days. Syrian immigrants are banned indefinitely. The refugee program is halted for 120 days. Other key players in Silicon Valley are also considering plans to challenge the order. A group of companies including Netflix, Google and Airbnb were scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss what actions they can take. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Amazon are working with Washington state's attorney general on a lawsuit filed against the immigration order.

Stocks are building on a late surge from a day earlier. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK – Stocks are little changed Wednesday after an early rally ran out of steam. Technology stocks are up after Apple said iPhone sales improved in its last quarter, which sent its stock to its highest price in more than a year. Most other stocks are trading lower and utilities are falling the most. A survey showed private U.S. employers hired new workers at a faster pace in January, a sign that the economy could be getting stronger. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average gained 15 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 19,878 as of 11:05 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 2 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,276. The Nasdaq composite added 15 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 5,629. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 3 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 1,364. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. The market has made only small moves in recent days as investors wait for the Federal Reserve to wrap up its latest policy meeting later Wednesday. JOB GAINS: A survey by payroll services provider ADP said private U.S. employers added far more jobs than expected in January. The gain of 246,000 jobs was the most in a single month since June. The hiring was widespread, with the construction, manufacturing, health care and shipping industries all adding jobs at a solid pace. That was a positive sign for the economy. Investors sold government bonds, which are relatively safe investments that are in greater demand when the economy seems weaker. The U.S. government will release its own monthly jobs report Friday. APPLE POLISHED: Apple jumped to its highest price in a year and a half after it said consumers snapped up its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus over the last three months. That ended the first-ever slump in iPhone sales, and Apple’s first-quarter results were stronger than analysts expected. Its stock rose $6.83, or 5.6 per cent, to $128.18. The big gains for Apple, the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company, took technology stocks higher. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices also climbed $1.22, or 11.8 per cent, to $11.59. AMD reported a profit when analysts expected a loss, and its sales were greater than expected. BONDS: U.S. government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 2.50 per cent from 2.44 per cent. Financial stocks rose, as higher interest rates allow banks to charge more money for lending. Lincoln National climbed $1.07, or 1.6 per cent, to $68.58 and JPMorgan Chase rose 92 cents, or 1.1 per cent, to $85.55. THE PITS: Mailing equipment and software company Pitney Bownes slid $3.02, or 19 per cent, to $12.90 after its quarterly sales fell short of expectations and its profit forecast disappointed Wall Street. ENERGY: Oil prices continued to trade in a small range. U.S. crude added 44 cents to $53.25 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, gained 59 cents, or 1.1 per cent, to $56.17 a barrel in London. U.S. oil has stayed between roughly $52 and $55 a barrel for the last two months. The S&P 500’s energy company index is on track to fall for the fifth day in a row. It’s down 3 per cent over that time and has sunk 7 per cent since Dec. 13. ALUMINUM ACTIVISM: Lightweight aluminum products maker Arconic surged after its largest shareholder said the company needs new leadership. Elliott Management nominated five potential directors to Arconic’s board. The company said it stands by CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and that Elliott’s moves are not in the best interest of all shareholders. Arconic makes lightweight engineered products for aerospace and autos, which some investors saw as more promising than Alcoa’s mining and smelting business. But since the companies split on Nov. 1, Arconic stock is almost flat and Alcoa has jumped more than 60 per cent. Arconic gained $2.03, or 8.9 per cent, to $24.76. CURRENCIES: The dollar gained strength after the jobs survey. It rose to 113.62 yen from 112.76 yen. The euro fell to $1.0753 from $1.0803. OVERSEAS: Stocks in Europe got a boost from the ADP survey and a report that said manufacturing in China grew at its fastest pace in two years in January. Heavy government spending and more lending by banks helped keep the economy steady. Germany’s DAX added 1 per cent while the CAC 40 of France rose 0.9 per cent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain picked up 0.1 per cent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.6 per cent after a skid on Tuesday. The Kospi in South Korea jumped 0.6 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.2 per cent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

    By Dion RabouinNEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Stocks moved higher around the
globe and the U.S. dollar rose along with oil prices on
Wednesday as risk assets enjoyed a reprieve from the downturn
that has gripped markets in recent days.
    The dollar <.DXY> had suffered its worst January in three
decades after President Donald Trump complained that every
"other country lives on devaluation," while the U.S sat by "like
a bunch of dummies." [nL1N1FL25O]
    It rose 0.4 percent <.DXY> Wednesday, boosted by a
stronger-than-expected initial reading on U.S. employment and
solid manufacturing data.
    Bruised dollar bulls were also looking to the decision by
the Federal Reserve later in the day that is expected to
announce the central bank's intention to raise U.S. interest
rates a number of times this year. [nL5N1FM3EC]
    Wall Street stocks opened higher, powered by a 5-percent
jump in Apple, to join most major indexes from Europe, Asia and
emerging markets on the rise. [nL4N1FM2YA]
    Apple shares were the top boost to all the three main
indexes.
    "With a bellwether company such as Apple reporting an
encouraging set of numbers, it has brought the focus of
investors back on company fundamentals," said Andre Bakhos,
managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New
Jersey.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 57.39 points,
or 0.29 percent, to 19,921.48, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 3
points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,281.87 and the Nasdaq Composite
<.IXIC> added 25.53 points, or 0.45 percent, to 5,640.32.
    Both the pan-European FTSE 300 <.FTEU3> and the STOXX 600
<.STOXX> indexes were up around 1 percent. The Nikkei <.N225>
added 0.56 percent and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific
shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> gained 0.36 percent in a
largely quiet session.
    MSCI's index of emerging market bourses rose 0.5 percent as
well.
    That all combined to help MSCI's 46-country All World index
snap a four-day losing streak <.MIWD00000PUS>, though the recent
protectionist noises from Trump's team kept markets jittery.
    Trump's top trade adviser had also said on Tuesday that
Germany was using a "grossly undervalued" euro to exploit its
trading partners. The accusations drew rebuttals from German and
Japanese officials, but looked likely to run for some time.
[nL1N1FL25O]
    U.S. Treasury yields jumped after the U.S. data from
payrolls processor ADP that showed strong jobs gains in January,
raising expectations that Friday's closely watched government
employment report will also show strong growth. [nL1N1FM0PL]
    Friday's nonfarm payrolls report is expected to show
employers added 175,000 jobs last month, according to the median
of 102 economists polled by Reuters. [ECONUS]
    "When you have such an outlier the market's going to react,"
said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor
Fitzgerald in New York.
    Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes <US10YT=RR> fell 16/32 in
price to yield 2.51 percent, up from 2.45 percent late on
Tuesday.
    Brent crude <LCOc1> futures, the international benchmark,
edged further above $55 a barrel, supported by signs that Russia
and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are
delivering on promised supply reductions.  [nL4N1FM10H]
    Metals took a breather from their recent rise, with copper
falling from a two-month high as concerned grew over a strike in
the world's biggest copper mine in Chile <CMCU3>.[nL5N1FM2KT]
    Gold <XAU=> fell by nearly 1 percent on the strong dollar
and profit-taking from its recent rise.

Cook said hundreds of employees at Apple are affected by the travel ban, adding that he received “heart-wrenching” letters from workers at the company. His remarks come after Trump signed an executive order Friday barring immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. After the order was signed, protests across the country took off, with the tech industry being strongly vocal against the ban. "More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds. That's what makes us special," said Cook in the interview. "We ought to pause and really think deeply through that." Related Stories Google Sets Up $4 Million Immigration Crisis Fund After Trump Ban Tech Companies Meeting Up To Plan Against Trump Immigration Executive Order Cook said the company is looking into taking legal action against the order, which is something Amazon and Expedia are already doing in the state of Washington. On Tuesday, it was revealed other major tech companies, including Google, Airbnb and Netflix, were invited to a meeting to discuss supporting a filing against the travel ban. Google said more than 187 workers were affected by the executive order. In the interview, Cook said Apple is matching employees’ donations to relief funds on a two-to-one basis. The CEO also said he continues to contact “very, very senior people in the White House” to talk about why repealing the executive order is important not only for Apple but for the country. Cook had previously spoken out about the travel ban in an internal memo to employees over the weekend, in which he pointed out the company would not have existed without immigration, since Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs’ father was an immigrant from Syria. “Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,” Cook said in the memo. “I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 01, 2017 11:58am   Comments Share: Related AAPL By The Numbers: Putting Facebook's Staggering Growth In Perspective Apple Takes A Breather After Best One-Day Performance In Years Apple Plans $10 Billion Bond Sale To Boost U.S. Cash Pile (Investor's Business Daily) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) gained around 5 percent after the company's first quarter earnings consisted of a top and bottom line beat along with record iPhone sales. Perhaps flying a bit under the radar is Apple's growth in the Services segment, which is becoming a bigger part of the conversation moving forward. Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets broke down Apple's performance in the Services segment in a report following the earnings print. Long noted that Apple's services related revenue rose 18 percent year-over-year in the quarter to $7.2 billion and exceeded the analyst's estimates of $6.5 billion. The analyst also pointed out that last year's quarter included a one-time payment from Samsung of $548 million and was also one week shorter. Taking these factors into account, Long estimates the segment's revenue were 21 percent higher year-over-year, which is a growth rate that's approximately on par with the past few quarters. Apple management continues to believe it can double the segment's revenue in four years, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the high teens that exceeds the analyst's 10 percent growth rate through 2019. Bottom line, Long believes Services will be "an important part of the story" given the now stronger than expected growth rate relative to expectations heading into Tuesday's earnings report. Shares of Apple remain Outperform rated with a price target boosted to $142 from a previous $135.

PHOTO: Tracy Lundgren Google has displaced Apple as the world's most valuable brand to retake a spot it last occupied in 2011. Amazon, AT&T, Microsoft, Samsung Group, Verizon, Walmart, Facebook and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) also rank among the Top 10 brands on the planet. That's the word from London-based Brand Finance, an independent branded business valuation consultancy. Google Up, Apple Down Google’s brand value rose by 24 percent last year (from $88.2 billion to $109.4 billion) while Apple’s brand value declined nearly 27 percent (from $145.9 billion to $107.1 billion), according to the latest Brand Finance Global 500 report. Brand Finance first evaluates brands to determine their power/strength (based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, loyalty, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation). Brand strength is used to determine what proportion of a business’s revenue is contributed by the brand, which is projected into perpetuity to determine the brand’s value. The results of this analysis are ranked, with the world’s 500 most valuable brands featured in the Brand Finance Global 500. PHOTO: Brand Finance Google did well in this year's analysis, even though analysts noted its brand architecture is "somewhat more complicated than Apple’s" and further acknowledged it is attracting growing scrutiny over personal privacy issues and its "potential monopolistic behavior." "Google remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income. Ad revenues were up 20 percent in 2016, despite a fall in cost per click, as ad budgets are increasingly directed online," the report stated. The Google name is so strong that it drives reputation by association: "Multiple brands have been created or acquired that are merely ‘endorsed’ by the Google brand such as Android and Chrome. There are also brands that merely sit within the Google stable, such as YouTube, which has retained its brand long after acquisition." Apple Fans 'Losing Faith' But analysts took a big bite out of Apple's meticulously constructed image. "Apple was once a paragon of branding excellence," Brand Finance CEO David Haigh noted in the report. But he warned Apple’s evangelists are beginning to lose their faith, as "snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost to the point of invisibility." They said Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage while repeatedly disillusioning its advocates with tweaks rather than innovation in the form of material changes. "Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline," the report noted. PHOTO: Brand Finance Haigh said Brand Finance bridges the gap between the marketing and finance. "We understand the importance of design, advertising and marketing, but we also believe that the ultimate and overriding purpose of brands is to make money," he said. Based on a recent share price study, Brand Finance’s concludes it pays to invest in companies with strong brands. It found the most highly branded companies have a return almost double that of the average for the S&P 500 as a whole. 20 Tech/IT Services Companies There are 20 technology/IT services company among the 100 top rated companies in this year's Brand Finance Global 500 report.

What Wall Street expects from Apple's earnings call today Hannah Roberts, Business Insider UK Jan. 31, 2017, 7:29 AM 16,037 facebook linkedin twitter email print Stephen Lam/Getty Images Apple reports earnings for its first quarter of fiscal 2017 after market close today. It's the holiday quarter, which is always Apple's biggest. Investors are expecting its revenues, which have declined year-on-year for the past three consecutive quarters, to rebound this quarter. But they will also be focused on whether its services business — the App Store, Apple Music, and Applecare warranties — is becoming Apple's second firehose of profit after hardware sales. Here we map out analyst estimates going into Tuesday's earnings. Consensus revenue: $77.4 billion Consensus EPS: $3.23 Consensus 12-month price target: $133 View As: One Page Slides UBS is bullish on both Apple's long-term growth and in iPhone sales for 2017. UBS analysts believe that investors are not pricing in Apple's long-term revenue growth. They take the view that "Apple is preparing for the next era of personal technology — the Ambient Paradigm," contradicting the view held by investors that the iPhone is the "end of the road." The analysts are also bullish on iPhone sales for fiscal year 2017 because of growth in the installed base (the number of people with an iPhone and therefore potential customers for an upgrade). Revenues estimate: $76.8 billion EPS: $3.20 12-month price target: $127 Pacific Crest Securities: "Regardless of FQ1 results, Apple seems likely to be range-bound in the next few months as investors contemplate the next iPhone cycle and we see implications of potential policy changes under the new U.S. administration." Analysts at Pacific Crest Securities don't believe that Apple's stock price will move much before the third fiscal quarter of 2017, "when we should get more evidence around the lineup, costs and potential pricing in the next iPhone cycle." Revenue: $76.5 billion  EPS: $3.19 12-month price target: $127 Maxim Group: "[We] continue to believe Apple is at the precipice of a multi-year investment up-cycle." Maxim Group is extremely bullish on Apple in both the short, long, and medium term. Its estimates for the first fiscal quarter's revenues are around $5 billion more than the consensus, and its 12-month price target is more than $30 ahead of the Nasdaq consensus. Revenue: $82.1 billion EPS: $3.51 12-month price target: $164 Bernstein: Even if December results disappoint, investors will look forward to a strong iPhone 8 product cycle. Analysts at Bernstein take the view that "pent-up iPhone upgraders exist," and as a result investors would look forward to the iPhone 8 product supercycle even if December results disappoint.  Revenue: $77.4 billion  EPS: $3.23 12-month price target: $140 RBC: now is a good time to buy the stock. RBC analysts remain fundamentally positive on Apple based on: 1) iPhone 8 super cycle and 600 million + install base; 2) continued growth in high-margin Services; 3) new MacBook Pro product should revert Mac segment to growth; 4) potential upside from Trump-onomics (taxes, cash repatriation); 5) attractive valuation (~9x EV/FCF). Revenue: $76.9 billion  EPS: $3.15 12-month price target: $125 JP Morgan: guidance for the second fiscal quarter (March quarter) is likely to be lower than many expect because of weaker iPhone sales. But they also buy into the consensus view that the iPhone cycle should be better this year.

  Markets Stocks Indices Commodities Currencies Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds News SIGN IN BUSINESS INSIDER       PORTFOLIO SEARCH Markets Stocks Indices Commodities Currencies Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds News CANCEL 2 tech titans are having dramatically different impacts on the performance of the tech sector (AAPL, FB) Tina Wadhwa Feb. 1, 2017, 11:14 AM Justin Sullivan/Getty Images When it comes to the tech sector, two companies stand out in the crowd - Apple and Facebook. Unsurprisingly, these two titans have a huge impact on the sector's earnings growth. Apple is expected to be the largest detractor to the sector, while Facebook is expected to be the largest contributor, according to a blog post by FactSet Insight's John Butters on Tuesday.  The current mean earnings per share (EPS) estimate for Apple for the calendar fourth quarter is $3.22, compared to a year-ago actual EPS of $3.28. Earnings per share serves as an indicator of a company's profitability. Apple's drop is dragging down the tech sector as a whole. Butters notes that the blended earnings growth rate for the overall S&P 500 information technology sector is 7.1%. However, without Apple, the blended earnings growth rate for the sector would improve to 12.6%, according to the post. Apple's falling EPS can be boiled down to declining iPhone sales as the iPhone product segment reported an average YoY revenue decline of 14% from Q4'15 through Q3'16, according to Butters.  Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Meanwhile, Facebook is expected to be the largest contributor to Q4 '16 earnings growth for the sector. The current mean EPS estimate for Facebook for the calendar fourth quarter is $1.31, compared to a year-ago actual EPS of $0.79, according to the post. If Facebook were excluded, the blended earnings growth rate for the overall tech sector would fall to 5.3%, lower than the actual growth rate of 7.1%. So Facebook is propping the sector up. This can be attributed to an increase in mobile advertising sales for Facebook, according to Butters. From Q4'14 - Q3'16, mobile advertising sales have reported year-over-year revenue growth of 80% on average.  Apple reported earnings on Tuesday that beat Wall Street's expectations on revenue and profit and Facebook is reporting earnings on Wednesday after the close.  SHARE THIS POST News for Apple PRESS DIGEST- New York Times business news - Feb 3 (JWN, DBK) Reuters 3h Snap says Apple is a competitor (AAPL, SNAP) Business Insider 7h Here’s what iPhone sales have been each year since the first model came out (AAPL) Business Insider 9h Apple, IBM, and United Airlines are teaming up to improve your flying experience (UAL, AAPL, IBM) Business Insider 9h UPDATE 1-Facebook vulnerable to expected changes in key visa program (AMZN, MSFT, AAPL) Reuters 10h Facebook vulnerable to expected changes in key visa program (AMZN, MSFT, AAPL) Reuters 11h Apple moves closer to iPhone assembly in India Reuters 13h Apple Music nabbed a former Spotify executive (AAPL) Business Insider 13h Click here for more news Related Stocks Apple Inc. 128.25 -0.65% Facebook Inc. 130.00 -4.59% Gainers & LosersMore Dow Jones S&P 500 NASDAQ 100 Merck Rg 64.18 3.35 % Cisco Systems Rg 31.18 2.23 % Chevron 112.21 1.09 % Boeing Co Rg 162.26 -1.04 % Unitedhealth Gro Rg 160.76 -1.20 % Caterpillar Rg 93.77 -1.41 % your MARKET VIEW Your Personalized Market Center Find News GO Home / Stocks / Apple-Quote / News for Apple Apple / 2 tech titans are having dramatically different impacts on the performance of the tech sector (AAPL, FB) Follow us Need help?

Apple's (AAPL.O) shares were up 5.1 percent at $127.40 after the company's earnings and iPhone sales blew past expectations in the latest quarter. The stock was the top boost to all the three main indexes and added 40 points to the Dow's 90-point rise. "With a bellwether company such as Apple reporting an encouraging set of numbers, it has brought the focus of investors back on company fundamentals," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey.While Apple opened at its highest level since July 2015, shares of other technology heavyweights also jumped. Facebook (FB.O), which is expected to report after markets close, was up 1.1 percent. Alphabet (GOOGL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) also rose. Investors are closely tracking quarterly earnings to support valuations, especially after a post-election rally pushed Wall Street to record highs. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates unchanged in its first policy meeting after President Donald Trump took office as the central bank seeks greater clarity on his economic policies. Investors will parse the Fed's policy statement, expected at 2:00 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), for any changes following a string of strong economic data. Sentiment was also boosted by a report that showed U.S. U.S. private employers added 246,000 jobs in January, the most in seven months, pointing to sustained strength in the labor market. The report acts as a precursor to the more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report due Friday.At 9:36 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 100.74 points, or 0.51 percent, at 19,964.83, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 9.88 points, or 0.43 percent, at 2,288.75 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 46.14 points, or 0.82 percent, at 5,660.93. Trump's comments and decisions are also in investors' crosshairs, especially after he placed curbs on travel to the United States, a move that unleashed uncertainty on Wall Street and declines in the past few days. "Trump is a wild card and someone who can say something at any given time and drive the markets into short-term disarray," Bakhos said. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with technology's .SPLRCT 0.88 percent gain giving the biggest boost to the broader index, followed by financials .SPSY. Apple's influence extended to other parts of the technology industry. Apple suppliers Cirrus Logic (CRUS.O) rose 3.8 percent and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O) was up 2.6 percent.Oneok Partners (OKS.N) jumped 31 percent to $56.57 after biggest shareholder Oneok Inc (OKE.N) said it would buy the rest of the company for $9.3 billion.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,900 to 725. On the Nasdaq, 1,652 issues rose and 590 fell.The S&P 500 index showed 23 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 72 new highs and five new lows.

 Strong iPhone 7 sales 'a bridge' to Apple's next upgrade Reuters Feb. 1, 2017, 10:20 AM 577 facebook linkedin twitter email print Customers gather at a store selling Apple products during launch of new iPhone 7 sales in Moscow Thomson Reuters By Supantha Mukherjee and Rishika Sadam (Reuters) - "Things don't have to change the world to be important," Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs said in an interview in 1996. His words rang true, two decades later, as sales of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus - similar in design to their predecessor - surpassed expectations to reinstate Apple as the world's biggest smartphone seller after a five-year gap. This has only built expectations, however, that the 10th-anniversary iPhone will need to offer revolutionary new features if it is to trigger a substantial uptick in sales. "This is really the last (quarter) that anybody is going to care about iPhone until the launch this fall," Cowen & Co analysts wrote in a note. "It can be said that iPhone 7/7+ 'did its job' as a bridge to get to the supercycle in 2017." Apple's shares rose as much as 5.8 percent to $128.30 early on Wednesday, their highest in 18 months, a day after the company dethroned Samsung Electronics Co Ltd as the world's top smartphone seller based on units shipped. At the day's high, more than $36 billion was added to the company's market value. Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31, up from 74.78 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected sales of 77.42 million. The sales reflected the first full quarter of iPhone 7 sales and come at a time when global demand for smartphones is slowing and cheaper Android alternatives are flooding the market. Apple may also have benefited from Samsung's much-publicized recall of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7. Apple's strong sales set the stage for the 10th-anniversary iPhone, which analysts say is expected to feature better touchscreen display, wireless charging and a shift to a higher-resolution OLED display. The company typically launches new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back in anticipation of the next launch. Existing iPhone users tend to upgrade their devices when the new model has significant design changes. Apple last saw a significant uptick in sales with the introduction of iPhone 6 in 2015. "We see pent-up demand heading into a significant form factor change that is likely to accelerate iPhone unit growth," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note. At least twelve brokerages raised their price targets on Apple. Stifel Nicolaus & Co and RBC Capital Markets - the most bullish brokerages - raised their price targets by $15. No brokerage changed their rating on the stock. Of the 48 analysts covering Apple's stock, 39 have a "buy" rating or higher. Eight have a "hold" rating and one a "sell". Their median price target is $139. To Tuesday's close of $121.35, Apple's shares had risen nearly 25 percent in the past 12 months.

Related articles Apple Qualcomm battle likely to continue all the way to court Apple sues Qualcomm for $1 billion Today's channel rundown - 28 July 2016 Apple Watch final details set for March release - reports Cook said he maintained this view, but given the growing frustration at the company over how Qualcomm was acting, he felt that he had no choice but to take legal action. "They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with," Cook said in the call, transcribed by Seeking Alpha. "And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features, like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason, and the more expensive it would be for us to innovate." Cook went on to liken this to being charged more for a sofa depending on the house it would be going into. "Just from our point of view, this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts," the CEO claimed.  He noted too that Apple believes Qualcomm has withheld $1 billion in payments from the smartphone maker, so this was also forcing its hand. Cook said that, in light of all this, he thinks it unlikely that a settlement out of court will be reached. "I don't like litigation. And so if there's another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don't see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end I think common sense will prevail and the courts will see it for what it is." Qualcomm has already hit back at Apple's claims, with Don Rosenberg, general counsel for the firm saying last month that "it is quite clear that Apple's claims are baseless". "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," he said.

Don't Miss: The Galaxy S8, iPhone 8, and Google Pixel 2 will all share one key component Cook told The Wall Street Journal that hundreds of Apple employees have been affected by the order and that he continues to contact “very, very senior people in the White House” to tell them why repealing the executive order benefits Apple and the country. Cook also said that he receives plenty of emails from concerned Apple staff detailing “heart-wrenching stories” related to the Muslim ban. “These are people that have friends and family. They’re co-workers. They’re taxpayers. They’re key parts of the community,” Mr. Cook said, detailing a case of an employee who’s about to have a child and the future grandparents have Canadian and Iranian citizenship and won’t be able to meet the baby. “More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds. That’s what makes us special,” Cook said. “We ought to pause and really think deeply through that.” Cook did not say what legal options Apple is pursuing, but he did say that “we want to be constructive and productive.” It’s unclear who Cook is talking to in the White House, but the CEO already met Trump following his election. Furthermore, a few days ago, Cook had dinner with Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner in Washington D.C. Amazon on Monday submitted a declaration of support for a lawsuit filed against Trump’s order by the Washington state attorney general.

Record iPhone sales have driven Apple back to growth, with the US giant reporting an increase in revenue for the quarter ending 31 December 2016. Apple posted revenue of $78.4bn for the quarter compared to $75.9bn in the same period last year. The Cupertino-based company sold 78.2 million units of iPhones in the first three months of its fiscal 2017, up 5% compared to the corresponding period in 2016. iPhone sales surged 72% in the quarter on a sequential basis, after seeing a decline for three consecutive quarters. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook said: “We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch. The iPhone being the main driver of Apple’s turnabout has been attributed to the US giant taking advantage of Samsung customers who were impacted in the heavily publicised Galaxy Note recall. Richard Windsor, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said that the firm’s return to growth was “primarily driven by Apple taking a good share of users that purchased the Note 7 and were left high and dry by the recall.” “Users appear to have taken this opportunity to move from Android to iOS, a move which is pretty much a one-way street. We find this surprising as the iPhone 6 is now in its third generation meaning that a large screen iOS device has been an option for users for 2.5 years. This means that most high-end Android users have already purchased a new Android device despite a large screen iOS option being available. “This is what led us to believe that iOS would not benefit from Samsung’s Note 7 disaster but this logic appears not have been correct. Instead it appears that the negative stigma surrounding the recall has been enough to encourage users to switch away from Android despite the fact that many apps will need to be repurchased,” said the analyst. The analyst firm estimates that around 2.5 million customers were affected by the Samsung recall, of which 2 million bought an iOS device. The smartphone maker forecasts its revenue to be between $51.5bn and $53.5bn in the January-March quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said: “We returned nearly $15bn to investors through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter, bringing cumulative payments through our capital return program to over $200bn.”   Tags Apple Homepage News List iPhone Samsung Previous ArticleYour next self-driving Uber could be a Mercedes as Daimler partners with car-sharing app Next ArticleMajor GitLab backup failure wipes 300GB of data Most read Nearly 30,000 MongoDB servers held captive in ransomware attacks – and ElasticSearch is just as bad Ellie Burns 31st January 2017 Cisco, BNY Mellon and other Fortune 500 firms team up with startups on IoT blockchain Consortium Byomakesh Biswal 30th January 2017 Smart cars and penguins: more alike than you’d think Joe Clark 30th January 2017 Top 5 smartest Smart Cities in the world Joe Clark 27th January 2017 Microsoft silences Brexit exit fears with ground-breaking cloud & digital skills programme James Nunns 26th January 2017 Oracle lodges EU complaint over Google’s privacy policy change Joe Clark 25th January 2017 More bad news for BT as BT mail service goes down Joe Clark 24th January 2017 Latest White Papers How Intel IT’s Integrated Analytics Platform Helps Sales and Marketing By Intel HPE Security Research – Cyber Risk Report 2016 By HPE Le stockage de demain By Kaminario Editor’s Pick Developing the next army of intrapreneurs – supporting UK innovation Ellie Burns 1st February 2017 Consumers remain oblivious to IoT security threats, despite £12m government campaign Tom Ball 31st January 2017 EU Digital Chief: Decade old data roaming promise must serve public Joe Clark 31st January 2017 Hybrid Cloud Security and How to Do It Right Ellie Burns 30th January 2017 Women in Technology: Have gender stereotypes become even worse?

People will be able to use iPhones and Apple Watches equipped with Touch ID fingerprint authentication to make payments, the Web site said, but did not give an exact date for when the service would start. Shoppers would simply need to place a finger on the Touch ID sensor and hold their iPhone within 2.54cm of contactless readers at stores to make a purchase, it added. When using an Apple Watch, buyers would need to double-click the side button and hold the display within 2.54cm of a contactless reader, then wait for a gentle tap that signals completion of the transaction, the Web site said. Apple said seven banks are to be part of the launch of the Apple Pay service in Taiwan: Cathay United Bank (國泰世華銀行), CTBC Bank (中國信託銀行), E.Sun Commercial Bank (玉山銀行), Standard Chartered Bank, Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank (台北富邦銀行), Taishin International Bank (台新銀行) and Union Bank of Taiwan (聯邦銀行). Apple Pay was introduced to a number of markets worldwide in September 2014, allowing contactless payments via iOS apps. Taiwan is to become the 14th region in which Apple Pay is available, after the US, Britain, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, China, France, Russia, Switzerland, New Zealand, Spain, Singapore and Japan, Apple said.

This has only built expectations, however, that the 10th-anniversary iPhone will need to offer revolutionary new features if it is to trigger a substantial uptick in sales. "This is really the last (quarter) that anybody is going to care about iPhone until the launch this fall," Cowen & Co analysts wrote in a note. "It can be said that iPhone 7/7+ 'did its job' as a bridge to get to the supercycle in 2017." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, up from 74.78 million a year earlier. Photo: George Frey Apple's shares were 6.1 per cent higher at $US128.79 at the close, rising as high as $US130.49 before easing, a day after the company dethroned Samsung Electronics as the world's top smartphone seller based on units shipped. About $US35 billion was added to the company's market value, now at $US679.7 billion. Advertisement Apple sold 78.29 million iPhones in its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, up from 74.78 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected sales of 77.42 million. The sales reflected the first full quarter of iPhone 7 sales and come at a time when global demand for smartphones is slowing and cheaper Android alternatives are flooding the market. Apple may also have benefited from Samsung's much-publicised recall of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7. 'Pent-up demand' Apple's strong sales set the stage for the 10th-anniversary iPhone, which analysts say is expected to feature better touchscreen display, wireless charging and a shift to a higher-resolution OLED display. The company typically launches new iPhones in September. A big jump in sales usually follows in the holiday quarter, before demand tapers over the next few quarters as customers hold back in anticipation of the next launch. Existing iPhone users tend to upgrade their devices when the new model has significant design changes. Apple last saw a significant uptick in sales with the introduction of iPhone 6 in 2015. "We see pent-up demand heading into a significant form factor change that is likely to accelerate iPhone unit growth," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note. At least twelve brokerages raised their price targets on Apple. Stifel Nicolaus & Co and RBC Capital Markets - the most bullish brokerages - raised their price targets by $US15. No brokerage changed their rating on the stock. Of the 48 analysts covering Apple's stock, 39 have a "buy" rating or higher. Eight have a "hold" rating and one a "sell". Their median price target is $US139. To Tuesday's close of $US121.35, Apple's shares had risen nearly 25 per cent in the past 12 months.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Stocks wobble after early gain; Apple climbs on better sales By Marley Jay • Associated Press Feb 1, 2017 (…) In this Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, file photo, the American flag flies above the Wall Street entrance to the New York Stock Exchange. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) The Associated Press Updated at 10:34 a.m. NEW YORK • Stocks are little changed Wednesday after an early rally ran out of steam. Technology stocks are up after Apple said iPhone sales improved in its last quarter, which sent its stock to its highest price in more than a year. Most other stocks are trading lower and utilities are falling the most. A survey showed private U.S. employers hired new workers at a faster pace in January, a sign that the economy could be getting stronger. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average gained 15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,878 as of 11:05 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,276. The Nasdaq composite added 15 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,629. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 3 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,364. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. The market has made only small moves in recent days as investors wait for the Federal Reserve to wrap up its latest policy meeting later Wednesday. JOB GAINS: A survey by payroll services provider ADP said private U.S. employers added far more jobs than expected in January. The gain of 246,000 jobs was the most in a single month since June. The hiring was widespread, with the construction, manufacturing, health care and shipping industries all adding jobs at a solid pace. That was a positive sign for the economy. Investors sold government bonds, which are relatively safe investments that are in greater demand when the economy seems weaker. The U.S. government will release its own monthly jobs report Friday. APPLE POLISHED: Apple jumped to its highest price in a year and a half after it said consumers snapped up its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus over the last three months. That ended the first-ever slump in iPhone sales, and Apple's first-quarter results were stronger than analysts expected. Its stock rose $6.83, or 5.6 percent, to $128.18. The big gains for Apple, the world's most valuable publicly-traded company, took technology stocks higher. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices also climbed $1.22, or 11.8 percent, to $11.59. AMD reported a profit when analysts expected a loss, and its sales were greater than expected. BONDS: U.S. government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 2.50 percent from 2.44 percent. Financial stocks rose, as higher interest rates allow banks to charge more money for lending. Lincoln National climbed $1.07, or 1.6 percent, to $68.58 and JPMorgan Chase rose 92 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $85.55. THE PITS: Mailing equipment and software company Pitney Bownes slid $3.02, or 19 percent, to $12.90 after its quarterly sales fell short of expectations and its profit forecast disappointed Wall Street. ENERGY: Oil prices continued to trade in a small range. U.S. crude added 44 cents to $53.25 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, gained 59 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $56.17 a barrel in London. U.S. oil has stayed between roughly $52 and $55 a barrel for the last two months. Who's hired? Check our People in Business See how St. Louis stocks are faring How do they stack up?

It's down 3 percent over that time and has sunk 7 percent since Dec. 13. ALUMINUM ACTIVISM: Lightweight aluminum products maker Arconic surged after its largest shareholder said the company needs new leadership. Elliott Management nominated five potential directors to Arconic's board. The company said it stands by CEO Klaus Kleinfeld and that Elliott's moves are not in the best interest of all shareholders. Arconic makes lightweight engineered products for aerospace and autos, which some investors saw as more promising than Alcoa's mining and smelting business. But since the companies split on Nov. 1, Arconic stock is almost flat and Alcoa has jumped more than 60 percent. Arconic gained $2.03, or 8.9 percent, to $24.76. CURRENCIES: The dollar gained strength after the jobs survey. It rose to 113.62 yen from 112.76 yen. The euro fell to $1.0753 from $1.0803. OVERSEAS: Stocks in Europe got a boost from the ADP survey and a report that said manufacturing in China grew at its fastest pace in two years in January. Heavy government spending and more lending by banks helped keep the economy steady. Germany's DAX added 1 percent while the CAC 40 of France rose 0.9 percent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain picked up 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.6 percent after a skid on Tuesday. The Kospi in South Korea jumped 0.6 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.2 percent.

Asian markets wavered and the dollar lost some steam Thursday after the Fed kept its key lending rate on hold as expected at its latest policy meeting. (AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi) LONDON - Global stock markets were uneven Thursday as investors shied away from riskier assets amid renewed concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. KEEPING SCORE: In Europe, Germany's DAX was flat at 11,663 while the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2 per cent to 4,805. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.6 per cent higher at 7,153. U.S. stocks were heading for a soft open, with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures down 0.2 per cent. TRUMP TURBULENCE: Investors were rattled by the latest news from the Trump administration, including a phone call in which he warned Mexico's president he might send in troops and another about a tense exchange with Australia's leader over refugees. Following the Trump rally in the wake of his election victory last November, stock gains appear to be petering out with investors getting jittery in light of Trump's dramatic policy announcements since taking office. MARKET VIEW: "Trump's presidency comes with greater than normal risks," Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, said in a report. Eventually, he said "pragmatic pro-growth policies are likely to ultimately dominate populist policies." However, Oliver added that "the Trump honeymoon with investors is likely over with a short term period of correction/volatility likely to continue in shares, bond yields and the U.S. dollar." CENTRAL BANKING: On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold after its latest policy meeting — as investors had expected. Policymakers signalled that they still expect to gradually raise rates but gave no clear timeline. Meanwhile, the Bank of England kept its main interest rate on hold at a record low of 0.25 per cent on Thursday but revised up its growth forecasts for the British economy, which has held up better than many forecasters predicted in the aftermath of last June's vote to leave the European Union. DEUTSCHE DOWN AGAIN: Germany's biggest lender, Deutsche Bank, saw its share price fall by around 5 per cent after the company posted another hefty loss in 2016. The bank reported a loss of 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) for all of 2016. Much of that loss was due to a fourth-quarter deficit of 1.89 billion euros largely related to the sale of its Abbey Life unit and costs associated with legal fines and penalties. ASIA'S DAY: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 1.2 per cent to 18,914.58 as the stronger yen weighed on exporters, while South Korea's Kospi dipped 0.5 per cent to 2,071.01. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.6 per cent to 23,184.52 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1 per cent lower to 5,645.40. Markets in mainland China were closed for the final day of a weeklong holiday. CURRENCIES: The euro rose 0.3 per cent to $1.0810 while the dollar fell 0.6 per cent to 112.36 yen. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 15 cents to $54.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, advanced 38 cents to $57.18 a barrel in London. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Apple Tops Samsung in the Fourth Quarter to Close Out a Roller Coaster Year for the Smartphone Market, According to IDC 1 February 2017Military News FRAMINGHAM, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The holiday quarter of 2016 capped off another positive year of smartphone growth despite concerns about the overall market slowing. According to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, smartphone vendors shipped a total of 428.5 million units during the fourth quarter of 2016 (4Q16), resulting in 6.9% growth when compared to the 400.7 million units shipped in the final quarter of 2015. For the full year, the worldwide smartphone market saw a total of 1.47 billion units shipped, marking the highest year of shipments on record, yet up only 2.3% from the 1.44 billion units shipped in 2015. Large markets like China, the United States, and Brazil all ended the year on a strong note helping to keep worldwide volumes in positive territory. „There’s no question that 2016 marked a memorable year for the smartphone industry in many ways,” said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers. „This was a year that brought us the first down year for iPhone, yet Apple closed out the holiday quarter by surpassing Samsung for the top spot in the smartphone industry. We also witnessed year-over-year declines in some emerging regions like the Middle East and Latin America where high growth was expected. To round it all off, we now have a three horse race at the top of the market as Huawei cracked the double-digit share mark for the first time ever.” Despite the changes that 2016 brought upon the market, including annual growth dropping from 10.4% in 2015 to just 2.3% in 2016, IDC expects a few turnarounds in 2017. First, IDC is forecasting a rebound in iPhone shipments with the yet to be announced tenth anniversary iPhone. Second, the Middle East and Africa (MEA) and Latin America regions are expected to return to growth in 2017. And, as a result of the aforementioned as well as several other driving factors, growth in 2017 should improve slightly from 2016’s results. „As the two leading players continue to battle for the top spot, several Chinese vendors have solidified their position as valid contenders,” said Anthony Scarsella, research manager with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. „The top three Chinese vendors (Huawei, OPPO, and vivo) are persistently applying pressure on Samsung within China thanks to a vast portfolio of affordable, well-built devices. Not only is this pressure coming at the low-end, but high-end devices like the P9, Mate 8, R9s, and XPlay6 haven proven viable options for consumers looking to upgrade or save money without sacrificing quality. However, it is worth noting that despite the success of these brands within China, they will need to find growth beyond their home turf to eventually knock off either Samsung or Apple at the top.” Smartphone Vendor Highlights: Apple reclaimed the top spot thanks largely to the success of the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Despite a strong fourth quarter, 2016 marked the first full year of declining shipments for the iPhone with a 7% year-over-year drop. Apple shipped a record 78.3 million units in the fourth quarter, up 4.7% from the same quarter one year ago. Although the iPhone 7 did not feature a drastically different industrial design from its predecessor, it did bring yet another significantly improved processor, more robust camera, water resistance, and new color/finish options. Much like Samsung, all eyes will be on Apple’s next flagship, and all signs point to something very special for the tenth anniversary of this iconic product. Samsung dropped to second in the worldwide smartphone market with shipments declining 5.2% compared to last year. The Korean giant shipped 77.5 million units in 4Q16, down from the 81.7 million units shipped last holiday quarter. On the year, Samsung shipped 311.4 million smartphones worldwide, which was down 3% from the 320.9 million shipments in 2015. Despite the Note 7 debacle and growing pressure from Chinese vendors, Samsung still managed to find success with its S7 and popular J-series of devices in numerous markets. The challenging holiday quarter, however, did bring its worldwide market share below 20% for the first time in over four years, leaving no better time for the pending arrival of its next flagship product, the Galaxy S8. Huawei retained the number three position while gaining worldwide market share in 4Q16. The quarter marked the first time the Chinese giant captured double-digit share with 10.6% of the total shipment volume. Huawei shipped 45.4 million units in the quarter, up 38.6% from the 32.7 million shipped in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year, Huawei shipped 139.3 million units, up 30.2% from the 107 million units shipped in 2015. The P series and Honor sub-brand drove essential volume in China as well as other countries in Asia and beyond. With proven success in China and many European countries, Huawei now has its sights set on the U.S. Whether or not the U.S. market becomes a serious playing field for Huawei is yet to be determined, but the recent release of the Mate 9 in the U.S. has surely caught the attention of both Apple and Samsung at the high end, while Honor brand devices will continue to drive the mid-tier. OPPO continued its push to reach the top of the market with its fourth straight quarter of greater than 100% year-over-year growth. OPPO shipped 31.2 million smartphones in the holiday quarter, which was up 117% from the 14.4 million smartphones shipped in 4Q15. The focus for OPPO over the past year has been international expansion outside of China and so far it has been successful at this. Beyond China, Southeast Asia and India have been the focal points for OPPO’s growth in 2016 supported by intense marketing campaigns and new product launches. The company also began ramping up its presence in the Middle East and if momentum can pick up, a strong 2017 could be ahead. vivo remained the number five vendor with 24.7 million smartphones shipped in the holiday quarter, which was up from the 12.1 million shipped last holiday season. Over the year, vivo shipped a total of 77.3 million smartphones, up 103% from the 38 million last year. The majority of the shipments continue to be in China, however, and much like OPPO, vivo has been extremely aggressive with its marketing in a number of countries in Asia as it looks to extend its global reach.   Top Five Smartphone Vendors, Worldwide Shipments, Market Share, and Year-Over-Year Growth, Q4 2016 Preliminary Data (Units in Millions) Vendor     4Q16 Shipment Volume     4Q16 Market Share     4Q15 Shipment Volume     4Q15 Market Share     Year-Over- Year Change 1.

Our nation’s political debate has become so polarized, it was only a matter of time before your stocks got dragged into the mess. It didn’t take long for CEOs at over a dozen U.S. companies to weigh in against President Donald Trump’s travel restrictions. Let’s not get into the merits of Trump’s policy, aside from the horrendously sloppy execution that was troubling from a guy who ran on his supposed management prowess. Whatever the merits, or lack thereof, the potential downside for you as an investor in the storm that ensued was apparent pretty fast. Trump supporters, for example, immediately promised to unleash a boycott against Starbucks (SBUX) even though the coffee chain’s pushback against the president was fairly innocuous. Essentially, Starbucks said: “We’ll hire more refugees.” Other consumer-facing companies that openly took on Trump, like Ford (F) Amazon.com (AMZN) Twitter (TWTR) Apple (AAPL) Netflix (NFLX) and Microsoft (MSFT) could face similar challenges. Since Trump is unlikely to stop being controversial, and CEOs with big egos are unlikely to stop pushing back when they see fit, now is a good time to ask the following: Is it OK for companies to be messing with your portfolio like this? After all, you’re supposedly the boss as a shareholder, and boards and CEOs are supposedly working for you. The short answer is “yes,” according to several corporate-governance and business experts. Let’s look at their logic first. Then we’ll get into some of the risks to your stocks that experts may be overlooking, just as they may have overlooked Trump’s prospects for victory during the election. Enlightened self-interest One of the most telling Trump pushbacks came from Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein, according to Columbia Law School professor and corporate-governance expert John Coffee. Blankfein left a voicemail to employees saying the policy is bad for the company, and rightly so. “A lot of the companies that have been outspoken get a very large percentage of their revenue internationally. And this looks like an attack on internationalism, which could hurt them,” says Coffee. To his point, a big part of Starbucks’ response was to note that it has opened nearly 600 stores in Mexico since 2002, and that it has bought coffee beans there for three decades. The bottom line: Starbucks wants to build bridges on the border, not walls, said CEO and founder Howard Schultz, in a statement. CEOs have an enlightened self-interest at home, too. “Companies have to be careful with what they do, but they are also members of society and they are affected by the broader society in which they operate,” says Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability, which promotes greater transparency in corporate political campaign donations. That includes “the type of market they have and even basic things like the spending power of consumers,” he says. As examples, he cites corporate support for racial integration in the U.S., and opposition to apartheid in South Africa, even if this may have alienated some customers at the time. “There are issues where companies do have a broader responsibility as a member of society. So they have to take a stand, even at a cost to shareholders,” says Freed. Standing by core values It’s also important to remember that just like people, companies can have “core values” they have to stand by, points out Columbia Business School professor William Klepper. CEOs have an obligation to “speak up if an executive order is contrary to their stated values,” he says. One reason is that these “core values” can be part of why customers buy from them. Starbucks’ stated mission is to “inspire and nurture the human spirit — one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.” So it makes sense that the company would want to support refugees by hiring them, one at a time. Apple has always been outspoken and iconoclastic, and that’s part of what draws consumers to its product. “That is their style. They aren’t to going to hide what their position is,” says Coffee. Next, a lot of large companies are “culturally progressive” because it appeals to their diverse work force, says Eric Dezenhall, CEO of Dezenhall Resources in Washington, D.C., a crisis-management consultancy. “I am not at all surprised that corporate leaders have pushed back on the travel issue because the benefits of appeasing their work force, including not getting sued, outweigh their fears of ticking off POTUS over a policy that has been wildly unpopular in the dominant media culture,” says Dezenhall. As a practical matter, tech companies hire a lot of foreign nationals, so they’re going to naturally resist travel restrictions because that’s in their interest. Boycotts don’t work Then there’s the little matter of the ineffectiveness of boycotts. “It is easy to make pronouncements that you are not going to drink Starbucks coffee and organize a boycott. But it never seems to work,” says Howard Anderson, who has taught at Harvard Business School and MIT’s Tuck School of Business. “I don’t think it makes too much difference. Every airline I have flown on I have sworn I would never fly on again, and guess what. I am still flying.” Motley Fool Inside Value editor Rich Greifner, who follows Starbucks closely as an investor, agrees that boycotts won’t have “a meaningful impact on Starbucks’ long-term ability to generate free cash flow” or its intrinsic value. But is it different this time? All of these points make a lot of sense, of course. But it’s hard not to notice we have moved into a new era politically. And so companies, and you as a shareholder, may face greater risks with their political activism. Just as almost everyone discounted Trump’s potential during the elections, analysts may now overly discount the power of Trump supporters to do real damage to companies via boycotts. There are, after all, a lot of Trump supporters out there, and they are passionate. Besides, boycotts can work. According to consumer surveys, the Chick-fil-A brand took a hit after activists openly challenged the opposition to same-sex marriage espoused by the restaurant’s president, Dan Cathy, points out Ira Kalb, assistant professor of clinical marketing at USC Marshall School of Business. The lesson? In general, companies should avoid getting “embroiled in political issues” if their customers are likely to be split on the topic, he says. Tweetstorms Then, of course, there’s the risk of retaliation from Trump himself. He’s got a track record of being vindictive against perceived antagonists, like the CNN reporter who was openly denied the opportunity to ask a question at a press conference. And Trump’s twitter account can move stocks. He’s shaved tens of billions of dollars off the biotech sector with a single tweet on drug pricing. Other tweets have sparked temporary setbacks in the shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) There’s also the possibility that Trump could roll out government spending or policy decisions fine-tuned to target companies — as he’s threatened to do with Ford over plant locations, and Lockheed and Boeing over the amounts these companies charge the government for aircraft. “Never in my career have I seen a president strike such terror into the hearts of senior corporate leadership,” says Dezenhall, at Dezenhall Resources. “Corporate chiefs now believe they are facing an absolute ruler versus a broad-based government. And they are trying to figure out where on the spectrum of avoidance to confrontation they need to be. As a general rule, avoidance is the better of your bad options.” In short, laying low may mean the presidential tweetstorm moves on to another target. “So why go to war?” Besides, as much as CEOs make, openly taking on the president may be above their pay grade. “It’s not the job of a CEO to be gratuitously tough; it’s the job of a CEO to create and maintain value for shareholders,” says Dezenhall. “Getting into an unnecessary war with POTUS could become a fire-able offense if the share price tanks.” Reform begins at home If this seems overly obsequious, then here’s a modest proposal for you and all the politically activist CEOs who risk tanking their stocks by taking on Trump. Why not start close to home, with your social activism? Many economists lament the widening of the wealth gap under President Obama. They cite it as a continuing source of social unrest, which often turns violent. Lavish CEO pay packages have definitely contributed to the wealth-gap problem, including those at companies now taking on Trump — like Starbucks, Ford, Facebook (FB) Amazon.com and Apple. If the CEOs at these companies really want to make the world a better place, why not take a two-thirds pay cut, sell two-thirds of your company stock, and redistribute all the money to the bottom 20% of your workforce in the form of a pay hike? After all, this would have a measurable impact on the growing wealth gap. And it could even change the world by example. Who knows, it might even help shareholders by putting CEOs more in touch with customers, and reality. “I think this explosion of CEO pay has been very damaging for companies because it puts CEOs in a rarified category,” says Freed, at the Center for Political Accountability. “Many of them are out of touch.” Starbucks, Ford, Facebook, Amazon.com and Apple all declined to comment on whether their CEOs might consider adopting my modest proposal. So in fairness to these companies, I’ll point out that a lot of their CEO pay comes in the form of stock and options grants. So shareholders benefit along with them. And in the cases of Starbucks, Amazon.com and Facebook, the CEOs are founders who deserve a lot of credit for creating solid companies — and lots of jobs.

In August of last year the European Commission announced that the Irish government had provided “undue tax benefits” to the multinational that amounted to €13 billion. The investigation started in June of 2014, but had started on a preliminary basis the year before when European officials first made requests for information from Apple. The first payments by the government in connection with the case were made in 2013, and amounted to €4,113. In 2014 payments came to €182,060; in 2015 the figure was €658,889; and last year the total amount paid was just over €1 million euro. Government response The figures were provided by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan in response to a parliamentary question from Sinn Féin Deputy Pearse Doherty. In his response, Noonan stated that the government “disagrees profoundly with the Commission’s analysis” and that the decision will be challenged before the European Courts. “This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign Member State competence of taxation.” Previously there had been objections from the government to the ruling on the grounds that it meant Ireland would have to act as a tax collector for the rest of the EU. Under investigation Appearing before the Oireachtas Finance Committee yesterday, the European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager – who was responsible for the investigation into Apple – stated that she believed the bulk of the unpaid tax bill was owed in Ireland. The money paid out by the government has included all legal costs, consultancy fees and other costs associated with the investigation, with the money coming from the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Attorney General’s Office and the Chief State Solicitor’s Office. In the findings of the investigation, Vestager said that the company had an “effective corporate tax rate of 1% on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005% in 2014”. The investigation by the EU, published in December, ordered the Irish government to recover the unpaid tax for that period. This includes interest on the original €13 billion amount, which Vestager yesterday told the Finance Committee could come fall somewhere between €1.5 billion and €6 billion. The EU investigation into Apple’s tax arrangements was sparked by a 2013 U.S. Senate committee hearing that criticised the tech giant for not appearing to be tax resident anywhere in the world.   16:17 1 Feb 2017 Michael Shiels McNamee 1 day ago most popular latest sport Consumer agency warning after Irish man loses €9,000 How to delete Facebook Ireland enjoy unprecedented success at the Sydney 7s Tiger Woods withdraws from the Dubai Desert Classic site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

Kalanick's resignation comes after days of criticism about the executive's decision to work with the president. The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. (Reporting By Heather Somerville, writing Peter Henderson; Editing by David Gregorio) Wochit Business How does Snapchat make money? Feb.02 -- Snapchat parent company Snap just unveiled its IPO prospectus, setting the stage for one of the largest tech debut in years. Much of how Snap operates has been shrouded in secrecy since co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy first launched the Snapchat app in 2011. What is clear is that the app is most popular with young people, which means the investor community isn’t necessarily using the app -- and has often been confused about what it does and how it makes money. Bloomberg IPO reporter Alex Barinka and Bloomberg Technology reporter Sarah Frier give a tutorial on the app and show how Snap has pivoted into other offerings, like its Spectacles glasses.

The S&P 500 added 0.03 percent, with tech outperforming. The Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent as Apple spiked 6 percent. Quotes in the article Johnson Controls Inc JCI ▼ 42.30 -0.20 -0.47% IAC/InterActiveCorp IAC ▲ 72.84 +4.60 +6.74% Facebook Inc FB ▼ 130.84 -2.39 -1.79% Anthem Inc ANTM ▼ 157.66 -3.13 -1.95% AdChoices The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-making arm, kept its benchmark overnight lending rate target at 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent. Ahead of the announcement, market expectations for a rate hike were just 4 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. "That was the expectation and they delivered," said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark. "One thing we're sure is that the Fed is going to telegraph its next move." "With all the talk about growth, ... the Fed will have even more pressure to do so," he said. There was little in the post-meeting communique to indicate when the Fed might resume the rate normalization process. However, officials did take note of a change in mood. "Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late," the committee said in its statement. The language was new and, in the arcane process of discerning where the thinking resides among central bankers, significant. "The market's fear was that the Fed could've been more hawkish; that didn't happen," said Matt Toms, chief investment officer of fixed income and Voya Investment Management. "The one thing that could be viewed as more hawkish — and that's grasping because it was a pretty tame statement — is that the Fed's 2 percent inflation target could be reached in the medium term." The Fed raised rates for just the second time in a decade at its December meeting. The central bank also signaled the possibility of three rate hikes this year. "Donald Trump's executive orders have shaken the Fed and they do not want to increase rates as aggressively as previously thought. The unanimous decision by the Fed has made it clear that March meeting may not have much life," said Naeem Aslam at Think Markets. Investors have shifted some of their focus away from the Fed and into the White House, following a sharp rally after President Donald Trump's election on Nov. 8. "We're in a transition period — which I like to call 'The Great Hand-off' — from monetary policy to fiscal policy," said Adam Sarhan, CEO at 50 Park Investments. The stock market's rally was propelled by the prospects of fiscal stimulus, deregulation and corporate tax cuts. Equities ended January on a sour note, as the major indexes closed lower the last two days of the month. That said, they managed to close off their session lows on Monday and Tuesday. "That's typical of a market seeking direction but not looking at a steep pullback," said Peter Cardillo, a chief market economist at First Standard Financial. In economic news, the latest report from ADP and Moody's showed private companies added 246,000 jobs in January, well above the expected 165,000. January also turned in the best single-month performance since June. Other data released Wednesday included the IHS Markit Manufacturing index's final read for January, which showed the strongest manufacturing production growth for almost two years. The ISM Manufacturing index for January came in at 56, above an expected read of 55. December construction spending fell 0.2 percent, while economist had forecast a gain 0.4 percent. U.S. Treasurys fell broadly but traded off session lows, with the benchmark 10-year note yield holding around 2.46 percent and the two-year note yield near 1.21 percent. The dollar rose about 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies — giving back some of its earlier gains — with the euro near $1.078 and they yen around 112.92. On the earnings front, Dow component Apple reported better-than-expected quarterly results Tuesday after the close, as the firm said it sold more expensive iPhones. However, its future guidance came in at the lower end of expectations. The stock rose more than 5.5 percent in midday trade. "Apple pulling a [strong] quarter is bullish because it shows the consumer, which is a large part of the economy, is in good shape," said 50 Park Investments' Sarhan. Companies reporting before the bell Wednesday included ADP, Johnson Controls and Altria, with all three topping bottom-line expectations, but reporting lighter-than-expected sales. Facebook and MetLife are both scheduled to report Wednesday after the close. About four stocks declined for every three advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 431 million and a composite volume of 2.056 billion in afternoon trade. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 11.90. U.S. crude futures for March delivery rose 28 cents to $53.09 per barrel. Gold futures for April delivery fell $5.50 to $1,205.90 per ounce. CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

Apple surged 5.0 percent after reporting record revenues of $78.4 billion in the first quarter due to its highest-ever volume of iPhone sales at 78.3 million. The strong Apple results lifted sentiment after worries about President Donald Trump's controversial executive order on immigration weighed on the market for two days. About 10 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 19,962.34, up 0.5 percent. The broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to 2,288.23, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 0.8 percent to 5,659.32. Analysts were looking ahead to the central bank's statement following a two-day meeting of the policy committee. Although the Fed is not expected to hike interest rates, it could signal more precisely the timeframe for future increases. Private payrolls firm ADP reported that US private-sector hiring rose 246,000 in January, far more than analysts expected. The US Labor Department is due to release its more closely-scrutinized employment report on Friday. Arconic, formerly part of Alcoa before the company was split off from the aluminum giant, rose 3.0 percent after activist fund Elliott Management called for the ousting of chief executive Klaus Kleinfeld and nominated five directors.

By Eileen Yu for By The Way | February 1, 2017 -- 16:18 GMT (08:18 PST) | Topic: Processors Samsung Electronics and Apple contributed 18.2 percent to the global semiconductor in 2016, spending US$61.7 billion. The smartphone makers had spent US$61.3 billion the previous year and occupied the top two positions for six consecutive years, according to figures from Gartner. Positions were swopped, though, with Samsung assuming the pole position while Apple fell to second. Latest news on Asia ​Samsung in S8 battery talks with Japan's Murata: Report ​Three bills and a Trump executive order train their gun sights on the H1B visa Panasonic admits avionics business is under investigation in US Grab rides up Indonesia with $700M investment ​Samsung Pay Mini to launch for Android Spending US$31.67 billion last year, Samsung grew its semiconductor design total available market (TAM) with a 9.3 percent share. The iPhone maker spent 2.9 percent less at US$29.99 billion, on decreased design TAM for the first time since Gartner began tracking the market in 2007. Its market share dropped to 8.8 percent, the research firm said, noting that Apple's iPad tablet did not sell well last year and it also lost share in the PC market. Gartner's principal research analyst, Masatsume Yamaji, noted: "While both [Samsung and Apple] continue to exert considerable influence on technology and price trends for the wider semiconductor industry, their impact has lessened due to falling expectations for future growth." Most of the top 10 companies in 2015 remained on last year's top 10 list, with the exception of Cisco Systems, which dropped out and was replaced by Chinese smartphone OEM, BBK Electronics. Among the top 10 global chip buyers in 2016 were Dell, Lenovo, Huawei, and LG Electronics. Yamaji said: "Even though the influence on the semiconductor industry of the top two strongest OEMs is weakening, the combined design TAM of the top 10 companies outperformed the average growth rate of the total semiconductor market in 2016. "However, semiconductor chip vendors can no longer secure their businesses by relying on a few strong customers because market share changes much faster these days," he said. "BBK Electronics grew very fast in 2016 and increased its design TAM, but this extraordinarily fast growth also underlines how volatile the businesses in China can be." The Gartner analyst underscored the need for market players to diversify their clientele to remain competitive.

Guess Apple is better at getting people to...wait for it...listen when it announces new products. Eh? Listen? The IconX went on sale last August with a retail price of $199, but reviews were decidedly mixed. And that brings us back to a question I raised recently: When there's a deal to be had on a flawed product, is it easier to overlook those flaws? Because, for a limited time, TechRabbit has the Samsung Gear IconX cord-free fitness earbuds for $79.99 shipped when you apply promo code CNETSG70 at checkout. Yep, it's another Cheapskate exclusive, my friends! These are new, not refurbished, and sell elsewhere (like at Amazon) for at least $145. Apple's AirPods, incidentally, run $159. Let me note straight away that although the IconX can pair with an iPhone, only Android users can leverage the heart-rate monitor and fitness-tracking features. Yep: These earbuds are like a Fitbit for your ears. 'X'-man Because of the aforementioned reviews, and because CNET hadn't contributed an opinion, I asked TechRabbit to loan me an IconX to test. Which I did, primarily with a Galaxy S6. Sure enough, this is a flawed product. It's also a great one, at least in some respects, and well worth considering at this price. First, the flaws: Initially, they sounded weak and tinny, largely because the medium-size eartips didn't make a good seal in my ear canals. The range is poor. I walked two rooms away from the phone and experienced serious dropouts. The earbuds' touch controls are very sensitive and easy to graze by accident. Battery life is a paltry 1.5 hours, though that's if you're streaming from your phone and using the fitness features. Leave the phone and fitness out of the equation and you can get closer to 4.5 hours. As with many Bluetooth audio devices, there's a slight sync delay with video sources. So these aren't great if you're planning to, say, watch Netflix on the treadmill. (Actually, I don't have this issue with my Shadow Wireless earbuds.) Some kind of wired connection (to either your phone or your PC) is required if you want to copy music to the earbuds. Now, the good stuff: Once I swapped the medium eartips for the large one, I got a perfect seal, and the audio quality went from "meh" to "excellent." Like Apple's AirPods, the IconX comes with a travel case that's also a charger. Similarly, the earbuds automatically turn on and connect when inserted into your ears, and pause playback when removed. With 4GB of onboard storage, the IconX can hold up to 1,000 songs. That means you can enjoy music even without your phone. If you do bring your phone, built-in microphones allow you to take calls. Cooler still, you can activate them to allow ambient sound to pass through. I tried watching TV while listening to music; there was no delay at all between the onscreen images and what I was hearing. Heart-rate monitoring! And activity-tracking! I didn't have time to test either feature at length, but I did verify that they work. Whether or not you're better off with a fitness band of some kind -- something you can wear full-time -- is open for discussion. They're splash- and sweat-resistant. (Don't wear them in the shower.) These don't look nearly as goofy as the AirPods. Just saying. So there you have it: My sort-of review of the IconX. Would I pay $199 or even $149 for it? Definitely not. But $80? If you're in the market for completely cord-free earphones, this is worth a look. Do your homework, though, and read other reviews. Bonus deal: Calling all parents! And teachers! Keep those kids reading. The more they read now, they more they're likely to read into adulthood. And adult readers (of fiction) are smarter, more creative, empathetic and less stressed, among other benefits. The Hero-Up Middle Grade Bundle is a collection of five DRM-free ebooks for $5 (or more, if you're feeling generous) or 11 books for $15. Needless to say, all the books are intended for middle-grade readers, and all would cost considerably more if purchased separately. This bundle supports not only indie authors, but also, optionally, a worthy charity. (Choose one at checkout.) Highly recommended!

Most Popular {{item.title | formatTitle}} Investing Feb 1 TSX, Wall Street finish flat as U.S. Fed keeps key interest rate unchanged Linda Nguyen, The Canadian Press VIDEO SIGN OUT An expected decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to stand pat on its key interest rate did little to move North American stock markets during a relatively quiet trading session Wednesday. In Toronto, the S&P/TSX composite index was ahead 16.43 points at 15,402.39, with the biggest gains coming from the metals and materials sectors. The loonie was at 76.65 cents US, down 0.20 of a U.S. cent. On the corporate front, shares in Canada's largest uranium company plunged more than 11 per cent after announcing it was at risk of losing a multi-year contract with Tokyo Electric Power, worth more than $1.3 billion. The Japanese power company is seeking to kill the deal with Cameco Corp. (TSX:CCO) stating that regulations arising from the 2011 Fukushima disaster have prevented the operation of its nuclear plants. Shares in Saskatoon-based Cameco fell more $1.87 to $14.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. On Wall Street, investors seemed unfazed after the Fed announced it was keeping its key interest rate unchanged between a 0.5 to 0.75 per cent range -- a move that was widely expected. The central bank also conveyed a slightly more optimistic tone about the U.S. economy. It noted the job market was getting stronger and inflation was gradually rising, but added that it wanted more time to monitor the economy before it hiked rates again. Last month, the Fed modestly raised its benchmark short-term rate for the first time since December 2015 when it raised it after keeping the rate at a record low near zero for seven years. It also forecasted there will likely be at least three more rate hikes this year. The Fed had driven down its key rate to help rescue the banking system and energize the economy after the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession. Laura Lau, a senior portfolio manager at Brompton Group, says the markets are unsure if that schedule will stay in place due to the uncertainty surrounding how U.S. President Donald Trump's incoming policies on trade, tax reform and health care will impact the economy. "The Fed is still in a wait-and-see mode to see what happens with Trump," she said. "But all (economic) signs do say that they should be looking at another hike." Lau says the markets anticipate a rate hike can come as early as May, with most predicting a June increase if all the data points from now until then show that employment and consumer sentiment is continuing to thrive. The central bank will have to time its next hike properly or run into risks, she added. "If they take too long, the economy can get overheated and there could be more inflation." A survey released by payroll services provider ADP on Tuesday showed that private employers added far more jobs than expected in January. The gain of 246,000 jobs was the most in a single month since June and widespread in various sectors including construction, manufacturing and health care. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 26.85 points at 19,890.94 and the S&P 500 was flat with an uptick of 0.68 of a point at 2,279.55. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite gained 27.86 points at 5,642.65. In commodities, the March crude contract advanced $1.07 at US$53.88 per barrel and March natural gas was up five cents at US$3.17 per mmBTU. The April gold contract was down $3.10 at US$1,208.30 an ounce and March copper dropped two cents at US$2.71 a pound.

Cook, in first quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings release conference call, said despite the demonetisation exercise, US-based iPhone maker performed well in the Indian market. "Despite the demonetisation move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results, and so we were very happy about that," Cook said in the call yesterday when asked about the company's performance in India during its fiscal 2017 first quarter ended December 31, 2016. NOTE BAN GOOD FOR LONG TERM Cook, 56, said the impact of demonetisation has not worked its way through yet and it is "still definitely having some overhang." "But I think in the longer term, its a great move, and I feel really good about how we're doing there. We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe its a great place to be," Cook said. Describing India as a "great" market, Cook said Apple will make significant investments in the country going forward. The Indian government had last year in November withdrawn from circulation the highest denomination currency notes of 1000 and 500 in an effort to curb black money. Apple's Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the company established new all-time revenue records in most developed and emerging markets, with strong growth rates in many countries, including the US, Japan, Canada, France, Australia, Brazil, India, Turkey, and Russia. IPAD AND MACS SOLD WELL He said the iPad and its laptop range Macs did very well in the Indian market. Cook said Apple sold 5.4 million Macs and generated its highest-ever quarterly Mac revenue. "We were very happy to report double-digit unit growth in several countries, including Japan, Mainland China, India, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as in the US education market," he said. Apple sold 13.1 million iPads, ahead of its expectations, posting double-digit growth in China and India, "as we've expanded distribution channels in those countries and we continue to attract a very high percentage of first-time tablet buyers," Maestri added. Apple posted a quarterly revenue of USD 78.4 billion compared to revenue of USD 75.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 64 per cent of the quarters revenue.

Photo: Gage Skidmore/Flickr CC Tim Cook makes it clear that Apple is staunchly opposed to President Donald Trump’s temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries, according to a new interview. “More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds,” Cook told The Wall Street Journal. “That’s what makes us special. We ought to pause and really think deeply through that.” Apple will push the White House to reverse Trump’s controversial executive order — which temporarily bars people from seven terror-plagued countries from entering the United States, and halts all immigration for 120 days — alongside high-profile Silicon Valley executives such as Alphabet’s Sergey Brin. However, according to the Journal, “Mr. Cook declined to elaborate on Apple’s possible legal options.” Cook noted that he has received “heart-wrenching” messages from Apple employees about Trump’s executive order, which could potentially affect hundreds of Apple employees. “These are people that have friends and family,” Cook said. “They’re co-workers. They’re taxpayers. They’re key parts of the community.” It’s not clear from the report what potential action Apple plans to take (if any) against the executive order, although Cook previously noted that Apple employees affected by it would be able to draw on Apple’s expert HR, legal and security teams. Cook, like many in Silicon Valley, has so far enjoyed something of a mixed relationship with Trump. Cook was a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter during her campaign, and was even considered as a possible running mate for her. Trump, meanwhile, attacked Apple for not manufacturing iPhones in the United States, and called for a boycott of the company related to Apple’s refusal to create an iOS security backdoor to aid the FBI. Trump’s executive order hits Cook on two levels. As someone who has been outspoken about social issues and potential discrimination while running Apple, sentiments like this were never likely to find favor with Cook on a personal level. As numerous news outlets have pointed out, Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant. However, there is also a business component. The White House is reportedly working on a new executive order that would compel companies to prioritize American workers over international ones. Given that Apple (as with many tech companies) recruits from around the world, this could wind up being a contentious issue. “Our country’s immigration policies should be designed and implemented to serve, first and foremost, the U.S. national interest,” the draft proposal reads, according to Bloomberg. “Visa programs for foreign workers … should be administered in a manner that protects the civil rights of American workers and current lawful residents, and that prioritizes the protection of American workers — our forgotten working people — and the jobs they hold.” Source: The Wall Street Journal Leave a comment Deals of the Day See all deals Trent Wilbanks Tim Cook need to keep is damn mouth shut before he ruins Apple. Your are a BUSINESS, not a PAC. Seems he’s more concerned with money that the safety and security of this nation. May be time I left Apple. evans.duane@mail.ru I’ve made 104 thousand dollars in last 12 months by freelancing online a­­n­­d I did that by w­orking part-time for 3 or sometimes more hours /daily. I’m using an earning model I stumbled upon from this website i found online and I am amazed that I was able to earn so much extra income. It’s beginner friendly a­n­d I’m so happy that I found out about it. Check out what I did… STATICTAB.COM/h8vxywm DrMuggg But the ban doesnt mean any security difference. It’s just…stupid. The majority of 9/11 hijackers was from Saudi Arabia (not banned) – maybe because Trump has a lot of hotels there…. Tomáš Kubín Brainwashed DrMuggg, do you know who choose those 7 countries? It was not Trump and his administrative, but Obama and his lefties – in 2015 and 2016. Do you think, they did it because of Trump’s business? Trent Wilbanks Dude. Where the 9/11 hijackers came from OVER 15 YEARS AGO has no bearing on today’s threats. EVERYTHING has changed and terrorists are coming from MANY MORE places. Besides, you do not have access to the CURRENT intelligence that determined the guidelines of this TEMPORARY ban, so you are in no position to evaluate its merits. DrMuggg Intelligence had nothing to do with Trump. Trent Wilbanks LOL! And you know this how? jakeleone Please read Isaacson’s book on Steve Jobs, before spreading ignorant and bigoted lies. Steve Jobs was born in America, and raised by an ordinary American family. Steve Jobs was an American (U.S. Citizen) juvenile delinquent who was given chance after chance to succeed. Yet he did (hehe), thank you America. Sergey Brin came to the U.S. at age 6 and is ethnically an ordinary American. The other Google founder was born in the Mid-West. Google 100% founded by people who were raised in American culture, by U.S. Citizens, by ordinary Americans. How difficult is that to understand? We need to get real about things, if you are an American Citizen you don’t inherit special genes from your foreign ancestors, because ulitmately we all have foreign ancestors, at best it is meaningless, but really it is ignorant racism to say it has any meaning. If you came in before you are teenager, you are basically culturally an ordinary American. You inherit all the good and bad traits of ordinary Americans and there is nothing special about you in regard to immigration. To say there is something special in that, in regards to your ability to function because of you genetics, is IGNORANT RACISM. Making reference to the founding of many of the popular/successful tech companies as having been founded by immigrants (who are fully and culturally Americans) IS JUST PLAIN OLD IGNORANT RACISM. It is basically a Racist, Bigotted, and Xenophobic argument, because you are so Xenophobically afraid of American culture and Americans, that you are in denial (and you cannot conceive) that anything good can come from ordinary American Citizens, and ordinary American culture, such as those who founded Google, Apple, and Microsoft, all founded by Americans. Saying that most of America’s big tech companies were founded by immigrants, because they were immigrants and nothing else, is basically (at best) a lie. But it is more likely just another ignorant and racist rant, that scapegoats ordinary Americans as incapable of doing any economic good in their own country. jimanders Apple needs to be very careful here. Stay out of politics. The temporary ban is just that. A temporary freeze until adequate vetting can take place. What would Tim Cook like to say about proper vetting to the families of the slain San Bernadino victims. The government botched their vetting. And where was Apple when Obama did a similar freeze? Yes, there are some differences. But not so many as to justify this level of so-called outrage. Trump is the only one who fought to get Apple’s overseas fortune to be repatriated. So, stop with the political posturing and focus on your main business. Tomáš Kubín Why do you need join the army of brainwashed fanatics, not capable to respect democratic elections results? Why do you need vomit again and again dirt on president Trump? BTW, this “Syrian emigrant” left his own children and did not care for them, AMERICAN family raised them. Shut up, Cult of Mac propagandists! Greg_the_Rugger After eight years of monkey jokes and claiming that the president hates America, I don’t think you have any standing to complain. I don’t blame Trump. He repeatedly made it very clear he was unqualified for POTUS.

Considering Legal Options Against It By Aman Jain on February 1, 2017 9:25 am in Technology ShareTweetPostFlip Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is considering legal options to force the Trump administration to take back its executive order on immigration, Tim Cook told The Wall Street Journal. This news comes just a few days after Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and other companies pledged declarations of support for a legal fight against the executive order in Washington state. Image source: YouTube Screen Grab No details on legal options Though Apple is considering legal options, Cook refused to elaborate on the possibilities. However, he did note that the tech giant wants to be both “constructive” and “productive” in its response. The immigration order was signed last Friday by President Donald Trump, suspending entry of refugees from seven countries to America for 90 days. On Saturday, Cook sent an email to Apple staff, saying that they do not support this, and Apple’s legal, security and HR teams are contacting employees who are affected by the order. Hundreds of employees have been affected by the order, said Cook, adding that he has been contacting “very, very senior people in the White House” to tell them that taking back the order is not only important for the tech giant but also because the strength of America comes from its immigrant background. “More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds. That’s what makes us special,” Cook said. Cook said many of Apple’s employees have contacted him with heart-wrenching stories about how the ban will impact them.  According to the WSJ, one employee is expecting a child and is afraid that the future grandparents, who have Iranian and Canadian citizenship, will not be able to meet their grandchild. Apple and Trump: a love/hate relation On the other hand, the Trump administration and its allies are arguing that this immigration ban is required to keep America safe from potential terrorists. During his presidential campaign, Trump censured the iPhone maker, partly for producing its products overseas. But since the election, relations between them seem to have improved a little. Last week, Cook visited Washington and dined with Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, says The WSJ, citing people familiar with the trip. This followed a private meeting with Trump last month. Apple sells its devices in more than 180 territories and countries. Its staff has been increasing their contributions to refugee relief funds in recent days. Cook said that the tech giant will match those contributions on a two-to-one basis.

Speaking to The Wall Street Journal, CEO Tim Cook said the order, banning Syrian refugees and citizens of seven other Muslim countries from entering the US, has affected hundreds of company employees – and now Apple feels it can no longer sit idle. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY Despite repeatedly reaching out to “very, very senior people in the White House” in hopes of persuading the administration to revoke the immigration ban, Cook made it clear the Big A is not ruling out the possibility of pursuing legal action in case the White House continues to refuse to rescind the order. While the outspoken CEO refrained from detailing under what conditions Apple could resort to legal action, he appealed to the administration to consider all the great things immigrants have done for the country. Stressing the value of foreigners to the US, Cook told The Wall Street Journal,”[m]ore than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds. That’s what makes us special.” In addition to its public condemnation of the travel ban, Cook added that Apple will be matching all donations by employees to refugees on a two-to-one basis, which will triple the value of all employee contributions. In spite of the outcry, the president remains adamant about his decision: Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 1, 2017 Apple is hardly the only company to have taken a stance against Trump’s inhumane order. On Monday, thousands of Googlers across the country took it to the streets to speak up against the immigration ban, including founder Sergey Brin and CEO Sundar Pichai. Microsoft and Amazon also expressed readiness to stand up to the Trump administration, supporting a lawsuit against the executive order filed by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson.

Company CEO Tim Cook has been vocal against the immigration ban and has pledged to keep fighting.  ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple is reportedly thinking about taking legal action to pressure the Trump administration into rescinding the controversial executive order and immigration ban. The news follows worldwide outrage and public outcry regarding the executive order and comes days after Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and other Silicon Valley companies denounced the immigration ban and pledged to support legal actions against the executive order. Trump Executive Order: What Does This Immigration Ban Mean? The executive order signed on Jan. 27 denies refugees' entry to the United States for 120 days, suspends the Syrian refugee program indefinitely, and bans people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. On Saturday, one day after President Donald Trump signed the executive order, Apple CEO Tim Cook sent an email to employees saying that Apple does not support this policy and the company's Human Resources, Legal and Security teams were getting in touch with staff affected by the order. Cook also pointed out that Apple would not exist without immigrants and said that the executive order had an impact on hundreds of Apple employees. The CEO also noted that he's been contacting people in senior positions within the White House to highlight that rescinding the executive order is important not just for Apple, but because the strength of the United States comes from its immigrant background. According to Cook, the immigrant background of the United States, more than any other country worldwide, paints it as a force with the ability and capacity to accept people from a wide range of backgrounds. That is what makes the United States special. Cook's comments echo those of other leaders in the technology field. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, for instance, shared his experience coming to the United States at the age of 6 as an immigrant from the Soviet Union - the States' greatest enemy at that point. The United States welcomed him and his family back then, but the new executive order paints a whole other reality. Apple Considering Legal Options Against Trump Executive Order According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, Apple is now considering legal action to fight the immigration ban, hoping to convince the Trump Administration to rescind the executive order. Cook declined to detail the possibilities of this potential legal action, but did highlight that Apple wants to be both constructive and productive in its action. Apple's stance regarding the executive order was a no-brainer, says Cook, since the company is selling its devices in more than 180 countries worldwide and it's essential for Apple to "look like the world." At the same time, Apple itself would not exist if the Syrian immigrant father of late Apple CEO Steve Jobs was denied the opportunity to enter the United States. It remains to be seen whether the whole outrage of the people and the public stance of major U.S. companies and their leaders will have any influence on the immigration ban. Trump has not even entertained the possibility of rescinding the executive order, but the fight goes on.

At the time, Qualcomm issued a statement to say the claims in the suit were "baseless", and that Apple had "intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented." Now, Apple CEO Tim Cook has addressed the lawsuit as part of Apple's Q1 earnings report (via The Inquirer), saying the company had "no choice" but to sue the Snapdragon chip-maker. Related: MWC 2017 The CEO said: "They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with. And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason and the more expensive it would be therefore for us to innovate." "So it's somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. "Just from our point of view, this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts." Cook also reiterated the claim that Qualcomm has witheld $1 billion in rebates because of Apple's involvement in an investigation carried out by South Korea's anti-trust regulator, the Fair Trade Commission. The regulator fined Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won ($853 million) in December for allegedly violating competition laws. Cook said he and his team felt they had "no choice" but to start legal proceedings following this alleged witholding of payments. Related: iPhone 8 – What we know But Qualcomm said in its response to the initial lawsuit that Apple was attempting to turn regulators against the company in “various jurisdictions around the world,” by “misrepresenting facts and withholding information.” The chip-maker also said it it "welcome[s] the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court." Cook said in his comments during the earnings report that he doesn't see a settlement out of court as likely, adding: "I don't like litigation. And so if there's another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don't see it. "I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end I think common sense will prevail and the courts will see it for what it is."

Click 5 Takeaways From Apple's 'Outstanding' Q1 Report Apple surprised Wall Street late Tuesday with better-than-expected sales and earnings in the December quarter, fueled by record iPhone sales. (Apple) PATRICK SEITZ 2/01/2017 Reprints Consumer electronics maker Apple (AAPL) surprised Wall Street late Tuesday with better-than-expected sales and earnings in the December quarter, fueled by record iPhone sales, sending its shares to 18-month highs. Apple CEO Tim Cook called the company's fiscal first-quarter results "outstanding" on a conference call with analysts. He said they could have been even better if Apple had built more units of the iPhone 7 Plus, MacBook Pro, iPad and Apple Watch during the quarter. The company was production-constrained on the iPhone 7 Plus and MacBook Pro, but misjudged holiday season demand for the iPad and Apple Watch. Apple's Q1 marked a return to growth for the Cupertino, Calif.-based company, which had seen declining sales and EPS in the preceding three quarters. Apple earned $3.36 a share, up 2% year over year, on sales of $78.35 billion, up 3%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts were expecting $3.21 and $77.25 billion. IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock broke out of a cup-with-handle chart pattern on Jan. 9, clearing a buy point of 118.12. For more information on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup. For the current quarter, Apple expects sales of $52.5 billion, up 4%, based on the midpoint of its traditionally conservative guidance. It did not give an EPS target. Wall Street had been modeling Apple to earn $2.08 a share, up 10%, on sales of $53.79 billion, up 7%, in the March quarter, its fiscal Q2. Apple stock jumped 6.2% to 128.87 on the stock market today, still in a buy zone from breakout in early January at 118.12. What follows are several key takeaways from Apple's Q1 report: Supply-Constrained On iPhone 7 Plus Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones during the December quarter, up 5% year over year. The increase follows three straight quarters of declining iPhone sales. The average selling price for iPhones rose to $695 in the December quarter from $619 in the September quarter thanks to the success of the iPhone 7 Plus. That top-of-the-line model was supply-constrained throughout the quarter and did not reach supply-demand balance until January, Cook said. The iPhone 7 Plus features a dual-camera system for taking high-quality photos, especially portraits. IPhone sales accounted for 69.4% of Apple's total revenue in the quarter. Apple generated $54.4 billion in iPhone sales in fiscal Q1, up 5%. Apple's second-largest business in Q1 was its Mac computer unit, which generated $7.24 billion in sales, or 9.2% of revenue. Services came in third with $7.17 billion, or just under 9.2% of revenue. Apple Sees Services Business Doubling Services were Apple's fastest-growing business in Q1, with revenue up 18% year over year. The company's App Store was the biggest driver of growth, executives said. "Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year," Cook told analysts. "Our goal is to double the size of our services business in the next four years." Apple's services portfolio includes the App Store, iTunes, iCloud, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, among others. Apple manages over 150 million paid customer subscriptions through its services unit, including its own services and third-party services offered on its App Store, Cook said. Apple's App Store revenue grew 43% in Q1 vs. the comparable period a year earlier, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said. 'Toe In The Water' With Original Video Cook described the company's foray into original video programming for its Apple Music service as a "toe in the water." The company will be learning from its experience in original content and seeing where it can go from there. "With our toe in the water, we're learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways that we could play at that," Cook said. Apple has long been rumored to be interested in offering a streaming video service, as competition for either pay-TV services or on-demand services like Netflix (NFLX). Apple sees its Apple TV set-top box as a platform for internet video services. Cook believes the media industry is beginning to see the traditional cable TV programming bundle break down. Apple Makes Home Automation Pitch Cook spent some time on the analyst call to tout Apple's efforts in home automation. "We are leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10," Cook said. "With Siri and a new Home app in iOS 10, everywhere you go, you can easily and securely control all of your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad, or your Apple Watch." Four weeks ago, Amazon's (AMZN) Alexa voice control system dominated the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas. Scores of device vendors announced plans to integrate Alexa into their products, so users can control them using spoken commands. Apple was a no-show at CES 2017. Perhaps feeling left out of the conversation, Cook pitched Apple's play in home automation with its HomeKit. "The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly, with many exciting solutions announced just this month, including video cameras, motion detectors, and sensors for doors, windows, and even water leaks," Cook said. "Perhaps even more importantly, we are unmatched when it comes to securing your home with HomeKit-enabled door locks, garage doors, and alarm systems." Cook discussed his own use of Apple home automation services. "I'm personally using HomeKit accessories and the Home app to integrate iOS into my home routine," Cook said. "Now when I say good morning to Siri, my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap on my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down, and locks the doors. "When I return to my house in the evening, as I near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago, and it's here today with iOS and HomeKit." Apple As Wearables Company With the Apple Watch, AirPods wireless ear buds and Beats headphones, Apple is now a major player in the wearable device market, Cook said. "With AirPods off to a fantastic start, a strong full first year for Apple Watch, and Beats headphones offering a great wireless experience using the Apple-designed W1 chip, we now have a rich lineup of wearable products," Cook said. "Their design, elegance, and ease of use make us very excited about the huge growth potential for wearables going forward." Apple did not give sales figures for the recently launched AirPods and second-generation Apple Watch.
