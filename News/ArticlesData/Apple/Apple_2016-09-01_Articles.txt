The European Commission replied that Kroes was wrong, and that she was speaking on behalf of Silicon Valley. The Commission found that Ireland had breached state-aid rules by allowing the California technology group to pay substantially less tax than other businesses since 1991. EU says Apple must repay €13 billion over ‘illegal’ Irish tax deal The European Commission said on Tuesday (30 August) that US tech company Apple must repay €13 billion in back taxes after ruling that a series of Irish tax deals were illegal. EurActiv.com In an op-ed for The Guardian, Kroes argues that EU member states have a sovereign right to determine their own tax laws, and that the Commission cannot change the rules of the game and seek unrecovered taxes retroactively. “EU member states have a sovereign right to determine their own tax laws,” she said. “State aid cannot be used to rewrite those rules. However, the current state-aid investigations into tax rulings appear to do exactly that,” Kroes wrote. Kroes is also critical of the retrospective nature of the ruling, which determined that Apple had underpaid its Irish taxes from 2003 until 2014, saying a fundamental principle of tax law is that changes do not apply to past years. Former Dutch politician Kroes served as Competition Commissioner from 2004 to 2009, and as Commission Vice President for Digital agenda from 2010 to 2014. She is now special envoy for StartDelta, a tech startup development project run by the Dutch government, and sits on the public policy board of Uber and the board of directors for Salesforce, an American cloud computing company headquartered in San Francisco. In fact, Vestager has already addressed the issues raised by Kroes. She has stated that the tax ruling favouring Apple are a matter of state aid, because member states cannot give unfair tax benefits to individual companies.  She has argued that this has been long confirmed by the EU courts and the executive’s case practice. “State aid can come in many forms, as a task benefit, as a favourable treatment of a piece of land, a favourable loan,” Vestager has told journalists. Regarding accusations of changing the rules of the game and seeking to recover taxes retroactively, Vestager explained that no legislation has been changed in the time frame of the Apple ruling, and that that consequently there was no ground for such claims. Asked to comment on the accusations by Kroes, European Commission chief spokesperson Margaritis Schinas acknowledged that the Commission had seen the op-ed. Reading from a prepared statement, he said: “We understand that it may be sometimes challenging to reconcile the role as a former Commissioner with the temptation to publicly express the views of those, in Silicon Valley or elsewhere, who oppose the Commission’s decisions. This seems to criticise how the Commission applied state aid rules, but the fact is that they were not applied in the way it was alleged,” Schinas said. Brussels Apple tax ruling reverberates across the Atlantic The European Commission’s demand for Apple to pay back a record 13 billion euros in back taxes in Ireland has triggered warnings that it could damage transatlantic economic ties. Others in Washington, however, used the case to call for an international tax system to ensure revenues are paid where they are due. EurActiv.com In fact, Kroes was very popular as a Commissioner precisely for playing hardball in the EU-Microsoft competition case, which resulted in a €497 million fine for the US company.

There is plenty of EC frameworks and interpretations saying exactly the opposite, i.e., that a special fiscal treatment is aid. This has nothing in liaision with fiscal sovereignty of a Member State in EU. Actually any state can adopt its own fiscal policy as regards direct fiscal to its firms. Though it has to apply to every firm incorporated in its territory without discrimanation.

Irish finance minister Michael Noonan promises to fight EC decision over Apple back taxes 2 Sep 2016 at 17:51, Kieren McCarthy The Irish government formally decided to appeal the European Commission's $14.5 billion back-tax demand on Friday. "There are some very important principles at stake in this case," said the country's finance minister Michael Noonan. "A robust legal challenge before the courts is essential to defend Ireland's interests." "The full amount of tax was paid in this case and no state aid was provided. Ireland did not give favorable tax treatment to Apple," he added. The cabinet decision was unanimous, Noonan said, but the issue itself has sparked a heated discussion among politicians. Deputy leader of opposition party Sinn Fein, Mary Lou McDonald, said the decision to allow Apple to pay such little tax "demonstrates an absolute disregard and disdain for citizens, fair play and tax justice." Parliament will be reconvened next week for a special session to debate the matter. The EC, for its part, has said it will defend its ruling in court. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on Friday: "All of us benefit when businesses pay their fair share of tax. It's not in the interest of the individuals and businesses who do pay tax, if others aren't paying their share." Good deal Earlier this week, the EC determined that a tax arrangement between the electronic giant and Irish tax authorities – which saw Apple move the bulk of its profits to a company that existed only on paper – amounted to illegal state aid. The two-year investigation claimed that Apple had paid a tax rate of just 0.005 per cent in 2014, and calculated that the company owed €13bn ($14.5bn) in back taxes. Both Apple and the Irish tax authorities strongly disputed the claim, arguing that there were no special circumstances and that Apple had paid the full amount of tax owed. While the Irish establishment stands by its arrangement, politicians and citizens are less enamored with the arrangement, particularly since the Irish government has imposed tight spending restrictions for nearly a decade following the financial crisis. The huge amount owed has drawn a wide range of comparisons with the money spent on other government services, such as its national health service. Ireland already has one of Europe's lowest corporate tax rates – 12.5 per cent – leading many large US corporations to set up their European headquarters in the country. Apple has stored a significant proportion of its revenue and profits in the country as a way of avoiding what it says would be an effective 40 per cent tax rate if it brought it back into the United States. Apple has been pushing the US government for some time to lower that rate in order for it to "repatriate" the hundreds of billions it holds outside the country; although earlier this week CEO Tim Cook said during an interview about the EC tax demand that he would start bringing some of it back into the country. A spokesperson later "clarified" that he was assuming that the US government would lower its rate later this year. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 72 Comments Whitepapers The 2016 study on the insecurity of privileged users For purposes of this research, privileged users include database administrators, network engineers, IT security practitioners and cloud custodians Can Machine Learning Prevent Application Downtime?

Mello Jr. Sep 3, 2016 8:00 AM PT Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak recently said removing the headphone jack in the next version of the iPhone is going to "tick off a lot of people." It's been rumored for months that Apple would be scrapping the 3.5 mm headphone jack in the iPhone 7 it's expected to unveil next week. Such a move, Wozniak said in an interview, could upset users who have invested in listening technology that uses the headphone jack. Ditching the headphone jack could be the prelude to another rumored new product: Bluetooth earbuds based on a very-low-powered radio chip developed exclusively by Apple. Wozniak prefers listening to music over wired headphones, he told The Australian Financial Review, because audio through Bluetooth wireless technology, which is used by most wireless headsets, sounds flat. However, if Bluetooth could be improved to produce better sound, he'd use wireless headphones, he said. Such technology already exists, maintained Jeff Orr, senior practice director for mobile devices at ABI Research. "There is the ability in Bluetooth to deliver a very high-quality audio experience," he told TechNewsWorld. "It depends on how much a company is willing to invest in it to deliver something an audiophile would appreciate." Jackless Options Without the headphone jack, the only headset option would be wireless, unless Apple introduces alternatives. One solution could be headphones that plug into Apple's proprietary Lightning Connector, which is used primarily to charge the iPhone. However, it's rumored that Apple is changing that connector, too. The new connector would dock to the iPhone magnetically, similar to Apple's laptop computer connectors. Another alternative would be to offer a dongle that would plug into the Lightning Connector and add a 3.5 mm jack to the iPhone. Apple used the adaptor approach before, when it went from using a 30-pin connector on its iOS devices to the present Lightning Connector. Such an adaptor likely would be inelegant, maintained Kevin Krewell, a principal analyst at Tirias Research. "Apple does not make elegant dongles," he told TechNewsWorld. "The dongles are designed to be as inelegant as possible to convince people not to use them for an extended period of time and to move on to what's new," Krewell added. Inelegant or not, Wozniak would use an adaptor with an iPhone so he could listen to music through his wired earphones with custom ear implants, he told the AFR. Strong Foundation Although the demise of the headphone jack has not been confirmed, the rumor appears to be very well established, as rumors go. "It's been a solid rumor for an extended period of time, so I believe it will be true," Krewell said. There are still doubters, though. "I wouldn't be surprised if Apple floated the idea a year ago to get people talking about it and see how people would react to this type of change," ABI's Orr noted. If Apple does scrap the standard headphone jack, it won't be the first company to do so. Lenovo removed the jack in its flagship Moto Z line of phones introduced earlier this year. "If you're going to remove the headphone jack, you'd better have a compelling advantage for consumers," said Ian Fogg, senior director of the mobile and telecoms team at IHS Markit. Lenovo's pitch is that by eliminating the headphone jack it can create a thinner device to which optional modules can be attached. The problem is that the modules would add thickness to the phone. "That makes Lenovo's proposition for dropping the headphone jack quite weak," Fogg told TechNewsWorld. Backlash or Back Pat? Although Apple has made bold moves to mothball legacy technology in the past, losing the headphone jack is different from going from a 30-pin to Lightning Connector. "The headphone jack is not just a port used by smartphones. It's used on many devices -- laptops, TV sets, home stereos, radios. It's very, very ubiquitous," Fogg said. "It isn't like a change in the product line where people can get over the change fairly quickly. There are so many other devices where people use a headphone socket, it will take them many years to switch to something newer," he suggested. "That makes it a tricky area for Apple to innovate in." Will eliminating the headphone jack tick off customers, as Wozniak predicted? "There is certainly the risk that Apple will alienate some part of its audience if it removes the audio port from the iPhone," said Orr. However, if the past is any predictor of the future, Apple should be able to keep its fans in line. "Apple's customer base has never abandoned it when it's made major infrastructure transitions in the past," observed Tirias' Krewell. "There's always grumbling initially, but people eventually fall in line." John Mello is a freelance technology writer and contributor to Chief Security Officer magazine.

Reply Re: Sacking Jack May Anger iPhone Headphone Fans jescott418Posted 2016-09-04 Apple is all about marketing. Eliminating the jack is of no concern for Apple. It's about marketing new products, accessories, and providing what Apple considers as advancing the product. This is nothing new, Apple has always managed to dump ports for the purpose of installing new ones. In iPhone's this is purely about selling higher priced wireless headphones. Especially since Apple purchased Beats. What Woz says is absolutely true, many have invested in other products that use the 3.5 mm jack and beyond that a wired headphone for many is a better choice than bluetooth. Not every iPhone owner is wealthy enough to buy a wireless solution especially if they have invested in a good wired head set. Why should I buy more products to fix something Apple decided I didn't need? My experience with ...

This file photo taken on June 13, 2016 shows the Apple logo displayed on a screen at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference presentation at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California. File photo by Barielle Lurie/AFP BRUSSELS, Belgium (UPDATED) – The European Union on Tuesday, August 30, ordered Apple to pay a record 13 billion euros in back taxes in Ireland, saying deals allowing the US tech giant to pay almost no tax were illegal. In a ruling that is set to anger Washington, the European Commission said the world's most valuable company avoided tax bills on almost all its profits in the bloc under the arrangements with the Irish government. Ireland has been seeking to attract US multinationals by offering extremely favourable tax conditions, known as sweetheart deals. "The Commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years," EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. "In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of one per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014," she said in a statement. Ireland immediately said it would appeal against the decision and Apple is also expected to challenge it. "I disagree profoundly with the Commission's decision," Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said in a statement. "The decision leaves me with no choice but to seek cabinet approval to appeal the decision before the European Courts." The tax repayment order, by far the largest in the EU's history, follows a three-year inquiry into whether Dublin's tax breaks for Silicon Valley titan Apple amount to illegal state aid. Apple has had a base at the southern city of Cork since 1980 and employs 5,000 people in Ireland, through which it routes its international sales, avoiding billions in corporation taxes. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a Washington Post interview published August 13, said he hoped to "get a fair hearing" on the matter. "If we don't, then we would obviously appeal it," he added. 'No bias against US' The US stepped up its fight last Wednesday against the commission's crackdown on tax avoidance by Apple and other multinational companies, accusing it of unilateralism and overstepping its mandate. In a white paper, the US Treasury said the commission probe into alleged special tax treatment that certain EU countries gave Apple, Amazon, Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler "undermines the international tax system." The EU has made taxes a core issue since the LuxLeaks scandal in which it was revealed that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker's native Luxembourg gave companies huge tax breaks while he was prime minister. In October Brussels ordered US coffee giant Starbucks and Italian automaker Fiat to each repay up to 30 million euros ($34 million) in back taxes to the Netherlands and Luxembourg respectively. The US has acknowledged the problems around the issue of multinational firms obtaining state aid, in the form of secret and extremely lucrative tax breaks, from Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg for setting up business in those countries. But it said those deals were made under international treaties and accepted tax practices. Last week the European Commission denied it was targeting US companies in particular and said that EU rules do not allow national tax authorities to give tax breaks to some companies that are not available to others. "There is no bias against US companies," it said in a statement. Washington has also expressed concern about EU anti-trust cases targeting tech giant Google alleging that it has unfairly suppressed competition. – Rappler.com Filed under:European Union•Ireland•Margrethe Vestager•Michael Noonan•Tim Cook•tax deals•Apple HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

A lawsuit accuses Apple of allowing a design flaw go unaddressed. File photo by Justin Sullivan/AFP SAN FRANCISCO, US – A lawsuit filed in Silicon Valley federal court over the weekend accuses Apple of knowingly selling defective iPhone 6 models with screens that stop responding to touch. Attorneys representing the three Apple smartphone owners named as plaintiffs in the litigation asked that the case be granted class-action status to represent anyone in the United States who has bought an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus. "This action arises from Apple's concealment of a material design defect that causes the touchscreens on the iPhones to become unresponsive and fail for their essential purpose as smartphones," the civil complaint contended. The lawsuit accused Apple of refusing to repair iPhones free of charge despite knowing that a design flaw was a fault. Apple did not respond to an AFP request for comment. According to the lawsuit, chips that handle touchscreen input were not properly secured to logic boards and failed under normal wear-and-tear. "The Internet is replete with examples of blogs and other websites where consumers have complained of the exact same Touchscreen Defect within the iPhones," the complaint maintained. The lawsuit accuses Apple of a litany of violations including fraud and breach of implied warranty, and goes on to demand unspecified cash damages along with attorneys fees. Damages sought in the suit include having the court order Apple to repair, recall, and/or replace the iPhones at issue. – Rappler.com Filed under:Silicon Valley•iPhone•lawsuits•Apple HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

Apple CEO Tim Cook, however, argued in an open letter that while Apple is a great supporter of international tax reform to promote “simplicity” and “clarity,” new rules shouldn’t be applied retroactively. He also told Irish broadcaster RTE that, “The finding is wrongheaded. It’s not true: There wasn’t a special deal between Ireland and Apple.” Meanwhile, Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s top competition official defended the ruling, stating, “All of us benefit when businesses pay their fair share of tax. It’s not in the interest of the individuals and businesses who do pay tax, if others aren’t paying their share.” Both appeals are expected to take several years. Apple says it is setting aside the money in an escrow account if its appeal eventually fails. Related: European Union slaps Apple with $14.5 billion USD in fees after ten years of Irish tax breaks SourceThe New York Times   Do Do So, if were a tax payer in Ireland I think I’d be a little peeved at my government. What, you don’t want 14 billion or so that is owed to you. Special deal? what? TrickyDickie So old Timmy has changed his tune now? “Ok, we did it, but we shouldn’t have to pay it back” WTF?! It’s Me That’s not what anyone, anywhere reported. Not even close really. fmradio68 Meanwhile the average Joe in Ireland and other businesses have to pay their fair share. It’s Me The average taxpayer might look and see that Apple is the largest corporate tax payer (or close to) in Ireland and employees many thousands of people there directly and more indirectly. Do Do That doesn’t make it fair that Apple isn’t paying their fair share of taxes and 6000 isn’t small but still, it’s not enough that they should be allowed to get away with not paying what they owe, if they owe it. If they owe the money, they owe the money, Fighting it just makes them look like gluttons and disrespectful of the Irish taxpayers to me. Again, if they owe it according to the laws that were in place. It’s Me Apple paid what they were asked to pay. And, it’s Ireland that is fighting this (as well as Apple). It’s as simple as that. Say you paid you taxes for the last 10 years, exactly as you were asked to. If Justin came in and said, “oh well, I don’t think Steve was charging enough in taxes, so we’re raising rates. Oh, also, we’re going to charge you those new rates back on your last 10 years too”, no one would think that was right. You may not like how much Apple paid, but they paid what they owed and what they were asked. For a new level of government to come in and say they should have paid more, when even the government they actually paid says no, it’s laughable. Do Do Well your analogy isn’t exactly accurate and keep in mind, I’m only suggesting that if they didn’t pay their fair share that they should, not that I think they didn’t according to the law. I do think most corporations don’t pay enough but that’s another story. Anyway, if Ireland didn’t collect as much as the needed to and they were obligated to as far as the EU suggested then I think they have to pay, and pay from as far back as whatever rules dictate. If the money is owed and somebody conveniently claims ignorance, that’s not an excuse that’s going to work. Certainly doesn’t work for most people….unless your name is Hillary I guess. It’s Me Nothing to do with fair. Has to do with what was expected by law. The EU had no jurisdiction at the time Ireland provided the tax rate. Now, as a supra-national entity they are saying that their authority no only trumps Ireland’s sovereignty now but also retroactively. It is very similar to a new government deciding you should have paid more in the past, in order to be fair. Magic18 The money goes to EU, not Ireland It’s Me Umm, no, it’s paid to Ireland…who is fighting against accepting it. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-30/apple-s-14-5-billion-eu-tax-ruling-what-you-need-to-know Who receives the money if Apple ends up paying? The money gets paid to Ireland, which puts those funds into an escrow account and leaves it there until any appeal process has fully concluded. Why might Ireland not want this money? Because Ireland says it did nothing wrong in the first place. And the risk of damage to Ireland’s attractiveness to multinationals may cost it much more in the long term through lost foreign investment than it will gain out of Europe’s ruling today. They’ll be going after google and others next. Ipse I’m gunna slap my accountant for not being able to put me in the 0.001% bracket. gommer strike Well it’s nice to see that Ireland is on Apple’s side in this. But of course they are. Why wouldn’t they be? It’s Me They stand to gain an extra $14.5 billion they never asked for is one reason for them not to side with Apple. Potentially even more if Apple loses and they go after Google and Chrysler and Starbucks, etc. gommer strike You have a point. I was thinking more along the lines of…Ireland could choose to stand back and say “hey hey don’t look at us, we’re just the country here” and stay completely out of it – they’re making $$ of if this anyways. Or they could choose to(as they have) to defend Apple because hey…what’s the cost of one lawyer, vs all that money pouring into their coffers(yes it’s not theirs, but surely they stand to gain a pretty penny from those transactions).

Internet by Rick Broida August 29, 2016 3:05 PM PDT @cheapskateblog Up Next CES is finally open: Here's what you missed Think there's no such thing as a deal on Apple products? Think again. I'm on record as saying that when you shop for Apple gear, you should almost always look for refurbished options. That's because Apple routinely offers computers, tablets and other stuff for less than the price of new. Ah, but what if you're looking for a refurbished iPhone? You won't find those in Apple's outlet store. And what if you're looking for a particular model or configuration not offered by Apple proper? How can you find third-party deals on refurbs? Enlarge Image RefurbMe aggregates listings for refurbished Apple products and helps you find items not available from Apple proper.Photo by Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET Simple: Head to RefurbMe. Born a few years ago as a simple catalog of Apple's own clearance items, the site now offers all manner of refurbished Apple products from many sources, like Best Buy, Apple, Gazelle and Target. Even better, it can alert you when a particular item becomes available. The site is divided into six major sections: Mac Laptop, Mac Desktop, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Apple TV. (You can also search for a specific product, natch.) Click iPhone, for example, and you can then filter by model, carrier and even refurbisher (Apple, Best Buy, Gazelle, Jem Jem and so on). So, for example, if you happened to be looking for an unlocked iPhone 5s with at least 32GB of storage, RefurbMe would quickly steer you to a JemJem option priced at $249. (Whether or not that's a smart buy is topic for debate; just saying you can find it easily.) Once you filter your way down far enough (specifying things like color, storage capacity and carrier), RefurbMe will let you create a product alert just by providing your email address. You can also opt to receive alerts via SMS. Just keep in mind that RefurbMe is merely aggregating all refurbished Apple products under one roof. The product conditions, warranties and other factors can vary greatly from one seller to the next, so it's up to you to do your homework. But don't assume that the site always has the latest and greatest deals. For example, I just spotted a refurbished Apple Watch at Best Buy for $189.99, but as of this writing, it's not on RefurbMe. I'm not sure how often the latter crawls various sites for new deals, or whether it's as comprehensive in its crawling as it needs to be. Even so, I consider this a useful tool for anyone seeking to save money on Apple gear.

Click here to support us on Patreon. ★ News TouchArcade Game of the Week: 'Riff Racer: Race Your Music' Author Carter Dotson Posted On2016-09-02 19:00:05 Watch App   Featured, Game of the Week, News The idea behind the TouchArcade Game of the Week is that every Friday afternoon we post the one game that came out this week that we think is worth giving a special nod to. Now, before anyone goes over-thinking this, it doesn't necessarily mean our Game of the Week pick is the highest scoring game in a review, the game with the best graphics, or really any other quantifiable "best" thing. Instead, it's more just us picking out the single game out of the week's releases that we think is the most noteworthy, surprising, interesting, or really any other hard to describe quality that makes it worth having if you were just going to pick up one. These picks might be controversial, and that's OK. If you disagree with what we've chosen, let's try to use the comments of these articles to have conversations about what game is your game of the week and why. Without further ado…   Riff Racer: Race Your Music While the big rhythm game this week was undoubtedly Lumines: Puzzle and Music [$2.99], and you really should read Shaun's review of the game, there was another music game that made the jump to mobile this week that's well worth checking out: Riff Racer [$0.99]. Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel The idea is that you're racing on courses that are set to music tracks, either from your library, Apple Music playlists, or from the game's built-in songs. The courses are generated based on the structure of the music and themed according to genre. Your goal is to try and stay in sync with the track, not falling behind the sync lines as you pick up turbo boosts, take ramps, and dodge obstacles. You can and occasionally will go flying off the course at high speed after you use a turbo boost. The whole thing takes place in a futuristic environment, and looks super-slick. The name is not only a reference to music, but also a pun on Ridge Racer, one would presume. Considering that the drifting is a big part of the racing as you can drift through many of the turns, I'm guessing it was intentional. The thing with music games nowadays is that it's now possible to stream a lot of music without actually owning it. So, many games that let you import your own tracks run into problems with users. Not Riff Racer, at least if you have Apple Music – you can pull in tracks from selected playlists by the developers. It'd be great to get integration with the entirety of the service's music library, or to get support for Spotify, Google Play Music, and Tidal as well. But at least if you're in the Apple ecosystem, then you have a larger selection of music available to you beyond just the tracks you own. And at least seeing support for one streaming service, and admittedly one that's tied into the manufacturer's OS, is cool to see. If you haven't used that 3 month Apple Music trial yet, now's a good time to do so. Another issue with music games is that sometimes they don't work so well with complex music that has odd time signatures and many tempo changes...like a lot of the music I listen to, such as sci-fi prog-thrash masters Vektor: Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel Thankfully, Riff Racer is set up to handle complicated music like that, with sections that correspond to the various slower and faster sections. It might not work with the longest, most complex tracks...at least not with a 63-minute long song like I tried. Fair enough, though. The track generation does a good job at feeling like you're racing to the music itself, which is certainly not an easy thing to pull off for any game. Don't just stick to one genre – different themes are spread throughout the game for different types of music. Perhaps it's a sign to start diversifying the kind of music I listen to since pretty much all of my music is metal, progressive rock, and Run the Jewels. I stand by my choices though. While the game is mostly just about getting high scores, it's a really cool foundation for a game. Plus, if you play the same tracks as your friends, you can compete in high scores against them on the same tracks, with coin bonuses for being the first person to create a track. I'm probably going to get a lot of those with my eclectic tastes. Want to listen to some music, but have more of an active experience while doing so? This is one of the best ways I've experienced on mobile yet. I also get a kind of Forever Drive [Free] vibe from this game in terms of theme and the idea of endless content to play through. Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel So, if you've got some music to listen to and want to play games at the same time...or at least prefer driving cars through neon environments at high speeds versus matching blocks to the rhythm, Riff Racer is the game for you, and it's a rocking choice for our game of the week. Riff Racer: Race Your Music by FOAM Entertainment 99¢ Watch Button Watch App Telltale's 'The Walking Dead' S3 Is Called 'A New Frontier', Releases November The TouchArcade Show - 272 - Something's Not Right Here ffaust Neat idea, be nice if it synced with Spotify. skylerolson Agreed, if this had Spotify support it would be an instabuy for me mudads Agreed as well. I'll keep an eye on it. If they add Spotify support, I'll buy it. orangecan Same here. I don't keep any music on my device at all houseofg Going to +1 this as well. It was my first thought because, thanks to services like Spotify I don't store locally on my device anymore. That's clearly true of a lot of people. The possibilities are endless with Spotify, including the ability for people to race via the same song as mentioned. DrlRage Has the dev given any indication that Spotify can be done or will be? I'm in the same "SPOT". From watching the gameplay, it doesn't really seem like it's in tune with the music. It does have a cool look and people seem to enjoy it despite the DRM issues and app crashing, so I might give it a shot in the future after it updates. macatron Totally agree. I don't store music on my phone anymore because I solely use Spotify. If they add support for Spotify I'd definitely bite. 🙂 RiptoR It's a fun game, but it keeps crashing when I return to the main menu after finishing a race, wiping all progress I made. Very annoying to say the least. Playing on an iPad Air (iOS 9.3.5). JPhilipp Crashes for me before I can make a race. Consider yourself lucky 😉 zebramatt So it's Audiosurf? I'm kidding - it looks fun!

Close share panel Image copyright PA Image caption Apple boss Tim Cook says the European Commission's tax ruling is "maddening" Was this week a turning point? It has certainly been expensive for the biggest stock-market listed company on the planet. Of course, Apple can afford that €13bn (£11bn) tax bill that may be heading for the chief financial officer's in-tray. And who knows whether it will actually have to pay up. Perhaps the planned appeal will be successful. But it certainly feels like a very important moment in the battle to get multinational businesses to pay what many governments - as well as ordinary people - think would be their fair share of tax. It is true that this episode has not brought unity among the governments concerned. The United States in particular is livid about the way the European Commission has gone about trying to get Apple to cough up. But despite the spat, there's still a degree of underlying common purpose. It is driven in part by a recognition that voters, many of them at least, detest what they see as the devious behaviour of many multinationals and some wealthy individuals. The recent Panama papers scandal demonstrated that. Then, there are the trade talks between the US and Europe, known as TTIP. There is a strong business lobby supporting the project and its aim of removing barriers to transatlantic trade and investment. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Critics say a TTIP deal could lead to job losses We can't declare the talks formally over, but the doubts and hostility expressed by senior political figures in France and Germany in the past few days do suggest that TTIP is in precarious territory. Why did those leaders speak out? In part, because both countries have elections coming up. President Francois Hollande, of France, and the leader of Germany's social democrats, Sigmar Gabriel, are well aware of the hostility to TTIP among many voters. Some people feel they have been left behind by globalisation and are worried that more of the same will undermine jobs and incomes. Some think that trade talks are going to weaken standards of environmental and consumer protection, and even impinge on the sovereignty of elected governments - all, they would argue, for the benefit of big business, and not ordinary people. Similar concerns have affected the US presidential campaign. The Republican candidate Donald Trump has been especially outspoken about international trade deals. Media captionDonald Trump has accused China of trade "rape" But his main rival, Hillary Clinton, has also felt obliged to reflect the mood. She had been a keen supporter of trade liberalisation agreements, including TTIP. Now, she seems decidedly lukewarm. And with another set of talks that have been completed but not yet ratified by the US Congress - involving countries of the Pacific Rim - she said the result didn't live up to her standards. So we have two developments this week that reflect a popular distaste for international big business. And haven't we had a lot of that kind of thing in the past few years? Some people think Britain's vote to leave the European Union is part of the same "small-is-beautiful" feeling. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Much of the Vote Leave campaign's rhetoric focused on rejecting big government Of course, that distaste has always been there, but the financial crisis really brought it out. Certainly, banks were at the centre of that storm, but the sentiment spilled out to undermine popular perception of big business more widely. None of this is to write the obituary of the giant multinationals. They lobby, they contribute to political campaigns, they send their top staff on secondment to, and recruit from, the top levels of governments. And let's not forget that the reason they are successful multinationals is that they make and sell stuff and services that the great majority of us want. But this may have been the week when they were told, by some at least: thus far, and no further.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Biz Break: Facebook, Alphabet among tech leaders working on ethical A.I. guidelines By Rex Crum / September 2, 2016 at 2:58 PM Top Of The Order:   Playing Nice: It’s safe to say that there is a lot of competition among the biggest names in the tech sector. That’s no surprise. For example, when you have the likes of Facebook and Google battling over the same advertising bucks, there isn’t going to be a lot of sympathy between rivals. But that doesn’t mean the big bullies on the playground still can’t find a way to get along from time to time, does it? We’re about to see how some of those leaders can work together, as Facebook, Google parent company Alphabet, Microsoft, IBM and Amazon have been getting together to work out a slate of ethical guidelines to apply to artificial intelligence. The growth of A.I. has gotten a lot of attention of late, in particular with regards to the race to develop so-called self-driving cars, and the involvement of everyone from Ford, to Uber, to chipmaker Nvidia. The group, which is a very loose affiliation, is said to be working on rules that would apply to artificial intelligence to ensure such technologies are used to benefit people and not cause harm. According to the New York Times, the group doesn’t have an official name yet, nor has it nailed down any actual guidelines for its purposes. Middle Innings:  No Taxes For Us, Please: Earlier this week, the European Commission slapped Apple with a back-tax bill of $14.5 billion related to taxes that the EC says Apple owes the government of Ireland. Naturally, Apple has said it will appeal the decision, and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook basically said if it gets stuck with the bill, that could jeopardize the approximately 6,000 Apple jobs in Ireland, and who knows how many others in Europe. Normally, governments love to collect taxes. And if you don’t think so, just see what the Internal Revenue Service has to say if you don’t pay yours by next April 15. But nothing about this situation is normal, including the government of Ireland’s response to the EC’s ruling. On Friday, the Irish government said it would join Apple in its appeal of the tax bill. The country has even said it doesn’t want the largesse that would come from Apple. The main reasons Ireland is siding with Apple are practical. The country doesn’t want Brussels (the European Union capital) dictating how Ireland applies its corporate tax policies, which offer low rates to businesses to locate operations in the country. For Ireland, it seems like it would rather have the jobs those companies provide than to nickel and dime them over a few billion bucks in taxes. Bottom Of The Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Friday… Movin’ On Up: Gains came from Harmonic, QuinStreet, Rovi, Jive Software and Palo Alto Networks. In The Red: Verifone Systems shares fell more than 16 percent after the maker of credit card and electronic-payment technology products cut its earnings and sales forecast for the year. Other decliners included GoPro,  Aviat Networks, Abaxis and Solar City. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.4 percent to 5,249.9. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 percent to end the week at 18,491.96. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index also rose 0.4 percent to 2,179.98. Quote Of The Day: “You have to come out as prepared as you can and play together the best we can.” — Washington State University football coach Mike Leach.

As Apple's Campus 2 site has undergone construction, we've continued to get frequent drone videos of the progress. The latest drone-shot videos show real progress, with important things like walls and roofs actually starting to appear. Apple's environmental credentials are also on show, with green landscaping work starting and solar panels going in. DON'T MISS: Everything you need to know about Samsung’s unprecedented Galaxy Note 7 recall https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBTar9-E6n0 Both videos are shot with DJI drones, although with different levels of quality. Duncan Sinfield used a DJI Inspire 1 to capture images of the solar panels going in on the roof of the main building, which is a far cry from what the structure looked like a year ago. Landscaping is one of the areas that still needs a lot of work before any employees move in next year. At the moment, everything apart from the main buildings are just big piles of dirt (some of them particularly big). https://youtu.be/kFQsu5bdPXw The second video was filmed by Matthew Roberts using a Phantom 3 Pro. The smaller drone managed to get closer to the roof, and you can clearly see all the HVAC hardware Apple is having to install for all of its hard-working humans. The scale of Apple's new HQ is always difficult to grasp from the drone footage, but the occasional glimpse of tiny workers is enough to remind you how ambitious this project is. Construction will cost around $5 billion -- expensive, for sure, but a lot less than Apple's hundreds of billions of cash sitting offshore. (It's less than Apple's back tax bill to the European Union, for that matter.)   Trending right now: Yet another reason the iPhone is superior to Android One reason why the iPhone 7 won’t have the best specs next year OK, so there is one big problem with the iPhone 7’s lack of a headphone jack See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next 9 tech-friendly gifts for people obsessed with travel Yahoo Tech Get a $100 AT&T Visa® Reward Card DIRECTVSponsored Here’s all the Kmart stores that will have liquidation sales this weekend BGR News Facebook launches live 360-degree video feature Yahoo Tech Modders report successful hack of NES Classic Edition, expand library to 60 games Digital Trends Switch Your Number to Sprint and Save 50% Sprint®Sponsored New leak shows how terrible Apple’s iPhone could have been BGR News The iPhone 8 is going to be bigger than you can even imagine BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

Again. Not long ago, there was a simple migration from PC and Mac desktops to notebooks. Then, Apple finally got the simple tablet right in 2010. However, basic tablets can’t do it all, and so Apple warmed to the iPad Pro concept. But the dust isn’t clearing. Rather the market is exploding in use cases, customer preferences and advanced technology. What looked to be simple evolution has become not so simple. It all started, around the turn of the century, with the terrors of race-to-the-bottom desktop PCs that ran Windows XP. That operating system was not very secure, but it was sufficiently complex that customers thought buying a new computer was easier than upgrading to a new OS. And to keep prices down, PC hardware was barely able to run the new Windows versions, so new hardware was imperative (and frequent) along the way. Apple made good headway against Windows XP and Vista with Mac OS X, an OS that was generally more secure and easier to handle. The implementation of [Mac] OS X on sleek MacBook Pros lured many into the Apple fold. Complexity Out of Control In time, however, the sophistication of desktop and notebook OSes became a difficult challenge for average PC customers who tired of constant updates, complex GUIs, security problems, Registry issues and backups. The evolution of hardware technology with prefixes like “giga” and “tera” overwhelmed many. The Apple iPad in 2010 was just what the doctor ordered for millions of people. It looked like the iPad was going to eradicate the conventional PC. Then something unexpected happened. The iPad was too simple. Too easy. It didn’t need upgrading very often. Its high security, which made it so safe to use, also crippled it when it cam to replacing the PC and Mac. Beautiful MacBook/Airs/Pros with keyboards continued to cannibalize iPad sales. They’re still doing it today. Just when Apple thought the Mac was a dying breed, computer makers started figuring out how to use advanced technology to deliver strong solutions to each traditional market segment. Hewlett-Packard took up the mantle. abandoned by IBM, Sun and SGI, to build superior “Z” workstations for the technical professionals. Microsoft, under CEO Satya Nadella, started acting like a very smart company. They waited patiently until hardware technology could deliver a competent touch screen, Intel-based tablet that could run X86 business aps. Lenovo and Google have jumped in with some interesting tablet and 2-in-1 concepts such as the Google Pixel C and the Lenovo YogaBook. Chromebooks are finding a place in education. HP has just introduced an awesome, amazing desktop for the consumer market, the Elite Slice, and injected it into a void left by the Mac Mini which has been left on its deathbed. Just when it looked like the personal computing market was going to simplify, computer makers have found that there is, instead, a wealth of differing customer needs and diverse technical solutions that can fill those needs. Decisions, Decisions Every week I read an article by an author who wrestled with which device to take on a business trip, despairing that any once device could fill the complete bill. Meanwhile, markets that seemed dead because some computer makers wanted them to be dead have been, instead, reinvigorated and exploited by clever competitors—making product choices even harder. Tablets like the iPad have had to sprout multi-tasking, a pencil and keyboard to sustain viability. Amazing desktops combined with a new generation of 4K displays have breathed new life into CAD, research, science, architecture, and video production. The smoke isn’t clearing. Not at all. And now it’s Apple’s turn. Perhaps the long delay in refreshes to the Mac lineup reflects Apple’s struggle with the changing and fracturing markets. It will be interesting to see how Apple responds and which parts of this quickly changing marketplace Apple wants to engage and what approach the company takes.

I find your viewpoints interesting but I’ll have to disagree with some of these. I somewhat agree with your thoughts on the iPad but slowing growth is a long way from ‘dying.’ You still make a fair point though. Nadella is certainly an improvement over Ballmer but a company that loses it’s ‘golden key’ (or whatever it is) is not what I’d call ‘a very smart company.’ Not so sure about the flying car. I mean, $300K and oh yeah, it just crashed. You need years of training for the license and airport access. Assured success? It’s a really cool toaster-frig though. I fail to see how the HP Slice is awesome. What new ground has it broken? I think the article on Baby Boomers is significant. I can see how many of those insights go hand in hand with much of what has made Apple successful. Keep up the good work. I really like most of your stuff. September 2, 2016 at 6:08 EST PM Paul Goodwin September 2, 2016 I find that a regular iPad (I have an iPad Air 2) fills the bill for a lot of work. As an engineer consulting with other engineers online using things like Webex, Box and others, the iPad is an almost ideal tool. I never really want for a keyboard, it wouldn’t add that much to my personal work experience, however, I can see where others would value it. The only negative to using an iPad for work in a web based environment is that there are still a lot of web page designs that aren’t very iOS friendly. Many time they offer apps which don’t have the full capability of their web based designed tools. And even their web based tools are nearly always deficient when running on a Mac or in iOS Safari. The world still doesn’t recognize the iPad as a serious engineering tool, and many site just won’t invest in making them Mad or iOS friendly. Many times I work with both the laptop and the iPad side by side. Each is very good at what it does, and having both pieces of hardware is many times far more productive than trying to accomplish things using just one or the other. How does that fit with this article? Well, the manufacturers keep trying to design this ideal holy grail of a piece of hardware. I’m quite sure it’ll be a long time before one “thing” will be better than having both tools in front of you. September 2, 2016 at 11:32 EST PM Jamie September 3, 2016 This is all really interesting to me. I find that my best-case use scenarios are very similar, I use a combination of several devices side by side, and I can’t imagine them all being integrated without it being incredibly awkward or compromising somewhere along the line. I expect Apple is aware of this too, and as Macs, tablets, and phones are all fairly mature at this point, it’ll be interesting to see what direction they take with their stuff. September 3, 2016 at 4:32 EST PM daemon September 4, 2016 You’re honestly telling us that people are too stupid to understand unit prefixes? That’s your argument for what makes computers too complex? John, your contempt for the general public is sickening. Why don’t you tell us about how girls women just don’t have the mental fortitude required to understand how a water pump works. /s September 4, 2016 at 10:58 EST AM wab95 September 4, 2016 John: There’s a lot of material here worthy, of discussion, so let’s get to it. First, regarding the complexity and the fracturing of the computer market place, to the extent that there is greater distribution of devices for the same use cases, this is a story less about the devices than about users, and their experimentation and exercise of greater choice, in finding that right balance between functional capacity and access (particularly portability). In that heady mix, you then have the manufacturers, who, like Google and MS, have seen Apple’s success with an ultra portable (the iPad), and have leveraged their respective skill sets (Chrome for Google, the Surface with Windows for MS), to proffer devices that can compete in that space. What further complicates this, in my opinion, and renders some of the analysis (not yours) somewhat lacking, is that this complexity is less about a defined niche than it is about opportunity. The advantage of a true niche is that it can, not necessarily will, select for a specific type of device. This is what we saw with smartphones, to the detriment of Blackberry and other devices whose technology, form factor and limitations hailed from a previous century. An important distinction here is that the iPhone created, defined and then expanded its own niche, not unlike a rapidly expanding universe following the Big Bang, in which only the iPhone, and similar multi-capacity ultra portable computers that could also make phone calls, could compete, and thus left the detritus of legacy devices like the original Blackberry in their wake. The situation with traditional computers and their ultra portable competition, like the iPad, is evolutionarily distinct. This is a productivity space whose access points have been expanded, not by a new device, but by the cloud and its myriad spinoff services and technologies. These have created opportunity for people to work differently by accessing that space using whatever device is available and sufficiently functional to get the job done. Suddenly, we have new opportunity that can potentially be satisfied by a vast range of devices both extant and future, and less of a device-defined phylogenetic niche. No doubt, the opportunity still exists to dominate this space with a device-specific or device-type solution, however I suspect that this will not be met by a one size fits all solution. Rather, in my opinion, that competition will be won by a set of attributes or a feature set, namely an ideal balance of convenience (portability) and capacity (the range of productivity functions that device can fulfil). This will be a Darwinian competition of fitness for this work space whose winners will be defined by a diverse population of user needs, permitting the coexistence of of several device species that will occupy parallel niches. Under these conditions, I would not bet against Apple and the iPad, but see it as having a viable future. The Forbes piece on the Apple Store name change illustrates just how easy it is for pundits and Apple watchers, using overly simplistic analysis, to miss the significance and rationale of Apple’s decisions. This is not about aesthetics but a change in how Apple want to maximally exploit their interface with their client base, beyond mere shopping. The Guardian’s piece on the signature, ‘Sent from my iPhone’ reflects my own experience. In the beginning, I kept it simply to indicate that I was using an iPhone and not a Blackberry or other device, really as a lobbying tool to the IT wonks that they needed to accommodate other devices. Somewhere along the way, it became more of an disclaimer to my colleagues that I was working on the run with limited time. Still useful. Fascinating. Mark Lowenstein’s piece on Tech forgetting the Boomers is a nice diversion, but risks over generalisation. In my home, at least, I remain the tech source, even for my kids when they run into difficulty with their devices, network or apps. Admittedly, that may not be representative, but illustrative of the fact that much of this is driven, not by age, but by how intimately one engages the technology. Finally, Dan Moren is correct, Apple need to rethink iCloud, specifically in the context of their vision of a post-PC era that is device agnostic. September 4, 2016 at 9:03 EST PM John Martellaro September 8, 2016 daemon: I wasn’t referring to any kind of unfamiliarity with metric prefixes. I was, of course, talking about coping with complexity: computers with gigabytes of RAM (and operating systems with 75 million lines of code) and the need to reliably, consistently back up terabytes of data. This, combined with endless security issues, is a serious challenge for even modern, astute computer users. It’s overwhelming for many others. The Apple iPad solved that problem for many computer users. September 8, 2016 at 3:19 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

News of the update was first reported by Motherboard. The fix comes a week after Apple patched a similar vulnerability for iPhones, and the timing apparently is no coincidence: Apple credited digital rights group Citizen Lab and security software company Lookout with finding the now-fixed OS X vulnerability. Both were also at the center of last week’s iOS fix. Last week’s iPhone update was the result of an attempted hack directed against pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted for his work against human rights violations in the United Arab Emirates. Mansoor had received suspicious text messages attempting to trick him into installing malware on his device. The software in question, which would have allowed outsiders to hijack his phone and download data from it, has reportedly been developed by the NSO Group, a secretive Israeli surveillance company. The New York Times reported Friday that the NSO Group sells spyware like this to foreign governments for steep fees: Spying on 10 iPhone users costs up to $1.15 million. Most users will likely never be the subject to such targeted surveillance campaigns, but it’s still a good idea to update your computer immediately. After all, other rogue actors could exploit the same vulnerability. Apple made the latest patches available as part of its regular update process.

Photo / Getty Images Apple's legal defence against European Commission charges of improper tax avoidance is yet to be heard. But even based on the company's own reporting, Apple's claim that it has always paid all the taxes it owed is disingenuous. The recent ruling - forcing Ireland to hit the iPhone maker with 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes - throws harsh light on a long-standing practise that Apple described to investors but never stressed. Now it will be tested in the courts. Both Apple chief executive Tim Cook and chief financial officer Luca Maestri have angrily rebutted the European Commission's statement that Apple's effective tax rate in Ireland in 2014 was a mere 0.005 percent. Cook called it "total political crap." They claim Apple paid $400 million in Irish taxes that year. A careful reading of the statement, though, shows that the 0.005 per cent rate is only ascribed to one of Apple's Irish entities, Apple Sales International. Though Commissioner Margrethe Vestager got the headlines she wanted by stressing the miniscule figure, this line of discussion is a red herring. What does require scrutiny is how Apple's 26 per cent effective tax rate, which Cook keeps bringing up in his company's defence, is worked out. Apple's profit and loss statements for several recent years have indeed provided for about 26 percent of its pretax profits to be paid as income taxes. As often happens, the company didn't actually pay that much: On a cash basis, it has spent about 18 per cent of its pre-tax profit on taxes in the last three financial years. The rest of the expenses the company accounted for swelled the tax liability on its balance sheet. When its 2015 financial year ended, the company had a net deferred liability of $16.2 billion sitting on its books . Continued below. Related Content NZME scoops awards on both sides of Tasman Market Watch: Can the bull run last? Apple CEO Tim Cook faces his biggest challenge The income tax provision includes foreign taxes, which are calculated at a low effective rate. In its 2015 annual report, Apple said, for example, that 2014 foreign pre-tax earnings reached $33.6 billion, for which it made a $1.5 billion foreign tax provision. That's a 4.5 per cent effective rate on profits earned in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America; in there somewhere is the $400 million in payments to Ireland, the much smaller payments made in other European countries and the growing tax bills from China. The amount of unrecognised deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be $30.0 billion. That may seem to vindicate Vestager's charge of underpayment, but Cook wasn't wrong to say Vestager took her figure out of context. Apple makes a provision for US taxes on a portion of its foreign earnings, which it may at some point repatriate. Once it does so, it will have to shell out the difference between the US taxes due and the foreign ones already paid. In the meantime, the provision makes the effective tax rate on the US portion of Apple profits look outsized: 64.7 per cent in 2015 and 62.8 per cent in 2014. Those booked but not necessarily paid US taxes account for some of the difference between the tax amounts Apple carries on its profit and loss statement and the actual cash payments, and they explain the 26 per cent effective rate of which Cook boasts. But there is another, underwater part of Apple's tax iceberg on which the company doesn't even make a provision for US taxes, only for foreign ones at low rates. Apple says in its 2015 annual report: "Substantially all of the Company's undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the US were generated by subsidiaries organised in Ireland, which has a statutory tax rate of 12.5 per cent. As of September 26, 2015, US income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $91.5 billion of such earnings. The amount of unrecognised deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is estimated to be $30.0 billion." I think it's a desire to reallocate taxes that should be paid in the US to the EU. That's a 32.8 effective rate that Apple calculates it might face if it repatriated all the "indefinitely reinvested" profits, less than the US statutory rate of 35 per cent. Ostensibly, a provision for Irish taxes on the $91.5 billion in earnings has already been made -- but given Apple's outraged reaction to the European Commission's ruling, that may not be the case. Even before the Commission decision was published, Irish economist Seamus Coffey arrived at the approximate amount of back taxes the EU might force Ireland to extract from Apple. Applying Ireland's statutory tax rate, 12.5 per cent, to the profits of Apple Sales International from 2004 to 2013 gives about $14 billion. In effect, the European Commission is telling Apple to pay full Irish taxes, and not the single-digit rates that it provided for, on earnings it never planned to repatriate. "I think it's a desire to reallocate taxes that should be paid in the US to the EU," Cook told the Irish Independent. His company, however, did not make a provision for paying the taxes in the US - and made an insufficient one for paying in Ireland. Being forced to pay US taxes on these profits would be far more damaging, but Apple failed to plan for the potential that its special tax-minimising arrangement with the Irish government - one which allowed it to allocate substantial profits to a "head office" outside Ireland - would prove a contravention of EU law. When the Commission's decision was announced, many assumed - and Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan promised - to appeal it. Cook, too, has expressed hope that this would be the case. But the government has delayed a decision on the appeal: Some ministers doubt that Ireland was right in undertaxing Apple as it did, and the windfall would be welcome in a debt-ridden country hurt by years of post-crisis austerity. Apple will appeal the decision in any case. If it loses - that is, if courts decide that profits booked in Ireland should have been taxed there at the statutory rate or close to it so that all companies operating there get a level playing field - the US company will have to admit to investors that it had been overoptimistic on its tax provision. It has already admitted it indirectly by boosting its effective foreign tax rate to 6.1 per cent in 2015. Its tech peers such as Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Qualcomm and Cisco, which also have been accumulating untaxed or barely taxed profits overseas, now will need to look at their tax provisions, too, and decide if they are safe. Talk about European overreach is beside the point: It's not going to sway the courts, which will be more concerned with the issue of whether taxes were properly charged and paid. That's something that would take Apple some serious effort to prove. - Bloomberg> By Leonid Bershidsky Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Now, the same security threat reportedly affects Mac desktop and laptops as well. In response to the iPhone security threat, Apple rolled out a software update—the current 9.3.5 version—which would protect users from the undetectable virus. "The software leaves absolutely no indicators of compromise to the user," said Mike Murray, vice president of security research and response at mobile security firm Lookout, to Business Insider. Similar to its response to the iPhone vulnerability, Apple released an OSX update on Thursday that will protect Macs from the hacking software. Those with Apple desktop and laptop devices should download Security Update 2006–001 for El Capitan and Security Update 2006–005 for Yosemite, which will stop applications from revealing kernel memory. There is also a Safari 9.1.3 update for El Capitan, Yosemite, and OS X 10.9.5 Mavericks—this update takes care of the memory corruption issue that would leave devices vulnerable. Related Stories Why You Should Update Your iPhone — Now MacBook Pro 2016 To Come With 10Gb/s USB 3.1 As Revealed By macOS Sierra Code “Pegasus is the most sophisticated attack we’ve seen on any endpoint because it takes advantage of how integrated mobile devices are in our lives and the combination of features only available on mobile — always connected (WiFi, 3G/4G), voice communications, camera, email, messaging, GPS, passwords, and contact lists,” write Lookout and Citizen Lab, the security firms that first uncovered the iOS flaw, in a blog post. “It is modular to allow for customization and uses strong encryption to evade detection.” Users who have not updated their phone or computers should do so immediately and have likely received an auto-update prompt from Apple on their device. If the devices are not updates, consumers are at risk of letting their gadgets get remotely hacked. Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Fiji Time: 1:34 PM on Saturday 7 January Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Cook: Unjust ruling Reuters Saturday, September 03, 2016 OTHER multinationals which do not employ as extreme Irish tax schemes as Apple but shift profits via the country to tax havens could also be breaching EU rules, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday. She handed the iPhone maker a record 13 billion euro ($F26b) bill for Irish registered units that Dublin authorities accepted were liable to tax in no country on Tuesday. She told Reuters in an interview that other firms' arrangements, which involve routing profits to Irish registered subsidiaries tax resident in places such as Bermuda, might fall foul of the Commission on similar grounds. "Taxes have been paid nowhere due to the Irish tax code," she said. Asked if the bill would have been different if the head office of Apple's Irish unit been registered and paid tax in Bermuda, Ms Vestager said: "Not much." Ms Vestager said the core of the case against Apple was that it had an Irish registered company that booked most of the profits generated across Europe. However, since Ireland didn't deem the subsidiary tax resident there, the unit was able to report just a small taxable income at an Irish "branch". Apple's CEO Tim Cook and Washington have denounced the Commission ruling as an unjust raid on tax that should be paid in the US. Ms Vestager said if Washington chose to tax the profits reported by Apple's Irish operation, she would reduce her demand accordingly. The US could do this by forcing Apple to have its Irish units pay more in fees to Apple in California for the right to licence Apple patents.

Apple already offered some limited third-party integration with Siri through select partners like OpenTable, Yelp and Twitter, but the company has now more fully opened up its walled garden and provided iOS 10 developers with SiriKit, allowing them to build in the ability for users to interact with apps with their voices. The first third-party integrations were announced in a series of blog posts on Apple’s website and include Pinterest, Square Cash, WhatsApp and Uber. For instance, users can pull up Siri and say ‘Siri, take me home in an UberX,’ and a card from Uber pops up showing details and fair estimate. Siri handles the voice and natural language recognition, then extends the request to the app. These advancements come at a time when Apple is facing stiff competition in the field of AI assistants from Amazon’s Alexa, which has long been lauded for its openness to developers, to Google Assistant, which was announced in spring as a more complex evolution from Google Now.

The iPhone 7 will have 2GB of RAM like its predecessor, while the iPhone 7 Plus is going to be bumped up to 3GB of RAM. That’s what most reports claim, explaining that the features of the dual-lens camera that’ll be found on the phablet will require extra memory. But why isn’t Apple going for massive RAM upgrades as its biggest rivals? DON’T MISS: Official: Samsung recalls Galaxy Note 7 worldwide, announces replacement program Flagship Android devices ship with 4GB of RAM, while some device makers went for 6GB of memory inside a phone. One reason is that the iPhone probably doesn’t need as much memory. The iPhone 6s with its 2GB of RAM is still faster than the handsets with double or triple the memory because Apple does a great job at optimizing software performance. But one other reason is that RAM is pricey, and there’s only so much to go around. And Apple likes its money. A new report from DRAMeXchange says that RAM prices are going up as Apple has been ramping up demand for the iPhone. As such, other devices will suffer. "With the official launch of the next iPhone release on September 7, the entire smartphone supply chain is now under a critical period of intense stock-up activities." DRAMeXchange director Avril Wu said. “At the same time, there is still high demand for memory components from Chinese smartphone brands, so both the DRAM and NAND Flash markets are experiencing tight supply.” It looks like Apple is carefully planning its RAM consumption. iPhone RAM demand is driving up prices, something Apple doesn’t want from suppliers. So Apple is probably more interested in making the iPhone 7 perform better without increase the amount of RAM, if there’s no reason to do it. The report says that demand for servers has also heated up recently, becoming one other factor that explains DRAM price increases, which means PC RAM supply has also tightened.

Home / Models / 7-series / BMW’s Apple CarPlay shouldn’t be an additional… BMW’s Apple CarPlay shouldn’t be an additional option 7-series, News | September 2nd, 2016 by Nico DeMattia 32 Tweet BMW is trying to cement itself as the world’s most technologically advanced automotive brand. With new technologies from Carbon Core chassis tech to the new … BMW is trying to cement itself as the world’s most technologically advanced automotive brand. With new technologies from Carbon Core chassis tech to the new 7 Series’ Remote Parking feature and Gesture Control, the Bavarians are pushing technology more than ever before. One of the brand’s newest features is Apple CarPlay compatibility. This is popular among millennials who want their cars to basically just be extensions of their smart phones. Apple CarPlay is relatively new to the automotive world, at the moment. Not every automaker has its compatibility just yet, but almost all are working on it. BMW does offer CarPlay compatibility in each and every model, which is a nice feature. However, what’s not so nice is that it’s an additional option, one that costs $300. Frankly, that’s ridiculous and shouldn’t cost an additional penny on any model. BMW already gets quite a bit of criticism for not offering some basic technology features as standard, such as a back-up camera or heated seats. There are some KIAs that come with those features as-standard and cost less than half the price of the average BMW. So BMW’s penny-pinching is well-documented at this point. However, Apple CarPlay being an additional, $300 option is frankly insulting to buyers. Apple CarPlay in an Audi A3 It’s not even the actual cost that’s bothersome, as a $300 option for a BMW is basically nothing. However, CarPlay is a bit of software and should be standard on all BMWs, without question. The real kicker? It’s still a $300 option on the BMW 7 Series. I jumped on BMW’s online editor today to build my own Alpina B7 just for fun and noticed that CarPlay was still an additional option. If you didn’t already know, the Alpina B7 wears a starting sticker price of $137,000(!). Surely, for that money, BMW and Alpina can find a way to throw in Apple CarPlay. This sort of penny-pinching is giving the brand a bad reputation. Frugality is one thing, being downright cheap is another. This is the sort of bean-counting that General Motors is known for and should be beneath a brand like BMW. Admittedly, if I were buying a new BMW, I’d probably still check the box and buy the damn CarPlay, but I’d bitch and moan about it like a 75-year old man complains about how back in his day, an ice cream cone was only a nickle. It’s frankly outrageous that BMW can charge an additional cost for a bit of software on a car that is already lacking features Korean hatchbacks come with as standard equipment. Hell, those Korean hatchbacks come with Apple CarPlay as-standard. I can understand (more like keep quiet about) cars like the BMW 230i  and 320i not having CarPlay as-standard, being that those are the bargain models that come with little equipment. But on anything else, especially a 7 Series? That’s ludicrous. So, BMW, please make features like Apple CarPlay standard equipment in the future, or at least a no-cost option.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers   skip to main content skip to main menu     What we’re expecting from Apple’s September 7 event By Christian Zibreg, Sep 2, 2016 Tweet 8 Comments Apple is hosting a special media event on September 7 at San Francisco’s Bill Graham Civic Auditorium at 10am PT. As always, we’ll be covering the latest in Apple’s big fall refresh thoroughly here at iDB. Of course, the iPhone 7 will be the event’s biggest story, but we’re also hoping to see other hardware refreshes, accessories and related products come into full view next Wednesday. Here’s everything we think Apple could introduce come September 7, plus some of the things we’d like them to announce but they probably won’t (yet). iPhone 7 Expectations for Apple’s iPhone refresh are tepid as the forthcoming phone appears to be an incremental upgrade versus the iPhone 6s. The biggest visual difference: updated antenna lines on the backside, now visible only at the top and bottom edges of the device. Aside from the subdued antenna seams, the iPhone 7 is thought to borrow the industrial design that Apple has used for the past two years, making the new phones virtually indistinguishable at first glance from the iPhone 6/6s design. On the inside, however, the iPhone 7 is said to pack in more improvements than meets the eye. An Apple-designed ‘A10’ system-on-a-chip fabbed on TSMC’s ten-nanometer process will speed up CPU and GPU performance versus last year’s A9 chip inside the iPhone 6s, while consuming less power. Furthermore, the A10 will probably integrate an embedded ‘M10’ motion coprocessor that may for may not draw less power in ‘Hey Siri’ mode while potentially powering new tracking features. The 4.7-inch iPhone 7 is said to include two gigabytes of LPDDR4 RAM (like the iPhone 6s) while the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus could use three gigabytes of RAM due to its dual-lens camera processing more data. Both phones may come with a slightly larger earpiece and relocated proximity sensor. The new phones are said to be outfitted with stronger batteries. That said, it’s unclear if more juice will equal extended run time but even the modest improvement in that regard will be much appreciated. The iPhone 7 range should have the same display resolution as Apple’s current Retina and Retina HD screens on the iPhone 6/6s and iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus. The back cameras are said to be better, with the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus getting a dual-lens camera system allowing for better low-light performance and features like true optical zoom and more accurate colors while the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 is said to gain optical image stabilization. For what it’s worth, we’re not expecting any increase in megapixels, but that protruding lens should be more bearable thanks to the cameras’ curved design. Both phones are thought to have a non-moving digital Home button with haptic feedback. The headphone jack is widely expected to disappear from the next iPhone—but, it’s not clear whether or not the removal of the 3.5mm analog audio port paves the way for stereo speakers. Even without the 3.55mm jack, the iPhone 7 will support Bluetooth headphones and wired ones based on Lightning I/O. Dubious iPhone 7 packaging photos have indicated that the handset could ship with a wireless version of Apple’s EarPods, likely to be called AirPods Wireless Earphones, and a 3.5mm to Lightning adapter so that folks can connect their “legacy” headphones to the iPhone 7 without buying a standalone adapter. We believe the phones will start out at 32 gigabytes of storage as Apple finally kills off the oft-criticized 16GB iPhone tier. A model with 256 gigabytes of storage is in the cards, too, providing twice as much on-device storage versus current 128GB iPhones. When it comes to the finishes, some new colorways might join, or replace some of Apple’s current Gold, Rose Gold, Silver and Space Gray options. These might include a Darth Vader-like Glossy Black and either a Deep Blue or an Apple Watch Space Black-like Space Black colorway. The Cupertino firm should begin taking pre-orders for the iPhone 7 on Friday, September 9, with shipments probably commencing two weeks later on September 25. As is Apple’s won’t, we’re not expecting a price increase for the new iPhones: the iPhone 7 should cost the same as the iPhone 6s. And by the time the latest iPhones arrive, the iPhone 6s and older models (but not the already affordable iPhone SE) should see their prices slashed. Apple Watch 2 It’s been nearly a year and a half since the original Apple Watch debuted in April 2015 so it’s obvious that Apple’s wearable is not on the same annual refresh cycle as iPhones and iPads are. Be that as it may, we think the September 7 event could also serve as a launchpad for a second-generation Apple Watch 2—more so given the Apple Watch 2 will still require an iPhone to function. Most of use here at iDownloadBlog are in agreement that the Apple Watch 2 will run Apple’s ‘S2’ chip built on TSMC’s 16-nanometer process, have a thinner and lighter display and a bigger battery potentially giving it a few more hours of run time. We’re also pretty sure the gizmo will be more waterproof than the original device, track swimming and provide more accurate workout readings without its paired iPhone thanks to the included GPS. New sensors (like barometer for improved elevation and geolocation capabilities) could also be in the offing. There are some things we think didn’t make the cut for the second-generation refresh of the Apple Watch, namely such features as a built-in FaceTime camera (who cares? videoconferencing from the wrist doesn’t seem like a must-have feature), a sharper screen (it’s already sharp) or LTE connectivity (because cellular data transfers deplete most tiny smartwatch batteries far too quickly). Some new bands in a plethora of colors/materials, you say. Definitely possible, we say. If you believe analysts, the original Apple Watch could also be updated with a faster S2 chip and slightly improved waterproofing, but don’t expect any visible changes to its form factor or appearance. iPads Reports of the iPad’s fall refresh are inconclusive and sketchy, at best. Some sources have called for a second-generation iPad Pro along with a third-generation iPad Air in September. Others have claimed that Apple won’t be updating its tablet lineup before 2017. As there has been virtually no iPad-related leaks in the past few months, it is our speculation that any new iPads would deserve a separate event in October (less likely) or in Spring 2017 (definitely more likely). For what it’s worth, perhaps the most reliable Apple analyst out there, Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, recently predicted that 2017 will be the year of a brand new 10.5-inch iPad Pro model, a second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a low-cost 9.7-inch iPad. New Macs Most of the Macs sold, especially the three-years-old Mac Pro, are ripe for a refresh. We think there’s a reasonable likelihood that we’ll see some new Macs announced at the iPhone 7 presser. That’s mainly due to some solid sources stating Apple no longer wishes to hold two events in the fall—iPhones in September, with iPads, Macs and other related hardware like the Apple TV in October. No matter how you look at it, Apple will disservice fans by delaying new Macs into 2017. The key issue potentially holding back new Macs: Intel. As the world has witnessed, Skylake chips have been plagued with reliability issues related to overheating so good thing Apple hasn’t bet on the SkyLake platform. Earlier this week, however, Intel announced first Y and U-series chips based on a seventh-generation Core architecture code-named Kaby Lake. These new chips would be perfect for Mac notebooks and iMacs (their desktop counterparts won’t be available in volume until 2017). Due to these uncertainties and Intel’s increasingly unreliable roadmap, we really cannot predict whether new Mac hardware built around these processors could get unveiled this or next month, or in 2017. If you asked us to speculate, we’d say Apple could get away with giving us a glimpse of some of the upgraded Mac systems (like notebooks) at the September 7 event. Such a move would be similar to how the company previewed the overhauled Mac Pro in the summer of 2013. Apple could then advertise any previewed new Macs with a vague “late 2016” or “early 2017” shipping date and collect pre-orders ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season. The refreshed Mac lineup most certainly includes new versions of the all-in-one iMac desktop and the MacBook Pro which should gain latest Intel chips, upgrade graphics, a thinner industrial design akin to the 12-inch MacBook, USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports and that programmable OLED touch strip above the keyboard. Will Apple refresh the MacBook Air notebooks? If so, we only expect modest upgrades to bring the Air’s hardware up to date with features like Intel’s new chips and USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports. A Retina-capable display, an even thinner and lighter appearance and other major hardware undertakings are probably out of the question as most people believe Apple’s been phasing out the Air in favor of the new MacBook for some time now. Credible sources mention the possibility of a standalone monitor with 5K Retina resolution, created in collaboration with LG Electronics. If such product is in the pipeline, I’m wondering if it’ll be branded as a Thunderbolt Display or an LG monitor. The Mac Pro remains the biggest mystery in Apple’s Mac lineup. That machine was awesome back when it launched, but now Apple continues to sell the three-year-old Mac Pro hardware with previous-generation graphics at the same (high) price points, so something’s gotta give here. I want to believe that Apple will continue to cater to creative professionals with powerful Mac desktops like the Mac Pro. And if they’re building a 5K monitor in cooperation with LG, then the Mac Pro’s future is probably assured. Almost forgot: what’s up with the Mac mini? I hope Apple won’t kill of the Mac mini, its most affordable BYODMK (Bring Your Own Display, Mouse and Keyboard) desktop computer because people have been using this unassuming little system to power anything from home offices to media centers to hosting services. Software, Beats & more Apple’s currently tentative release date for iOS 10, macOS Sierra, watchOS 3 and tvOS 10 is “fall”, but we’ll be undoubtedly given exact release dates during the iPhone 7 event. Just don’t expect these software updates to drop simultaneously—if past is any indication, iOS 10 will release for public consumption a few days before first iPhone 7 units start shipping to customers. We totally think a selection of new Beats by Dre products will be unveiled on September 7 (thanks, Apple PR!). Who knows—Apple could even rebrand its existing headphone lineup under the Beats moniker (not very likely, but still a tantalizing marketing opportunity). We know this is a stretch—and I’m putting it mildly—but with the next MacBook Pro getting an OLED touch bar who’s to say that Apple’s wireless keyboard won’t be getting the same treatment? On the other hand, if there’s indeed something like an Apple Wireless Keyboard With OLED Touch Bar in the works, Apple could quietly announce it with a press release and a website refresh. One more thing… On top of all of the above, Apple could surprise us with a One More Thing moment that no one saw coming. To be honest with you, we’re not keeping our fingers crossed for any surprise announcements because in this day and age of 24/7 news cycle and Apple’s ever-expanding footprint around the world it’s become nearly impossible for them to prevent leaks. And that, boys and girls, concludes our roundup of everything we expect would get announced on September 7. We want to hear your predictions regarding Apple’s big event.

Alan Freeman Published Friday, September 2nd, 2016 Written by Alan Freeman Published Friday, September 2nd, 2016 Economy Facebook Twitter Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks at an event to announce new products at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., March 21, 2016. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Spare a charitable thought for Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple. He has none of the charisma of Steve Jobs and doesn’t look as good in a black turtleneck. In fact, he doesn’t even try. And though Apple may still be the largest corporation in the world in market capitalization terms, it’s been going through some ‘tough’ times recently. Sales of iPhones and Mac computers are down and the stock price is off by 4 per cent over the past year. (Mind you, that hasn’t stopped Tim Cook from raking in US$373 million in Apple stock bonuses since 2011.) Then, out of the blue, the European Commission accused Apple of exploiting illegal state subsidies from the government of Ireland in the form of an amazing tax deal. Apple, not playing by the rules? Inconceivable. The Commission, spurred by a U.S. Senate investigation of Apple’s global tax practices in 2013 that found Apple had avoided paying billions in taxes through a complex web of international subsidiaries, conducted a three-year investigation of its own into how Apple had organized its affairs in Europe. What they found turned out to be quite a sweet deal. Under the arrangement, all Apple sales outside North and South America are channeled through subsidiaries based in Ireland, where the corporate tax rate is a bargain 12.5 per cent. The U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 per cent. One estimate says that 90 per cent of Apple’s foreign profits are moved through Ireland. So Apple has been able to shift billions of dollars of sales and profits to Cork in Ireland, rather than pay taxes in the countries where their products are actually sold. Apple wasn’t satisfied with paying 12.5 per cent, though, so it cooked up a deal with the Irish government which has allowed it to avoid virtually all corporate taxes. According to the Commission, Apple paid just 1 per cent of its European profits in taxes in 2003 and an infinitesimal 0.005 per cent in 2014. One of the Irish subsidiaries, Apple Sales International, made a profit of 16 billion euros in 2011 — but most of the funds were allocated to its supposed head office, which had no employees, no premises and no activity. The Commission said that this arrangement amounted to an illegal state subsidy and ordered the Irish government to collect 13 billion Euros worth of back taxes, plus interest, from Apple. The Irish government, anxious to preserve its reputation as a tax haven (particularly for multinational technology firms), is appealing. Apple’s Cook can’t believe the inequity of it all. “It’s maddening. It’s disappointing. It’s clear that this comes from a political place.” Apple is fundamentally no different than the railway and steel monopolists of a century ago. What’s infuriating is its habit of insisting that it plays on a higher moral ground. Apple, like all corporations, aims to make as much money as it can, and pay as little in tax as it can get away with. The company’s executives may dress casually, it may sponsor hip advertising and fabulous design, but it’s fundamentally no different than the railway and steel monopolists of a century ago. If only they would admit it. What’s infuriating about Apple and Tim Cook is their habit of insisting that they’re playing on a higher moral ground. “When you’re accused of doing something that is so foreign to your values, it brings out an outrage in you, and that’s how we feel,” Cook said this week. “Apple has always been about doing the right thing. We haven’t done anything wrong and the Irish government hasn’t done anything wrong.” Now, we’ve all been told by accountants and lawyers that tax avoidance is legal while tax evasion isn’t — but what Apple and its ilk are doing is taking advantage of every possible loophole and extracting every concession they can from governments to make sure they pay as little as possible in taxes. Is that “doing the right thing”? As of June, Apple was sitting on $215 billion in cash and assets outside the U.S., where the money can remain tax-free indefinitely as long as it’s not brought home. Cook says he would love to return at least some of this money to the United States — but he doesn’t want to pay the 35 per cent tax rate. “I don’t think that would be a reasonable thing to do,” says Cook. So rather than paying taxes, like we all do, he’s apparently waiting for an amnesty or a special deal from Congress. Is that doing the right thing? In a luscious piece of irony, the U.S. Treasury has come to Apple’s defence, complaining that the European move against Apple will “undermine foreign investment, the business climate, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the European Union.” In fact, what the U.S. is really worried about is the Europeans grabbing the Apple tax money first. “The royalties Apple collects for its overseas sales of products designed and developed in the U.S. should be taxed in the U.S,” says Carl Levin, a former U.S. senator who has been highly critical of Apple’s use of tax havens. The truth of the matter is that multinationals like Apple have been playing governments off each other for years in the quest for tax breaks and subsidies. We do it in Canada, using government grants to compete with U.S. states for new auto assembly plants, or giving generous tax breaks to companies in the video gaming industry. And we tout our lower corporate tax rates as an incentive for companies to set up shop in Canada — companies like Valeant, the pharmaceutical giant that’s run out of New Jersey but based for tax purposes in Laval, QC. There are hopeful signs, however, that times are changing — that governments have finally woken up to the fact that they’re being taken for a ride. Hillary Clinton has called for measures to penalize tax inversions, where U.S. corporations turn themselves into foreign corporations to benefit from lower tax rates. And spurred by the G20, the Organization for International Cooperation and Development (OECD) is shepherding discussions on what’s called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. That refers to tax planning that exploits gaps in tax rates, allowing corporate profits to be artificially moved to low-tax (or no-tax) jurisdictions where there’s little or no economic activity. So far, 85 countries have signed up for the talks, including Canada, the U.S. and Ireland. It will still take years but — eventually — even Apple may have to start paying up.

Now, ahead of the September 7 event, it appears that nearly all stainless steel Apple Watch models are sold out online, with limited supply in store. Only one model of the stainless steel Apple Watch is available on line and seven aluminum Apple Watch Sport models. This could indicate some Apple Watch news at Apple’s September 7 event. We’re expecting a new Apple Watch to be announced during the event, with a faster processor and an embedded GPS chip for Maps and Workouts. Low Apple Watch inventory could indicate Apple will launch the device several weeks earlier than expected. Apple Watch Sport has more availability than the stainless steel Apple Watch. Out of the 16 available stainless steel models, only one is available to order. While seven out of the Apple Watch Sport models are sold out. Still, this leaves fifteen models still available for delivery. This could suggest that the first-generation Appel Watch will only be available in the Sport configuration while the stainless steel (and presumably the Apple Watch Edition), will be phased out and be available only for the second-generation Watch. It’s also worth considering that a report from KGI believes that Apple will launch a slightly faster, modified version of the Apple Watch 1 alongside the new Apple Watch 2. Don’t forget to tune in on September 7 at 10 AM PT to Todays iPhone as we will be covering the event as it happens.

The Commission’s ruling this week that the US tech giant must pay up to €13 billion (RM59.3 billion) to Dublin has angered Washington, which accuses the EU of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the US government. With transatlantic tensions rising, the White House said President Barack Obama would raise the issue of tax avoidance by some multinational corporations at a summit of the G20 leading economies in China this weekend. Paradoxically, Ireland is determined not to receive the tax windfall, which would be equivalent to what it spent last year on funding its struggling health service. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the European Union began investigating Apple’s Irish tax affairs in 2014, arguing that it had to protect a tax regime that has attracted large numbers of multinational employers. On Wednesday, he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers, whose support is vital for the minority government, to agree to fight the ruling by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager that Apple’s low tax arrangements in Ireland constitute illegal state aid. However, he won them over at a second attempt when the cabinet met today. Apple, keen to defend its own interests, has already said it will lodge an appeal. For Fine Gael, the main Irish coalition party, a broader principle is at stake. It wants to take on Brussels to safeguard Ireland’s decades-old low corporate tax policy that has drawn in multinationals such as Apple, creating one in 10 jobs in what was once an impoverished country. A fair rate of tax The Independent Alliance, a group of five lawmakers, fell in line after the coalition agreed to conduct a review of what tax multinationals pay and what should they pay. Transport Minister Shane Ross, an Alliance member, defended Apple up to a point. “I think they were acting legally. What they were doing was making use of extraordinary loopholes that existed there,” he told reporters. “Multinationals provide absolutely vital jobs to the economy... (but) multinationals should pay a fair rate of tax in Ireland.” A failure of the Alliance to come on board would have cast doubt on the government’s survival prospects. Dublin has just over two months to lodge an appeal. A government spokesman said the issue would go to parliament on Wednesday next week. The main opposition party, Fianna Fail, also favours challenging Brussels, so the government should easily win the Dail’s backing to fight what is by far the largest anti-competition measure imposed on a company by the EU. Some Irish voters are astounded that the government might turn down the money, and the left-wing Sinn Fein party has led attacks from the opposition. Apple was found to be holding over US$181 billion (RM739.7 billion) in accumulated profits offshore, more than any US company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning nonprofit groups, a policy critic say is designed to avoid paying U.S taxes. But Apple chief executive Tim Cook has said part of the company’s 2014 tax bill would be paid next year when the company repatriates offshore profits to the United States. Obama to take the lead The US government is keen to ensure that it, and not Ireland, gets the revenue. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said leaders of the G20 developed and emerging economies would tackle the wider issue when they meet in the Chinese city of Hangzhou on Sunday and Monday. “The president will... lead the discussion at the G20 about combating tax avoidance strategies that are implemented by some multinational corporations,” Earnest said. “We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair — more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States.” A number of G20 governments are worried about how multinationals move profits around so they end up getting taxed in a country that has very low corporate rates. Last year the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development unveiled new measures to tackle corporate tax avoidance. A number of countries have moved to implement some of them measures, but the United States has not. It needs to change its own tax rules which, for example, allow companies to build up tax-free profits offshore. However, Congress has struggled for years to agree such reforms. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Ford plant turns ‘cemetery’ as Trump wrenches Mexican autos Stocks, dollar recover ground after US jobs report Rising REITs back bets on stronger economy US stocks little changed on mixed jobs report China could keep reserves near US$3t to avoid alarm BMI Research: Things will get worse for the Malaysian ringgit World’s highest-paid expats toil in land of fondue and watches Ringgit to stay under pressure on US interest rate rise Trump tweets GM should make Cruze model in US or pay tax Sterling hits two-week high vs euro after strong manufacturing PMI Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Multiple people dead in Florida airport shooting Jason Momoa stars in ‘Frontier’ Reuters Video: Trump orders Obama's envoys out by inauguration day Reuters Video: Nunes stuns challenger Rousey with first-round title win Reuters Video: Man survives Turkey nightclub attack by pretending to be dead HD video of earth from space will make your heart ache Related Articles Apple appeals landmark EU tax ruling Ireland accuses EU of exceeding power in Apple tax case Starbucks brews up a tax storm as Apple gets set to battle EU EU countries demand slice of Apple tax bonanza Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

E i grandi flop INTERVIEW Milano, 2 settembre 2016 - 22:06 “Taxation is a global issue, but Europe’s approach is wrong” Top manager says that retroactive legislation is a deathblow to legal certainty and investments di Federico Fubini di gli argomenti MI INTERESSA A-A+ shadow totale voti 0 1 0 Da Guardare Evidenzia onoff Stampa Listen Email Luca Maestri, 52 from Rome, Apple’s chief financial officer, is so crucial for the company that last year he earned over twice as much as CEO Tim Cook. He shared his views on the phone from Cupertino, describing how the news of Apple’s tax bill was taken in the United States: “A money grab, a subtraction of money by the European Union.” EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager said that if she only had to pay taxes of 0.005% on her earnings, like you, maybe she would check her income tax return. “Sure.” How does it make you feel? “Apple pays taxes all over the world; it pays them in every country in which we sell to consumers. We also pay taxes in Ireland, since some of our management activities for a series of international markets are based there. We also pay large sums in the United States, because the United States fiscal system has a global reach. They don’t have a territorial system like Italy. Basically, we are the largest taxpayer in the world, by far, and also the largest in the United States. And we believe we are the largest taxpayer in Ireland too. But this doesn’t come across in Vestager’s analysis.” Can you be more specific? “You talk about tax rates of 0.005% in 2014. Well, in 2014 Apple paid $400 million in Ireland. We believe it is the largest payment made by any company there that year. We also paid $400 million in the United States, and set aside billions for the additional payments that we will have to make when we transfer funds to America. But to go back to Ireland: our income there is subject to the standard rate in the country, 12.5%, which applies to all businesses.” The European Commission argues that you enjoy a so-called “ruling”, an ad hoc special arrangement that allows you to pay less. Is that how they came up with the figure of 0.005%? ”I don’t know how they arrived at this figure, but you can only imagine or come up with it if you completely disregard how fiscal legislation works in Ireland and the United States. You can do it intentionally, or because you don’t know, but you really have to ignore the legal reality to come up with such figures.” Can you clarify? “Vestager says that we have profits that are not taxed anywhere. This isn’t true. Much of the income that we generate around the world is taxed in the United States, and at a very high rate, since companies pay 35% as standard, in addition to state taxes. The total comes close to 40%.” If your revenue is generated in Europe, why do you pay taxes in the USA? “Because we create our intellectual property here in California, in terms of research and development, industrial design and innovation.” You said that in 2014 you paid 400 million in the US and 400 million in Ireland. But Ireland’s economy is eighty times smaller. Did you move the income from the rest of Europe there? “When we trade in France, Italy or Spain, we pay income tax in those countries, related to our business activities there, which essentially involve the distribution and sale of our products. We pay other taxes in Ireland, because we have operations there such as procurement, logistics, distribution, supply and demand management. But most of our taxes are paid in the US.” Is the real issue the transfer of revenue and tax residency between countries? “I think that the Commission’s issue is precisely this. Not on how much tax Apple pays, but on where it should be paid.” Do you not think that Brussels has a point? “We raise a very simple point, both regarding the level of taxation and the countries where it is paid. Some say we should pay more, some say less, some say everything in the United States, some elsewhere. I think these are issues that should be discussed as part of a legislative process. The rate must be decided within each European country, between citizens and the government. As to where the taxes are to be paid, there are already excellent international organizations that deal with this, such as the OECD. These things can be handled within the legislative process. Companies will adapt.” Are you saying that you are prepared to discuss “profit shifting”, the transfer of income between countries, but that EU rules on state aid are not the solution? “Absolutely, yes. These are issues that are worth discussing, and we are in favour of a simple, internationally aligned tax system. We would comply with such a system if it were the outcome of a legislative process. But we cannot accept this attempt to retroactively change existing laws simply because someone doesn’t like Irish legislation and wishes it were different. This would mean the end of legal certainty, and would be a huge problem for Europe.” You must realize that the EU Commission has executive powers over State aid. “As a European I’m very sorry about what is happening. Apart from our reputation, which we will defend, the real damage is to the European economy. Believe me, there are currently companies in Europe, the United States and Asia who are wondering how they can manage risks related to the EU taxation system in the absence of legal certainty. These risks are difficult to accept, and impossible to manage.” Do you at least acknowledge that you have received favorable treatment in Ireland? “We set up there in 1980. In 1991 and 2007 we asked the Irish tax authorities to explain exactly how to operate in the country and how to comply with local fiscal regulations. This is our normal procedure, especially when legislation changes. But whatever tax status was applied to us was also available to other companies.” Don’t you find it strange that many ordinary citizens pay higher tax rates than Apple or Google? “There’s an issue regarding international company taxation. The systems are not aligned, and this creates tensions. Our case in Europe is a perfect example. But it is also true that Apple is the largest taxpayer in the world. In 2014 we paid 26.1% tax on our revenues, and 26.5% in 2015. In the business world, these rates are actually some of the highest.

(Reuters) MIDWAY ATOLL: The White House says President Barack Obama will lead a discussion of tax avoidance, spurred by the European Union’s recent decision about Apple, during the G20 summit of major economies. Obama arrives Saturday in China for the Group of 20 meeting. White House spokesman Josh Earnest says there’s a need to address the problem of eroding tax bases in a way that’s fair to companies. He says the approach needs to be consistent and globally coordinated, rather than unilateral action by individual countries. Earnest says the issue is highly technical and the US doesn’t expect a major breakthrough during the G20. The long-running debate escalated sharply earlier this week when the EU ordered Apple to pay Ireland $14.5 billion in back taxes, plus interest. Ireland’s Cabinet has meanwhile agreed to join Apple in appealing against a multi-billion-euro back tax demand that the European Commission has slapped on the iPhone maker, despite misgivings among independents who back the fragile coalition. A government spokesman said that following the cabinet’s decision, it would ask parliament to endorse the legal challenge on Wednesday next week. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the European Union began investigating the US tech giant’s Irish tax affairs in 2014, arguing that it had to protect a tax regime that has attracted large numbers of multinational employers. But at an earlier Cabinet meeting on Wednesday he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers, whose support is vital for the minority government, to agree to fight the ruling that Apple must pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in tax to Dublin. Ireland’s main opposition party, Fianna Fail, also favors challenging Brussels.  The government should therefore easily win parliamentary support to appeal against European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s ruling that Apple’s low tax arrangements in Ireland constitutes illegal state aid. Apple, anxious to defend its own interests, has already said it will lodge an appeal.  Apple CEO Tim Cook warned that if the Dublin government did not join it in appealing, this would send the wrong message to business in a country whose economic model depends in part on companies like his.  Facebook STAY CONNECTED Follow @Arab_News Tweets by @Arab_News Download The App!

This jailbreak allows Apple TV 4 owners running tvOS 9.0 and 9.0.1 to jailbreak their devices. Although it is possible to jailbreak the Apple TV with a paid developer account, it’s also possible to do so with a free account as well. In this tutorial, we’ll show you step by step how to jailbreak the Apple TV 4. Watch our video walkthrough inside to see how. Also, the current Apple TV 4 jailbreak is GUI-less at this time, meaning that only SSH access is available. This means that currently no Cydia-like interface is available for jailbroken Apple TV 4 units. That said, this is only the beginning. Before starting you will need to login Xcode with an Apple ID that has sideloading privileges. You can get this for free by visiting the Apple developer member center and agreeing to the terms. To login to Xcode, go to Xcode → Preferences → Accounts and click the ‘+’ sign. Pangu’s post implies that you will need a paid developer account, although our tutorial shows you how to do so for free. It is our understanding that the jailbreak will still work as we’ve outlined below using our free method, but we are not responsible for any negative side effects that using this method will have. Things you will need An Apple TV running tvOS 9.0 or 9.0.1 A USB-C cable Xcode A Mac A free Apple ID account with sideloading privileges Pangu jailbreak tool iOS App Signer How to jailbreak the Apple TV 4 Step 1: Connect your Apple TV to your Mac using the USB-C cable. Step 2: If you haven’t already, disable Automatic Updates on your Apple TV. Go to Settings → System → Software Updates and turn off Automatically Update. Step 3: Download the Pangu jailbreak tool and iOS App Signer ZIP files and extract both to your desktop. Step 4: Open Xcode and go to File → New → Project → tvOS → Application → Single View Application → Next. Step 5: Fill out the following fields Product Name: Jailbreak Organization: <Your name> Organization Identifier: com.jailbreak.appletv Keep everything else as is, and click Next → Create. Video walkthrough Step 6: Click Product → Destination → Apple TV. Step 7: In the team area, select your personal Apple ID. If you don’t have one, you’ll need to create a free Apple ID, and link it to Xcode via Xcode → Preferences → Accounts. Step 8: Click Fix issue to clear up any provisioning issues. Step 9: Launch iOS App Signer and use the Browse button to select the atvipa.app file from the Payload folder in the Pangu download that you extracted to your desktop in Step 3. Step 10: In iOS App Signer, select the Certificate and Provisioning Profile for the app that you just created in Xcode. Step 11: Click Start on iOS App Signer, select Desktop and click Save to save the atvipa.ipa file to your desktop. Step 12: Open Xcode and go to Window → Devices and select your Apple TV. Step 13: Click the + button under Installed apps, and select the atvipa.ipa from your desktop. Step 14: The Pangu jailbreak tool should now be deployed to your Apple TV. Once it appears on your Apple TV’s Home screen, launch the app to initiate and complete the jailbreak. Step 15: Congratulations. You can now SSH into your Apple TV  using the Apple TV’s Wi-Fi IP address. Keep in mind that Pangu’s method uses a paid dev account. There could possibly be a reason for them taking this approach, which I hope that they comment on later. With that said, this method does work as far as being able to SSH into my Apple TV. Whether or not there are any downsides by using the free method is still yet to be seen. If you’re looking for an Apple TV running iOS 9.0.x, be sure to check out our Apple TV 4 jailbreak preparation tutorial for details on how to do just that. Otherwise, stay tuned for more coverage relating to this exciting new release. How to fix the Apple TV 4 black screen of death Some users have complained about being stuck in a black screen reboot loop after jailbreaking the Apple TV 4. This, as it turns out, can be easily fixed by a few simple SSH commands. Step 1: Turn on your Apple TV Step 2: Open Terminal Step 3: Type the following in the Terminal window: ssh root@<ip address of apple tv> (password = alpine) wget http://nitosoft.com/ATV4/fixBoot.sh chmod +x fixBoot.sh ./fixBoot.sh This will run the following commands automatically upon startup, which resolves the issue: launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mobile.lockdown.plist launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mobile.lockdown.plist This, as was discovered by @nitoTV and Morpheus______.

Several months later, Apple seems to have acknowledged the issue and launched a Quality Program to replace affected users’  hardware. The Staingate Facebook page now includes many reports of people successfully sending their MacBooks in for repair at Apple Stores. The existence of the program was first reported by MacRumors. In general, though, it seems Apple is trying to keep news of the problem quiet. There is no public acknowledgement of such a program existing on Apple’s website. Apple is contacting people who have reported the problem earlier in the year and were turned away, however. If you have problems like those shown in the picture above (although that’s an extreme case), you should now be able to take your laptop to the Apple Store for a straightforward repair. AppleCare coverage is not necessarily required with several people successfully getting screen repairs/replacements who are officially out of warranty. If you believe you are affected by this problem, call Apple Support or visit an Apple Store or authorized reseller for support.

As usual, the morons look like morons. Also, Apple trying to keep this quiet is pretty shitty. LikeLiked by 4 people srgmac - 1 year ago Reply Just like they did with bendgate, despite Apple changing the design this year — not the form factor itself at all, just the strength of the alloy so it would no longer bend. If it was a made up problem, then why change it? People have blinders on…brand loyalty is such a ridiculous concept I don’t even know where to start. They are making billions of dollars — what do you owe them? They’re not paying you to write comments saying how awesome they are…If you’re happy with Apple stuff (as I often am), then cool — but don’t go all buck wild and try to have sex with your iPhone and masturbate to pics of Tim Cook…realize that from time to time, they screw up, and sometimes in a big way. My 13″ retina has burn in / ghosting issues that showed up just as the warranty expired. It is now extremely awful — I am now forced to keep the brightness down all the time — turning it up to even 80% produces burn in within 5 minutes– and a new display would cost so much I would be better off just buying a new laptop all together. I wish Apple would fix mine for free — I doubt they would though. But wait, I know, I’m imagining this problem, it’s made up, it’s not Apple’s fault…right. LikeLiked by 2 people Charlypollo - 1 year ago Reply I remember perfectly that comment section, saying stupid things like “probably you don’t take care of your stuff as you should”.

LikeLike Drew (@gettysburg11s) - 1 year ago Reply As everyone with a brain knows, Apple will take care of any quality control issues with your purchase. Also, real journalists done add -gate on the end of anything that want to be a scandal, so they can get more clicks. Only bloggers seems to do this. It makes you wonder if they read history. Watergate was so named, because the crime took place at the Watergate hotel. So, its moronic to call any Apple issues -gate. LikeLiked by 2 people mashdots - 1 year ago Reply I agree with you. Also, I agree with your point about the -gate suffix. It’s annoying and as terrible as over-sensationalized article titles. I wish authors in the media would blog and create with a little more integrity. LikeLike srgmac - 1 year ago I am going to have to disagree with you here — for one, 9to5Mac didn’t make this up — it started originally with antennagate I believe, and when Jobs himself had the press conference, I remember this clearly — he used the term, thereby cementing it in stone and legitimizing it. Also, since Apple products are so popular, I think using a common term (however ridiculous the term is), is helpful for readers who wish to find out details and possibly a resolution for the issue. If you searched for “Apple Screen Stain” you might get a ton of irrelevant hits back — but Staingate gets you to where you want to go. LikeLike Benjamin Mayo - 1 year ago Reply I used ‘Staingate’ here because that’s what people who are involved with this issue actually call themselves. I didn’t make it up myself for a few extra clicks. LikeLiked by 1 person bboysupaman - 1 year ago They are right to criticize you on this. A journalist should use the proper/official name for things. Your title could have stood just fine without the “Staingate” part. If a woman is arrested for “possession of drugs” and “disturbing the peace”, one would hope that a journalist wouldn’t write “Cracked out woman arrested for throwing a bitch fit”. It’s the same thing here. Don’t use an improperly formed moniker just to garner clicks. LikeLiked by 1 person strawbis - 1 year ago Reply You can’t blame the Author for the “gate” moniker! In the UK it’s used to describe anything that causes mild controversy, no matter what the original term was referencing. It’s now a term legal eagles will attach to anything they want to create an air of scandal around.

The Fanbois will be long off on another “shout down the critics” crusade to protect the naked emperor, but as with the GPU problems and capacitor problems and leaking G5 chillers, Apple often takes WAAAAAAAY too long to do anything about this kind of stuff. They take SO long that most people who are bitten have given up, and often NEVER even find out there exists a recall notice because they couldn’t have POSSIBLY waited that long with broken kit. Not if they actually wanted to get shit done, that is. It didn’t take Apple’s engineers this long to determine that the screens were bad, it took this long for the Apple Exec team and Apple Legal to hammer out a deal with a supplier on how this recall/$$refund was going to go. Then they announced. Quietly. Limitedly. But in the meantime, ALL those effected users suffered what amounted to defective hardware for years. Their compensation? Oh, we’ll fix it. Now. Finally. (Well, that is a GIVEN, Apple. Sheesh.) And if you already spent the cash, we’ll compensate you, without interest or any nod to having to have dealt with the hassle. (Again, gee thanks, Apple, for doing what you SHOULD HAVE DONE months ago.). Not even a free t-shirt. Wow. How about this…how about you take their defective computers back and send them NEW units. Because you were dicks. That’s penance. [FWIW, I have a long history of dealing with Apple Support and the Exec team over bad support experiences. It is always great to hear all the positive experiences Apple purchasers have, from never having issues, to having them but finding Apple nice and accommodating. But the real rubber/road testament is when shit goes REALLY bad. And it does. And Apple, invariably, falls flat on its face every damn time. You’d think, given their record, such occasions are VERY RARE, and my experience tells me they are rare. Not rare enough, but indeed rare. Yet they’re SO rare that you’d think Apple, $200B cash-pile Apple, could handle them with aplomb and just ship new kit…do a swap. Get the worst of the worst off the table and make a very happy customer. However, time and time and time again, that does NOT happen. They screw it up. Then they dig in and make it worse. And, more infuriatingly, you’ll get some nitwit that jumps in and says “Well so and so Apple store gave me a brand new iPhone after I dropped mine in the toilet”, as if that negates several dozen Exec team-escalated issues I’ve dealt with in my history with supporting the company. Those ARE the worst, because it shows Apple inconsistently and absolutely capriciously dealing with issues, and when those people chime in it REALLY pisses off—and hence makes non-Apple customers for the rest of their lives—legitimately aggrieved buyers. It has been 30 years, and Apple hasn’t gotten better at this. I have zero belief it will change, either. It is a corporate culture problem, a corporate culture that eschews failure, and then is completely blinded to abject failure right in front of it. Like the See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil monkey scene in ‘Planet of the Apes’, they simply cannot accept what is right there and obvious.] LikeLike ❗ (@thatsteez) - 1 year ago Reply Wow. A month ago I brought mine in to the Apple store because of this issue. They said they hadn’t really seen this issue before although I pulled an 86 page thread of it on MacRumors. I was out of warranty, and after stating that this issue was clearly not done on my behalf after seeing numerous reports of it online, the manager finally dropped the repair price to replace the whole screen from $600 to $200. Although it was nice I received a discount, I still didn’t find it fair considering I did not cause this issue and it was happening out of nowhere to many others. I want to see if I can get a refund on my repair. LikeLike rrobinson1216 - 1 year ago Reply They should refund the repair price without any problems. Of course, you could always call Customer Relations, but just be nice about it and they’ll almost always bend over backwards to make it right.

I was unaware that this was a widespread problem and was expecting a hassle, but I was informed that there was a quality program in place and they replaced my screen. It took two days. The only problem is that the new screen does not seem to be as bright as the previous one. Anyone else experiencing this? LikeLike Ian Norman - 1 year ago Reply Just as a report back for those affected by this issue and are wondering about the repair process. I sent my mid-2012 Macbook Pro Retina in on the quality program via my local Apple Store in California. They anticipated 5-7 days for the repair. The Macbook was sent to Houston, TX and returned within 7 days. They replaced the Display Clamshell, Retina, 15″ (Item Number 605-3504) free of charge. The computer seems good as new. The rubber bezel around the edge of the screen appears deeper, not sure if there are any actual changes to the screen’s reflective coating but it looks perfect. I actually didn’t know about the quality program. I brought my Mac to the genius bar for battery issues and the employee helping me noticed the surface of my screen and asked if I wanted a free screen replacement alongside my battery replacement. Seemed like a good deal and I was traveling for a week anyways and didn’t absolutely need my macbook so I jumped on it. LikeLike Luca Bertoli - 2 months ago Reply Were you still on warranty?

I was asked by the repair center to leave my MBP at the store for 5 days as they need to order the part. I need my MBP to do my work, and I can’t afford to leave it there for 5 days. I called Apple to explain my situation, they just arrogantly ignored that. I told them, I would bring my MBP to the repair center, so they could diagnose and see the problem themselves, after that they could log a case to Apple for part. While waiting for the part to arrive, I want to keep my laptop (since they have identified the problem), so I could use my laptop. Until the part arrived, I would just bring it in again for the part replacement. Such a simple request has been declined by Apple. Apple said, this is their rule. This is ridiculous, Apple thinks every Mac owner is a casual user? They can leave it for 5 days? My staingate-MBP is still with me without repair as I can’t free up 5 days without the laptop. Tim Cook should be ashamed with such a service. LikeLike Luca Bertoli - 2 months ago Reply Were you on warranty?

Now, Apple has confirmed that there are issues with the iOS 9.3 update for older iOS devices and that it is pulling the update for select devices. In a statement issued to iMore, Apple explained that updating older devices, including the iPhone 5s and earlier and the iPad Air and earlier, can require customers to enter the Apple ID and password used to originally set up the device. If the user doesn’t remember this information, they can be blocked from activating the device. Apple says that it has pulled the update for affected devices and will release a new build within the coming days that removes the process of entering the Apple ID and password used when the device was first set up: Updating some iOS devices (iPhone 5s and earlier and iPad Air and earlier) to iOS 9.3 can require entering the Apple ID and password used to set up the device in order to complete the software update. In some cases, if customers do not recall their password, their device will remain in an inactivated state until they can recover or reset their password. For these older devices, we have temporarily pulled back the update and will release an updated version of iOS 9.3 in the next few days that does not require this step.” While some speculated earlier this week that the issue simply centered around too many people hitting Apple’s activation servers at once, it’s now clear that wasn’t the case. If you’re affected by this bug, Apple has also published a new support document detailing some potential workarounds. Below is what Apple says you should try first: Sign in to iCloud.com from a computer. You can get help if you forgot your Apple ID or need to reset your Apple ID password. Open Settings and scroll to the My Devices section. Confirm that your device is listed in the My Devices section. If you don’t see it listed, check all your accounts. Mac users have also reported issues centering around singing in to iMessage and FaceTime after updating to OS X 10.11.4. Apple has yet to formally acknowledge this issue. Let us know in the comments if you’ve been affected by either of these issues. Guides iOS Devices Breaking news for iPhone, iPad, and iPod.

The two biggest problems are 1) the iPad cannot activate, server isn’t reachable or it just hits an apparent infinite loop. This happens a lot on iPad 2 and connecting the device to ITunes just gets you ‘this device cannot be checked’. Now for 2). There’s just a LOT of people out there that don’t have any idea of ‘iCloud’ or ‘Apple ID’. You don’t want to know how many people I see that don’t even know their email address. Come on? Nevertheless good that Apple will recall the need to activate with your Apple ID after the update. Indeed, if you now reset e.g. an iPad 2 with iTunes it will reinstall iOS 9.2.1 . Another thing that happens to work from time to time is using RecBoot to first enter DFU mode and then again exiting it. So no restores, just entering and exiting. Finally, it’s worth noting that with such ‘bricked’ iPads, the data is still recoverable with Photos on Mac. Especially handy if you need to reinstall 9.2.1 .

It only becomes an issue when the user does not recall either their Apple ID nor their password and is locked out of their own device.

If you’ve decided that you don’t want to continue with Apple Music experience and want to avoid being charged for your first month, we’ve put together quick and easy instructions on how to cancel your subscription to keep it from auto-renewing (which is on by default when you sign-up). Otherwise, Apple will charge the credit card linked to the Apple ID that you used to sign-up for Apple Music.  Yesterday Apple posted official walkthrough videos for Apple music just as the first free trials are set to expire tomorrow, and today the company started notifying customers through email and iOS notifications with a reminder to renew their membership. It’s unclear if Apple is sending out the notification to all customers or perhaps just those who have already disabled their subscription from auto-renewing, but many users have yet to receive the notification. Of course, only users that signed-up on day one will have their free three-month trial expire tomorrow.  While Apple has yet to share any solid numbers on Apple Music usage, it did respond to third-party reports related to user retention and conversion from rival services by claiming that only 21% of people have opted out of the free trial. Apple came up with the number by calculating the number of users that had used the service at least once in the last 7 days. The company was responding to reports from research firm MusicWatch that claimed that just 11 percent of iOS users report actually using Apple Music (although 77 percent were aware it had launched), roughly the same as the number of users purchasing or managing their music through iTunes. It also said that 64 percent of users said they are likely to subscribe after the free trial, but in contrast a similar 61 percent had switched off the automatic renewal process. If you’re still having trouble deciding whether or not to keep your subscription active, you’ll want to check out Ben’s “Apple Music Diary: Decision time — is it worth the money?” In it, he weighs many of the pros and cons of Apple Music as observed in past instalments in his diary series: In three months, it has introduced me to more new artists I like than Spotify has in literally years. More than I’ve discovered through recommendations from friends. More than I’ve found by Shazamming tracks in bars and coffee shops. That’s huge. And while the UK does get a raw deal on pricing, it’s still less than than the cost of one album per month. So yes, for me Apple Music is worth it, and I’ll be continuing my subscription once Apple starts billing me in a week’s time. My Spotify subscription got cancelled a week in, and I won’t be renewing it. But if you’re ready to cancel now, head below for instructions on how to stop your Apple Music subscription from auto-renewing on either iOS or Mac: iTunes/Mac: 1. Click on your account (the silhouette icon) in the upper right of iTunes 2. Select “Account Info” 3. Navigate to Settings and click “Manage” next to subscriptions 4. Click the “Edit” button next to “Apple Music Membership” (only necessary if you have multiple subscriptions). If not you’ll go direct to next step: 5. Click “Off” next to Automatic Renewal (this is also where you can switch your plan type) iOS: 1. Tap your account (the silhouette icon) in the upper left of the new Apple Music app 2. Tap “View Apple ID” 3. Scroll down and tap “Manage” under in the Subscriptions section 4.

On the other hand, Spotify and Rdio did not debut 3 months ago and offer a 3 month trial to its new users — unlike Apple Music which did, in fact, debut 3 months ago with a 3 month free trial.

Trending in Apple Apple in 2017: What’s next for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch & Apple TV this year June 9, 2015 How to get your content on Apple Music and manage your ‘Connect’ artist profile page Jordan Kahn - Jun. 9th 2015 9:35 am PT @JordanKahn Apple Music iOS Apps how to videos Comments (28) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Now that Apple Music is official and launching at the end of the month to replace Beats Music, artists can already start submitting music and signing up to manage their artist page. Apple Music introduces new social features under the “Connect” branding, allowing artists to share content, post updates, and connect with fans in a number of ways like never before. While some thought these features would be limited to big artists from major labels, Apple surprised somewhat and delivered for independent artists by making the feature open to all. Here’s how artists can take advantage… 1. First you have to submit your music for inclusion on Apple Music. If you aren’t with a label that already has a relationship with Apple and iTunes, that means using an aggregator, like TuneCore, that offers distribution on iTunes and now Apple Music for a fee. This is Apple’s list of approved aggregators by country. 2. Once you’ve submitted your music, you’ll be able to claim your artist profile for the new Apple Music Connect features here. 3. After signing in with your Apple ID, you can search for your artist name or band. 4. Select your role. Apple lets you pick from a ‘band or group member, solo artist, artist manager, or label representative, depending on who will be managing your artist profile. 5. Now you just have to fill out your contact info and press submit. Apple will email you a confirmation that your request has been received and is in review. Once you’ve been approved, you’ll have access to start managing your artist page and uploading content. When someone searches for you in Apple Music, the content you upload will be presented in a “From the Artist” section next to your catalog of music. Here’s what you’ll be able to do: You can post a simple message, share your favorite music from our expansive catalog, and upload your own work, including audio, videos, and photos. All users, whether they are members or not, can read your posts and stream content you upload. However, only members will be able to stream the songs, albums, and music videos you share from the Apple Music catalog… You can also attach audio or videos that you upload to your existing albums in Apple Music and comment on other artists’ posts or respond to comments on your own posts. Limitations on uploads for artist pages include up to 90 minutes of audio, videos up to 8 minutes, or photos in JPEG or PNG file formats. While some artists will post professionally produced content, Apple also notes that you’ll be able to upload videos and photos “spontaneously recorded on an iPhone or iPad” and post immediately right from within the app. The significance of these features goes well beyond simply social network-like functionality for Apple Music. Apple is for the first time allowing artists total, on the fly control over how they market themselves through its music services, and the fact that the feature is open to all and not just major labels is a huge win for independent artists that do most of their own marketing anyway. If Apple Music, the new curated radio stations, and the Connect social features are successful with users, this could be the first music streaming service that truly embraces smaller artists. What remains to be seen, however, is how Apple might promote this content uploaded by artists and how they’ll be paying out to artists relative to competitive services.  Guides Apple Music: Apple's streaming music service View THe Guide iOS View THe Guide Apps View THe Guide Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

So in my case, I just uploaded a previously unreleased track and it asked me if this was for my artist “Jido-Genshi” or “Science Patrol” or “Mielikki” etc. I chose the appropriate artist, and it uploaded the song and photo I attached as well.

Only at the Shenzhen market… [Video] Jordan Kahn - Feb. 3rd 2016 7:33 am PT @JordanKahn iOS Devices iPhone how to video Upgrade Comments (49) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit You can get just about anything at the Shenzhen market in China, and that apparently includes an on-the-spot internal storage upgrade for your iPhone (in addition to a long list of counterfeit Apple products). It’s a service that, save for perhaps the most hardcore DIYers, is unheard of stateside. Apple charges a $100 premium each time you bump up to a higher capacity iPhone, but at the Shenzhen market this third-party upgrade costs only around $60 to go from a 16GB model to 128GB. The 128GB iPhone model would normally be a $200 premium over the 16GB model retail price, and that’s not accounting for the fact you’d also have to purchase a new device. You can also get an upgrade to 32GB for $20 or 64GB for $35.  The process takes around 30 minutes and sees a Shenzhen market employee taking apart the iPhone and replacing the device’s internal flash storage with a new 128GB chip from Toshiba. And all of the device’s storage is transferred to the new chip, so you don’t lose any data in the process and can continue using the device with everything intact from before the upgrade. The upgrade apparently works for iPhone 6, iPad Air and older devices with around 50 upgrades per day done at the Shenzhen market alone, according to the full video below courtesy of local company BeSound. And not surprisingly, getting this type of upgrade from a third-party will completely void your warranty with Apple. But — Shenzhen aside— we aren’t holding our breath for seeing a similar service become popular stateside, as Apple will likely not be too happy about an unauthorized third-party cracking open iPhones, voiding warranties, and undercutting its lucrative margins on flash storage in the various iPhone models. For the rest of us there are great external storage add-ons for iPhone that can be a solid solution for those running out of space. Lightning to USB thumb drives— like the one Hyper recently showed off at CES— is one way of getting some extra storage while on the go. And there are versions that accept microSD cards if that’s more your style. Check out the full video of the upgrade being performed below: Guides iOS Devices Breaking news for iPhone, iPad, and iPod.

Modern iPhones are a lot more intelligent in discovering foreign parts as well, such as third party displays causing darkening of your screen over time. This is one of the many signs Geniuses use to instantly tell it’s been messed about with. The only way I see it having worth is if indeed, your warranty is completely out and you’re just left with the phone for the time being.

And funnily mine ends in this december, I’m totally going to research more into this because I’m 100% interested in doing this. I have an iPod 5.5th generation, the best product Apple ever released, from a time when Apple actually made great products to facilitate people’s lives, hundreds of Gigs of memory for anything you need to store? Apple nowadays would never do that, so that they discontinued the ipod classic, they want you to pay monthly fees for cloud storage. And I just upgraded the memory to 700Gb, you can upgrade up to 1 Tb of memory, and I got a bigger battery with the fat case mod. And only 16 Gb in the entry level phone, when all other manufacturers offer 32? Apple does that so you get frustrated and unhappy with the meager 16Gb of memory and buy a new phone with more. Apple doesn’t really make their products, virtually every single part of the iPhone is made by other companies in Asia, Samsung, Sony… they just market it and sell for thousands to their fanatic Apple cult, just look how Apple charges 200 dollars more for 128Gb when the chinese guy does it for 60 LikeLike Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

For example, its cylindrical-shaped symmetrical body lacks a basic pen clip for attaching it to your shirt pocket or elsewhere, which makes it look prettier and simpler but means it easily rolls down inclines and can’t attach to cases or pockets. Apple has weighted it internally to sit in place on a flat surface cleverly with the Apple Pencil marking facing upward, but it’s still no match for a slight slant and where exactly are you supposed to put it? This creates an obvious opportunity for accessory makers. There will surely be a market of add-ones for Apple Pencil, it’s just a matter of time of course, and case makers like Urban Armor Gear are already tackling the problem with solutions like this. But I’m plenty happy with either a Smart Cover or Smart Keyboard, personally, and don’t much want a spot on my case dedicated for stashing the Apple Pencil. What have I found to work best for me? The novel idea of one clever Reddit user called texasdoesitbest posted late last month. Buy a particular basic mechanical pencil with a removable metal clip, detach it, and slide it on Apple Pencil. It’s a nearly perfect fit and only costs a few bucks. Here’s what you need and how it works: 1. Apple Pencil, you wouldn’t have this problem to solve otherwise right? 2. Pentel Sharp Automatic Pencil, 0.5mm — I picked up a 2-pack for under $10. 3. Something to attach it to — it clips along pretty nicely to the fold of the Smart Keyboard and feels more secure than a magnet solution might. Most of the work is in removing the attached clip from the mechanical pencil. I found that it’s secured on fairly well, but it does separate on one side without bending too harshly and slides off. It’s hacky, but I used a butter knife to pry it off. Once the metal clip is freed, it’s time to attach it to Apple Pencil. You could bend it outward enough to fit over the removable Lighting connector cover, but I found it easier to slip it from the nub end which is pointed and smaller than the clip’s opening. Once you get past the nub, Apple Pencil thickens and enough so that it easily lets the clip securely hug it and stay put. Just slide it upward to where you like it. After trying a few spots, I found that placing the clip part just to the left of the Apple Pencil marking on the metal band fits really well — it doesn’t obscure the tasteful Apple branding and it actually aligns almost intentionally with the Lightning connector under the cap. It’s not an absolutely perfect solution: the band doesn’t fully enclose so there’s a white gap opposite the clip, you could potentially scratch Apple Pencil’s plastic casing or metal ring if you slide it on too tightly, and there’s both Pentel and Japan stamped into the clip band. I have found it to be highly practical, however, and clipping it to the Smart Keyboard’s cover means I’m much more likely to have Apple Pencil around during leisure time for spontaneous doodling and not just in my backpack or at my desk. I’m not completely in love with how it looks attached, but there is something typical about the pen and clipboard effect it creates. I’m curious, now, to see the inevitable market of pen clips created especially for Apple Pencil to develop. Pentel Sharp Automatic Pencil 0.5mm is sold from $6.00 on Amazon. Don’t have an Apple Pencil or prefer a less enormous iPad? Adonit Jot Dash is a recommended iPad stylus that features its own clip. Guides iPad What's next for Apple's iPad line?

LikeLike 89p13 - 1 year ago Well, Zac, we are all entitled to our opinions and while I found the comments that were deleted to be mildly critical and somewhat humorous in their delivery, my particular post that was swept away was – IMHO – valid in that it pointed out that following your suggestion was potentially dangerous to the iPad Pro screen. Specifically, a very serious scratching of the screen from the metal clip you installed on the pen as well as the potential cracking of the screen glass if something was to press too hard on the iPad Pro cover as shown in your illustration photos. Again, everyone has their own opinion, but I found your sweeping away those comments that were critical of your suggestion to be childish (‘It’s my ball and if you won’t play by my rules, I’m taking it back.”) and unprofessional, YOU control who and what gets posted. And it seems that you may have kicked over a hornets nest by your reaction to those early posts – but I’ll still read and comment of 9 to 5. I really appreciate and respect most of the editors and what they write and find the ability to comment on those posts to be informative and, in many cases, enlightening to the original post.

Go ahead and delete this as well, 9to5mac has also been deleted from my bookmarks, ciao! LikeLike kjl3000 - 1 year ago Reply Here’s a copy of my mail to Seth regarding censorship at 9to5mac: Dear Seth, as a longterm reader and follower of 9to5mac, I just wanted to inform you that I am disappointed in the way some writers seem to handle criticism. Zac Hall recently published an Article about a Pencil „mod“, where he puts a cheap pen clip on Apple’s device. Disregarding the obvious Design massacre and hillarious look of this concept, it most certainly can cause potential damage to the pencil (scratches etc) or the iPad when attached to the closed cover. Without further explenation of those, to me obvious, reasons not to follow his guidlines to reproduce this, I just wrote „Please, DON’T“ , which I think isn’t offending nor wrong at all, it is just my personal opinion, and two or three similar comments by other useres followed in the comments section. As I just learned today, these comments have been deleted by Zac Hall with the following Explanation in response to another useres comment about the deletion: “Yes, found the first batch of comments distasteful to the point that friends and family were asking if i was aware of them … on a Sunday morning. Like the idea or hate it, that’s fine, but I chose not to have something I found distasteful under my writing. Thanks for reading.“ I neither see my comment distasteful nor offending, what I see is a writer being in a huff who simply cannot stand his ideas being not liked. This is CENSORSHIP in its worst form and earns my deepest disrespect and dishonors not only the work of 9to5mac but the whole aspects of free speech and journalism! I’m really offended by this and will no longer follow or read 9to5mac as long as I don’t see any regrets or apologies for this in any form, either from Zac Hall or you. Best regards, Frédéric.

Trending in Apple Apple in 2017: What’s next for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch & Apple TV this year April 6, 2015 Tim Cook: Apple employees will get 50% off Apple Watch, 1000+ apps submitted Mark Gurman - Apr. 6th 2015 1:37 pm PT @markgurman Exclusive AAPL Company Comments (73) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple CEO Tim Cook today sent out a memo to all employees ahead of the Apple Watch’s retail try-on kickoff this Friday. Cook thanks employees who have worked on the Apple Watch by saying, “congratulations to everyone who has worked so hard for years to help this product reach our customers.” Cook also prepares the company’s retail division by noting that try-ons will begin in over 400 Apple Stores on Friday ahead of the official Friday, April 24th launch… Likely to the delight of Apple employees, Cook also announced major Apple Watch discounts for all employees: 50% off the aluminum sport and stainless steel models and $550 off of the gold Edition variations. By comparison, the iPad was not immediately offered at discount for employees, while the original iPhone was provided for free to a large percentage of the company. The special pricing for employees lasts for 90 days, starting on Friday, which is when general Apple Watch pre-orders begin. Commenting on the reduced price, Cook told employees that “we want you to share in that experience right alongside [customers].” Cook also told employees that “more than one thousand apps were submitted in just four days last week when the App Store started accepting them, and the rate of submissions has only been climbing since then.” Apple started accepting Apple Watch app submissions last week. Apple has already previewed several Apple Watch applications on its website and during the March Apple Watch keynote presentation, which will be available to download via the Apple Watch Companion app. The full memo from Cook to employees can be read below: Team, The day we’ve all been waiting for is almost here: Apple Watch is ready to ship. Our retail stores are training for a whole new way to engage customers and help them experience Apple’s most personal product yet. On Friday, in over four hundred stores across four continents, we’ll open our doors to people who want to try on Apple Watch for the first time and start deciding which one is right for them. Tens of millions of people have seen our keynotes and demonstration videos about the watch, and there’s much more to come. Some of the most innovative developers in the world are working on new experiences designed specifically for Apple Watch. More than one thousand apps were submitted in just four days last week when the App Store started accepting them, and the rate of submissions has only been climbing since then. I know that many of you have been looking forward to choosing an Apple Watch for yourselves, and we want to make it easy for you. Starting Friday, in countries where the watch is available for pre-order, a special Employee Purchase Plan will offer a 50% discount on any Apple Watch or Apple Watch Sport for your personal use. As we introduce the watch in more countries, the special pricing for employees will be offered in those countries as well. Discounts will begin at pre-order and last for 90 days after availability. AppleWeb has more details, so I invite you to check it out. Our products enrich people’s lives like no others, and we think Apple Watch is going to delight our customers in ways people can’t yet imagine. We want you to share in that experience right alongside them. Congratulations to everyone who has worked so hard for years to help this product reach our customers. And thanks in advance to the thousands of retail employees around the world who will start placing it on people’s wrists starting Friday. Tim Guides AAPL Company Breaking news from Cupertino.

Since you don’t know which size: Go to any decent clothing store. Tell them you’re looking for a 42mm watch. Let them give you a few to try on. Don’t tell them you’re just getting a feel for size. If it feels too big, order the 38mm. If it feels just right, get the bigger one. Bigger watch will have a bigger screen and bigger battery (purportedly). I completely agree on going to the Apple Store to try one on. I’ll be doing the same. If you need to change your pre-order, I’d imagine there will be no issue unless the model you want has a slipped ship date already.

<Prev | [Index] | Next> genew@telus.net Tue, 30 Aug 2016 11:44:34 -0700 Peter Sayer, Computerworld, 30 Aug 2016 Apple must repay up to the equivalent of US$14.5 billion in underpaid taxes in Ireland, the European Commission ruled on 30 Aug 2016. Two Irish tax rulings constituted illegal state aid, the European Commission ruled. http://www.computerworld.com/article/3113753/it-industry/apple-must-repay-145-billion-in-underpaid-taxes-in-ireland.html selected text [PGN-ed]: Apple's tax benefits in Ireland are illegal, and the company will have to pay up to the equivalent of roughly US$14.5 billion in back taxes, plus interest. The investigation found that Apple's effective tax rate on profit reported in Ireland was just 1/2000, falling to 1/20000 in 2014. Apple and the Irish tax authority disputed the commission's charges. Vestager said that Irish tax authorities had allowed Apple to split profit from the two companies, which were subject to normal taxes, with "head office" companies that were subject to no taxes, either in Ireland or elsewhere. "Splitting the profits did not have any factual or economic justification. The so-called head office had no employees, no premises, no real activities," she said. Those head-office companies were allocated almost all the profits. This selective tax treatment in Ireland is illegal under European Union state aid rules, she said, and distorts competition. <Prev | [Index] | Next>

This year, speculation indicates Apple’s new iPhone, rumoured to be called the iPhone 7, is poised to be a safe, incremental upgrade for the company. We also could be in for a new Apple Watch and possibly a long-overdue MacBook Pro and MacBook Air revamp, though recent rumours indicate the Cupertino-based tech giant likely plans to hold a separate Mac-focused event at a later date. Here’s everything you need to know about Apple’s upcoming “See You” September 7th Keynote set to take place at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco at 10 a.m. PT/ 1 p.m. ET. Say goodbye to the headphone jack The most significant shift with the new iPhone is reportedly the removal of the standard 3.5mm headphone jack, in both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, in order to make the phone thinner, similar to Motorola’s move with the Moto Z. In the headphone port’s place, it’s unclear if the phone will feature Lightning headphones or some sort of lightning-to-3.5mm headphone adapter. It’s also possible the phone could include wireless Bluetooth headphones. Overall, speculation indicates the phones will look very similar to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, adopting a nearly identical form factor with cleaner antenna lines and possibly new colours, with dark black and blue variant rumours currently swirling across the internet. On the camera side of things, the iPhone 7 is expected to get a larger shooter that features dual cameras, resulting in improved low-light performance, similar to the Huawei P9 (which actually didn’t get released in Canada). Furthermore, it looks like the home button is going contextual with new Force Touch-like haptic feedback and that the smartphone will come equipped with a new A10 processor. The iPhone’s base line of storage is reportedly starting at 32GB, up from the standard 16GB, a move iPhone owners have been requesting for years. It’s also possible we could see higher-resolution displays in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, though I’m skeptical of that particular rumour. The iPhone 7’s release date is expected to be on September 23rd. Get ready for an Apple Watch refresh With watchOS 3 looming on the horizon, it’s possible we’ll finally see the smartwatches first full revamp. With cellular data functionality probably no longer coming, it’s likely the Apple Watch 2, as it’s expected to be called, will finesse some of the issues users experienced with the original wearable. Battery life will reportedly be improved, independent GPS functionality is on the way and even a barometer for altitude tracking could hit the new smartwatch. Other upgrades include a faster processor and stronger water resistance. It looks like the new Apple Watch will arrive in September and that eager Apple fans won’t have to experience the six-week gap between the March 2015 Apple Watch’s reveal and its actual launch day. Macs, iPads and iOS 10 iOS 10 is on the way and it’s likely that we’ll get the operating system’s final public release date during Apple’s keynote. It’s also possible watchOS 3 and macOS Sierra will get launch dates as well. It’s well-known Apple’s superb but rapidly aging MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are long overdue for an update and while it looked like we’d catch our first glimpse of the new laptops at Apple’s September 7th keynote, that probably isn’t the case now. According to a recent Bloomberg report from the almost always correct Mark Gurman, Apple’s new laptops will likely be shown off at a later event. The new devices will, however, reportedly feature an OLED control strip and USB-C functionality. We also could see a revamped 12.9-inch iPad Pro at the keynote, though details regarding what will be upgraded in the device are scarce right now. SourceBloomberg gommer strike Remember guys – Apple never does anything first. And that includes removal of the headphone jack. Android holds that honor by a country mile. We’ll see how it goes. If it is indeed nothing more than a spec boost but largely most other things remain the same – I don’t know if that’ll be a reason for me to upgrade. Maybe I’ll wait for Sailfish. Philosoraptor Apple doesn’t do it first, but whatever they do – others then tend to follow en masse. They weren’t the first for fingerprint scanning, but after they introduced it, many followed and it’s a staple of most high end devices. Personally, I don’t care about the port – I use it maybe one a year. Patrick O’Rourke As far as rumours go, this year’s keynote should be relatively low key. As usual, the iPhone 7 is going to be an upgrade, but the verdict is still out on how much of an upgrade. jay see the same thing iphone 7 will just a small update more hardware than anything else aaron Your comment is so wrong that it will give yourself cancer gommer strike What aspect of my comments do you disagree with? Is it necessary for you to compose such an inflammatory response? If you felt genuinely angry with my post, then I apologize. But if you wrote this to provoke, troll, or incite a negative response, then sorry but – that’s not what you’ll get from me. If you are a great fan of Apple products which compelled you to write this then hey – I love Apple products too(I use them myself). As Android users would tell everyone…be together[and not the same]. aaron You’re wrong again… I’m an android person but what you said its incorrect. It’s Me I expect much bitching and moaning. Victor Creed And shortages… ciderrules Blamed on Apple intentionally limiting stock to give the impression there’s high demand. Lil’ Cwyin’ Cowar316 You still cry ’bout this one, bro…? Can’t Fix Stupid Not from the Verge or BGR. If you want best phone ever stuff that’s your place to get your fill. It’s Me I meant in the comments sections. Dozens of people who don’t use Apple products will flood every single story to post about how much they dislike Apple products they don’t and won’t use. We’ll be inundated with people complaining about things that don’t affect them in any way. Much bitching and moaning by those with no sane reason for bitching and moaning. FTR_Part_deux Don’t understand how Apple can remove the headphone jack for the sake of making the phone thinner…what of the current iPod Touch? 6.1mm thick on the iPod Touch vs. 6.9mm thick on an iPhone 6s and both have the Lightning Port. Their excuse is not making me a believer. I’m guessing it’s to setup some product they have in development over in their Beats division. Can’t imagine using a stupid dongle if I want to use my after market buds. Not a smart move Apple. David K most likely release bluetooth headphones with the iphone, they always include headphones so they might actually include the bluetooth ones, but this is just using logic not facts neo905 I like my bluetooth headphones but I only use them to workout. If I used them on a daily basis it would be a PITA to have one more thing to charge every night. Even only using them to workout it is a PITA when they eventually die in the middle of a workout. Keep the jack. David K maybe make em wireless charging? so you just place em on a pad and they charge, no need to plug em in, but i get what you mean neo905 Same result. I need to charge them. It matters not the mechanism for doing so. FTR_Part_deux Ya, from what k have read, BT earphones aren’t the way to go. The battery doesn’t last long and SQ isn’t as developed as our standard jack earphones. I think my next phone upgrade will be the IPhone 6s+ 128gb and have it last for as long as possible. jay thats not the reason removing the jack. because apple can save some extra money. maybe 26 cents a piece. It’s Me That doesn’t seem like the reason. Headphone jacks are cheap. Likely costs them far more to include a dongle than they’d save on the part for a jack. jay But one day they don’t need to put a dongle inside than $$$$ gommer strike We’ll just have to see. This is definitely getting a ton more attention than the Android phones which have long preceded Apple in removal of the headphone jack. Mr Dog Because the number of people that use those android phone is very tiny when compared to the number of people that will use the iPhone. And could likely trigger a complete shift from wired headphones because of it. Which would not happen because of those few android phones that did it first. JD It would blow peoples minds if Apple announced the new iPhone with a 3.5mm jack Mr Dog LOL Everyone would actually be disappointed that they did not remove the jack after all this hype over it. JD Yep. People: Mind blown. WTF IS THIS 3.5MM STILL DOING HERE?! gommer strike I would laugh so hard if Apple “leaked” all fake pictures to troll everyone into believing there’s no jack. And on release day…hey what DIS?! Omar Just to troll Motorola Jefferson Won I wish apple would just go with faster, just as flexible USB type-C instead of lightning connector. But then again, they would lose money…so they won’t. gommer strike Come to think of it, if they did use the USB-C standard(they’re not), then at least it’ll force the cable/adapter industry to adhere a little bit better to those USB-C standards. Right now it’s a bit of a nightmare. Whenever we look up cables that are supposed USB-C compatible, a closer look reveals that many buyers confirmed – nope – this cable doesn’t support fast charging, or nope, while the end fits, it isn’t really up to spec. That’s not a good thing. Micro-USB didn’t have this problem – why are companies cutting corners on USB-C? Rimtu Kahn And do we not know that there will be a better or real version 7, the 7S in about 6 months time? jay without even know what they will announce people will be disappointed. there are to much expectation. apple wont deliver what we want. waterproof more storage better screen 3.5 headphone jack. smaller bazel usb type c Cornfed710 You’ll get water resistant, more storage (32GB base) and better screen (True Tone Display) jay we see i don’t think 32 GB only with another 100$extra Cornfed710 The 32GB will cost the same as the 16GB did. jay How do you know how much it will be? Cornfed710 Doesn’t take a genius to figure out, I guess we’ll see tomorrow. Lil’ Cwyin’ Cowar316 This goo’ pone, yeah? This goo’ pone for you!

But even the magnitude of the error probably won't be enough to push users immediately into the arms of rival Apple, experts told CNBC. Samsung Electronics, a leading maker of higher-end Android devices, on Friday stopped sales of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone amid reports that batteries were exploding during or after charging. The decision came at a crucial time, as competitor Apple is expected to unveil a new smartphone — the iPhone 7, if Apple sticks to convention — at an event next week. But even with the timing of Samsung's battery cell issues, Apple still has a lot to prove before it can win over Samsung buyers, said Daniel Newman, principal analyst at Futurum Research, which provides analysis and research on digital transformation and innovation. It may come down to software as both companies duke it out for each other's customers. SeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg | Getty Images "I don't think the market pays a ton of attention to the news," Newman said. "People that walk into a store to buy a new phone, and they ask, 'What's the $99 dollar smartphone this month? What comes free with my plan?' That's a huge chunk of the market." Early reports, unconfirmed by Apple, indicate that the iPhone 7 will have few changes visible to the naked eye of the average shopper. A dual lens camera, slightly thinner chassis, new body color, more memory, improved waterproofing, and the lack of a headphone jack are among the highlights that have been reported. The Note 7, meanwhile, had already seen better-than-expected demand amid positive reviews before the company began to announce delays. The Note 7's note-taking functions, and security features like iris-scanning, are particularly unique, said Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's mobile phones team. Plus, Samsung has another phone — the Galaxy S7 edge — that can draw in premium users. Now, the market is waiting. If the pricey new iPhone fails to impress, that leaves the door wide open for another player to snatch customers who may care more about their operating system — surfing Facebook or playing Pokemon Go — than the specs of their speakers, Newman said. "I think anytime nowadays that there's a manufacturing issue, it makes people take pause," Newman said. "The last thing that people want is to buy something and have an issue. But I think really, what catapulted Apple beyond Blackberry, way back when, was simplicity and reliability. Android was always clunkier, had more glitches and more difficult to use. But Samsung phones have given people the experience they want." With hardware innovation plateauing and apps becoming more important than ever, it's a significant undertaking to get users to switch from the iPhone to Android ecosystem, said Llamas. Smartphone apps now account for more than half of all American's time spent online, according to a Thursday comScore report. "All your applications, content, all that you had on your previous Note devices — they don't transfer easily to an iPhone, and only some may transfer to other Android smartphones," he said. By acting swiftly, Samsung may have time to fix and replace its smartphones in time for the holiday season sales spike, Newman said. It could blow over the way Apple's Maps glitches or "bendgate" did. Still, not everyone is so sure. Nomura research analysts CW Chung and Chris Chang wrote that Samsung could have had a better follow-up strategy which could prevent brand-loyal consumers from changing their minds, like a Gear S3 giveaway. Samsung also faces a squeeze as Apple threatens its high end market, and Android makers like Lenovo, Motorola, LG and HTC undercut its price, said Forrester analyst Frank Gillett. "Having the talk about, 'Oops, there's a battery problem,' is a step in the wrong direction," Gillett said. "The biggest concern is they have to pivot the conversation to software and services." As both Apple and Samsung face their challenges, there could be an opportunity for a dark horse to enter the race, too, Newman said. While Apple and Samsung are still top smartphone vendors by volume, their shipments are growing much more slowly worldwide than upstarts like Oppo, Xiaomi, Vivo and Huawei, according to IDC. Indeed, many vendors now offer physical features like big screens and adequate processors, including $100 phones offered in emerging markets by players like Oppo, Xiaomi, Vivo and Huawei that come loaded with locally-important apps, Llamas said. But far fewer offer the Note's private file system, Llamas said, or Apple's curated app store, said Newman. "It's about changing the conversation," Gillett. "Are they in a commodity race to the bottom competing with the leading Chinese makers on price? Or can they carve out a role to themselves with services?"

Set to their song “Hooking Up With Girls,” the Lane Moore-led alt band swapped Apple’s heterosexual couple for a lesbian pair, featuring Moore navigating an after-hours party in various states of undress. Apple’s original take won a 1998 VMA for Best Cinematography. The song, which celebrated its 20th anniversary earlier this year, appeared on her debut 1996 album Tidal. It was the record’s highest charting single, and later won a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. “Fiona Apple has always been a huge influence for me musically, and I knew I wanted to pay homage to my favorite ’90s music videos,” Moore told Nylon of the video. “So when I realized the ‘Criminal’ video had a lot of similar visual and lyrical themes about vague sexual exploits that aren’t what they seem and are confusing and frustrating, it all clicked.” Watch the video for “Hooking Up With Girls” above.

As Apple’s developer page on Offering Subscriptions explains, auto-renewable subscriptions can now be offered on all Apple platforms and in all app categories, including games, to provide users with access to content or services on an ongoing basis, and automatically renew until a user chooses to cancel. Developers will be able to allow users to sign up for subscriptions with free trial periods, subject to the normal subscription durations, and will also be able to offer upgrades, downgrades, and crossgrades to subscriptions, all controlled via Apple’s in-app purchase APIs. Similarly, as Apple SVP Phil Schiller announced in June, Apple will also be implementing a new revenue structure for auto-renewable subscriptions, providing developers with a larger share of the revenue for users who continue to subscribe to the app’s services. After a subscriber accumulates on year of paid services, regardless of whether they’re on a weekly, monthly, or yearly subscription plan, developers will received 85% of the subscription price, as opposed to the standard 70% cut that Apple normally offers. Users can also upgrade, downgrade, or crossgrade within a subscription group without affecting the days of paid service, and Apple will offer a 60 day grace period during which a user can cancel their subscription and return without resetting their days of paid service toward the higher revenue model. Full details on the new in-app subscription system and revenue sharing can be found on Apple’s Subscriptions page.

Close Close "" Close Listen Watch EU Socialism Bites Apple Aug 30, 2016 RUSH: The way the European Union is looking at Apple — the European Union is nothing but a bunch of takers.  The European Union wouldn’t know how to produce diddly-squat.  So Apple is the golden goose.  And they’re taking as many eggs from the golden goose as they can, because they’re out of money.  All these brilliant socialist Democrats in Western Europe, all these elites, these pointy-headed intellectuals, our so-called betters, can’t manage anything.  And they have been out of money for years.  They don’t know how to budget. They don’t know how to behave responsibly. So here comes Apple, and it’s a big pile of money and they can go get it, and Apple’s just the first.  And the interesting thing about this is who does Tim Cook sidle up to?  The very people who want to do this to his company.  You know what else is interesting about this?  This babe over there that did this, her name is Margrethe Vestager.  I don’t know how she pronounces it.  This was this morning in Brussels during the press conference she had. VESTAGER:  Our decision concludes that splitting the profits — RUSH:  Listen to this.  Hold it a minute. (laughing) This is even better than I thought it was gonna be. (imitating Vestager) Oh, man, this is just too perfect.  VESTAGER:  Our decision concludes that splitting the profits did not have any factual or economic justification.  The so-called head office had no employees, no premises, no real activities.  The so-called head office was attributed almost all of the company’s profits.  The second company, Apple Operations Europe, makes certain Apple computers in Ireland.  Under the same two tax rulings, the majority of its profit was also artificially attributed to a so-called head office that only existed on paper and whose profits were not taxed. RUSH:  Look, I don’t have a dog in this fight.  I’m just telling you that Apple set themselves up according to Irish law.  So they set themselves up according to Irish law.  But, folks, you can have one or the other but you can’t have both.  You can either have confiscatory taxation like this or you can have jobs.  The problem with leftists is they think you can do both.  They think they can tax the golden goose as often and as highly as they want, and that the golden goose is gonna keep producing.  Because they’ve never been in that sector of life where the golden goose lives.  All they are is a bunch of takers, a bunch of people in government with power to take.  But you put on them the responsibility for innovation, creation, productivity, invention, and you’ve got nothing, because they are clueless.  So they come along and they start demanding all this.  And then they start demanding jobs, and you have to choose one or the other.  Confiscatory taxation or jobs.  What do you want?  But there’s another aspect to this that isn’t being reported, and that is the anti-Americanism of this, the EU.  All this globalism, Obama and his cronies trying to tell us that globalism is the future and that the US was gonna be once again loved and respected once Obama was there and George W. Bush was jettisoned, and now this?  This woman delighted in screwing the screws tighter to an American corporation, and the US and Obama did everything to try to stop her from doing it, and she relished it all the more.  Ha. BREAK TRANSCRIPT RUSH: Just one more thing on the Apple story.  This thing is gonna be tied up for years with the appeals and everything.  There’s one reason Apple has so much money in Europe.  You know what the Apple cash pile is right now?  It’s $231 billion and climbing.  I mean, it’s profit, yeah, but that’s how much they’ve made that they have not reinvested, and their R&D budget is huge.  It’s just a phenomenal pile of money.  You know how much of that $231 billion is being held overseas?  About $210 billion of it.  It is striking.  Maybe $20 billion — if I read that right this morning, $20 billion of Apple’s $231 billion is in the United States. Meaning when they say “cash,” it’s not all greenbacks in the bank.  This means it’s invested in various assets, stocks, bonds, like anybody else would invest.  It’s fairly liquid.  But you know why $220 billion of it is overseas?  It’s not strictly because Apple is a global corporation; it’s because of the US tax rate.  The United States has the highest business tax rate in the world, 35%.  So Apple received favorable tax proposals from European countries, including Holland and Ireland, because they wanted jobs, they wanted an economic boost, and they offered Apple attractive tax packages, which is common.  I mean, how many of you have heard of the state of New York exempting taxes for whatever business that they want to invest in the state, open in the state, build factories in the state?  It happens all the time.  There’s nothing unfair about it; it’s nothing unusual.  It’s the way markets work.  And if there are confiscatory tax rates in play, you can guarantee that smart-money people are gonna do everything they can to avoid them.  And it isn’t irresponsible.  I mean, you can make the argument Apple has the duty to shareholders to maximize profits, so as to maximize stock price and dividends if they pay it.  All that, of course, is true.  But it just makes sense anyway:  It’s Apple’s money.  It isn’t the European Union’s money.  It’s not Barack Obama’s money or John Kerry’s or Hillary Clinton’s; it’s Apple’s.  But if you’re Elizabeth Warren, you come along and say, “You didn’t build that. You didn’t build that iPhone. We made that possible for you,” all that rotgut rigmarole.  So the European Union is like any other massively bloated, overweight bureaucracy:  It’s out of money.  They can’t manage their own finances.  They have the ability to take money from anybody, anywhere, any time.  It’s called taxes and fees and taxes and fees and user fees and who the hell knows what all mechanisms, and even at that they’re broke.  And it’s typical; the people who do not work and who have nothing to do with the production of the money they have, have no appreciation for how it was acquired.  If you can get money by taking it from other people, you’re gonna think you can always get money by taking it from other people.  And if you have a lot of money and you’ve never earned it, guaran-damn-teed you are never going to appreciate the value of that money.  And that’s government for you.  Government confiscates wealth.  Government does not create wealth, pure and simple.  “Wait a minute, Rush.  What about defense contracts?”  Well, the government’s not doing the work, and it’s taxpayer money to begin with.  It isn’t government money.  Government doesn’t produce jack.  All government does is get in the way.  Government could do much more than they do by getting out of the way.  There can be even more wealth, Apple could have even more money.  Well, anyway, the United States government would love some of Apple’s money but not enough to alter the tax rate, so 35%’s what it is and Apple’s gonna keep their money overseas, and they have arranged for all of their sales to be recorded. They’ve got an office I think in Reno, and arranged for most of their sales to be recorded in Ireland.  People say, “Wait, they don’t make anything in Ireland.”  Yeah, I know, the actual assembly process is in China, but their supply chain is worldwide.  Most people don’t ever — and there’s no reason they would — most people never stop to think, take an iPhone, or any smartphone, I don’t care if it’s Samsung’s or anybody, what goes into making that phone a reality is beyond most people’s comprehension.  Apple’s supply chain is massive, it is intricate, and it is one of the most well-oiled machines in and of itself in all of American corporate life.  They’ve got it down pat.  When Apple is on a role, you know how often they turn over their inventory?  I’m talking about everything, iPhones, iPads, Macintosh computers, whatever.  When Apple is humming, they turn over their inventory every eight days.  Stop and think of that, worldwide.  To have your manufacturing down so that you’re not saddled with a big bunch of inventory you’re holding onto, which just drags down everything, it slows manufacturing, it slows everything in the supply chain, it slows down the profitability of all your suppliers.  To be able to have your manufacturing such that you’re able to turn total inventory five to eight days in a global circumstance is just phenomenal.  For these governments to come along and try to claim that Apple’s cheating here and cheating there, it’s typical.  Anyway, what has to happen, Apple’s gonna appeal this, so they have to put the money — it’s about $13 billion euros, translation to $15 billion.  They have to put the money in escrow.  Some of that $15 billion is interest and penalties on the original base amount that the fine is.  So Apple will appeal, and it goes on.  It’s gonna be years before this is solved.  It’s not gonna have any immediate impact on the Apple stock price.  It’s just government doing what government does, particularly these clowns in the European Union, who are just inept.  Well, anyway, I was reading my tech blogs about this today.  And the tech blogs are young Millennial, and younger, journalists.  And I want to read to you just one excerpt from one of them.  I mean, I could probably find this thinking in all of them.  “Apple likes to present itself as a friendly, open company that is on the side of consumers. Yet here it is arguing that its complex financial arrangements, which serve to dramatically reduce its overseas tax bills, are justified. It does this at a time when the public mood is very much against such maneuvering.” Oh, okay.  So the public mood is against responsible fiscal behavior.  So what should Apple do?  “Given than Apple isn’t short of cash by any stretch of the imagination, why doesn’t it simply take the moral high road and voluntarily pay the taxes that it really believes should be due?” You see, this is what we’re up against dealing with Millennials.  So now it’s a moral issue.  Apple has lots of money.  The way they arrange their finances is very complex.  It’s bad PR to scrap and fight over every dollar.  Apple should just pay up.  It’d be a great PR move.  Apple’s customers — and we of course in the tech media, we would love Apple.  Not.  Because, of course, giving government money, why, that is the supreme definition of morality, don’t you see?  Apple should just figure out what it owes morally and pay that, whatever the real tax bill is.  Isn’t that instructive?  Doesn’t that tell us a lot?  So, Apple, as a PR move, should not argue this. They should not even dispute it.  They should just pay up and maybe even pay a little more than they owe, and get great PR benefits as a result.  Does anybody think that’s what would happen?  What do you think would happen, Mr. Snerdley, if Apple followed this advice and issued a press release today by Tim Cook, the CEO, “Hi, I’m Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.  We have just been told by the European Union that we have underpaid our taxes by $15 billion.  We dispute this, but because we want our customers to think we are moral people, we’re gonna actually give them $20 billion.  By the way, our new iPhones come out the next week, and we really hope you snap ’em up.”  What would be the practical result of Apple publicly announcing they’re gonna pay either exactly what they owe with no dispute or adding to it for the — (interruption) Right.  Well, that’s true.  The next thing to happen would be every tinhorn government dictator and bloated bureaucracy in the world would be lining up demanding that Apple exercise its morality with them.  And then what would they say Apple should do?  “They should pay it! They should pay what these governments say.  That’s the only way to have good PR and buzz.  They should do it.  They’ve got so much money, more than they need. Look at that cash wad Apple has.  They don’t need all of that.”  I guess there’s really nothing new in that kind of thinking about wealth and so forth.  What is missing, however, is the acknowledgment or the appreciation for what it took to create that wealth.  And this is what, sadly, is often missing.  People see the wealth.  They don’t have any idea what went into creating it.  And if a corporation’s involved, they might even think it’s all because of cheating, lying, maybe even killing their customers, like Big Pharma does and Big Drug does and Big Oil.  But I doubt, in the real world, it’s not gonna have much of an impact on you.  But it’s an interesting exercise, instructive in taxation and bureaucracy and government and how government behaves.  And they’re out of money.  And it’s not just the European Union.  There isn’t a government in the world that’s in the black.  And they’re gonna go look for money wherever they can get it.  If it’s your pension fund that your money’s in, if it’s a 401(k), if it’s a hedge fund, don’t put it past ’em, in dire straits.

Sep 2nd 2016, 8:00 PM 19,025 Views 68 Comments Share42 Tweet Email Image: Leah Farrell IT WAS “CRUEL” of Europe’s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager to say that Ireland could spend the €13 billion Apple tax rebate in whatever way it sees fit. Following today’s Cabinet meeting, in which government ministers decided to appeal the Apple tax ruling, Independent Alliance TD Kevin Boxer Moran said it was wrong to make such statements in public. ‘False hope’ Boxer Moran said “false hope” was given to the Irish people that the money could be spent on hospitals and schools. It is cruel to send out that message to the people of Ireland. This money cannot be spent and even if a time where it does come, we might not receive a penny of it. The decision by all Cabinet members to back an appeal today puts an end to any speculation the government would topple over the Apple tax issue. Despite reports there were rifts between Independent Alliance and Fine Gael members, unity was displayed in front of the cameras today. Minister of State for Training, Skills and Innovation, John Halligan, who was at the centre of dissent in the talks this week, quashed any such sentiments. Staying in power Halligan said he has committed to supporting the government motion in the Dáil next week if it means the government gets to stay in power. He also said that promised improvements to Waterford Regional Hospital were not used as a pawn during discussions on the appeal. Defending his decision to support the appeal, he said there is no certainty that Ireland would get the €13 billion from Apple. I have made my position quite clear. I believe Apple should pay the money. I have also made it quite clear that I don’t think the government should be destabilised or brought down on this issue. There are far more important issues – the Budget, Brexit – that are coming down the line. I think the Independent Alliance have got a good deal. For the first time ever in the history of the State there will be an independent review as to what tax is being paid by the multinationals and if they are paying fair tax. Today, the Independent Alliance said it got what it wanted from the deal – with some compromises – and Minister of State for Disability Finian McGrath said sections two, three and four of the motion “have the prints of the Independent Alliance all over it”. The aspects which commit to the highest international standards of transparency, no preferential tax treatment for companies, and the review of Ireland’s corporation tax policy, “are our blueprints”, claimed McGrath. “When you are in power, in Cabinet, you have to compromise, but the bottom line is we got enough in this package to get our policies over the line and I am very proud of that,” he said. We strongly support the whole principle and economic strategy of having foreign investment in this country, but yes, everybody has to pay their fair share of tax and we managed to get that into the agreement. Boxer Moran said today’s agreement was an example of a new way of politics, that everyone in government and the media would have to get used to. Minister Ross said it is a “core value” of the Independent Alliance that issues such as this are debated and supported by the entire Dáil. “This would have never happened in any other government. It would have just been decided in August. If the Dáil gets more power… the Independent Alliance will be very happy.” Read: Noonan claims Apple ruling an “attack” on Ireland’s corporate tax regime> Read: FactCheck: How many people actually work for foreign companies in Ireland?> Get breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook.

Now, those changes have gone into effect. Apple has put up a web page detailing the new guidelines for developers and offering some "best practices" for app makes who opt into the new services. The new rules allow for auto-renewable subscriptions, free trials of apps, territory-specific pricing (i.e. offer a different price for users in a different country). Perhaps more notably is the change in revenue split: for app developers who have long-term paying subscribers, Apple will only take a 15 percent revenue cut after a year, rather than the standard rev-share plan, in which Apple takes a 30 percent cut and gives the developer 70 percent. And, all types of app makers can now sell their apps as subscriptions. Previously, it was limited to certain types of apps, like cloud-storage apps, or audio and video streaming apps. The most significant changes to the App Store since its launch Apple's App Store changes, which The Verge wrote an in-depth report on back in June of this year, are the most significant changes the company has made to the App Store since its initial launch in 2008. However, the new rules were met with mixed opinions in the app world. Some developers have said that the changes will finally allow them to monetize their app-making businesses in a sustainable way; others, such as Spotify, have been vocal about wanting even more flexibility on how they price their apps in Apple's App Store. There are a fair amount of caveats in all of these changes. For example, in regards to subscription cancellations: in order for an app maker to maintain the 85/15 revenue share split with Apple per subscriber, a user who cancelled would have to resubscribe to the app within 60 days. And, app makers can't "offer a three-month subscription at an introductory price of $2.99 and then raise the price to $3.99," according to the developer web page, because it would raise the price for all users. One thing's certain: now that more developers can finally start taking advantage of subscriptions, we'll be able to get a sense of how fruitful is actually is for them in the coming months.

We noted last month that Apple Watch inventory was shrinking ahead of Apple’s expected fall event, and now it appears that almost all stainless steel Apple Watch models are sold out online and in limited supply in stores. Only one version of the steel Apple Watch is available to order online, and seven of the aluminum Apple Watch Sport models are sold out as well. This could mean a few things for Apple Watch 2 news at Apple’s September 7 ‘iPhone 7’ event. We’re expecting Apple to introduce a new Apple Watch 2 with a faster processor and an embedded GPS for mapping workouts and using Maps, but it’s unclear how soon new models will hit stores. Depleted inventory this many days before an event and possible launch date suggest Apple Watch 2 could be available in stores earlier in the month rather than several weeks after the announcement. Apple Watch Sport is also more available than the pricier Apple Watch models. Out of 16 Apple Watch model, only one model can be purchased from Apple’s website for delivery. Seven versions of the Apple Watch Sport are also sold out online, which leaves 15 other options that are available to order for delivery. This could suggest that first-generation stainless steel Apple Watches are discontinued while Apple keeps older Sport models around to hit a lower price. Even if we weren’t expecting a second-generation Apple Watch, depleted inventory of certain models could also mean that Apple is simply changing up the bands offered or awaiting watchOS 3’s release to ship models with the latest software. But there’s another aspect to consider. Analyst firm KGI expects a new Apple Watch 2 and a modified Apple Watch 1 with a slightly faster processor. That means two new Apple Watch models: one with several new components including a GPS and a much faster chip, and one with the existing components and a somewhat snappier chip. If Apple does introduce a totally updated Apple Watch 2 and a slightly faster (and cheaper) Apple Watch 1, that doesn’t leave much room in the lineup for further discounted Apple Watches that haven’t been refreshed (and the lineup may be confusing enough already). At any rate, it looks like Apple made just enough Apple Watches to sell before the new models are introduced without much excess. Apple’s September 7 event kicks off in San Francisco at 10 am PT/1 pm ET. 9to5Mac will have full coverage so stay tuned.

Featured Story Authorities claim 97 percent property-owners paid taxes last year DUBLIN, Ireland - According to Irish tax authorities, as many as 97 percent of all property owners paid taxes last year. The tax authorities have said they collected as much as 463 million euros from tax last year.  Astonishingly, a huge number of people have already paid the taxes for this year. However, this wasn’t without prompting owners to do so: The tax collection authorities had to send as many as 300,000 warning letters telling owners to pay up, or face consequences. Further, those who are yet to pay up their taxes can do so via an electronic cheque, also called an annual debit authority by the Revenue Department. Owners doing so must inform tax officials about the same by Wednesday. All the tax shall be hence withdrawn from their accounts in March. Michael Gladney, Collector General, has stated that since the Revenue Department took charge of tax collection in 2013, as much as 64 million dollars have been collected.  Moreover, as many as 360,000 properties have been taken over by the department following non-payment of taxes on the owner’s behalf. The collector general said in a statement, “The vast majority of property owners fully comply with their local property tax payment obligations, either in a single payment or with phased payments. As long as payment obligations are being met, Revenue will automatically roll over existing payment methods for property owners who pay by direct debit or by deduction at source from pay/pension.” Find Irish Sun on Facebook Latest Irish Sun news Huge surge in electrical goods sales help to boost retail figures DUBLIN, Ireland - The Central Statistics office has released figures that show a rise of ...

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Boost Performance on Your Older iPhone or iPad Every year, Apple comes out with new iPhones and iPads and a new version of iOS. While it’s a good idea to stay current on software, few can afford to buy new hardware every year, or even every few years. If your iPhone or iPad is showing its age, try these tricks to squeeze out a bit more performance. Even though Apple strives to keep iOS running well on older iPhones and iPads, the sad truth is, eventually they won’t be able to keep up. Plus, as apps become more advanced, they too won’t run as quickly. So, aside from falling into an endless upgrade cycle, what can you do? Turns out, there are quite a few things. Restart Your Phone Have you tried turning it off and on again? It sounds silly, but we all know that the most time-tested way to sole problems is to just restart your device. To do this, just hold down the power button until the “Slide to power off” control appears, power off you device and then start it again. We understand, this method has usually been the domain of Windows users, but it can work for a sluggish iPad or iPhone as well. Give that a try before you go changing settings. Reduce Graphics Overhead by Disabling Eye Candy Graphics comprise a great deal of performance overhead. On newer iPhones and iPads, everything seems seamless and liquid, but as your device ages, you might start to notice some stuttering and lag. To improve things, open Settings, then head to General > Accessibility. There are two settings groups here that you’ll want to look at: Increase Contrast and Reduce Motion. First, tap open Increase Contrast and then turn Reduce Transparency on. This removes the transparency effects you see on certain UI elements, such as the control center. Instead of seeing a hint of your icons underneath, it’s grey and opaque. This requires less processing power for your device to draw and should speed things up a bit. The other item you can consider is Reduce Motion. This will reduce a lot of unnecessary animations, like the parallax effect on your home screen. Those items will go a long way to speeding up your device, but there are obviously others. Delete Apps and Free Up Space If your iPhone’s storage is very full–as in, close to zero free space left–deleting apps you’re not using may help improve performance in certain areas. Also, many apps employ background processes that use precious resources, such as the aforementioned background refresh, so uninstalling apps you don’t use can go a long way. Make sure you’ve got the General settings open and tap Storage & iCloud Usage. Under Storage, tap Manage Storage. Now that you’re on the Storage screen, you will see all your apps and the space they consume in descending order. For most apps, just tap on it and choose “Delete App” to uninstall it. You can also do this from the home screen, but this view lets you see how much space you’re freeing up as you go, which is nice. Again, you don’t to go crazy deleting stuff to improve performance, though it is nice to have a buffer of free space so you have room for new photos and things like that. RELATED ARTICLE 5 Things You Need to Know About Your iPhone’s Photos App Some apps, such as the Podcasts app, will give you the option of purging the data contained therein, but this is an irregular occurrence. Also, if you want to free up space, you might look within those apps themselves–cleaning out certain podcast episodes or old photos and videos you don’t want is a great way to get back some of that space. Do Away with App Refreshes Background app refreshing is a surefire way to gobble up precious resources on your device. Luckily, you can disable them–though be advised that disabling them means opening up apps to see anything new.They won’t update in the background. Head into the Settings, if you aren’t there already, and head to General > Background App Refresh. You have two choices here: you can disable them wholesale, or individually. You might try disabling individual apps at first to see how that affects performance. If it doesn’t help, try disabling them all in one go. This option will also likely get more life out of your battery too, so it definitely has its advantages. Clear Out Your Messages While it’s unlikely to slow down your entire phone, many users have found that storing hundreds or thousands of text messages can cause the Messages app itself to slow down–after all, that’s a lot of information for it to index. So, from time to time, it may be wise to clear out your Messages app if it’s starting to feel laggy. To delete individual messages, you can swipe to the left to reveal a Delete button… …or delete multiple messages by tapping the “Edit” button in the corner and selecting the messages you want to delete. Most likely, though, you’ll want to limit your message history and delete items over a certain age. Open the Settings app on your iPhone and scroll down to and tap open Messages, then tap Keep Messages to limit your message history to a year or 30 days. Disable Siri Suggestions As cool as it may be, Spotlight Search can be a little resource intensive on less capable devices. Turning off the Siri suggestions that show up when you search can help move things along. Once again, in the General settings, tap open Spotlight Search. Just like with background app refreshes, you can elect to go the individual route or turn it all off at once. Again, how you go about it is up to you, if you find this feature useful, but there are things you might not need results for, and you can thus disable them. Use Apple’s Apps Third-party apps often offer more functionality than Apple’s built-in apps, but they can also require more resources–resources that an older iPhone or iPad won’t necessarily have. If third-party apps are feeling slow, try using one of Apple’s built-in offerings instead (for example, try Safari instead of Google Chrome). Since they don’t get updated as often–and since Apple takes great care in developing their apps to run well–they may have more longevity on old devices than new, constantly-updating apps do. Be Careful with iOS Updates You might think that updating to the latest version of iOS will improve performance, but this isn’t always the case. In fact, sometimes it’s better to not update, especially on an old device. Historically, many of Apple’s final updates to an old device–for example, iOS 5 on the first generation iPad–slow the device down to a crawl. That old hardware just isn’t powerful enough to run the latest and greatest, but Apple updates it anyway. This isn’t always the case (some iOS updates really do boost performance), but it just goes to show that you should be careful when your old device shows it has an iOS update waiting. Don’t update it right away–wait a few weeks, and then search the web to see if others are noticing better or worse performance. You can’t downgrade on iOS, so once you update, you’re stuck on that version–so it’s better to wait and see how the update is performing for others. If All Else Fails, Just Start Over If none of the above solutions work, you may have a more serous problem, like data corruption, causing your device to slow down. Sometimes it’s best to just start from a clean slate, which means resetting your device. To do this, open the General settings and scroll down to Reset.   Instead of implementing the nuclear option, you can first try to Reset All Settings, which will remove a lot of data like stored Wi-Fi networks, Touch ID, app permissions and more. But, if that doesn’t work, make sure your important data is backed up, then choose “Erase All Content and Settings”. You’ll have to set your iPhone back up from scratch, but you may find it runs better as a result.   No, Closing Open Apps Won’t Help RELATED ARTICLE No, Closing Background Apps on Your iPhone or iPad Won’t Make It Faster We think it’s also important to dispel a widespread myth here: contrary to popular belief, “clearing your RAM” and closing open apps won’t do much of anything for general performance (though it can help fix a stuck app). In fact, this will force all your apps to start from scratch the next time you open them, which will make things take longer–not go faster. Hopefully these tips will give you some improvements when it comes to giving your old iOS devices a new lease on life. Obviously they won’t be as fast as the latest and greatest, but they will at least give you maybe another year or so before you inevitably have to upgrade. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (3 REPLIES) September 4, 2016 Cam On older devices, such as ones that are 32 bit (iPhone 5c or older) can be downgraded in various ways. On A4 devices, they can be tether downgraded without shsh blobs and untherthered with shsh blobs. On other (jailbroken) 32 bit devices, kloader can be used, however, you need to have your shsh blobs saved for the version you want to downgrade to.Aside from downgrading, there are certain jailbreak tweaks that can also speed up an old device. September 5, 2016 John If you update to the latest on iOS, you can indeed downgrade if apple is still signing the IPSW firmware. Usually after a new version of iOS is released, apple will let you downgrade to the earlier version for around a week or two after the newest version comes out. So when iOS 10 comes out, you will, for a period of time be able to downgrade back to 9.3.5. However you will only be able to do this if apple is still signing the 9.3.5 firmware. If you do upgrade to version 10 and don't like it and want to downgrade back to 9.3.5 for any reason, this is the way to do it, using the signed IPSW file and iTunes.

Apple already said it will appeal against the ruling. E.U. competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Tuesday that deals between Apple and the Irish tax authorities in 1991 and 2007 contravened E.U. rules on state aid, which outlaw preferential treatment for individual companies. The deals enabled Apple to channel European sales through Ireland and benefit from an ultra-low tax bill — sliding from 1% of its European profits in 2003 to 0.005% in 2014. The E.U. said Apple will have to pay back the money they pocketed from those arrangements, with the Irish government ordered to recover the unpaid taxes, plus interest. The Irish government on Friday recommended an appeal against the E.U. ruling but said it would summon lawmakers to parliament on Wednesday to debate the issue. Ireland’s Finance Minister Michael Noonan said: “The government has decided unanimously to bring an appeal before the European courts to challenge the European Commission’s decision on the Apple state-aid case.” He added: “I believe that there are some very important principles at stake in this case and that a robust legal challenge before the courts is essential to defend Ireland’s interests. The full amount of tax was paid in this case and no state aid was provided. Ireland did not give favorable tax treatment to Apple.” However, some Irish politicians opposed the government’s position and favored keeping the extra taxation it would receive. Mary Lou McDonald, deputy leader of the opposition Sinn Fein party, said: “It’s an agenda that has nothing to do with standing by the people of Ireland. What it demonstrates is an absolute disregard and disdain for citizens, fair play and tax justice.” The Irish government felt compelled to appeal against the decision as it may set a precedent and threaten its low-tax deals with other multinationals.

The deal overcomes a split in cabinet over the 13 billion euros ($15 billion) plus interest that the EU says Apple owes in back taxes, putting Ireland at the centre of a row between Europe and the United States. Apple chief exec Tim Cook has urged the government to appeal the ruling to secure future investments; however, opinion polls have shown public support for Ireland taking the money and spending it on social services. A finance ministry spokesman told AFP there had been a "unanimous decision by the cabinet to appeal the decision" by the European Commission. Parliament will meet next Wednesday, ahead of its scheduled return on Sept. 27, officials said. Earlier this week, three independent ministers propping up the government had refused to back the appeal and said they wanted greater transparency about corporate tax arrangements for multinationals.

The recall comes just days before Apple is expected to unveil the latest version of its iPhone.” “Along with the expense of fixing the phones, Samsung could face lost sales if consumers grow wary of its products. Samsung said it expected that manufacturing replacement phones would take two weeks. Consumers who have already bought the phones will receive replacements before new phones go on sale, the company said. Samsung did not indicate the cost of the recall,” Mozur and Lee report. “The recall is a major blow to Samsung.” “The company faces pressures across its product line, with Apple on the high end and new Chinese brands on the lower end,” Mozur and Lee report. “Apple is set to show off its latest iPhone on Sept. 7.

Samsung is a POS! 😛 markbriton Friday, September 2, 2016 - 2:48 pm · Reply I don’t delight in this news, it’s a worry that many people may get hurt. Samsung have obviously done the right thing by quickly acknowledging the issue and recalling the device, but they have not said whether customers should continue using/charging their new phones in the meantime, which seems dangerous to me. SorrySam Friday, September 2, 2016 - 2:51 pm · Reply Since its release, samdung only able to sell 2.5 million? And smartphone marketing consultants, analysts keep saying samdung is the no.1 smartphone seller? Now its very very obvious that these analyst consutants are fuc**ng WRONG. Xennex1170 Friday, September 2, 2016 - 8:02 pm · Reply In the source article the units sold in China had a different supplier for the battery module and are not affected. So you’ll have to add the quantity shipped in China to get closer to the ‘true’ total of units shipped out or sold. Considering it has not been released in the UK till yesterday, been on pre-order for about a month and actually in consumers hands for almost 2 weeks elsewhere, 2.5 million units (plus unit count from China) seems pretty impressive to me. Voice of reason Saturday, September 3, 2016 - 3:27 am · Reply In the same period of time Apple will sell upwards of 15 million iPhones. And the 2.5 million number isn’t the number sold, since Samsung does not share that data. That’s the total number of units they have SHIPPED to retailers, which is not the same as sales, stop thinking it is. So, no that’s not an impressive number of devices to get to customers, but it is a massive amount of devices affected by an issue. Xennex1170 Saturday, September 3, 2016 - 8:48 am · Reply Considering that less than 40 units have been reported, recalling 2.5 million that are possibly affected with the same battery is quite notable in credit to Samsung considering the safety of their devices and taking action to remedy the problem. Apple having way more funds than Samsung does not seem so proactive to problems with their own devices, rather giving an excuse first then possibly apologizing or acting later. Voice of reason Saturday, September 3, 2016 - 12:49 pm · Reply Other than the fact the “issues” with Apple devices are blown completely out of proportion, misrepresented, falsified, and repeated ad Naseum until people think they’re true. Apple fixes the affected products, and keeps selling them because they wouldn’t release something with a flaw like that. The simple fact that Samsung has to recall that many devices means that a higher than 1-3% of them likely are defective (which is considered a normal/good rma rate for a product) you only do a massive recall if it’s systemic, and it looks like that’s the case here. Since they have to “remanufactur” devices with a different battery connector. This is an actual problem, that could kill people…. It explodes/catches on fire. it is not the same as the signal strength indicators algorithm being wrong, and people not understand cellular attenuation, or people intentionally bending devices with more force than any normal human would put on a device, or a laptop battery production issue that affected every manufacturer on the planet. This is simply a lack of quality control and shouldn’t happen. Don’t make excuses for a company that blatantly steals designs and makes their devices look as similar as possible to apple’s to trick people into buying them. Every Apple “scandal” you’ve ever heard is most likely fud. The only one that I remember actually being true is the laptop battery issue a few years ago (which effected everybody), and the video card issue in the one generation of 15″ unibody MacBook Pro. But that didn’t necessitate a recall because it affected less than 1 in 10,000 devices and was not systemic. Now this phone problem with the note obviously affects a significant percentage or no recall would be put in place, they would simply replace the unit with another one, but they have to REMANUFACTURE the entire device for a replacement…. This is a real problem. Voice of reason Friday, September 2, 2016 - 4:00 pm · Reply They deserve this… Karma is a bitch. And I am STILL waiting for the outcry from everyone on the tech channels. Hopefully all of the assholes who got paid to promote this piece of shit come to their senses and inform their viewers. Herself Saturday, September 3, 2016 - 1:15 am · Reply There will be little, if any, outcry. Only Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft merit the “outcry” label according to Jouranalism 2001. Smash Friday, September 2, 2016 - 4:19 pm · Reply Samsung has balls. Apple not so much. Antenna gate? You are holding it wrong! Light Leaks? Within spec. Bend gate? Don’t grab it. Exploding iPhones? You are charging it wrong. Touch Disease? RECALL COMING!!! No I lied… You got screwed by Smashpple. Voice of reason Saturday, September 3, 2016 - 1:08 pm · Reply Ok, you’re a troll but I’m going to feed you anyway: Atennagate: not a real thing, the signal strength algorithm was incorrect and Steve jobs himself admitted that and it was fixed. Secondly, people were holding it wrong… In order to get the iPhone 4 prior to algorithm adjustment to even do it, you had to wedge the thing into your palm and cover up all 3 ateanna bands. But blown completely out of proportion, and didn’t necessitate a recall. Light leaks: not a real thing. Affected ~31 devices, and anyone who was concerned about it got a new phone for free. But nothing had to be remanufactured or recalled, because again, not a real thing. Bend gate: not a real thing. A guy makes a video on YouTube deliberately applying too much force to the product, an amount of force by the way, which bent every other phone released that year including the Galaxy s5. Apple used much stronger aluminum in the 6s just to eliminate people even trying it this time. But it wasn’t a real thing, again no recall necessary. Exploding phones: 2 iPhone 4’s in China caught fire because they were using unlicensed cheap chargers! Using real chargers doesn’t cause that problem. Touch disease: not a real thing. Yes, many repair shops say they’ve seen it, but the Apple Store replaces the unit for free, and it is not something that people can reproduce effectively enough to cause a big kerfuffle. So? Not a thing. Every iPhone supposedly has some massive problem, except they don’t, and since they’re made up “scandals” they die pretty quickly now since our customer base is so much bigger. This isn’t like the old days when a zombie Apple lie wouldn’t die. 1 2 Next » Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps Samsung makes global recall of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones SE YOUNG LEE Last updated 06:16, September 3 2016 Faulty batteries prompt a global recall of the Samsung Note.7 Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has recalled all Galaxy Note 7 smartphones equipped with batteries it has found to be fire-prone and halted their sales in 10 markets, denting a revival of the firm's mobile business. Koh Dong-jin, head of the South Korean company's smartphone business, expressed regret over the recall, which will affect markets including South Korea and the United States, at a news conference on Friday. Models in China feature a different battery and are not being recalled by the world's biggest smartphone vendor. KIM HONG-JI/Reuters A model demonstrates waterproof function of Galaxy Note 7 new smartphone during its launching ceremony in Seoul, South Korea. The recall comes just over two weeks after the launch of Samsung's latest premium phone, which features an outsized screen and high-resolution camera, and follows reports of the phone igniting while charging.

In New Zealand, customers were still able to buy the phone on the company's website as of Friday night. The recall comes at a critical time for Samsung, just a week before Apple Inc is set to introduce new iPhone models at its annual September event. The Korean company had gambled that positive reviews for the new device, which features iris-reading technology, would lead to robust sales. "This is a P.R. disaster for Samsung" https://t.co/z39VzdkM9r pic.twitter.com/VpsPKomf3K— CNNTech (@cnntech) September 2, 2016 Koh, who declined to comment on the number of phones needing replacement, said Samsung had sold 2.5 million of the premium devices so far. The manufacturer plans to replace not only phones with faulty batteries sold to consumers, but also retailer inventories and units in transit. Nomura estimated that more than 1 million units have been sold to end consumers. "I can't comment on exactly how much the cost will be, but it pains my heart that it will be such a big number," Koh said. Ad Feedback The scale of the recall is unprecedented for Samsung, which prides itself on its manufacturing prowess. While recalls in the smartphone industry do happen, including for rival Apple Inc , the nature of the problem for the Galaxy Note 7 is a serious blow to Samsung's reputation, analysts said. It must act quickly to minimise damage to its smartphone recovery, after a string of product successes had reversed a fall in market share, they added. CUSTOMERS PUT ON HOLD The phone first launched in 10 markets in North America, Asia and the Middle East. Further roll-outs have occurred since in markets like China, where sales started just this week. Its wider availability, set for coming weeks, is now on hold. While there are occasional reports of phones catching fire or otherwise burning users, documented cases that lead to widespread product recalls remain relatively rare. Samsung said it was aware of 35 reports of affected Note 7 batteries. In 2007, the largest battery recall in consumer electronics history took place when Nokia, then the world's top mobile handset maker, offered to replace 46 million phone batteries produced for it by Japanese maker Matsushita Battery. Germany's biggest operator Deutsche Telekom said it had stopped delivering orders for the Galaxy Note 7, while French operator Orange said on its website that it had stopped pre-sales of the phone and postponed its planned sales launch - scheduled for Friday. In Britain, mobile carriers EE and Vodafone continue to accept pre-orders for the Note 7 on their sites. A Vodafone spokesman said its planned September 19 sales launch could now slip, but was waiting for more details from Samsung to decide. US operators have been taking pre-orders since early August. The No 1 US wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc said it had stopped selling the Galaxy Note 7 in light of customer safety, as did No 2 carrier AT&T. Target, a major US retailer, also said it had halted sales of the Note 7. If a customer wants to return or exchange the Galaxy Note 7, Verizon said it would waive the restocking fee it charges customers through September 30. T-Mobile US, majority owned by Deutsche Telekom, also said it has suspended sales, while Sprint could not be reached immediately for comment. SECOND-HALF HOPES Samsung has said it aimed for the Note 7 to maintain strong sales momentum in the second half of the year against stiffening competition from the likes of Apple Inc, which is widely expected to release its latest iPhone next week. "I am concerned more about a potential reduction in sales than recall costs," said analyst Jay Yoo at Korea Investment & Securities. "The recall is likely to be a blow to earnings." Samsung said new sales of the Note 7 in affected markets would resume after it deals with replacements, a process it expects will begin in about two weeks. The firm would extend refund periods for affected customers and offer exchanges for other Samsung phones, Koh said. Investors sold Samsung shares after the delay announcement on Thursday, stripping about US$7 billion from the firm's market value, which remains just off recent record highs. Sentiment recovered somewhat in trading on Friday as the shares rose 0.6 percent compared with 0.3 percent in the broader market. HI Securities analyst James Song said the replacement costs may be somewhat limited as Samsung could recycle components of the recalled phones. "It is clever for Samsung to replace the affected models, not offering fixes. That helps enhance consumer confidence and help reduce potential falls in future sales," he said. *comments are closed  - Reuters Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: Google shelves plan for phone with interchangeable parts Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines Africa's next top programmer Norway's risky switch to digital Everything Samsung at Las Vegas Space scientist's world tour How dating works in 2017 New 'Star Trek' smartphone Watchdog eyes Steam refunds Car with a mind of its own Zuckerberg's 2017 personal challenge FaceTime blamed for fatal crash Fear not, droids won't kill jobs World's first Street View skydive McDonald's hungry for NZ tech Google app scans your photo memories Tech you can expect in 2017 Ad Feedback Most popular Viewed Shared Commented US airport shooter had gun in checked bag: Five dead, eight wounded at Florida's Fort Lauderdale airport 'Racist' passport request riles New Zealand citizen of 10 years Man shot by police in Whanganui had violent history Jamie Oliver to shut six UK restaurants, blaming Brexit for making ingredients too expensive Woman's body found on beach near Opotiki Dealer with Mr Asia ties, who 'changed the Wellington drug scene', has died Waikato man slapped by rest-home caregiver dies after months living happily with family Morning trivia quiz: January 7 Phantom credits result of timing issue processing debit card transactions Missing boatie Alan Langdon estranged from close family The health reason behind why you need to wash new clothes before wearing them Dealer with Mr Asia ties, who 'changed the Wellington drug scene', has died Rolleston or Rangiora: Which is Christchurch's premier satellite town?

(Credit: Andrew Burton/Getty Images) × Mac Users Urged by Apple to Download OS X and Safari Immediately to Fix Critical Security Issue The Apple store on Fifth Avenue is seen on Jan. 26, 2016, in New York City. (Credit: Andrew Burton/Getty Images)  Apple is asking Mac users to update OS X and Safari immediately in order to fix a critical security issue. A week ago, researchers at mobile security firm Lookout and University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab announced the discovery of critical iOS security issues used to hack the iPhones of activists and journalists. Researchers traced the previously undiscovered exploits back to an Israeli “cyber war” company, the NSO Group. NSO openly sells software that it says can track a person’s mobile phone — and many of its clients are governments. The same day, Apple released an update to patch the issues for iPhones and iPads running iOS 9. Now, it appears the same vulnerabilities can be used on its Safari browser and OS X. On Thursday, Apple released security updates for OS X Yosemite and OS X El Capitan. To install them, open the App Store on a Mac and click the Updates icon. There’s also an update for Safari 9.1.3. According to Apple’s Safari update description, the exploit means if you accidentally visit a malicious website — say after clicking on a link in a phishing email — an attacker can run code on your system. If you have an iPhone running iOS 9 and haven’t already updated the OS to install the latest security patch, do it now. The issue was first discovered when UAE human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor received suspicious text messages last month. One included a link with malware that, if opened, would give attackers access to his incoming and outgoing messages, the phone’s camera and microphone, and his location. Regularly installing software updates is a vital part of keeping your systems secure. As tempting as it is to hit that “remind me later” button, don’t put off these updates. 37.090240 -95.712891 Related stories Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Recalled Worldwide Over Battery Problem New iPhone Malware Allows Attackers to Access Camera, Location; Intercept Texts; See Passwords; Record Phone Calls Filed in: Technology Topics: apple Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email Watch KTLA 5 News Every newscast plus replays streamed online Popular Fort Lauderdale Airport Closed After Mass Shooting Leaves 5 Dead, 8 Injured; Suspected Gunman in Custody NoHo Woman Who Went Missing With Boyfriend Confirmed to Be Dead Near Car Wreckage in Big Sur Area Watch Replay: The 128th Rose Parade Presented by Honda Dog Named ‘Scarface’ Mauls Florida Owners After They Try to Put Sweater on Him Latest News Dallas Woman Sues Uber, Honda for Crash That Allegedly Left Her Paralyzed Investigators Locate Remains of Newborn Baby Buried by Homeless Mother in Riverside Field: Police Search Resumes for Missing L.A.

Matthew Heller September 5, 2016 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* Ireland’s cabinet on Friday agreed to appeal the EU’s decision ordering Apple to pay $14.5 billion in taxes to Dublin, saying it was an attack on the country’s corporate tax regime. The European Commission ruled earlier this week that Ireland granted Apple tax benefits that amounted to “state aid” and enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses between 2003 and 2014. It ordered Ireland to recover unpaid taxes from Apple of up to 13 billion euros, plus interest. Recommended Stories: How to Make Hay out of Trump Tax Plans A Guide to R&D Tax Rules Trump Tax Cut Could Add 20% to Corporate Profits Apple has already said it will appeal to the EU’s General Court and Ireland is following suit after three days of talks between ministers from the right-of-center Fine Gael party, which leads the government, and ministers from the Independent Alliance, a much smaller grouping. A draft motion that will go before Ireland’s parliament next week said the government should appeal the Apple ruling to defend the integrity of Ireland’s tax system, provide tax certainty to businesses and challenge EU encroachment on member states’ sovereignty. “This ruling has seismic and entirely negative consequences for job creation in the future,” Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe said. “Ireland does not do deals with taxpayers,” Finance Minister Michael Noonan said. Asked if he thought the decision was an attack on Ireland’s corporation tax rate, he replied: “I do.” The $14.5 billion tax penalty is equivalent to what Ireland spent last year on funding its struggling health service and some left-of-center political parties have urged the government to accept the judgment and spend the money on a variety of projects. But as The Wall Street Journal reports, “the government’s position is that a failure to challenge the judgment would threaten future investment in Ireland by U.S. companies looking to sell in Europe and other parts of the world, a central pillar of the country’s decades-old growth strategy.” “Successive Irish governments have defended its relatively low 12.5% corporate tax rate despite often fierce criticism from other European governments,” the WSJ added. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said he was “very confident” the EU’s ruling would be overturned on appeal. Post navigation ← Where Are Mobile Payments Headed?

SLIDE SHOW 14 Great Ways to Spend or Invest $1,000 TOOL How Much Income Will You Need in Retirement? BUILDING WEALTH Kiplinger's Wealth Creation Web Conference Series Advertisement Personal Finance Advice from 9 Ways Siri Can Be Your Personal Finance Assistant Apple's voice-activated assistant won't make you rich but it can help you be smarter about your finances without a lot of work. iStock By Tim Lemke September 2, 2016 We're still a few years away from having personal robot assistants, but voice-activated applications on most modern smartphones are already making our lives easier. Apps like Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana can be helpful in a number of ways, and are particularly useful as personal finance helpers. See Also on Kiplinger: Great Apps for Investor I personally use Siri a lot to help me stay on track with my finances, and I am always surprised at how much the app can help me get information without the need to even type or search the web myself. Check out these personal finance tasks that Siri and similar apps can help you with. Advertisement 1. Check Stocks It's easy to use Siri to track the performance of your investments or the overall stock market. Just say, "I need the stock price for Apple," and Siri will tell you the price and the daily movement. It's also an easy way to check on the ticker symbol. 2. Helping You Calculate the Best Bargain Quick, what's a better deal? Three 20-ounce cans of juice for $6, or four 24-ounce cans for $9? To find out, you'll need to calculate prices on a per-ounce basis. Asking Siri to perform some simple math will help you learn that the second deal is a little bit better. 3. Driving Directions Yes, accurate driving directions can help you with your finances. That's because you can plan trips to ensure the shortest route, thus saving you gas. You can also find routes to avoid tolls and bad traffic. 4. Finding the Nearest ATM You need cash right away, but you'd rather not go to the first ATM you see, because it may not be tied to your bank. To avoid a fee, you can ask Siri to find you the nearest branch of your bank or a surcharge-free ATM. Advertisement 5. Research Food Ingredients When you're at the grocery store, you may come across products that like to tout certain ingredients, and you sometimes pay a premium for them. ("Sweetened with agave nectar!") Before you buy, you may want to do a little bit of research on what these ingredients are and whether they are worth paying extra for. Siri and similar apps can help you with this. 6. Set Reminders You never want to be late paying your bills, and you don't want to be charged for missing things like doctor's appointments. You can use Siri to remind you of important things. All you need to do is tell Siri what you want to be reminded about, and when. ("Remind me to finish this article for Wise Bread at 10 p.m.") There's even location-based reminders, like "Remember to mail the mortgage check when you are near the post office." You can also use Siri to adjust or create to-do lists on your phone. 7. Figure Out Tips What's 18% of $43.95? And how can you split that four ways? Siri can help you. Siri will even know local taxes, to help you calculate checks before they even come. 8. Find Out How Much Things Cost Using Siri, you can look up pricing information for a wide range of products. If you simply ask "Find me prices for a Toyota Corolla," it will provide you MSRP and invoice prices, plus other related charges, and even shows a chart with historical price information. It's still not easy to do true comparison shopping, but you'll learn enough to know if a particular store is trying to rip you off. Advertisement 9. Find Budgeting Apps If you need some extra personal finance help from your smartphone, Siri can help you find it. A simple query like, "Find me some budgeting apps," will give you a list of saving and money management apps from the app store.

The Commission last week ruled that a tax deal between Apple and Ireland was illegal . It called on Ireland to claw back more than a decade worth of unpaid tax which, with interest, could soar to £14billion. Ireland’s Government formally agreed to appeal against the Commission ruling. However, it also committed to hold an independent review of the country’s corporate tax system.

After just two weeks on sale and 35 faulty phone batteries reported so far, Samsung on Friday issued a global recall of Note 7 and promised to replace every unit already sold. SEE ALSO: IFA 2016: Sony Unveils its Xperia XZ Flagship with 23MP Camera, X-Reality Engine and More "To date (as of September 1) there have been 35 cases that have been reported globally and we are currently conducting a thorough inspection with our suppliers to identify possible affected batteries in the market," the company said in a statement. "Samsung is committed to producing the highest quality products and we take every incident report from our valued customers very seriously. In response to recently reported cases of the new Galaxy Note7, we conducted a thorough investigation and found a battery cell issue," it added. According to experts, this is bad news especially at a time when Samsung had a momentum going in its favour. "Market sentiments are not with Apple at the moment and Samsung had to have a good run in months to come, buoyed by its super-successfull S7 and S7 Edge devices and now Note 7. The global recall news is a godsend for Apple which is prepared to unveil another flagship device iPhone 7 on September 7," Tarun Pathak, Senior Analyst, Mobile Devices and Ecosystems, Counterpoint Research in New Delhi, told IANS. Giving a refreshing look to its Note series, South Korean giant Samsung last month launched its Galaxy Note 7 in India for Rs 59,900 with iris biometric scanner for enhanced security, upgraded S Pen and a dual-curved screen. "For customers who already have Galaxy Note 7 devices, we will voluntarily replace their current device with a new one over the coming weeks," Samsung noted. "The battery explosion issue will surely put a dent in Samsung's market in days to come. How quickly it fixes the problem will be something to watch out for. The turnaround time matters a lot," noted Krishna Mukherjee, Analyst (Telecoms) at market research firm CyberMedia Research (CMR), in Gurgaon.

According to Pathak, Samsung has to come up with an aggrasive marketing strategy to overcome this issue else Galaxy series sales will nosedive in upcoming quarters for sure. "Till then, it is Apple that will have the momentum back in its favour after sluggish growth and fall in iPhone sales," he told IANS.

Home News Europe Irish government to appeal against EC's Apple tax ruling Irish government to present parliamentary motion seeking endorsement of its decision to appeal European Commisison's order to collect €13 billion in undue tax benefits from Apple 2 September 2016, 7:07pm Print Version The European Commission has ordered Ireland to recover €13 billion in undue tax benefits from Apple Ireland’s Cabinet has agreed to appeal the European Commission’s order to collect €13 billion in undue tax benefits from Apple. “This is about Ireland, it is about our people, it’s about us as a sovereign nation, actually setting out what we consider our appropriate policies,” Taoiseach Enda Kenny said after a Cabinet meeting. A government spokesperson said that a motion will be presented before the Dail (Parliament) on Wednesday, seeking an endorsement of the Cabinet’s decision. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan said that the EC had overstepped a mark in attempting to dictate tax laws and impose current laws on a tax deal that had been struck with Apple 25 years ago. “I believe that there are some very important principles at stake in this case and that a robust legal challenge before the courts is essential to defend Ireland’s interests,” he said. “How could any investor come to Europe if their business was subject to retrospective taxes two decades later?” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said he was “very confident” the EC’s ruling would be overturned on appeal, lambasting the decision as “maddening” and “political”. “It’s disappointing, it’s clear that this comes from a political place, it has no basis in fact or in law, and unfortunately it’s one of those things we have to work through,” he said. However, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has insisted it was wrong for Apple to have paid the equivalent of 1% corporation tax on its European profits in 2003 and that this was down to 0.0005% by 2014. “The Commission’s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years,” she said.  Share on Facebook Share on Twitter World [WATCH] Five dead, eight injured in Fort Lauderdal...

The final decision was taken after two days of negotiations in the country's minority Government after concerns were raised by Independent members of the cabinet. The Dail parliament will be recalled next Wednesday to seek support for the appeal. Apple chief executive Tim Cook branded his company's 13 billion euro bill for unpaid taxes in Europe as "political crap", maddening and untrue The ruling by a Brussels competition watchdog - described by Finance Minister Michael Noonan as bizarre and outrageous - found Ireland gave Apple a sweetheart deal which ultimately allowed the iPhone maker to pay 0.005% tax in 2014 - 50 euro for every one million of profit. Mr Noonan said Europe had overstepped the mark in attempting to dictate tax laws and enforce today's laws for something that happened 10 or 20 years ago. "I believe that there are some very important principles at stake in this case and that a robust legal challenge before the courts is essential to defend Ireland's interests," he said. The minister added: "How could any investor come to Europe if their business was subject to retrospective taxes two decades later?" The tech giant's chief executive Tim Cook branded the numbers set out in Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's ruling as untrue, "political crap", and maddening. As part of the independents' support for the appeal Ireland's corporation tax system is to be reviewed, but it will not include any possibility of a change to the generous and much-maligned rate of 12.5%. On the face of it, when the Dail sits, Ireland's politicians will be asked to back plans to turn down a multibillion-euro windfall, albeit one that would have to be held in a bank account for several years while the legal challenges run their course. At the same time there is massive concern that Ireland would suffer reputational damage to an economy heavily reliant on multinationals if it does not fight Apple's corner. In the wake of the ruling, Ap ple also confirmed it has made provisions on its balance sheets for 30 billion US dollars of tax bills in the US. Mr Cook defended his company's attitude to tax and said it paid 400 million US dollars corporation tax in Ireland in 2014 and another 400 million US dollars of similarly classed tax in the US that year. He put its corporation tax bill at 26.1%. L eft-leaning political groups in Ireland insist the multibillion-euro tax windfall should go towards public services. Sinn Fein deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said the appeal was wrong and the Government was siding with big business and showing contempt for ordinary citizens. "So this is not about the EU trying to encroach on our tax sovereignty. It is about a level playing pitch and ensuring everyone pays their fair share," she said. The Anti-Austerity Alliance said: " The Government will waste public money taking a case to prevent a potential windfall of billions which could be used to dramatically change the lives of hundreds of thousands of people." Despite the mammoth tax bill, Apple insists it will not abandon Ireland, where it has about 6,000 employees and is planning to build a huge data centre.

Lauderdale airport shooting (VIDEO) Happy ending for missing Troodos trio Dherynia murder suspect in police custody Trump calls Russian hacking controversy a ‘witch hunt’ Home / Business / World Business / Ireland to join Apple in fight against EU tax ruling Ireland to join Apple in fight against EU tax ruling September 2, 2016 World Business Leave a comment Ireland’s cabinet agreed on Friday to join Apple in appealing against a multi-billion-euro back tax demand that the European Commission has imposed on the iPhone maker, despite misgivings among independents who back the fragile coalition. The Commission’s ruling this week that the U.S. tech giant must pay up to 13 billion euros (11 billion pounds) to Dublin has angered Washington, which accuses the EU of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the U.S. government. With transatlantic tensions rising, the White House said President Barack Obama would raise the issue of tax avoidance by some multinational corporations at a summit of the G20 leading economies in China this weekend. Paradoxically, Ireland is determined not to accept the tax windfall, which would be equivalent to what it spent last year on funding its struggling health service. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the European Union began investigating Apple’s Irish tax affairs in 2014, arguing that it had to protect a tax regime that has attracted large numbers of multinational employers. On Wednesday, he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers, whose support is vital for the minority government, to agree to fight the ruling by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager that Apple’s low tax arrangements in Ireland constitute illegal state aid. However, he won them over when the cabinet met again on Friday. Noonan said the retroactive nature of the EU ruling was “little short of bizarre and outrageous”. “How could any foreign direct investor come into Europe if they thought the valid arrangements they made under law could be overturned a generation later and they be liable to pay back money,” he said at a news conference. Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe said Dublin stood behind its corporate tax regime as a means of creating jobs. Apple Operations International, a subsidiary of Apple Inc, is seen in Hollyhill, Cork, in the south of Ireland August 30, 2016. REUTERS/Stringer “This ruling has seismic and entirely negative consequences for job creation in the future,” he said. Apple, keen to defend its own interests, has already said it will lodge an appeal. For Fine Gael, the main Irish coalition party, a broader principle is at stake. It wants to take on Brussels to safeguard Ireland’s decades-old low corporate tax policy that has drawn in multinationals such as Apple, creating one in 10 jobs in what was once an impoverished country. A FAIR RATE OF TAX The Independent Alliance, a group of five lawmakers, fell in line after the coalition agreed to conduct a review of what tax multinationals pay and what should they pay. Transport Minister Shane Ross, an Alliance member, defended Apple up to a point. “I think they were acting legally. What they were doing was making use of extraordinary loopholes that existed there,” he told reporters. “Multinationals provide absolutely vital jobs to the economy … (but) multinationals should pay a fair rate of tax in Ireland.” A failure of the Alliance to come on board would have cast doubt on the government’s survival prospects. Dublin has just over two months to lodge an appeal to the EU’s General Court. If that fails, Dublin has said it plans to take the case to the European Court of Justice. The issue goes to parliament on Wednesday next week, when lawmakers will be recalled from their summer break. The main opposition party, Fianna Fail, also favours challenging Brussels, so the government should easily win the Dail’s backing to fight what is by far the largest anti-competition measure imposed on a company by the EU. Some Irish voters are astounded that the government might turn down the money, and the left-wing Sinn Fein party has led attacks from the opposition. Apple was found to be holding over $181 billion in accumulated profits offshore, more than any U.S. company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning nonprofit groups, a policy critics say is designed to avoid paying U.S taxes. But Apple chief executive Tim Cook has said part of the company’s 2014 tax bill would be paid next year when the company repatriates offshore profits to the United States. OBAMA TO TAKE THE LEAD The U.S. government is keen to ensure that it, and not Ireland, gets the revenue. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said leaders of the G20 developed and emerging economies would tackle the wider issue when they meet in the Chinese city of Hangzhou on Sept. 4-5. “The president will … lead the discussion at the G20 about combating tax avoidance strategies that are implemented by some multinational corporations,” Earnest said. “We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair – more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States.” A number of G20 governments are worried about how multinationals move profits around so they end up getting taxed in a country that has very low corporate rates. Last year the Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development unveiled new measures to tackle corporate tax avoidance. A number of countries have moved to implement some of them measures, but the United States has not. It needs to change its own tax rules which, for example, allow companies to build up tax-free profits offshore. However, Congress has struggled for years to agree such reforms.

Irish finance minister Michael Noonan promises to fight EC decision over Apple back taxes 2 Sep 2016 at 17:51, Kieren McCarthy The Irish government formally decided to appeal the European Commission's $14.5 billion back-tax demand on Friday. "There are some very important principles at stake in this case," said the country's finance minister Michael Noonan. "A robust legal challenge before the courts is essential to defend Ireland's interests." "The full amount of tax was paid in this case and no state aid was provided. Ireland did not give favorable tax treatment to Apple," he added. The cabinet decision was unanimous, Noonan said, but the issue itself has sparked a heated discussion among politicians. Deputy leader of opposition party Sinn Fein, Mary Lou McDonald, said the decision to allow Apple to pay such little tax "demonstrates an absolute disregard and disdain for citizens, fair play and tax justice." Parliament will be reconvened next week for a special session to debate the matter. The EC, for its part, has said it will defend its ruling in court. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on Friday: "All of us benefit when businesses pay their fair share of tax. It's not in the interest of the individuals and businesses who do pay tax, if others aren't paying their share." Good deal Earlier this week, the EC determined that a tax arrangement between the electronic giant and Irish tax authorities – which saw Apple move the bulk of its profits to a company that existed only on paper – amounted to illegal state aid. The two-year investigation claimed that Apple had paid a tax rate of just 0.005 per cent in 2014, and calculated that the company owed €13bn ($14.5bn) in back taxes. Both Apple and the Irish tax authorities strongly disputed the claim, arguing that there were no special circumstances and that Apple had paid the full amount of tax owed. While the Irish establishment stands by its arrangement, politicians and citizens are less enamored with the arrangement, particularly since the Irish government has imposed tight spending restrictions for nearly a decade following the financial crisis. The huge amount owed has drawn a wide range of comparisons with the money spent on other government services, such as its national health service. Ireland already has one of Europe's lowest corporate tax rates – 12.5 per cent – leading many large US corporations to set up their European headquarters in the country. Apple has stored a significant proportion of its revenue and profits in the country as a way of avoiding what it says would be an effective 40 per cent tax rate if it brought it back into the United States. Apple has been pushing the US government for some time to lower that rate in order for it to "repatriate" the hundreds of billions it holds outside the country; although earlier this week CEO Tim Cook said during an interview about the EC tax demand that he would start bringing some of it back into the country. A spokesperson later "clarified" that he was assuming that the US government would lower its rate later this year. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 72 Comments Whitepapers The 2016 study on the insecurity of privileged users For purposes of this research, privileged users include database administrators, network engineers, IT security practitioners and cloud custodians Can Machine Learning Prevent Application Downtime?

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news Ireland decides it doesn't want Apple's $14.5 billion The country is appealing the decision by the European Commission earlier this week Financial trends and news by Steven Loeb September 2, 2016 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/470f If someone said they wanted to give you $14.5 billion, you'd take it. You wouldn't even think about it. The immediate answer would be, "Yes, please." The Irish cabinet, however, has a different answer, as it has decided to appeal the decision from the European Commission earlier this week, which ruled that it was owed that amount in back taxes from Apple, the New York Times is reporting. This is obviously not a decision that any country would come to lightly, especially given that the money would be the same amount that was spent on the Ireland's health service last year. It took three days to come to this decision, but it isn't over just yet. The country’s Parliament is going to have its own debate about whether or not to appeal next week. On Tuesday, Apple was ordered to pay €13 billion ($14.5 billion) due to "illegal tax benefits" given to it by the Irish government over the last two and a half decades. This was the end result of an investigation that started over two years ago into the tax loopholes several European countries, including Ireland, were offering huge, multinational companies, such as Apple and Starbucks. Ultimately, the European Commission concluded that two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple substantially, and artificially, lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland for the past 25 years.  Ireland is being ordered to recover the unpaid taxes from Apple for the years 2003 to 2014 of up to €13 billion, plus interest.  So why would any country turn down such a huge lump sum of money? There are a couple of reasons for Ireland to do this.  The first has to do with national sovereignty, which Apple CEO Tim Cook made sure to note in a letter written "to the Apple Community in Europe," following the initial decision.  The Commission, he wrote, "is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been. This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters, and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe. Ireland has said they plan to appeal the Commission’s ruling and Apple will do the same. We are confident that the Commission’s order will be reversed," he said. The sovereignty of European nations over the EU has been a hot issue as of late. This ruling comes only two months after similar persuasions led to the United Kingdom voting to leave the European Union.  On top of Ireland's desire to set its own tax policy, there's also the fact that if it did collect, it could be putting in jeopardy its ability to draw investments from U.S. companies, something that has helped the Irish economy over the last few decades. This was another point stressed by Cook. Apple has been operating in Cork, Ireland since 1980, a time when the town "was suffering from high unemployment and extremely low economic investment," he wrote. However, "Apple’s leaders saw a community rich with talent, and one they believed could accommodate growth if the company was fortunate enough to succeed, and, since then, "Countless multinational companies followed Apple by investing in Cork, and today the local economy is stronger than ever." While Ireland doesn't want the money, the U.S. government would gladly take it, and even feels as though it is entitled to it, according to Reuters. "The president will ... lead the discussion at the G20 about combating tax avoidance strategies that are implemented by some multinational corporations," White House spokesman Josh Earnest is quoted as saying. "We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair - more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States."

One of the big hardware upgrades that Apple will surely highlight on stage is the dual-camera tech it’s expected to introduce with far better zoom capabilities. It looks like the new dual-camera could be limited to the larger 5.5-inch models, while one report claimed the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 models will get optical image stabilization, a feature previously limited to the larger 5.5-inch Plus models. Both models will get new 12 megapixel cameras according to the latest supply chain reports. Redesigned Home button. We reported back in June that sources indicated Apple was working on a designed Home button, and since others have backed up our report that the new Home button with haptic feedback-like features could be included in the iPhone 7. No headphone jack. Apple is removing the headphone jack and forcing you to use wireless or Lightning headphones or adapters.  32GB-256GB. It looks like most iPhone users will get a storage upgrade this cycle with several reports pointing to a 32GB base model and a new higher-capacity 256GB model on the high-end. New Space Black color option. We reported previously on Apple’s considerations for a new darker color for iPhone 7. Now with some fresh component leaks adding to our report, it’s looking even more likely that Apple will offer a new color option. And if the part leaks are accurate, it will likely be a darker Space Black-like model. One recent report from supply chain analysts KGI noted both a darker space black and a glossier piano black finish will be offered making for five total color options alongside the current silver, gold, and rose gold.  iOS 10. Currently in beta, you can expect an announcement for the public release of iOS 10 at the event, which means the new and improved Messages features alongside a very long list of other new features will arrive for all. I’ll let Jeff walk you through 75 of them in the video above. Apple Watch 2 | GPS. One of Apple Watch 2’s standout features will likely be the inclusion of a new GPS chip, offering more freedom from the iPhone by enabling the device to offer an enhanced standalone fitness experience and other GPS features. Same design. Apple Watch 2 will include largely the same design according to the supply chain reports, but that doesn’t rule out some new strap and model configurations that could breathe some new life into the current lineup. Apple has reportedly experimented with titanium and other casing materials that could in theory be introduced without changing the overall design of the device, but it’s likely Apple won’t have any other major design changes in store for the second generation Watch. Improved battery life. The watch is also said to include improved performance and battery life, according to the latest component leaks claiming to show a larger battery for the device and other tweaked parts. watchOS 3. One thing we know Apple Watch will be getting is watchOS 3, with notable new features including improved performance, a new Control Center feature, quick access to watch face switching, improved messaging and more. Check out our hands-on with the beta release above.  Accessories | Beats Wireless Headphones. Apple’s Beats PR team this week leaked what appeared to be plans for a new line of Beats headphones to launch alongside iPhone 7. That followed hints at three new wireless Beats models in the works from recent trademark filings. AirPods? Will new Beats wireless headphones be the only thing Apple has for the first iPhone without a headphone jack? We reported earlier this year that it has truly wireless, cord-free earbuds in the works, and later leaks have speculated that hints at “AirPods” branding could be connected to the product. Whether to not Apple will have these ready in time to launch with the iPhone 7 remains to be seen. Lightning EarPods or an Adapter? Another thing we’re expecting to see is either an adapter or Lightning EarPods bundled with the iPhone 7. Even if Apple has its cord-free earbuds ready for launch, it will likely sell those at a premium and offer an adapter or new EarPods with a Lightning connector in the box. macOS Sierra: Apple will announce the release of macOS Sierra next week, currently in developer and public beta. What can you expect? Above Jeff walks us through a ton of new features in the release that Apple will possibly briefly highlight on stage when announcing availability. The highlight feature of the release is the debut of Siri on the Mac, but it also introduces a new universal clipboard, redesigned Apple Music features, and more.  tvOS 10: Along with macOS Sierra, iOS 10, and watchOS 3, Apple will likely release GM seeds of tvOS 10 for the fourth-generation Apple TV next week. Zac gave us a preview earlier this year showing us the new Dark mode feature, YouTube Siri search, HomeKit, & more. There have been several reports that Apple is continuing behind the scenes work on a new video service with the most recent report claiming it was developing a universal TV guide feature for Apple TV, iPhone, and iPad. But there hasn’t been any indication yet Apple will have anything beyond tvOS 10 to show next week. Macbook Pro Concept by Martin Hajek New MacBook Pro? (Wildcard) Apple is planning new thinner MacBook Pros for release in the coming months. We’ve reported extensively on the leaks surrounding the new models, which feature a new OLED touch screen panel above the keyboard. Is Apple planning another event between now and the holidays to announce the new MacBook Pro, or could it possibly be planning to give us a glimpse at the new Macs next week ahead of a release later in the year?

We are finally five days away from Apple revealing its new smartphone. Apple is known for secrecy — most employees won't find out about the new iPhone's details until the day of — so there's a chance that some speculation won't come to fruition. However, thanks to leaked photos and poorly timed press releases, we have a pretty good idea about what you might see come Wednesday. It's possible that your MacBook Pro, iPhone, and Apple Watch could all get some big updates. And how you listen to music might be forever altered. Headphones with wires? Those may soon head to the graveyard of abandoned tech. Click through to see which products you can expect to see next week — and be sure to tune into Refinery29 to learn exactly what Apple does announce.

Apple's desktop software, which shares code with iOS, also shared the vulnerabilities exploited by Pegasus. The Pegasus remote exploit chained three zero-day vulnerabilities, and was discovered after it was deployed unsuccessfully by the United Arab Emirates government against human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor last month. The exploit code was offered to governments by the NSO Group, the Israeli cyberweapons dealer, as lawful intercept spyware for surveilling high-value targets. Pegasus allowed governments to remotely jailbreak a victim's iPhone, install malware and access and control virtually all data on the victim's device. The spyware bugs in OS X, patched here by Apple in OS X El Capitan and Yosemite, include CVE-2016-4655, an information leak in the kernel, described as a "kernel base mapping vulnerability that leaks information to the attacker, allowing him to calculate the kernel's location in memory," and CVE-2016-4656, a kernel memory corruption vulnerability that enables jailbreaking and encompasses "kernel-level vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to silently jailbreak the device and install surveillance software." CVE-2016-4657 is a memory corruption vulnerability in Safari WebKit that allows the attacker to compromise the device when the user clicks on a link to a malicious website; Apple's patch for Safari is here. In other news One of the foundations of network security -- the security of air gapped computers and networks -- was proven vulnerable by a team of Israeli researchers who published their work on USBee, software that can turn a stock USB device connected to an air gapped computer into an RF transmitter. The proof of concept code USBee can be used for transmitting binary data from an unmodified USB device to a nearby receiver, the researchers wrote, although only at a bandwidth of between 20 to 80 bytes per second. The research team from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, in Beersheba, Israel, included Yuval Elovici, professor at the Department of Information Systems Engineering, and security researchers Mordechai Guri and Matan Monitz. A new variant of the Locky ransomware has been spotted being downloaded as encrypted dynamic-link library (DLL files), according to Trend Micro threats analyst Brooks Li, who wrote: "Using a DLL file in this way represents an attempt to try and evade behavior monitoring features that are now part of modern endpoint security products. Running as a DLL prevents a new process from being started, making it harder to detect. Other ransomware families (like CrypMIC/CryptXXX) have used this tactic as well, although for Locky, this is new." Fairware "ransomware" isn't really ransomware, but it wants victims to believe that sending two bitcoins will cause files to reappear on targeted Linux systems. Lawrence Abrams, founder of BleepingComputer.com, reported that the malware was deleting files and demanding ransom, and Duo Labs later found the malware was propagating through insecure instances of Redis, the open source data structure store software used for database, cache and message brokering. Fantom, another tricky piece of ransomware posing as a Windows update, was reported over Twitter by Jakub Kroustek, reverse engineer and malware analyst at AVG: #Fantom #ransomware mimics Windows Update while encrypting your files. https://t.co/ULliqBTti6 pic.twitter.com/F5lz1cQE3v — Jakub Kroustek (@JakubKroustek) August 24, 2016 "The Fantom ransomware uses an interesting feature of displaying a fake Windows Update screen that pretends Windows is installing a new critical update," wrote BleepingComputer.com's Lawrence Abrams. "In the background, though, Fantom is secretly encrypting a victim's files without them noticing."

By Ian Allison September 2, 2016 18:45 BST This week Apple demanded that cryptocurrency wallet Jaxx remove its support of Dash on its iOS app, providing a whitelist of six acceptable tokens, but no rationale for the decision. Apple has categorically stated only the following coins/tokens are allowed on its App Store; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, DOA tokens and Ripple. Anthony Di Iorio, founder of Jaxx, tweeted news Dash was to be removed from Jaxx iOS and this immediately reverberated around the crypto community. Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin stated publicly that, despite being a beneficiary of this instance of (private) regulatory protectionism, he opposes it. Dash is known for providing an extra layer of privacy, which may be a concern to Apple. There has also been news swirling around about the anonymity of Monero and its potential for dark web transactions and such like. To suggest these factors may have influenced Apple's decision is mere speculation, however. The technology giant has stated it will not be disclosing the rationale behind the decision. Di lorio told IBTimes UK: "I don't think it's necessarily Dash-specific. I think it's just that these are the six that have been accepted and nothing else yet." Di lorio, who had introduced Ethereum and then The DAO, and later submitted Dash, explained that Apple allowed the inclusion of Dash initially, but then called him to inform him a mistake had been made by allowing it. He ended up speaking to Apple developer support, which has a team responsible for what is authorised for inclusion in the store and what is excluded. This decision-making process involves a committee. Di lorio said he questioned the reasoning process, specifically how Apple is accepting DAO tokens but not Dash. He said: "There appears to be no real rhyme or reason. They are going coin by coin I believe and who knows what the rationale is; they are certainly not releasing that." Not knowing what triggers a red flag makes it difficult for developers trying to integrate new things and innovate. "It makes things a little tricky for us moving forward, because our goal is to be a universal blockchain wallet that is agnostic to coins," added Di lorio. Apple has a bit of form when it comes to pulling crypto and wallets from its store; it took sudden action against Bitcoin back in 2014 and adopted a similarly recalcitrant stance, but later softened its position. Di lorio made the point that Google also had issues concerning a Kryptokit extension in 2013 because versions of it had been copied and added to the Chrome store. Di lorio said his app was reinstated by Google when they realised they had removed it by accident. "They apologised and they actually came out and said we are Bitcoin fans, and you will have no problem on the Google store putting your stuff up. "It just shows that Android and google is more open to this type of more freedom on their stores and things like that." Di lorio emphasised he only has to remove Dash from iOS in Jaxx; there are seven other platforms that still have it. "So the way our wallet works is you have a 12-word key and that 12-word key enables you to derive all your keys for all your other tokens. "People still have their key on their iOS and they will have two weeks to get their Dash out of there. It will always be in there in the other wallets using their same key."

The change should make it easier to find the apps you’re looking for, improve discoverability, and cut down on apps that aren’t compatible with current iOS versions. Developers trying to manipulate search results with long app names are in for a surprise, too. Apple is cleaning house at the App Store Apple notified Mac and iOS developers of the chance in an email saying, There are also apps on the App Store that no longer function as intended or follow current review guidelines, and others which have not been supported with compatibility updates for a long time. We are implementing an ongoing process of evaluating apps for these issues, notifying their developers, and removing problematic and abandoned apps from the App Store. Apple isn’t planning on going Anakin-in-the-Jedi-temple on apps and instead will give developers a 30 day notice before removing their apps from store listings. Developers can use that time to address the issues targeting their apps for removal, and customers who already bought removed apps will still be able to download them. Developers who try to game the system with extremely long app names need to find a new tactic. “In hopes of influencing search results, some developers have used extremely long app names which include descriptions and terms not directly related to their app,” Apple said. “These long names are not fully displayed on the App Store and provide no user value.” New apps and app updates are now limited to 50 character titles, which should cut down on developers loading up key search terms in their app names. The changes come as good news for users and developers. For users, it means it will get easier to find the apps they really want. For developers, it means they won’t have to deal with as many copycat and unrelated apps showing up when potential customers perform searches. That equates to better discoverability—something the App Store has needed for a long time.

Park Soo Jung, a South Korean high school teacher, stated her phone exploded into flames and released chemical smelling smoke. Jung stated, "If the exploded phone in flame was near my head, I would not have been able to write this post." Ha Joon-doo, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp., stated "Every year, there have been accidents of batter explosions but it is the first time that six or seven cases happened within such a short period after the launch of a new product." USA TODAY A Samsung Galaxy Note 7 being held at the IFA trade fair in Berlin, Germany, Sept. 2, 2016. (Photo: Jannis Mattar, EPA) SAN FRANCISCO — When Samsung released the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone two weeks ago, it appeared to have a critical and commercial hit, selling an estimated 2.5 million units. Then the big, fiery letdown. The South Korean electronics giant suspended sales and announced a recall, after discovering batteries of some phones exploded while they were charging. USA TODAY Samsung to recall Galaxy Note 7 off battery issue The major recall of a well-received product in a fiercely competitive market is a blow to any manufacturer. But it is particularly stinging for Samsung, which is in a pitched battle with LG and Apple, both of which are expected to announce new smartphones next week. Samsung has capitalized on a recent decline in interest in Apple's iPhone, last quarter posting its strongest profits in two years on sales of the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Rivals are circling. In addition to Apple and LG, the company faces increased international competition from Android rivals HTC, Lenovo and Huawei. In a cooling smartphone market worldwide, the Note 7 situation could make an Android user consider an iOS device, but more likely could “make me want to go to another Android maker like LG," says Tuong Nguyen, principal analyst with research firm Gartner. "It’s a pretty tough time in the industry because all the vendors are struggling with keeping consumers regularly updating their devices and anything that puts a hiccup in that is noteworthy," Nguyen says. USA TODAY You bought the Samsung Note 7; now what? While Samsung increased its global sales of smartphones by about 6% in the second quarter of 2016, overall sales of mobile phones worldwide contracted by 0.5%, according to Gartner. Samsung is the global leader in smartphone sales, selling 76.7 million in Q2 2016; Apple is No. 2 with 44.4 million sold. For Samsung, the timing couldn't be worse, say analysts. "It’s a supply-chain issue, a quality-control issue and that, ultimately, makes it a marketing problem," says Paul Teich, an analyst at Tirias Research. "Samsung got a bad bunch of batteries — and you’re only as good as your components." Hunting down the defective batteries and the recall process is an expensive undertaking, says Teich, who recently purchased a Note 7, which he calls a "beautiful piece of work." USA TODAY Lithium-ion problem isn't unique to Samsung In an email message to USA TODAY, Samsung said it has discovered a "small number" — earlier, it said 35 — of defective phones worldwide. “Samsung is taking a proactive approach to address customer needs around the Note 7,” said Tim Baxter, president of Samsung Electronics America. “We are encouraging customers to exchange their Note 7 by taking advantage of our Product Exchange Program." The program (1-800-SAMSUNG) lets Note 7 owners exchange their current device with a new one as early as next week; or exchange their Note 7 for a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge and replacement of any Note 7-specific accessories with a refund of the price difference between devices. The timing of the recall is "not coincidental," says Teich, who suggested Samsung rushed the Note 7 to market before Apple announces what is expected to be a new iPhone on Sept. 7. "Maybe it was an error of expedience" on Samsung's part, he says. Samsung's misstep, no matter how adroitly it manages the situation, "gives Apple a perceptual advantage" headed into its event in San Francisco next week, says Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. But the recall is unlikely to significantly impact iPhone 7 sales, notes Angelo Zino, an analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 02, 2016 1:08pm   Comments Share: Related Lodging Stocks Should Be In For A Strong 2017 10 Stocks That Rallied Four Days, Then Sold Off Yesterday Rough session for lodging REITs on sell-side caution (Seeking Alpha) Ladenburg Thalmann reiterated its Sell rating and $13 price target on Apple Hospitality REIT Inc (NYSE: APLE), saying that the merger close and guidance revision could cause technical weakness in the coming days. Apple Hospitality completed its merger with Apple REIT 10 (AR-10) and simultaneously lowered its 2016 RevPAR growth guidance by 100bps at the midpoint. The brokerage noted that sentiment among REIT investors toward the lodging space is broadly negative. Apple Hospitality cut its RevPAR forecast to 2-4 percent from 3–5 percent. Further, AR-10's first half RevPAR growth was about 2 percent versus the 4.5 percent growth of the pre-merger company. Related Link: When Hotels Become Hotel Hell: New Study Moreover, the brokerage suspects that the lower RevPAR growth range was also a result of management tempering their expectations for the second half of 2016. "Given that this steep growth reversal seems too punitive for the AR-10 portfolio, we believe APLE's reduced outlook for RevPAR was likely driven by August coming in weaker than expected and fall not looking so hot either," analyst Daniel Donlan wrote in a note. n the positive side, Apple Hospitality also introduced new adjusted EBITDA guidance of $370 million–$390 million, which is $30 million above the prior guidance midpoint and includes merger impact. However, the new guidance midpoint was $19.0 million above 2016 consensus of $361.0 million and $10.1 million above brokerage's $369.9 million estimate. "We reiterate our SELL rating, but note that APLE's 6.3 percent dividend yield could keep some income- starved retail investors from acting too rashly in the coming days/weeks," analyst Donlan added. At the time of writing, shares of Apple Hospitality fell 1.53 percent to $18.65. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

Privacy Policy For a company built around the idea of democratizing the cost of travel, The Priceline Group (PCLN) doesn’t like democracy too much when it comes to shareholders. And it also doesn’t want to pay dividends. Not only does it sport the second highest share price of all companies in the S&P 500 index, but at a recent cost of more than $1,400 it is nearly double the price of Alphabet (nee Google), which is next highest at a little under $800 a share. That means one “round lot,” or 100 shares, of PCLN will set you back more than $140,000, which is a lot more than most investors can afford if they want a properly diversified portfolio. The net effect is more than 97% of Priceline’s publicly traded stock is owned by institutional investors and mutual funds, and less than 3% owned by everyone else (by way of comparison, only 73% of GOOG is owned by institutions and funds). To be clear, Priceline is nowhere close to being the most valuable stock in the S&P 500 index. That honor goes to Apple (AAPL), which has a market capitalization (share price multiplied by number of shares outstanding) of $571 billion. Priceline’s market value of $70 billion ranks it 58th, sandwiched between U.S. Bancorp ($75 billion) and Texas Instruments ($69 billion). In June of 2014 Apple split its stock 7-for-1 to drive its share below $100, in part to qualify for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index the following year. But Apple also wanted to make it easier for individual investors to own its stock, which was above $600 at the time of the split. By June of 2015 Apple’s share price appreciated from $91 to more than $130, a gain of nearly 50% in only a year so it appears that strategy was successful. By keeping its share price so high Priceline is discouraging individual investors from owning the stock, who tend to buy and sell in 100 share lots. If it wanted to, Priceline’s management team could split its stock 10-for-1 and bring its share price down below $150, putting it the same range as Apple, Home Depot and dozens of other blue chip stocks that are popular with institutions and individual investors alike. Even legendary investor Warren Buffett’s saw fit to effectively split his mammoth Berkshire Hathaway holding company 10-for-1 by issuing “B shares”, which directly track the value of the much more expensive “A shares,” currently the most expensive stock in the index at $225,000 and change per share. As is the case in most things Buffett does, his reasons for issuing the additional shares are self serving. While he wants investors of all sizes to have access to financial acumen, he also does not want to be beholden to a small group of institutional investors second guessing his every move. So why would Priceline prefer to remain accountable to a relatively small group of professional investors, instead of spreading its stock around a much larger (and less demanding) universe of shareholders? By keeping virtually all of its stock in the hands of a small number of institutional investors, Priceline can enjoy the primary benefit of being a publicly traded company which is the liquidity provided by public markets. Privately held stock is difficult to value since there is no market for doing so, and even more difficult to buy and sell for the same reason. But by having so few shareholders it avoids one of the main liabilities of being public, which is having to answer to a diverse range of shareholder interests. While Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting is famous for the degree to which so many of Buffett’s loyal shareholders trek to Omaha to hear his words of wisdom, that same feeling of empowerment can create a hostile environment for a less capable management team that is not living up to expectations. In the case of Priceline, there is no apparent reason why its management team would prefer to keep its performance opaque. Its share price has outperformed the S&P 500 index over the past year by a wide margin (+14.1% vs. +10.6%), while operating on a healthy 27% profit margin. Now trading at nearly 18 times forward earnings, it is priced about the same as the overall stock market so it does not appear to be precariously close to collapsing like some overpriced momentum stocks. There is only one reason I can think of why Priceline’s management team would rather keep things status quo. The company is sitting on a huge pile of cash (more than $4 billion), yet does not share any of it with its shareholders via dividends. However, it has spent billions of dollars buying back its own stock over the past couple of years, thereby driving up its share price. That share price appreciation is not taxed until the stock is sold, and at a more favorable long-term capital gains rate when it is. The 3% of shareholders that might prefer to get some of that money now in the form of regular dividends effectively have no voice in the matter. To be clear, there is nothing unethical about what the company is doing, but there is something about it that just doesn’t feel right to me. Since bottoming out near $50 eight years ago the stock has appreciated by 2,700% while the S&P 500 gained 125%. I think it’s time for Priceline to let some of that success travel to the pockets of the investing public that it so dearly serves.

The deal overcomes a split in cabinet over the 13 billion euros (USD 15 billion) plus interest that the EU says Apple owes in back taxes, putting Ireland at the centre of a row between Europe and the United States. Apple chief Tim Cook has urged the government to appeal the ruling to secure future investments but opinion polls have shown public support for Ireland taking the money and spending it on social services. A finance ministry spokesman told AFP there had been a "unanimous decision by the cabinet to appeal the decision" by the European Commission. Parliament will meet next Wednesday, ahead of its scheduled return on September 27, officials said. Earlier this week, three independent ministers propping up the government had refused to back the appeal and said they wanted greater transparency about corporate tax arrangements for multinationals. But after the cabinet meeting, Shane Ross of the Independent Alliance said he and his colleague Finian McGrath had supported the government position. "We felt there was a state of urgency because there was uncertainty out there in the markets amongst some multinationals," he said. "We were persuaded by the argument that it was necessary to clear up that uncertainty as soon as possible," he said. Katherine Zappone, another dissenting independent, confirmed she too had agreed to the appeal "in the public interest". The back taxes that the European Commission has determined the US tech giant owes are equivalent to around five percent of Ireland's gross domestic product and almost all of its annual health budget. "Ireland is caught in a dispute between the EU and US over which it has little control," the UK-based Financial Times newspaper wrote in an editorial. "Bowing to the commission's ruling would... Be a tacit acknowledgement that there has indeed been something rotten in the low-tax regime that Dublin operates to attract multinationals," it said. Ireland's minority government relies on the support of the main opposition Fianna Fail party, which is likely to back the appeal in parliament.

Photo: Reuters Other multinationals that do not employ as extreme Irish tax schemes as Apple Inc, but shift profits via the country to tax havens could also be breaching EU rules, the bloc’s Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday. She handed the iPhone maker a record 13 billion euro (US$14.54 billion) bill for Irish-registered units that Dublin authorities accepted were liable to tax in no country on Tuesday. In an interview, she told reporters that other firms’ arrangements, which involve routing profits to Irish-registered subsidiaries tax resident in places such as Bermuda, might fall foul of the commission on similar grounds. “Taxes have been paid nowhere due to the Irish tax code,” she said. Asked if the bill would have been different if the head office of Apple’s Irish unit been registered and paid tax in Bermuda, Vestager said: “Not much.” Vestager said the core of the case against Apple was that it had an Irish-registered company that booked most of the profits generated across Europe. However, since Ireland did not deem the subsidiary tax resident there, the unit was able to report just a small taxable income at an Irish “branch.” Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook and Washington have denounced the commission’s ruling as an unjust raid on tax that should be paid in the US. Vestager said that if Washington chose to tax the profits reported by Apple’s Irish operation, she would reduce her demand accordingly. The US could do this by forcing Apple to have its Irish units pay more in fees to Apple in California for the right to license Apple patents. However, Vestager said that the bill would not be affected if Apple next year moved funds from its Irish units to the US by paying dividends, even though in this case, the dividends would be taxed. She declined to discuss which other companies’ affairs were being looked at by her staff beyond two publicly announced and outstanding investigations into Amazon.com Inc and McDonald’s Co in Luxembourg. She said that since being alerted to Apple’s methods and other cases by a US Senate probe in 2013, the commission has been looking through about 1,000 such instances in the EU. She dismissed accusations from Cook and others that her decision was politically motivated or driven by anti-US populism. While US companies have been investigated, most of 35 firms probed over tax in Belgium were from Europe, she said. This story has been viewed 1360 times. Comments will be moderated.

Elvis has left the building Just a quick note: I'm leaving Penton today, and this will be my last Short Takes. You can check out my Goodbye post on the SuperSite for Windows for more information, and please continue following me at thurrott.com, which goes live tomorrow, Saturday, January 17, 2015. The good news? The SuperSite for Windows will continue—as will Short Takes—under the aegis of the incomparable Rod Trent, arguably the hardest-working guy in technology reporting. Thanks to Penton for a terrific 15-year run. –Paul Google to halt sale of Google Glasses to consumers In what I can only describe as a wonderful "I told you so" moment, Google announced this week that it would stop selling Google Glasses to consumers this month, ending a years-long debacle. With this single most personally invasive device ever, Google was able to provide Google Glasses users with a truly unique experience: a 50 percent chance of being punched in the face every single time they walked into a bar. Priceless. "Microsoft fumes, Google discloses another Windows security flaw" Well, at least they didn't wait until right before Patch Tuesday. Oh. Right. If it quacks like a duck and looks like a duck... It must be the new Xiaomi Mi Note phablet. Which looks exactly like an Apple product—I think they prefer the term "inspired by" rather than "stolen from"—and has the same name as a similar Samsung product. You gotta give Xiaomi credit: They've really raised the bar on the notion of "cheap Chinese knockoff." "Google expects public in driverless cars in 2 to 5 years" I can't wait to race past these lookie-loos on the highway. Intel results confirm PC rebound in 2014, but firm warns on 2015 Intel delivered what can only be called a "good news/bad news" earnings report for Q4 2014 and CY 2014 this week, posting $11.7 billion in profits on $56 billion in revenues for the full year. The good news: Intel's PC business grew 4 percent in 2013, to $34.7 billion in revenues. The bad news? Only $4.2 billion of those revenues were in mobile devices, and that group posted revenues of "negative $6 million" in Q4, "consistent with expectations." Intel's inability to crack the mobile nut is well-established, but I find the firm's 2015 guidance to be even more troubling: Revenue growth in 2015 will still be stuck in "the mid-single digits." "Apple Says 1 Million Users Now Sign Up for iBooks Every Week" Every time this happens, a unicorn dies. Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe settle US poaching antitrust lawsuit I'm not sure why this wasn't a bigger story, but the federal government sued several high tech firms in 2011, alleging that they violated antitrust laws by conspiring to not hire each other's employees. This conspiracy—you won't be surprised to learn it was masterminded by the ever-innovative Steve Jobs—involved a number of companies, some of whom settled early on, though Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe originally declined to do so. Well, now they have to the tune of $415 million, or what Apple would describe as "a few pennies on the ground that are not worth the time to stop and pick up." So, way to go, federal government. You showed them! "Apple's Swift rockets up programming language rankings, jumps 46 spots" To position 22, behind such popular languages as Groovy, Clojure and Go. Meaning that absolutely no one uses it. Microsoft does the right thing, brings back the $350 Xbox One Were one to write a book called "Stupid Microsoft Decisions," there would be no lack of content, and indeed I could envision a multi-book series here. But among the most recent was the software giant's decision to lower the price of the base Xbox One to $350 during the holiday season—resulting in the console finally outselling the PS4 in the United States in both November and December—and then jack up the price again to $400 in January. I railed against this wrong-headed move in Microsoft's Next Big Mistake: Increasing the Price of the Xbox One, but less than two weeks later, they've come around the obvious: As of today, the base Xbox One is again priced at $350. But this is Microsoft, folks. This pricing is promotional and thus could end at any time. Cue sad trombone.wav. What I'll miss most about Penton Mostly, I'll miss the meetings. The seemingly bottomless expense account (which I never abused). The impossible-to-update web site CMS. And the email system, which I am still convinced was actively seeking out junk mail and depositing it in my inbox. But seriously, folks, what I'll miss most about Penton is the people: Rod, Marcia, Steve and the many coworkers and friends who preceded them. And you guys, of course. Thanks for letting me into your lives. –Paul  Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 7 RyanGroom on Jan 16, 2015 I am still giggling to this comment: "Google expects public in driverless cars in 2 to 5 years" I can't wait to race past these lookie-loos on the highway. Good luck on your next adventure. Log In or Register to post comments mbedan on Jan 16, 2015 But since we are all going to be in driverless cars, the car will efficiently zoom us by the lookie-loo incidents... so it better be a quick lookie. Paul, thanks for all your hard work and your ability to both reveal the good things about Windows and other things Microsoft but not getting carried away like a fan boy. While many tech journalist and bloggers (I know you hate them) are immediately dismissive or hypercritical of Microsoft, you have wrote about what actually is happening. At this same time you have been very harsh - rightly so - regarding Microsoft's attempts. Good luck and see you on the other side. Log In or Register to post comments mtalinm on Jan 16, 2015 the applegoogleinteladobe poaching case was not a US government suit but rather a class-action by a SF law firm. the DOJ had stopped the alleged conspiracy years earlier, but there were no damages. so this law firm brought a class action suit. there has been a lot of coverage of the lawsuit. i think this latest episode got less coverage because it was the second settlement following the judge's rejection of the first settlement. a cynic might say that it was downplayed in the media because tech journalists love apple and google and/or are afraid to offend them. we can discuss more privately if you are interested. Log In or Register to post comments Advertisement ymcpa73 on Jan 16, 2015 No damages? Every employee who applied for an open position within any of the conspiring companies would have been damaged. Each employee potentially lost thousands of dollars from the pay increases they would have received. Plus each company would have given smaller pay increases and bonuses if they had no fear that employees would leave. Log In or Register to post comments br208 on Jan 16, 2015 No damages referred to the remedy at law in the federal case. Hence the class action to asses the actual damages theoretically suffered by the class.

And the "these prices won't last!" sales trick. Log In or Register to post comments hellcatm on Jan 16, 2015 "It must be the new Xiaomi Mi Note phablet.

The thing unlike the Samsung products these phone do look like iphones so the suit will have validity. Good luck Xiaomi, you're flames will be bright. Its good to see the PC market getting stronger but to bad Intel can't hit it off in the mobile market. Maybe they should do an ARM processor. They've tried and tried to make x86 work but it just won't, power consumption is their achilles heel. Maybe when they get down to 14nm or maybe 7nm with ARM that might work but only time will tell. Also ARM has its roots in the mobile market, are handset and tablet developers going to want to switch? Can Intel make the price right? So many questions that can't be answered.

Microsoft Azure experiences major outage A heavily-tested software update to the Microsoft Azure cloud services resulted in major outages around the world. The irony? The update was designed to improve performance. "During the rollout we discovered an issue that resulted in storage blob front ends going into an infinite loop, which had gone undetected during [testing]," Microsoft's Jason Zander explained. "The net result was an inability for the front ends to take on further traffic, which in turn caused other services built on top to experience issues." According to Microsoft, various Azure services were down for about 11 hours on Wednesday, and though the problem is apparently fixed—i.e. the update was reversed—the Azure Status web site is still reporting some issues. But this outage also impacted Xbox Live on Wednesday. And dammit, Microsoft. That is not OK. "Apple and Google face more encryption criticisms" My criticism: Microsoft can't seem to buy its way into this story. Intel: PC sales will be flat in 2015 And on that note, Intel is getting bullish about the future. The microprocessor giant is predicting growth in calendar year 2015 as the PC market improves and experiences flat year-over-year sales. That wouldn't normally be something to crow about. But after two years of falling sales, the PC market is slowly turning around and leveling off. Yes, we'll take our good news where we can get it. "Google tests subscription service for ad-free web sites" Wait, doesn't Google make all of the ads that I see on web sites? NSA predicts massive cyber-attack in the next decade And now some bad news. Testifying before a House Intelligence Committee hearing this week, NSA director Michael Rogers said that a massive cyber-attack aimed at disabling the electrical grid or other national infrastructure of the United States was a matter of "when" not "if," and that "something dramatic" would happen in the next decade. China, Russia and "one or two others" are already infiltrating the industrial-control systems of the electrical grid, nuclear power plants, air traffic control and subway systems, he said, and leaving behind computer code that could be used to disable them during a future attack. The worst bit? We're completely unprepared to handle such an attack, he said. "Comcast to let customers track and rate technicians with new app" And because they understand their customers, the lowest rating is pre-selected to speed things along. Xiaomi now says it will one day be the biggest smart phone maker in the world And speaking of China, Xiaomi CEO and founder Lei Jun said this week that his company would surpass both Samsung and Apple. "I believe that no one thought the Xiaomi from three years ago, which just made its first phone, would later rank as the third largest player," he said. "Within five or 10 years, we have the opportunity to become the number one smartphone company in the world." Xiaomi is controversial for a number of reasons, and the firm explicitly copies Apple to a degree that would be funny if it weren't so culturally bizarre: Jun even copies Steve Jobs' faux turtleneck/jeans look when he speaks on stage, which is both creepy and silly. But here's the thing: Xiaomi will almost certainly achieve this goal. And Jun's statement was bold enough to illicit a response from Apple, which normally tries to appear to be above the fray. "It is easy to say, it is more difficult to do," Apple legal lead Bruce Sewell said. But I bet this company—which Jun calls "a small miracle"—sees great success when it expands to major new markets like the US. Watch out Apple, the Chinese aren't just going after the electrical grid, they're going after you, too. "Microsoft makes it less attractive for developers to create apps for Windows" See? You didn't think that was possible. Google settles patent suit with Microsoft-backed industry group Google isn't exactly shouting this one to the rooftops, but according to a court filing, the search giant silently and secretly settled a patent infringement lawsuit that was brought down on it by Rockstar, an industry consortium that includes members such as Microsoft, Apple, and Blackberry. The terms of the deal are secret, but since the Rockstar patents are all mobile industry-based, it's fair to suggest that Google has basically started paying for all the intellectual property it stole when it created the Android mobile OS. The only question is how much it paid. "Washington Post's new Kindle Fire app has Jeff Bezos written all over it" Gross. It's official: Android really is the new Windows Security researchers this week have identified a new version of the NotCompatible malware as the culmination of two years of fears: This malware has successfully infected over 50 million mobile devices running Android, they say, and 4 million in the United States alone. It works much like PC malware: The unsuspecting user visits an infected web site and inadvertently downloads the malicious code to their device in what's called a "drive-by." And then the device becomes part of a botnet, or what we used to call a "zombie" when only PCs were susceptible to such attacks, and can be used by hackers to send out spam, bulk-buy tickets from Ticketmaster and other event services, and perform other dastardly schemes. The worst part, of course, is that the device owners are often racking up spurious data charges, too, so it's a win-win. Or something. "What it's like living on a Chromebook, Part 2" A lot like living on food stamps, I'd imagine. GameStop blames delayed game release on terrible quarter Not sure why I find this one so peculiar, but the video game retailer GameStop is blaming its terrible third quarter on the two week delay of a game, "Assassin's Creed: Unity," from October 28 until November 11. Here's the thing. October 28 is three days before the end of the quarter in question, and I find it a bit hard to believe that this one game had that much impact. As it turns out, however, there were other issues: Video game software sales, overall, were down 42 percent year-over-year, and new titles like "Destiny" and "The Evil Within," both launched in October, just aren't doing that well. Maybe "Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare" and "Halo: The Master Chief Collection" will pick up the slack this quarter. Or maybe retail video game sales are just a thing from the past. And let's be fair: "Unity" is buggy enough as it is. Imagine how awful it was two weeks earlier. "Will Apple's Next iPhone Capture DSLR Quality with 2 Lenses?"

I have the new app from the cloud, and on my Fire HDX 8.9 (2nd gen); and the "old" washpost app on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 (1st gen), and I have to say that the UI for the new app is much more tablet/touch aware. OTOH the new app gives you only a selection of curated articles (I hate curation :grrr) -- the old app gives you pretty much everything albeit with a not great UI. The initial announcement of this implied that fire hdx owners would get the washpost stories for free. As it turns out hdx owners get in for free for 6 months, after that (not mentioned in your referenced article) hdx owners get it for $1/month for an additional 6 months after which it goes to their normal digital pricing (about $50/year -- which is a heck of a lot cheaper than the NYT and WSJ digital editions :grin). I hope at some point this could be free for Prime members (:grin) -- would be a great prime bennie.

Hackers cannot hack what is not connected to the network. Such infrastructure should be accessible only through private networks not physically connected to any Internet node. Why this is difficult for the NSA to grasp is beyond me. The solution is as clear as it is obvious. Putting the remote control of nuclear power plants, for instance, "behind firewalls" but leaving it connected to the public Internet is equivalent to tasking the present Congress with the design of the next space shuttle.

Happy Thanksgiving! No, it's not Friday. But because tomorrow is Thanksgiving here in the US, this is the last day of the work week. But while there won't be any more newsletters until Monday, I'll be writing as usual over the long weekend, so stay tuned to the SuperSite for Windows for the latest updates. --Paul China charges Microsoft $140 million for "tax evasion" Remember all the craziness this past summer when China began investigating Microsoft and questioning senior officials in that country. This has absolutely nothing to do with that. But this week, China charged Microsoft with tax evasion and has levied a $140 million fee to cover the back taxes owed plus interest. China's official news agency, Xinhua, said that Microsoft has admitted to tax evasion and to pay the central government to settle the matter. Microsoft, naturally, has admitted nothing of the sort. "In 2012 the tax authorities of China and the United States agreed to a bilateral advanced pricing agreement with regards to Microsoft's operations in China," a Microsoft statement notes. "China receives tax revenue from Microsoft consistent with the terms of the agreed advanced pricing agreement." "The flashlight app on your [Android] phone may be reporting your GPS location" Just in case you thought Google wasn't innovative. The sad tale of Microsoft Band availability When Microsoft quietly introduced its new fitness wearable, the Microsoft Band, last month, it only made the device available in limited quantities, and only through the Microsoft Store in the United States. But it promised that it would continue delivering more of them throughout the holidays, and most people praised them for getting to market quickly and making it happen at all. Now, not so much. Microsoft emailed prospective Band customers this week to inform them that it will in fact not be getting any more Bands in stock during the holiday selling period, and that if they're lucky, maybe they can find one sitting in a Microsoft retail store. But here's the final insult: To "make it right," Microsoft is giving people on the Band waiting list a $10 credit toward an online purchase of $50 or more. Oh, Microsoft. "The Only Way to Save Google Glass Is to Kill It" I support this strategy. US warns EU not to get crazy in regulating Google In the wake of a report that the European Parliament may actually recommend to the European Commission that it seek the breakup of Google, the US Mission to the European Union—which is headquartered in Brussels and maintains our diplomatic relations with the EU—warned the EU not to overdo it. "It is important that the process of identifying competitive harms and potential remedies be based on objective and impartial findings and not be politicized," a statement from the Mission reads. Which is fine. Because an objective and impartial examination of Google's business practices can only lead to a remedy that makes sense, regardless of whether that includes breaking up the search giant. "Why Apple Failed to Make Sapphire iPhones" It couldn't breed the unicorns quickly enough. Apple looking to drop Google from Safari, and Microsoft smells blood in the water You have probably heard that there is no love lost between Apple and Google these days, and the Cupertino consumer electronics giant has been slowly removing Google apps and services from its popular devices over the past few years. In this not-so-subtle shift is opportunity for Google's competitors, including Microsoft, whose Bing services already power Spotlight search (and thus Siri) on iPhones and iPads. Now, Google's contract for Safari-based search defaults is coming up for renewal. And you have to think that Microsoft—and others, like Yahoo—will be making a big push for that. I'd love to see that happen, and nothing brings together two former competitors better than a new competitor no one likes. "Google Pushed to Extend 'Forgotten' Requests to US Site" Makes sense. So I expect Google to fight this. HP reports another decline as self-imposed breakup looms HP's slow road to recovery continued in the most recent quarter, with the firm experiencing drops in both profits ($1.3 billion, down 6 percent) and revenues ($28.4 billion, down 2 percent) for the most recent quarter. For the full fiscal year, HP reported net earnings of $5 billion, down 2 percent, on revenues of $111.5 billion, down 1 percent. But there were bright spots, including the fact that the firm is now cash positive, whereas they were $11 billion in debt just two years ago. But from my perspective, here's the big news: HP's biggest growth in the quarter came from ... wait for it... portable computers, which added an additional $510 million in revenue, year over year. So maybe at least one of the two companies that will emerge out of HP next year will be OK. "Windows 10 gets native support for Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)" Yeah, I can hear that one guy golf-clapping in the back of the room. Apple's iPad will experience a full year of sale declines in 2014 The market researchers at IDC say that Apple's two consecutive quarters of falling—and that's "falling" not "slowing"—iPad sales are not an aberration, and it expects Apple to experience a full year of sales declines in 2014. The rest of the tablet market has slowed considerably in 2014—tablet growth in 2014 is expected to come in at about 7.2 percent this year, compared to a whopping 52.5 percent growth rate in 2013. But only Apple is seeing huge declines, with the firm seeing shipments fall by 12.7 percent in 2014 and its market share fall below 30 percent, to 27.5 percent. Sales of Android tablets, meanwhile, are up: They're up 16 percent in 2014 to 67.7 percent, or over double iPad's sales, with 160 million in unit sales. And Windows tablet sales have skyrocketed: They're up 67.3 percent year over year, with 11 million units sold. I wonder when Windows tablet sales will surpass those of iPad. Cough. "Dell's Venue 11 Pro 7000 Tablet Makes Laptops Nervous" At least it's not a hard drive failure. Amazon cuts the price of unlocked Fire Phone to $199 When Amazon debuted its late-to-market Fire Phone earlier this year, it stunned analysts, press and potential customers by eschewing its normal low-price strategy. Instead, the Fire Phone shipped only on AT&T and was priced just like an iPhone: $200 with a two-year contract or $650 and up unlocked. Customers stayed away in droves—hell, even Windows Phone sold millions of units this summer—and Amazon quickly admitted it had screwed up. But when a 1 cent sale for the on-contract version of the Fire Phone failed to improve matters, the company pulled a Blackberry and finally did the right thing: Now you can buy a GSM unlocked version of the Fire Phone for just $199. And that is exactly the price it should have launched at earlier this year. Opportunity lost. "There's a Better Way to Board Planes" Says every single person who has ever boarded a plane, yes.

After three years of coping with the notion that mobile devices like smart phones and tablets could somehow replace PCs, we now have a more nuanced view. And the funny thing is, it took the rise of these mobile devices to drive home how relevant PCs really are. When it introduced the Surface Pro 3 back in June, Microsoft's Panos Panay spoke to this changing understanding of the market. Everyone thought the iPad was going to kill the PC, Panay said at the time. But in the quarter that had just ended, the iPad—once Apple's fastest-growing product of all time—had suffered its first-ever year-over-year sales shortfall. Then it happened again in the next quarter too. And according to IDC, Apple will sell fewer iPads in all of 2014 than it did in the previous year, and overall tablet sales are slowing to a crawl in 2014 after a feverish 50+ growth rate the year before. The PC industry isn't relying entirely on the right-sizing of tablet sales, though it's certainly helping that the effective lifetime of a tablet is close to that of a PC than a smart phone (4-5 years vs. 2). PC makers have also helped themselves by attacking the low-end of the market first with Chromebooks and then more recently with as-inexpensive Windows PCs thanks to Microsoft's "zero dollar" licensing. And some of these cheap PCs—shocker—are pretty good. That certainly makes a big difference. Those are interesting stories in their own right. But when I think about the lost years of Windows 8—which I'll stretch back to 2011 to account for the pre-release cycle as well—I see the makings of a tragedy. As with most bad ideas, Windows 8 started out with good intentions, to take Microsoft's dominance in what we now think of as "desktop computing" and extend it into this mobile first, cloud first world. It was a bold bet. And while some will always mock Microsoft for melding a new mobile platform onto the tried and true desktop, there is some good work there too. And thanks to Windows 10, which will finally strip away most of the goofiness of Windows 8, more than a few people may actually start using that new stuff—the more reliable and secure Modern app platform and store, the mobile device management capabilities, and the deep integration with cloud services, among others—going forward. That, too, is a good thing. But regardless of the specifics, the one thing that always nagged at me during the Windows 8 debacle was the central message that highly connected, highly mobile devices would replace PCs, that PCs would in effect become these simpler devices. Surely there is room in the heterogeneous personal computing world of the future for PCs and mobile devices. (Recall for a moment that Microsoft talked up something called "the PC-plus era" before it jumped into devices and services and then mobile first, cloud first.) A year ago, I penned an editorial I had originally titled The Right Tool for the Job (the title was changed somewhat, dubiously, I think, for SEO reasons) in which I expressed my frustration with devices that try to do too much. A phablet, for example, can replace both a smart phone and a tablet, and it does so for some, I guess, but I find them too big for a phone and too small for a tablet. And a 2-in-1 type PC, like Microsoft Surface, can replace both a tablet and a laptop, though my experience with many of these devices suggests that they are basically only good at one thing. Surface Pro 3, for example, is a wonderful Ultrabook, and it's thin, light and powerful. But it's a lousy tablet, with a fan and a terrible app ecosystem. What's happened is that smart phones and tablets have been humming along and improving nicely over the past few years, but then so have PCs. So it's possible to carry three devices—a phone, a mini-tablet and an Ultrabook—and be carting around less weight than you might have with just a standard business-class laptop from a few years ago. And each of those devices does something very well, serves a unique purpose. Smart phones present an obvious use case, but the notion that a tablet can replace a PC is quickly becoming passé. Tablets are consumption devices first and foremost, especially iPad and Android tablets, and are generally ill-suited to content creation. I carry one for reading, and to watch movies and TV shows on flights. They're great for casual games as well. This leaves the PC ... to be a PC. A productivity workhorse that can focus on the tools and tasks needed by content creators. A device that is now freed of the consumption activities we enjoy instead on smart phones and tablets. The PC has a role, a purpose. And if you need to actually get work done, hell yeah, it's a truck. There is nothing wrong with that, and I'm tired of being ashamed of the PC. You may feel differently, and your needs may differ. You may be able to get work done on an iPad. That's absolutely OK, there's room in this world for all kinds of devices. Including PCs. PCs with touch screens. PCs with transforming bodies that can be sort-of tablets. It's all good. Welcome back, PC.

Android (with occasional keyboard) is the future of computing for the majority. Just accept it. The consumer market has moved beyond PCs. They no longer want Windows. Log In or Register to post comments TruthSeeker321 on Dec 2, 2014 I don't honestly think that's true. I also think it's not entirely accurate to divide the market into enterprise and consumer. That's definitely one way to group things, but I think it's more appropriate to look at content consumption vs. creation. From that perspective, Android is by far the winner in consumption, but PCs and Windows are the leader in content creation. The market has not 'moved beyond' PCs. It has, as Paul says, realized that you don't need a full PC for browsing, watching movies or posting to Facebook. However, with few exceptions, if you want to actually create something, you need something more suited to the task. A tablet or phone running Android is not really up to the task. This is more of a right-sizing or adjustment than a whole-sale migration away from one platform to another. It all boils down to what task you're trying to accomplish. You can't use a hammer for everything and not everything's a nail. Log In or Register to post comments Advertisement Asgardi on Dec 2, 2014 How funny because just yesterday one of my friends was bragging to my other friend that he has to reboot his Android phone only once per week while the other guy has to do it every day. Btw they both have flagship Android phones less than 2 months old. My dads phone cannot update itself even without any apps installed from Play Store because it runs out of memory. At the same time I have 2w 1d 22h uptime on my Lumia 925, and only because I didn't have charger available 2 weeks ago and waiting for my third major OS update. In general, to me the current state of mobile OSes is still quite sad actually. They are just not mature yet and this include WP. On the desktop side Windows Vista was quite much the end of all problems you describe, but I'm sure you stopped using Windows at the time of XP 10 years ago like I was about to do too. Android is the future of malware nightmares and privacy issues just like Windows XP was. Log In or Register to post comments baked on Dec 2, 2014 You're right. Many no longer want Windows. The consumer market also lives out of a drive-thru window, consuming neither the best tasting, cheapest, nor healthiest food they could find. Of course, those people don't consider themselves smarter or more advanced than the home cooks. I'm at a loss to explain why the average tablet/phone/app user has concluded that they're smarter and more advanced than other user. Whatever the reason, it has. We have managed to enable a market that largely values free crApps over quality tools and are no longer embarrassed to type 15 words per minute. Yes, my age is showing. I take ridicule at work for my windows PC, while ALL of my coworkers maintain windows VMs on their shiny laptops to perform some of their tasks.

Log In or Register to post comments Arin on Dec 2, 2014 Sounds like you had bad experiences with Windows back in the day. And yeah, it *was* pretty rough 10 or 15 years ago. But now I use modern versions of Windows every day at home and work, and the only device driver problem I've had in years was on OSX on a Mac Mini. The last major OS headache I had was AT&T's official OTA Android KitKat upgrade bricking my Galaxy S4 Active, requiring warranty service. Windows is actually pretty good now, with modern versions generally running lean, fast and smooth even on old hardware. I'm sure you could get by with an Android-only setup if you're strictly a consumer, but -- and I say this as the owner of both an Android phone and an Android tablet -- for any sort of content creation, give me a Windows PC every time. Log In or Register to post comments Nargg on Dec 2, 2014 @JulesVerny, You must still be stuck on Windows XP. WIndows itself has moved past the driver problems, and registry corruptions simply do not occur any more. Plus the "bloat" is no more than on any smartphone or tablet these days, if not LESS! If you are frustrated with Windows, then it's your IT department I'd put the blame on for holding you hostage to outdated technology. Log In or Register to post comments waclark57 on Dec 2, 2014 I disagree. If you want to talk bloatware there are any number of Android devices that will gladly provide all the bloatware you could want. With respect to slowdowns, many of the first reports on the Nexus 9 with Android L talked about laggy performance. And this is supposed to be the flagship of Android devices not to mention the Nvidia Shield which has had nothing but problems before and after the Android L update. The Shield is supposed to be the ultimate gaming tablet and it can't even run simple games that lots of other Android tablets and phones can run. That sounds like K1 gpu device driver issues to me. If you think Windows is frustrating just peruse some of the Android forums and you'll see plenty of frustrated Android users trying to solve incompatibilities by rooting or unlocking the bootloader. When is the last time you unlocked the bootloader on your Windows machine? I don't think consumers have moved beyond PCs. They have moved to smaller more portable devices like tablets and phablets. I think Microsoft is on the right track with Surface. If they can get the price below $1000 for a core i5 and 8G memory I think it would sell very well. Put a decent GPU in that package and it would fly off the shelves. I don't want to have to carry 3 devices. I need a phone for phone calls and they are handy for lite Internet or apps. I do need something that is capable of handling my corporate needs as well as my personal needs. To me that would be something that has good integration with Windows and a strong app eco-system. The Surface is close, it could be better but at least it can handle the Windows integration far better than Android or iOS. For that reason I may go with a Surface or one of the really nice and thin Windows laptops combined with a larger Android phone or maybe the iPhone 6+. After seeing all the compatibility issues with Android, however, I see why iPads are selling well. Log In or Register to post comments macphisto96 on Dec 2, 2014 Anecdotal, but about a half dozen friends have gone for hybrid notebooks this Black Friday season and are excited about the prospect of a machine that can be a tablet when undocked from the keyboard and a PC when docked. This experience could be better in Windows 10, so that plays into your final point about the variety of devices. Yet that remains a strong advantage for the PC running Windows - and one that can grow as Windows 10 grows. The user is not pigeonholed. Any Intel based device could conceivably be a tablet using the Modern UI, but also can be docked to something and be a productivity machine. Even a smartphone running Windows on Intel could conceivably have a dock and run the Desktop, whether it be a desktop, a laptop case, etc. The most intriguing thing is the adaptability that is coming with Windows 10. Looking at Continuum, that could become a means for the OS to trigger UI changes in Modern Apps. A Desktop style menu system when docked, a larger touch system optimized for a tablet (and full screen) when undocked, and a smaller scale UI on a phone. This is the fascinating aspect of the PC going forward because Windows 8 began as Frankenstein's monster. It was a mess, but with Windows 10 it appears that mess may be turned into something that can completely and fluidly bridge the mobile and traditional PC gap. This should be a concern to the iPad and Android tablets. It may not impact phones quite as much (though familiarity with tablets and laptops may increase sales on the Windows side of phones too), but I think the IDC projections will be wrong and we may find Windows growing faster with tablets, especially if hybrids are counted (that's a mixed bag). Log In or Register to post comments guruguru on Dec 2, 2014 Well said. I see so many people trying to hard to replace a PC with a tablet and making their lives and workflow miserable. It is like they have a religious agenda to try to change things in ways they cannot. Reminds me of those people that tune up Hondas in the hopes they can race a Ferrari Log In or Register to post comments WaltC on Dec 2, 2014 @ JulesVerny You're funny...;) Moving to Android is like dumping Win8/10, or the current OS X version, and going back to Win98...! Not interested, sorry. Ugh. (Like you, most people who don't use Windows think it hasn't changed in 20 years...So to them, of course, Android looks good!) There will always be a place for toys and cell phones, of course. What's nice now is that most people *cough* are beginning to see that personal computers are devices far too exotic and powerful, far too versatile and economically appealing, to be confused with the...toys...and the cell phones..., etc. It's what happens every time an Apple product blunders into the public spotlight...the clocks get set back a half-decade or more... Log In or Register to post comments papamoto on Dec 2, 2014 When you refer to 'toys' are you referring to tablets? A tablet could never replace a laptop for me. In my world these are distinct devices with their own uses. But, I've switched almost entirely to digital media for newspapers, magazines, comics, and books. My 10 inch tablet (I personally think 10 inches is the best - especially for my rapidly aging eyes - 8 inches is too small - ymmv) is my go to content device. It is the last thing I put down at night and the first thing I pick up in the morning. Used to walk downstairs and get the paper...now I don't. Then when I want to go get something done, I go to my laptop. That doesn't make the tablet a "toy" though. Log In or Register to post comments Nargg on Dec 2, 2014 I couldn't agree more. Especially if you consider that all Android device makers have to pay MS for royalties on patents that are almost all circa 1998! Android is truly the re-incarnate of WIndows '95/'98 in all it's awfulness in the problems that Jules was so concerned about. Not to mention how easily that viruses are consuming Android devices these days... Funny how people gravitate to "new" to only be lost in the same old World they once lived in. Log In or Register to post comments br208 on Dec 2, 2014 "It's what happens every time an Apple product blunders into the public spotlight...the clocks get set back a half-decade or more..." I would make a snarky comment about your Apple fetish but I can't make enough sense of this statement to guess at your intended meaning. Log In or Register to post comments henador on Dec 2, 2014 Win8 was MSFT's attempt to get the 1.5B Windows users familiar with the Windows Phone 8 interface ... thinking that familiarity would eventually drive them to get a WP8 phone. It didn't work and might end up killing Windows itself (and MSFT) unless Win10 can get users engaged again. Probably the most interesting thing in this whole debacle is that AAPL's Mac marketshare hasn't increased dramatically. What aren't all those supposedly happy iPhone and iPad users replacing their PCs with Macs? It seems like a natural progression. Do we have any US marketshare stats for laptop and desktops? Log In or Register to post comments the_tech_mule on Dec 2, 2014 I think the main reason is that iOS and Mac OS X are still fairly distinct creatures, which I actually prefer. While there is some advantage of having a Mac with an iPad/iPhone, I don't think that advantage is significant enough to overcome the pricing difference between a Mac and PC. Log In or Register to post comments br208 on Dec 4, 2014 Well Apples market share (particularly in the US) has been increasing, but I suppose "dramatically" being the operative word what you say has some merit. I think the initial price differential between even a lower priced Mac and lower priced "PC" explains some consumers avoiding switching. Yes the marketshare stats are available and I would look them up for you if I wasn't too lazy. I would caution that marketshare info can be difficult to parse as most hardware manufactures do not publish the figures. (Apple does) and the orginazations that do tend to use different methods of counting and deciding what constitutes a device of a given type. (tablets v. laptops v. hybrids and so on). edit: spelling Log In or Register to post comments cassius on Dec 2, 2014 Another interesting take on mobile vs PC from Europe, Africa. "Not only are consumers in emerging markets in Africa and East Asia leap-frogging technology like desktop computers and going straight to mobile, but it is happening in parts of Europe too." http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/11/27/european-consumers-bypass-old-tech-for-mobile/?mod=ST1 Log In or Register to post comments Arin on Dec 2, 2014 I wouldn't call it leap-frogging so much as stepping up from no technology to the smallest, least-powerful tech devices. Seems like a natural path to me in terms of both cost and learning curve. Log In or Register to post comments the_tech_mule on Dec 2, 2014 I think this article is spot on. There's been a big push for converging devices (phone and tablet, tablet and laptop) that makes sense if you don't have the income to purchase multiple devices. For those people with the income, having multiple devices makes a lot of sense because each form factor has its advantages. As long as we can get the data we need back and forth between these devices, there's little reason to limit yourself to a single device in most situations. Getting to a single device is definitely more advantageous for someone that has limited income though. Log In or Register to post comments waclark57 on Dec 2, 2014 I don't think it's necessarily about income. I have the income to get whatever devices I want. I just don't want to have to carry around multiple devices along with all the wall-warts and charging cables to go with them. I need a phone to make phone calls and I need a portable computer (tablet/laptop) because I don't work 8-5 in an office every day. Smartphones, for me, offer the ability to get data quickly and easily. Like the ferry schedule in Seattle. I don't want to have to crack open a laptop to open a web browser just to see when the next ferry leaves. The smartphone app works great for that. But I do need to access document and spreadsheets and I need to be able to manipulate them regardless of where I may be located. Putting things into the cloud and having Office on my tablet or laptop makes accessing them pretty simple and I don't need a ton of storage on the computer to store all that stuff. I want to minimize the number of devices, not because of cost, but because I don't need a team of Sherpas following me around carrying solar chargers, extra batteries and cables just to make it through a normal work day. :) Log In or Register to post comments papamoto on Dec 2, 2014 Paul, you hit the nail on the head right here: "What's happened is that smart phones and tablets have been humming along and improving nicely over the past few years, but then so have PCs. So it's possible to carry three devices—a phone, a mini-tablet and an Ultrabook—and be carting around less weight than you might have with just a standard business-class laptop from a few years ago. And each of those devices does something very well, serves a unique purpose." I view smartphones, tablets, and ultrabooks as separate devices. I want them to be separate devices. They each serve a unique purpose - to me anyway. I might sit down with my laptop and also prop up my tablet too so I can look at books and documentation as I work. It is like a second screen sometimes. As you say, why try to make them be one device when you could stick a smartphone in your pocket and a tablet (even some 10 inchers are uber light these days) and an ultrabook in your bag and still have an ultra-lightweight mobile setup. Log In or Register to post comments mike311 on Dec 2, 2014 I could not agree more Paul. When a started hearing this whole "post PC era" stuff and how the PC was dead, it just made me laugh. Could i do my web page building on a tablet? Use Photoshop or Illustrator on a tablet? Not on your life. Its hard enough on a laptop, with its small screen. If you really need to get some work done, not just play with email or the web, you still need a real computer. Log In or Register to post comments Abasi on Dec 2, 2014 The saddest part of this article is that the author is "embarrassed" to have a PC. Wait are these nerds going to beat you up?? LOL anyway!!! The mobile generation and the failure of Windows 8 did kill the profits in the PC market just ask CompUSA and any computer shop #extinct. I've noticed PC sales increasing as well but only after forcing Dell to put Win7 on it. Log In or Register to post comments Asgardi on Dec 2, 2014 Or was it actually device makers themselves who killed their profits by embrasing free Android? The big OEMs who could keep competition away by licenses and better ability to make their own software rushed to save some money on free stuff for short term profits. At the same time developers rushed to this easy world free of licenses and small costs to produce apps (not applications). Last step is obviously that now consumers dont want to pay anything to use any software. There are countries where money used for software per person dropped 50 % this year... Log In or Register to post comments reidar76 on Dec 2, 2014 People are still going to use PCs. The problem for Microsoft is: How much... ? Back in the days when everyone listened to the radio several hours each day, and the family gathered around the radio in the living room each evening listening to shows og news. Then comes this new technology with both video and audio, the TV, and everybody thought the radio was dead. Now 60 years later we still have radio, and many people still listen to the radio every day, but the radio isn't important any longer. It has taken a different role. It is a similar problem with Windows and PCs. Going back to 2010 around 90% of us used a Windows PC to go online. We still have a PC, and we still use it for internet browsing, but we are more and more likely to use something else, something not reliant on Microsoft Windows, like most phones and tablets. Looking at it this way Windows and the PC is going the same way as the radio. It will still be there, and we will still use it, but we will use it less and its importance and relevance will be greatly reduced. With Windows 8 Microsoft started fighting for keeping Windows relevant and dominant. We now know it was to little, to late. With what we have seen of Windows 10 it looks like Microsoft has given up the fight for importance in the mobile and touch first world we now live in. They are on the road to irrelevance. Unless Microsoft soon shows us what their intensions are in the mobile space, Windows 10 will really be the final version of Windows. Log In or Register to post comments waclark57 on Dec 2, 2014 I don't think that analogy holds up. With the TV it offered more than radio. It offered pictures as well as audio. Radio was limited to whatever distance you could broadcast a signal whereas TV could broadcast coast to coast. Phones and tablets offer the same thing as radio, that is it's portable and can go places where a PC (or TV) can't go. When I try to do computer-like tasks on a phone/tablet it's either cumbersome or now I have to carry more stuff, like a wireless keyboard. At that point why not get a thin laptop that can do everything the phone/tablet can do plus most of what a home computer can do? Much like the radio/TV analogy you have to decide what task are you trying to accomplish and pick the right tool for the job. If I need updated traffic results in my car, I can probably get that from the local radio station. But if I want to watch a blockbuster action movie with my friends I'm probably not going to do that on a 5" phone screen. I don't agree that the computer is becoming irrelevant. The choice of operating systems is becoming less of an issue but phones and tablets offer limited productivity for even simple tasks like browsing the web or creating documents. I think Microsoft is actually on the right track. What they got wrong, initially, is that people want a device that is both computer and tablet. What we learned is that we want mobile devices for one purpose and computers for other purposes. Having an OS that can configure itself based on the hardware you're running makes a lot of sense to me. I just want to log in and have access to programs or apps that make sense for that hardware platform. Log In or Register to post comments DanielD on Dec 2, 2014 I think the most fundamental influence the tablet legacy has left us is Microsoft itself. Free Windows licenses for devices, hybrid devices like Surface, Windows 8 (warts and all), cross platform tools and open sourcing of .NET and Microsoft back to being a true multiple operating system vendor when its comes to productivity apps, is a direct result of the iPad and Android influence. In many ways Satya Nadella owes his new job to Google and Apple. Without them his way of running the company would be seen as insane.

What I've noticed is that as I start at the top and go down, the usage becomes more and more casual. I think I can do anything I want with my Windows PC, and it's the best for me as far as productivity goes. But why boot up an Uber-PC that's overkill just to check e-mail or the weather sometimes. And then my laptop is somewhere in the middle. That's how I see it. I like the fact that lower-end devices are getting more powerful so that I can still open up any document I want in the cloud and engage in some casual gaming, but I still think I need all these devices. I want my tablets, but I don't see my PC going away anytime soon.

Microsoft shareholders approve $84 million pay package for Satya Nadella Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is officially the second highest-paid CEO in the world after Apple's Tim Cook: Microsoft shareholders this week approved Mr. Nadella's $84 million pay package even though an investor advisory group said the company was paying him too much. The measure passed with 72 percent of shareholders approving the pay level, just north of the 70 percent level that would have triggered a policy review. I'm kind of mixed on this issue. I don't think anyone needs or even deserves that level of pay for anything, frankly. And at the very least, someone who is paid that much needs to be held to a higher standard. So far, the Nadella ship seems to navigating the murky waters of our industry relatively well. Let's see how next year shapes up. "More laptops based on Google's Chrome OS were shipped to schools in the third quarter than Apple's iPads" And now you know the real reason for "zero dollar" Windows licensing: You need to get those customers when they're young. Microsoft, Barnes & Noble terminate their NOOK partnership Though as I noted in NOOK - Microsoft, the reality is that this partnership died as far back as March, when Barnes & Noble was able to wiggle out of an agreement to keep making its NOOK app for Windows, and decided to cancel plans for a Windows Phone app. Then of course Barnes & Noble partnered with Samsung to make NOOK-branded Android tablets. Microsoft, for its part, saw NOOK as a chance to even the score against digital media ecosystems from Apple and Google, which both offer e-book offerings. But after a $1 billion NOOK buyout fell apart, it's been downhill ever since. Ah well, a WOOK—a Windows-based NOOK—would have been very interesting. But now it will never happen. "Mark Zuckerberg: Tim Cook's claim that ads turn people into products is 'ridiculous'" But just wait until you see Facebook's next app. It's called Soylent. Apple claims that original plaintiff in iPod case didn't even own an iPod in the right time period Apple presented evidence in its iPod antitrust case this week that shows that one of the two original plaintiffs in the case—a woman from New Jersey—didn't even own an iPod during the period of time in which the case covers. According to Apple, the women's iPods all date from July 2009 or newer, and since the case covers iPods purchased between September 2006 and March 2009, she couldn't possibly have been impacted by the alleged wrongdoing. Given how fickle the law can be, I'm curious to see what happens here. On the one hand, millions of people were obviously impacted by Apple's anti-competitive behavior. On the other, if Apple is right, then this woman can't be the basis for a case against them. But since I've owned every single iPod ever made, I would like to step up and take her place. Someone has to rise to the occasion. "Apple didn't really get started in a garage" Co-founder Steve Wozniak now admits it all happened from his desk at Hewlett-Packard. Which makes HP look even dumber than usual, frankly. Sony hack involved the personal data of many celebrities It will probably be months before we know the full scope of the recent Sony hack, but details seem to be emerging every day. This week, we learned that hackers gained access to the social security numbers for about 47,000 Sony employees and some major celebrities too. Among those affected are actors Sylvester Stallone, Judd Apatow and Rebel Wilson, according to reports, though I guess all you need is a BitTorrent client to go find this information for yourself. Again, I'd like to reiterate the obvious: This is all James Franco's fault. "Google to launch kid-friendly versions of Chrome, YouTube, others in 2015" Define kid-friendly. Less-intrusive ads? No usage of stolen personal data until they turn 16? Sprint stops selling Windows Phones, but Sprint will soon restart selling Windows Phones The Windows Phone community was likely unsurprised this week to learn that Sprint, the nation's most terriblest (yes, terriblest) wireless carrier had quietly dropped whatever outdated Windows Phone handset(s) it had been selling from its web store. But after being asked about this by Windows Central, Sprint told them that it expects "to bring new Windows Phone devices to our customers in the near future, and Sprint is committed to offering a variety of operating systems to our customers." We already sort of knew that was coming, however: As I reported last week in Windows Phone Stats: November 2014, the Windows Phone usage trackers at AdDuplex had already spotted a coming Sprint-based Windows Phone in the wild, though it is sadly a low-end 480 x 854 device. As with all things Sprint, don't set your sights too high. "Microsoft kills off Clip Art" First Clippy, now Clip Art. When will the madness end? Apple's new campus will be a Mecca for the non-religious Apple's in-progress $5 billion campus is a monument to the excesses of the company, its customers, and the country in which it was founded, and we learned this week that it will house, among other things, a $74 million gym facility and a $161 million auditorium. What this reminds me of is the TD Banknorth Garden in Boston, or whatever we're calling it this year. In the 1980's, the Boston Celtics were one of two dominant NBA teams—along with the LA Lakers—that together rejuvenated the league and took it to all-new heights, leading to the subsequent Jordan, Kobe, and Lebron eras. For Boston, it meant that they could replace the aging and inhospitable Boston Garden with a sterile and generic new arena that celebrated the past, mostly since the present—from about 1992 through 2007—was so freaking terrible. On that note, here's to the next 15 years for Apple. I'm sure that spaceship-looking thing will never seem silly to anyone. "Yahoo Is on Track to Pass Twitter in U.S. Mobile Ad Share by Next Year" This is how you know you're in trouble these days: Yahoo is doing better at something than you are. Samsung tries to overturn $930 damages payment to Apple Samsung and Apple were back in court this week, this time an appellate court in which Samsung is arguing that the $930 million a federal jury awarded to Apple is too high. Samsung, as you may recall, brazenly ripped off the design of Apple's iPhone and iPad in its own phones and tablets, and while some may take some degree of glee in such an event, it's apparently illegal. So Apple was awarded $930 million in damages in the initial trial, an amount Samsung has always claimed was incommensurate with the crime. In court this week, Samsung in particular highlighted one portion of the jury award—at a value of $382 million—that claimed that the firm copied Apple's iPhone design. And that may be worth examining, since Samsung's phones in question didn't really resemble the iPhone physically. At this point, it's all about saving face, I think, and even if Samsung is able to reduce that award somewhat, it can declare victory, like forcing a football team to kick a field goal instead of allowing a touchdown.

The case is almost a decade old and dates back to the pre-iPhone era when Apple's industry influence came solely from iPods and iTunes. But the big pull here is that former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who passed away in 2011, will play a major role in the trial. This isn't the first time Mr. Jobs has impacted an antitrust case since his passing: Apple was found guilty of colluding with the biggest book publishers on earth to harm competitors and consumers by artificially raising the price of e-books, and emails sent to and from Jobs played a major role in determining Apple's guilt. The iPod case is a bit different. In the e-book case, Apple had worked with partners to undermine the industry leader Amazon so it could try and gain a foothold in that market with its iPad and iBooks software. But the iPod case is older, and Apple was at that time the market leader, accused of artificially preventing competition from eating into its dominance. Apple released its first iPod in late 2001, and while it was generally hailed for its stellar design and build quality, its high price and Mac requirement made it a niche product. But Apple eventually saw great success with the iPod after it slashed prices and opened up both the device and the iTunes music store software to Windows users. Within a few years, the iPod was the dominant MP3 player, and digital device. But Apple also played unfairly, the class action alleges. It prevented other firms from licensing the FairPlay DRM technology that locked iTunes music purchases to the iPod and to Apple software, and it prevented competitors from letting iPod users access their competing music services. When companies tried to provide this compatibility—as RealNetworks did repeatedly in the mid-2000s—Apple changed the software on the iPod and in iTunes to prevent it. In Real's case, Apple even accused the company of "hacking" the iPod. Apple finally dropped FairPlay in 2009, and was widely applauded at the time for being an industry leader in DRM-free music. But RealNetworks had in fact dropped DRM from its own service in 2008, and of course several other smaller companies also offered DRM-free music by that time. Regardless, the class action lawsuit dates to the period of time between 2006 and 2009. In some ways, the stakes aren't very high: The class action is seeking about $350 million in damages, and though the award would automatically triple to about $1 billion because of antitrust laws, that amount is a pittance when compared to Apple's quarterly profits. In the most recent quarter, for example, Apple posted a net profit of $8.5 billion. But the presence of Steve Jobs, if virtually, is driving more interest in the case. A video deposition of Mr. Jobs defending his actions, and those of his company, will be played during the trial, and many email messages sent by the mercurial former CEO will be entered as evidence. One example published by the New York Times shows that Jobs was ever-ready to prevent its competitors from chipping away at iPod or iTunes. "We need to make sure that when [rival service] Music Match launches their download music store they cannot use iPod," an email penned by Mr. Jobs reads. "Is this going to be an issue?" One of the more polarizing characters in the history of technology, Jobs was both visionary and bully, and even his official biography paints an unflattering picture of a man who didn't care much for people or their feelings. But in many ways, Apple's behavior at the time is understandable: Like Microsoft before it, Apple continued being belligerent and bullying long after it rose to dominance because that was the mindset that hadn't gotten it to that position in the first place. The question here is whether Apple ever achieved a monopoly position in the markets in question—MP3 players and digital music—because, if so, the company is held to a different behavioral standard.

Judge Gonzales Rogers has listened to the testimony of senior Apple executives, and she has watched a video deposition of deceased tech titan Steve Jobs. But the biggest news in the case so far was more unexpected: Both of the case's plaintiffs have been dismissed because neither could prove they owned an iPod during the period of time covered by the case. But the case isn't over. Noting a responsibility to 8 million iPod owners who might have been affected by Apple's anticompetitive practices a decade ago, the Judge has denied Apple's motion to summarily dismiss the case. And she will instead select new plaintiffs from a vast selection pool of "ready and willing" participants. You may recall that Apple's antitrust trial got underway just a week ago in Oakland California, and that the company is accused of having harmed consumers who purchased iPods by artificially updating the iTunes sync software to prevent them from loading their own music—from other services—on the popular music players. The trial dates back to the period of time from 2006 to 2009 when iPod was Apple's only major success, and the long-struggling firm was aggressively defending its then-newfound success. This trial will never amount to much financially—even the automatic antitrust-related tripling of the maximum award would net less than $1 billion in damages—but the harsh light its cast on Apple's business practices is fascinating. Among the revelations from court this past week are: The return of Steve Jobs. A video deposition of the late Steve Jobs, recorded in 2011 shortly before his death, shows an understandably evasive and defensive Apple CEO. His best quip comes right at the beginning: When asked a question about RealNetworks, which tried to establish an open standard for iPod-compatible music, job asked "Do they still exist?" Apple execs in the hot seat. Two key Apple executives, then and now—Eddy Cue and Phil Schiller—took the stand to defend their employer. Mr. Cue blamed the recording industry for requiring Apple to put DRM technology in the iPod, which in turn led to its battles with RealNetworks and others. And ignoring the reality of Microsoft's PlaysForSure technology, Mr. Schiller said Apple had to invent its DRM system from the ground up because there wasn't anything reliable enough in the market. In other words, they really did it to lock in users, because there were in fact established systems. Apple deleted users' songs from their iPods. Confronted by software that could circumvent iTunes and let users load music from other services onto their iPods, Apple changed the software in both products, while claiming it was all done to improve reliability. But what Apple never discussed publicly is that it also silently deleted music from users' iPods. In his testimony, Mr. Jobs referred to RealNetworks and the impacted users as "collateral damage." And Mr. Schiller blamed the victim: he said RealNetworks, not Apple, were "the ones who ultimately let customers down." Neither plaintiff has a verifiable claim against Apple. There are two plaintiffs in the case, and as noted they represent a class of an estimated 8 million people, which is why this case went to court in the first place. But neither have been able to prove they purchased an iPod in the period covered by the suit. So each has, in turn, been thrown out of the case. Judge Rogers will hold a hearing today to select new plaintiffs so the case can continue. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 1 WaltC on Dec 9, 2014 "Judge Rogers will hold a hearing today to select new plaintiffs so the case can continue." I'm not an Apple fan, but this shows exactly what's wrong with our litigation system...no plaintiffs by all rights should mean "no case" as in the case is thrown out entirely. But no, the judge is going to let *the lawyers* continue the case, as though the lawyers are the plaintiffs--and is going to allow *the lawyers* to pull new plaintiffs out of hat like a magic trick at a carnival! If a case has ever proven more clearly that class action suits benefit only attorneys, or mostly attorneys, I don't know of it. This, and those cases where the lawyers walk away with millions of $ and the "plaintiffs in the class" get $15 each--in discount coupons. Class actions ought to require a minimum of 10,000 names and addresses and other contact information as to so-called "plaintiffs" before they can be heard; and lawyer fees should be capped @ 20% of the award, if any.

The decision was reached after just four hours of deliberation. "We created iPod and iTunes to give our customers the world's best way to listen to music," an Apple statement reads. "Every time we've updated those products, and every Apple product over the years, we've done it to make the user experience even better." The plaintiffs in the case alleged that between 2006 and 2009, Apple artificially and repeatedly updated its iTunes software to prevent competitors from integrating their own services with Apple's successful iPod MP3 players. Apple argued that the changes it made to iTunes benefitted users and that any competitors who were harmed by this activity were "collateral damage." The jurors agreed with Apple: Consumers were not harmed by Apple's iTunes updates, and the firm did not violate the Sherman Antitrust Act. Apple was aided by the fact that the original two plaintiffs in the case were found during the trial to have not purchased iPods during the time period in question. But even with a last minute replacement, the case was narrowed in other ways as well. It didn't help that a chief witness couldn't summon any examples of how an iTunes upgrade harmed consumers. "There's not one piece of evidence of a single individual who lost a single song, not even a complaint about it," an Apple lawyer said this week. "This is all made up." Current and former Apple executives testified during the two-week trial, including Phil Schiller, Augustin Farrugia, Eddy Cue and Rod Schultz. But the biggest Apple presence at the trial was a video testimony by former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who passed away in 2011. Had Apple been found guilty, it was liable for up to about $1 billion in damages: The plaintiffs were looking for $351 million in damages, but that would have been tripled automatically under antitrust law. "We got to put it in front of the jury," plaintiffs' attorney Patrick Coughlin said. "Sometimes that’s all you can ask." The plaintiffs are expected to appeal the decision.

I'm no Apple fanboi/evangelist/apologist but why would it be wrong to limit the player you produce to the media you sell. The iPod wasn't the only player around by any means. If you didn't want your tunes from iTunes, you shouldn't buy an iPod. It is nice that has changed...for music..but it is still that way for video. You can't watch XBox Videos on an iDevice, any more than you can watch iTunes videos on WP or Android or Google Play videos on WP or iPods. I think it would have been different if there was only one media player and one DRM option, but that wasn't the case. There was plenty of choice on what draconian system you wanted to be locked into. Apple was just the one that survived, so clearly they must have been cheating?

Log In or Register to post comments zeblonite on Dec 16, 2014 While it's entirely possible they didn't break any anti-trust laws (I'm no lawyer), there is no question that they harmed consumers. Barriers created to keep consumers locked into the Apple ecosystem made it painful for anyone who dared stray outside the walled garden. This artificially degraded the value of alternatives (using Rhapsody was a worse experience than it would have been if Apple weren't actively obstructing their product, for example), which meant they couldn't succeed on the strength of their offerings alone, which hurt consumers trying to cross the Apple border and even made life outside the wall less pleasant than it would have been if the wall didn't exist in the first place. The hassle of merging my Microsoft-centric music ecosystem with my wife's Apple-centric ecosystem, along with the attitudes and motivations that intentionally made it a hassle, was what turned me into an anti-Apple zealot. The iPod my wife had at the time is the last Apple product we ever owned, and the last we ever will. While I don't think companies should be forced to put resources into ensuring interoperability unless they choose to do so, what Apple did was the exact opposite - they put resources into deliberately creating artificial barriers to interoperability. That really rubs me the wrong way. Log In or Register to post comments br208 on Dec 16, 2014 Actually it would seem the jury felt there was a big question whether or not Apple harmed consumers. Their answer? No! Also The plaintiff's litigation team of Dewey Cheatam and Howe arriving at court in a clown car probably hurt their chances. "Apple was aided by the fact that the original two plaintiffs in the case were found during the trial to have not purchased iPods during the time period in question. But even with a last minute replacement, the case was narrowed in other ways as well. It didn't help that a chief witness couldn't summon any examples of how an iTunes upgrade harmed consumers." Log In or Register to post comments pd793 on Dec 16, 2014 Why should a company be forced to make their product compatible with competitors' products? They should be free to create as many barriers as they want, and consumers should be free to not use products that have too many barriers. I fail to see how creating a walled garden of Apple products hurt consumers. Yes, getting out of the garden was/is hard, but even today lots of vendors make it hard to switch, it's called lock-in for a reason. You can't seriously be suggesting that vendor lock-in and propriatery formats should be illegal. If you don't like the idea of lock-in, use a more open product, problem solved. Even back then, there werre other ways to get digital music and plenty of other devices to put it on. Log In or Register to post comments zeblonite on Dec 17, 2014 "Why should a company be forced to make their product compatible with competitors' products?" If you read my comment a little closer, I specifically said that a company should NOT be forced to make their products compatible with the competition. But, in my opinion it is unethical to make them *artificially* incompatible. Legal? Don't know, don't care. Good for consumers? Heck no. Just use something else, problem solved? No, not really. In the case of a monopoly or near monopoly like iTunes/iPod was at the time, incompatibility with the dominant ecosystem severely impacts a competitor's ability to build itself up over time. It becomes a high risk all-or-nothing game, with a few sub-standard alternatives on the side. Plus "just use something else" ignores past purchases, and the artificially-imposed inability to benefit from whatever is good about the other side of the fence.

Microsoft PlaysForSure was a certification given by Microsoft to portable devices and content services. Microsoft's Zune works only with its own content service called Zune Marketplace, not PlaysForSure. Microsoft announced that as of August 31, 2008, PlaysForSure content from their retired MSN Music store would need to be licensed to play before this date or burned permanently to CD,although this decision was later reversed. The Zune and PlaysForSure music are both Certified for Windows Vista, yet the Zune cannot play PlaysForSure music purchased from the MSN Music Store.

Competitors were late to market with different business models built around subscriptions while iTunes let you buy their music and collect your CD music on Apple's. No music service went out of business because of Apple practices and every Apple customer had the option to leave the Apple ecosystem for something they liked better. This is like blaming Microsoft for not making Windows compatible with MacOS. Log In or Register to post comments Bacchus1976 on Dec 16, 2014 Weird. Apple is definitely guilty here. They were updating iTunes twice a week to break 3rd party sync clients, they weren't adding features or fixing bugs/security. Sounds like the plaintiffs lawyers are just out of their depth here. Building a weak case, unable to gather what should be readily available documentation of these examples. The internet never forgets...unless they got out-lawyered and Apple was able to trash the change logs and disqualify 3rd party reporting of these changes. Log In or Register to post comments jeffsters on Dec 17, 2014 Nothing too weird. A jury, who heard that argument, and was given the legal requirements for action, unanimously came back with a different opinion in just three hours. You may not like what Apple did or does, but I suspect you either don't have all the facts or don't understand the definition of anti-competitive, or monopolies, under law? Don't be to concerned though, based upon this week's Apple eBook appeal, it seems Judge Kote doesn't either. ;-) Log In or Register to post comments McGilli on Dec 17, 2014 When I was using Sony Sonic Stage software as my media player (Was forced to because nothing else could transfer the DRM Crippled songs to MiniDisc players) I didn't start to cry when I finally got an iPod and wanted to use Sonic Stage to put all my ATRAC music onto the iPod.

(Photo credit: WLOS staff) VIEW PHOTO GALLERY13 photos AA MORE VIDEO 11 PM Coverage Noon CoverageWLOS —  HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. -- Crowds filled downtown Hendersonville on Friday to celebrate the county's top crop at the North Carolina Apple Festival. Gray skies didn't keep visitors away. In fact, cooler weather was a refreshing topic of conversation. For generations, a slice of fruit has given us a slice of life in Henderson County. Blind tasting at the NC Cooperative Extension booth gives visitors a sample of the varieties. "People will vote for the best looking and best tasting and best texture," explained Joyce Jolly. "We collect this data, we tabulate it and we give it back to the growers." With information about which apples they prefer, farmers can adjust their crop accordingly. Thousands will attend the 70th annual festival. Meanwhile, first timers Barbara and Maggie of Greenville didn't get the memo. "Food is good, turkey legs," she marveled. Wait, is it the turkey leg or Apple festival? "It's both," Barbara said, laughing. Surprisingly, Rock Ridge Farm is among the newbies too. The fourth generation growers have been on the waiting list for 15 years and finally made their debut at the festival. "It gets the name of your farm out," Cheryl McCraw said. "It's a great way to sell varieties people don't have or have never heard of." And whether it's your first time or your sixtieth, the festival is a link to old fashioned values and old friends. While you may come for the apples, you might leave with something else. "The food is good and I'm waiting on a turkey leg to take home," Maggie told News 13. Our own Lauren Brigman was a judge for the apple recipe contest, sponsored by the Henderson County division of NC Cooperative Extension. The grand prize winner was a buttermilk apple nut cake baked by Brundi Crawford. Hendersonville is the official home of the North Carolina Apple Festival, a four-day celebration to recognize the importance of the apple industry to Henderson County and North Carolina. North Carolina is the seventh largest apple-producing state in the nation, and Henderson County is the largest apple-producing county in North Carolina, producing 65 percent of all the apples grown in the state. The Apple Festival is always held during the Labor Day weekend. The Southeast Tourism Society has named the North Carolina Apple Festival one of the STS Top 20 Events in the Southeast for 2016. Festival-goers can choose from a variety of events including a street fair on Historic Main Street and surrounding event venues with continuous free entertainment, arts & crafts, local apple growers selling apple products, children’s & youth activities, special shows, exhibits, open houses, fun, festival food, and, to top it all off, the King Apple Parade. The Apple Festival’s street fair covers nine blocks of Main Street with more than 200 vendors. Main Street is closed to traffic from 6th Avenue to Caswell Street. Apple growers will be selling apples and goodies throughout the festival. The Family Fun Zone features carnival rides and Inflatables at two locations: Wells Fargo Bank and the Visitor Center. The highlight of Labor Day is the King Apple Parade filled with floats, bands, clowns, antique cars, fire engines and more traveling down Main Street from 5 Points to Caswell Street. Other festivities happening during the Apple Festival include apple breakfasts, the Gem & Mineral Spectacular, children’s activities, and the Western North Carolina Air Museum Open House. Please leave your pets at home, as a Hendersonville City ordinance prohibits animals in the event area. For tickets, applications and further information, call 828-697-4557. For times and locations of the events, visit the North Carolina Apple Festival website.

The Commission's ruling this week that the U.S. tech giant must pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) to Dublin has angered Washington, which accuses the EU of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the U.S. government. With transatlantic tensions rising, the White House said President Barack Obama would raise the issue of tax avoidance by some multinational corporations at a summit of the G20 leading economies in China this weekend. Paradoxically, Ireland is determined not to accept the tax windfall, which would be equivalent to what it spent last year on funding its struggling health service. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the European Union began investigating Apple's Irish tax affairs in 2014, arguing that it had to protect a tax regime that has attracted large numbers of multinational employers. On Wednesday, he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers, whose support is vital for the minority government, to agree to fight the ruling by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager that Apple's low tax arrangements in Ireland constitute illegal state aid. However, he won them over when the cabinet met again on Friday. Noonan said the retroactive nature of the EU ruling was "little short of bizarre and outrageous". "How could any foreign direct investor come into Europe if they thought the valid arrangements they made under law could be overturned a generation later and they be liable to pay back money," he said at a news conference. Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe said Dublin stood behind its corporate tax regime as a means of creating jobs. "This ruling has seismic and entirely negative consequences for job creation in the future," he said. Apple, keen to defend its own interests, has already said it will lodge an appeal. For Fine Gael, the main Irish coalition party, a broader principle is at stake. It wants to take on Brussels to safeguard Ireland's decades-old low corporate tax policy that has drawn in multinationals such as Apple, creating one in 10 jobs in what was once an impoverished country. A FAIR RATE OF TAX The Independent Alliance, a group of five lawmakers, fell in line after the coalition agreed to conduct a review of what tax multinationals pay and what should they pay. Transport Minister Shane Ross, an Alliance member, defended Apple up to a point. "I think they were acting legally. What they were doing was making use of extraordinary loopholes that existed there," he told reporters. "Multinationals provide absolutely vital jobs to the economy ... (but) multinationals should pay a fair rate of tax in Ireland." A failure of the Alliance to come on board would have cast doubt on the government's survival prospects. Dublin has just over two months to lodge an appeal to the EU's General Court. If that fails, Dublin has said it plans to take the case to the European Court of Justice. The issue goes to parliament on Wednesday next week, when lawmakers will be recalled from their summer break. The main opposition party, Fianna Fail, also favours challenging Brussels, so the government should easily win the Dail's backing to fight what is by far the largest anti-competition measure imposed on a company by the EU. Some Irish voters are astounded that the government might turn down the money, and the left-wing Sinn Fein party has led attacks from the opposition. Apple was found to be holding over $181 billion in accumulated profits offshore, more than any U.S. company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning nonprofit groups, a policy critics say is designed to avoid paying U.S taxes. But Apple chief executive Tim Cook has said part of the company's 2014 tax bill would be paid next year when the company repatriates offshore profits to the United States. OBAMA TO TAKE THE LEAD The U.S. government is keen to ensure that it, and not Ireland, gets the revenue. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said leaders of the G20 developed and emerging economies would tackle the wider issue when they meet in the Chinese city of Hangzhou on Sept. 4-5. "The president will ... lead the discussion at the G20 about combating tax avoidance strategies that are implemented by some multinational corporations," Earnest said. "We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair - more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States." A number of G20 governments are worried about how multinationals move profits around so they end up getting taxed in a country that has very low corporate rates. Last year the Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development unveiled new measures to tackle corporate tax avoidance. A number of countries have moved to implement some of them measures, but the United States has not. It needs to change its own tax rules which, for example, allow companies to build up tax-free profits offshore. However, Congress has struggled for years to agree such reforms.

"Beyond that I make no apology whatsoever for defending the right to appeal this because this is about Ireland, it is about our people, it's about us as a sovereign nation, actually setting out what we consider our appropriate policies to devise job opportunities and employment careers for our people." He also said he was pleased with the outcome of this morning's Cabinet meeting "at which a very clear decision had been taken not only to appeal the finding, but to also to reiterate our commitment to the 12.5% corporate tax rate in a very constructive and professional manner." Taoiseach makes 'no apology' for defending right to appeal EC decision - Full interview on RTÉ's Six One News pic.twitter.com/wOL98YSkFR— RTÉ News (@rtenews) September 2, 2016 Update 4pm: Sinn Féin says the decision by Cabinet to appeal the EU's €13bn Apple tax ruling is "just wrong". The party is also demanding that the full ruling be published before the Dáil debate. Deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald claims Government's did facilitate tax avoidance and is "covering their asses for decisions that were taken and not taken over a very long period of time". Update 2pm: Independent TD Katherine Zappone said there would be a number of measures to "ensure tax justice" as the Cabinet confirmed its decision to appeal the Apple tax ruling. There are five steps to the Government's approach (listed in full below), including asking the Attorney General to prepare the legal grounds in support of an appeal. "It would have been my preference that it was debated in the Dáil prior to making a decision," said Deputy Zappone. "I compromised on that in relation to accepting that as a Government and a Cabinet, we would take this decision." Meanwhile, Junior Minister John Halligan said that he now supports the decision to appeal, saying the Government does not need to be de-stabilised with the Budget and Brexit on the horizon. The Waterford TD said: "I believe Apple should pay the money but I've also made my position clear that I don’t think the Government should be brought down on this issue. "For the first time ever in the history of the State there will be an independent review as to what tax is paid by the multinationals, and are they paying fair tax." Earlier: The Cabinet has agreed to appeal the Apple tax ruling. Ministers have been meeting at Government Buildings following the European Commission ruling that Ireland should recoup €13bn in back taxes from the tech giant. The Dáil will be recalled next Wednesday to discuss the issue. The meeting ended after around 50 minutes with the Cabinet deciding that an appeal will be launched against the ruling by the Commission. The Attorney General will draft the grounds for the appeal. The Dáil will debate and vote on a motion next Wednesday to be drafted by the Government, effectively endorsing the decision to go for an appeal. It is also believed that the motion will have strong words on the 12.5% Corporation Tax rate, because the Government feels that the decision by the Commission is an attack on the tax rate "by the back door". Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran of the Independent Alliance said they had been working with Fine Gael to deliver a decision that takes into account all of their concerns. Deputy Moran said: “We have been carefully examining the entirety of Apple’s tax treatment to ensure that any decision reached is in the best interests of this country over the long-term. The integrity of the tax system and to provide tax certainty to business is also paramount. “I feel that the motion being put before the Dail will succeed in addressing our key concerns. “I am also pleased to say that the Government has agreed to a review of Ireland’s corporation tax system by an independent expert to be appointed by the Minister for Finance.” Mr Moran said it reflects the Independent Alliance’s approach of greater scrutiny of major decisions and the need for accountability and transparency at the heart of Government decisions. The Government's five-step approach is as follows: * Arrange for annulment proceedings to be brought before the General Court of the European Union (GCEU) on State aid SA. 38373 (2014/C)(ex 2014/NN) (ex 2014/CP) implemented by Ireland to Apple; * Request the Attorney General to prepare the legal grounds in support of those proceedings and to take all other steps incidental to the conduct of those proceedings; * Propose the following motion before Dáil Eireann, that Dáil Éireann: - Supports the Government decision to appeal the European Commission’s decision that Ireland provided unlawful State aid to Apple. - Commits itself to the highest international standards in transparency in the taxation of the corporate sector; - Resolves that, no company or individual receives preferential tax treatment contrary to the Tax Acts and calls on the Revenue Commissioners to continue to observe this principle;” and * To reaffirm Ireland’s 12.5% Corporation Tax rate * To arrange for a review of Ireland’s corporation tax system by an independent expert to be appointed by the Minister for Finance, excluding the 12.5% corporation rate.

Sure, they would be even more excited if Apple planned to unveil the big iPhone redesign that we'll all have to wait until next year to see, but the iPhone 7 launch is still going to be the biggest smartphone release of the season by a massive margin. In fact, the new iPhones' only real competition at the moment is no longer being sold in stores and won't be back on shelves for at least a few weeks. Despite how popular Apple's iPhones are, there's always some sort of commotion that comes along with each launch. Antennagate and Bendgate are two examples that everyone will recall. This year, it looks as though the biggest complaint about Apple's next-generation iPhones is already out there: people are angry that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus won't have standard headphone jacks. But are they right to be mad? DON'T MISS: This is the new color coming to Apple’s iPhone 7 In a post on Thursday, I explained why it's so great that Apple decided to kill off the 3.5mm audio port on its upcoming iPhones. The shift away from the old analog port means better quality audio and better water and dust resistance on Apple devices. It also means companies will shift toward Lightning headphones and offer some pretty great innovations as a result. Seriously, check out the Libratone noise cancelling earbuds discussed in this post. I also covered one drawback of the move in particular. If you do switch to wireless headphones or Lightning headphones — which you won't have to do, mind you, because there will be a 3.5mm-to-Lightning adapter in the box with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus — that means you won't be able to use your new headphones with other devices. Examples include entertainment systems on airplanes and on gym equipment. But after I published that article, a few readers contacted me with another problem that this move brings about, and it's a bigger issue for some users. There will be four ways to listen to audio playing on an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, and one is using the speaker(s) on the phones themselves. Where headphones are concerned, you'll have three options: wireless headset, wired Lightning headset or wired 3.5mm headset with a 3.5mm-to-Lightning adapter. Choose either of the last two options, and it means you can't charge your iPhone while you're listening. For most users, that won't be a big deal. But as has been discussed with a few BGR readers who have emailed me, there are people who stream music or videos for hours at a time, and they're used to being able to charge their iPhones while they do. For these users, the lack of separate audio and power ports does indeed pose a problem; streaming music while you're at your desk or traveling and not being able to charge your phone while you do is clearly a step backwards. Docks and other accessories will offer fixes for this issue in some cases, and an adapter of some sort could be made available — something like what Apple does with the MacBook. But some users will have no choice but to change their behavior as a result of the move, and plenty of feathers will be ruffled in the process.

A government spokesman said following the cabinet’s decision that it would ask parliament to endorse the legal challenge next Wednesday. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the European Union began investigating the US tech giant’s Irish tax affairs in 2014, arguing that it had to protect a tax regime that has attracted large numbers of multinational employers. But at an earlier cabinet meeting on Wednesday he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers, whose support is vital for the minority government, to agree to fight the ruling that Apple must pay up to 13 billion euros (US$14.5 billion) in tax to Dublin. Ireland’s opposition party, Fianna Fail, also favors challenging Brussels. The government should therefore easily win parliamentary support to appeal against European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s ruling that Apple’s low tax arrangements in Ireland constitutes illegal state aid. Apple, anxious to defend its own interests, has already said it will lodge an appeal. For Fine Gael, the main Irish coalition party, a broader principle is at stake. It wants to take on Brussels to safeguard Ireland’s decades-old low corporate tax policy that has drawn in multinationals such as Apple, creating one in 10 jobs in what was once an impoverished country. The Independent Alliance, a group of five lawmakers, had called for a review of how tax is collected from Ireland’s large cluster of multinational companies before it considers a challenge. “We are very, very keen that from now on multinationals should be seen to be paying their fair share of tax,” Transport Minister Shane Ross of the alliance said.

The Cupertino tech and design firm has been on Twitter since September 2011, but in those five years has not uttered a single status update from twitter.com/apple. Neither had it added a custom profile picture, header background, or sought the status of having its account's trustworthiness verified by the microblogging service. That's all changed now, in the lead-up to what is widely expected to constitute an iPhone 7 announcement event on September 7. Several Apple services in Apple Music, Apple News, and a number of iTunes divisions already have Twitter presences, some more active than others, as do some of its high-ranking executives including current CEO Tim Cook. Now it seems that the core Apple account is getting ready to fire off its first tweet at some point in the near future.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers   skip to main content skip to main menu     The government of Ireland will back Apple in its fight against EU’s tax bill from hell By Christian Zibreg, Sep 2, 2016 Tweet 20 Comments Following news earlier this week that the European Commission had ruled that Apple must pay €13 billion ($14.5 billion) in back taxes to the government of Ireland because its sweetheart deal with Dublin that lets it be subjected to a lower tax rate constitutes “illegal state aid,” the Irish government said today it would join Apple in its fight against the ruling. “Paradoxically, Ireland is determined not to accept the tax windfall, which would be equivalent to what it spent last year on funding its struggling health service,” says the report. Ireland fears that collecting back taxes from Apple would equal an admission of guilt, which in turn might discourage investors from creating new jobs in the country. The country’s decades-old low corporate tax policy has drawn in multinationals like Apple, helping create one in 10 jobs in the country. Ireland’s Finance Minister Michael Noonan said the EU’s retroactive ruling was “little short of bizarre and outrageous”. “How could any foreign direct investor come into Europe if they thought the valid arrangements they made under law could be overturned a generation later and they be liable to pay back money?”, he asked at a press conference Friday. His colleague, Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe, told the media that Ireland stood behind its corporate tax regime as a means of creating jobs. “This ruling has seismic and entirely negative consequences for job creation in the future,” he said. Transport Minister Shane Ross also defended Apple. “I think they were acting legally,” he said. “What they were doing was making use of extraordinary loopholes that existed there. Multinationals provide absolutely vital jobs to the economy… (but) multinationals should pay a fair rate of tax in Ireland.” Irish government has about two months to lodge an appeal to the EU’s General Court. If that fails, Dublin will take the case all the way up to the European Court of Justice. The Commission’s ruling has also ticked off Washington. The U.S. government’s position is basically that the EU is attempting to collect tax revenue that should go to Uncle Sam. President Barack Obama will raise the tax avoidance issue at a summit of the G20 leading economies in China this weekend. Apple CEO Tim Cook called EU’s tax bill from hell “total political crap,” insisting in an interview with the Irish news publication Independent that “no one did anything wrong here”. Part of Apple’s tax bill would be paid next year when Apple repatriates some of its offshore profits to the United States, he said. And in his “Message to the Apple Community in Europe,” Cook expressed confidence that the tax bill will be eventually reversed and said Apple would appeal the ruling. Source: Reuters Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Ireland is cheering in favor of Apple in EU state aid tax ruling Here’s Tim Cook’s message to Apple community regarding massive Irish tax bill In its appeal to EU tax ruling, Apple calls itself a “convenient target” EU orders Apple to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes Related Topics Apple, Corporate, EU, Ireland, News, Reuters, Tax, taxes, Tim Cook nova voter first off, I believe the ruling was against Ireland, not against Apple. Apple was merely unjustly enriched by Ireland’s illegal deal. So I don’t think anyone is saying Apple themselves acted illegally. Second, as noted above, Apple was unjustly enriched by an illegal act. In that case, it’s not out if the ordinary to demand disgorgement of the profits they otherwise would not have made — it’s akin to the concept of a relief defendant in US courts. Sucks for Apple, but the arguments being advanced by Ireland are specious — “it’s going to threaten future business if companies can’t rely on sweetheart deals that violate EU laws/regulations.” Come on. No, it’s going to encourage companies with hundreds of billions of dollars to do due diligence on deals/contracts/arrangements they make, to make sure they are in compliance with applicable laws. According to the ruling, it’s money they otherwise wouldn’t have had, so it’s not a punishment — it’s disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, putting them in the position they otherwise would have been in had the deal complied with applicable laws/regulations. lemonhead my thoughts exactly… Fun fact: if you’re an american and live in Europe you still have to pay taxes to the US as well… Posi X. Mosh Fun fact, that statement is disingenuous. lemonhead take it or leave it, I guess. Posi X. Mosh You don’t have to pay income tax twice if you live abroad. n0ahcruz3 It’s funny when Tim cook said “total political crap” Rowan09 When it deals with taxes it’s always something funny. For example I’m natively from Jamaica and if I make any money from a business there after paying them taxes the American government wants me to claim it as income to be taxed again. Xee A mostly one sided pro-Apple article. Not very objective. Except for the bit about the Irish Government being in the wrong, but Apple were part of that deal to don’t forget. Plus the US Government wants to steal tax paid by European customers. Are they freaking mad?! US Gov can go f-off!! Xee Lame deleting posts that are truthful… Kroffy Wow, agree. I doubted the fact they were deleting comments was true but I just witnessed yours. I’ve nothing to do on a website ruled by blind and one-sided people. Impreza If you knew how many comments were deleted on this blog site you’d think it was run by a tyrant. If you dont want to be deleted, dont mention a certain somebody who used to work here but got replaced by somebody who cant make a video and has a nauseating introduction and sound.

Anyway new guy is getting better all the time. Just takes time guys, plus jail breaking ain’t exactly full swing just now. Xee Well it’s not my site it’s theirs and they decide what can stay. I will just state the facts as I see it rather then attacking the article as well. Barry Murphy yeah so much for freedom of speech! does not apply here! when I put the truth up they always delete it! Posi X. Mosh The “lower state aid” tax rate is under a percent. This is evading taxes in my book. But that’s sorta par for the course for big multi-national corporations these days. Sorry, but, why is anyone ok with this? Do these companies think that roads and schools build themselves? And if Apple or anyone else is profitable enough to have a 13 billion dollar tax bill @ 20% percent of profit, maybe they could pay the employees that made this profit a bit more… Barry Murphy Apple does not create one in ten jobs here in Ireland ha ha! they employ almost no one here, We don’t have an Apple Store here in Ireland! the ones who created most jobs was PayPal the closest ones in Belfast in the UK, In Ireland we hate apple as an employer as they don’t employ anyone only a few to work in an office in cork to help em commit fraud! Your completely wrong with your story! also the ruling is agents Apple not Ireland, Ireland actually would love to have the 13bn, Apple want to fight it! all our news is saying how apple said they wont pay and that their appealing it! yous yanks are so brainwashed its crazy! yous don’t even get the real news, its all censored! we get the truth, and we know its kept from yous as they always say, but the American news outlets are telling their people X Y and Z yet the truth is…. its hilarious how stupid and under control yous are!! Xee Plus the US Gov wants its greedy mitts on EU tax money… hence why they are unhappy at the EU rightfully claiming tax due from Apple. Docservlet They employ 6000 people directly and who knows how many indirectly. They’ve been in Cork for over 30 years. If the EU ruling stands, which it won’t, Ireland stands to lose a lot more than 13 billion. Posi X. Mosh Looks like you forgot the rest of the paragraph… ” However, you may qualify to exclude from income up to an amount of your foreign earnings that is adjusted annually for inflation ($92,900 for 2011, $95,100 for 2012, $97,600 for 2013, $99,200 for 2014 and $100,800 for 2015). In addition, you can exclude or deduct certain foreign housing amounts.” Or the rest of the page with links full of loopholes (for individuals).

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Ireland's cabinet agreed on Friday to join Apple in appealing against a multi-billion-euro back tax demand that the European Commission has imposed on the iPhone maker, despite misgivings among independents who back the fragile coalition. The Commission's ruling this week that the U.S. tech giant must pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) to Dublin has angered Washington, which accuses the EU of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the U.S. government. With transatlantic tensions rising, the White House said President Barack Obama would raise the issue of tax avoidance by some multinational corporations at a summit of the G20 leading economies in China this weekend. Paradoxically, Ireland is determined not to accept the tax windfall, which would be equivalent to what it spent last year on funding its struggling health service. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the European Union began investigating Apple's Irish tax affairs in 2014, arguing that it had to protect a tax regime that has attracted large numbers of multinational employers. On Wednesday, he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers, whose support is vital for the minority government, to agree to fight the ruling by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager that Apple's low tax arrangements in Ireland constitute illegal state aid. However, he won them over when the cabinet met again on Friday. Noonan said the retroactive nature of the EU ruling was "little short of bizarre and outrageous". "How could any foreign direct investor come into Europe if they thought the valid arrangements they made under law could be overturned a generation later and they be liable to pay back money," he said at a news conference. Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe said Dublin stood behind its corporate tax regime as a means of creating jobs. "This ruling has seismic and entirely negative consequences for job creation in the future," he said. Apple, keen to defend its own interests, has already said it will lodge an appeal. For Fine Gael, the main Irish coalition party, a broader principle is at stake. It wants to take on Brussels to safeguard Ireland's decades-old low corporate tax policy that has drawn in multinationals such as Apple, creating one in 10 jobs in what was once an impoverished country.   A FAIR RATE OF TAX The Independent Alliance, a group of five lawmakers, fell in line after the coalition agreed to conduct a review of what tax multinationals pay and what should they pay. Transport Minister Shane Ross, an Alliance member, defended Apple up to a point. "I think they were acting legally. What they were doing was making use of extraordinary loopholes that existed there," he told reporters. "Multinationals provide absolutely vital jobs to the economy ... (but) multinationals should pay a fair rate of tax in Ireland." A failure of the Alliance to come on board would have cast doubt on the government's survival prospects. Dublin has just over two months to lodge an appeal to the EU's General Court. If that fails, Dublin has said it plans to take the case to the European Court of Justice. The issue goes to parliament on Wednesday next week, when lawmakers will be recalled from their summer break. The main opposition party, Fianna Fail, also favours challenging Brussels, so the government should easily win the Dail's backing to fight what is by far the largest anti-competition measure imposed on a company by the EU. Some Irish voters are astounded that the government might turn down the money, and the left-wing Sinn Fein party has led attacks from the opposition. Apple was found to be holding over $181 billion in accumulated profits offshore, more than any U.S. company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning nonprofit groups, a policy critics say is designed to avoid paying U.S taxes. But Apple chief executive Tim Cook has said part of the company's 2014 tax bill would be paid next year when the company repatriates offshore profits to the United States.   OBAMA TO TAKE THE LEAD The U.S. government is keen to ensure that it, and not Ireland, gets the revenue. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said leaders of the G20 developed and emerging economies would tackle the wider issue when they meet in the Chinese city of Hangzhou on Sept. 4-5. "The president will ... lead the discussion at the G20 about combating tax avoidance strategies that are implemented by some multinational corporations," Earnest said. "We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair - more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States." A number of G20 governments are worried about how multinationals move profits around so they end up getting taxed in a country that has very low corporate rates. Last year the Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development unveiled new measures to tackle corporate tax avoidance. A number of countries have moved to implement some of them measures, but the United States has not. It needs to change its own tax rules which, for example, allow companies to build up tax-free profits offshore. However, Congress has struggled for years to agree such reforms. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close  More ways to share...

RollingNews.ie photo.   By Irish Echo Staff   Take your 13 billion and…. That was the message from the Irish government to the European Commission today after the cabinet agreed to appeal the Commission’s ruling that technology giant Apple owes the Irish taxpayer €13bn or roughly $14.5 billion – plus accrued interest. The decision, according to an RTE report, was taken after a half-hour cabinet meeting “that headed off the danger of a rift.” Apple had already signaled its intent to launch an appeal. The RTE report stated that Independent Alliance ministers Shane Ross and Finian McGrath, and independent minister Katherine Zappone, had initially baulked at backing an appeal, calling instead for more clarity about multinational tax arrangements in Ireland as well a special Dáil debate. Fine Gael ministers, however, argued that an appeal had to be lodged to challenge a ruling that had deep implications for inward investment. In the end, it was agreed to file the appeal, a process that is likely to be a lengthy one. The terms of the appeal, according to the RTE report, will now be drafted by the Attorney General, and the Dáil will return early from its summer recess to debate the issue next Wednesday. That is certain to be a vigorous debate as some opposition parties and TDs have been urging the government to take the tax windfall and spend it on domestic programs. The cabinet also agreed a Dáil motion which would see an independent expert review the Republic’s corporation tax system. The motion, RTE reported, also states that the government should appeal the Apple ruling on the grounds of defending the integrity of the tax system, provide tax certainty to businesses, and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member states competence to set its taxation. The draft motion also states that no company or individual should receive preferential tax treatment. “It has been a difficult few days for everybody but we have kept our eyes on two things. One is that the multinationals provide jobs to the economy, and secondly the very important principle in the motion that multinationals should pay a fair rate of tax from now,” said Independent Alliance minister, Shane Ross. The current Irish government is a majority administration comprised of Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance grouping. The government runs with the backing of what is currently the largest opposition party, Fianna Fáil. Minister for Children, Katherine Zappone, who is U.S.-born, said the best way to secure any money for Ireland was through an appeal because to do otherwise would only end in prolonged delays. She described the original tax deal with Apple as unethical, but said the government had now agreed to transpose EU directives on more transparent tax policies. “Ireland is turning its back on a massive tax windfall from Apple,” was a CNN headline reporting the cabinet decision. As recently as 2010, the CNN report noted, Ireland was bailed out by the EU and International Monetary Fund. “The extra tax billions would go a long way at a time when Irish officials are worried about the impact of Brexit on their economy. “But multinationals such as Apple have created thousands of jobs in Ireland, and many are worried that the flow of foreign investment could be hurt if the government enforces the EU’s retroactive tax demand.” Ireland is an attractive location for multinationals for a number of reasons, one of them being its low 12.5 percent corporate tax rate. That rate has been subjected to strong criticism from other EU members and the U.S. though some countries, notably the United Kingdom, have lately initiated moves to lower their corporate tax rates. Northern Ireland is in line to introduce a tax rate identical to the Republic in 2018, though June’s Brexit vote has resulted in considerable uncertainly on a variety of fiscal and economic fronts.       Other articles you may want to read...

News Sports Entertainment Obituaries Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds E-Edition log in Pinning down Apple’s alleged 0.005 percent tax rate is nearly impossible Thursday Sep 1, 2016 at 6:00 PM Sep 2, 2016 at 11:58 AM The European Commission’s finding that Ireland must collect as much as an attention-getting 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes from Apple Inc. contained a second stunning number: 0.005 percent. By Lynnley Browning and David KocieniewskiBloomberg The European Commission’s finding that Ireland must collect as much as an attention-getting 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes from Apple Inc. contained a second stunning number: 0.005 percent. In a news release, the commission said that figure represented the effective corporate tax rate Apple paid on its European profits in 2014. At that rate, someone who earned $1 million would pay $50 in tax. With the world’s richest company vowing to appeal the finding -- perhaps joined by Ireland’s government -- the methods and data that the European Union regulators used will come under intense scrutiny, but largely behind closed doors at the EU’s General Court in Luxembourg. In the meantime, tax specialists say, the actual rate remains unknowable for the general public, and the basis for the minuscule figure that competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager cited will be something of a mystery. “It’s plausible, but we can’t verify it,” said Michelle Hanlon, a professor of accounting and taxes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. Apple, like most multinational companies, doesn’t disclose a country-by-country breakdown of its profits or taxes paid. ‘Made-Up Number’ Apple’s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, called the commission’s 0.005 percent rate “a completely made-up number.” Bloomberg News sent the company several questions aimed at clarifying and explaining its position. In response, Apple pointed to a Q-and-A it posted for shareholders that largely repeated its executives’ earlier remarks. The commission, meanwhile, hasn’t revealed what numbers went into its calculation, but Vestager said Thursday that the math was based on figures Apple itself provided to regulators. “There are very little if any figures in the public domain,” she said. She added later: “It’s quite a good illustration of the fact that more transparency would be a good thing,” including country-by-country reporting for income, taxes paid and other information. The commission found that Ireland provided Apple with selective tax treatment that let the iPhone maker skirt the nation’s 12.5 percent tax rate and gave it an unfair advantage over other companies for several years -- a violation of the EU’s state-aid rules. Irish Units The EU says the 0.005 percent effective tax rate applies to the profits of Apple Sales International, an Irish unit which regulators say is “responsible for buying Apple products from equipment manufacturers around the world and selling these products in Europe” as well as in the Middle East, Africa and India. The commission also cited another unit, Apple Operations Europe, which it said was responsible for manufacturing certain lines of computers for the Apple group. In questioning the commission’s finding, Apple has said it “paid $400 million in taxes in Ireland in 2014 -- considerably more than the commission’s figure suggests.” But that amount differs from one the company reported to regulators, according to people familiar with the EU’s investigations. Apple confirmed that the $400 million was corporate income tax paid to Ireland, but a company spokesman declined to answer whether any portion of that figure was paid by subsidiaries other than Apple Sales International. The commission sent its full decision in the case to Ireland on Wednesday. A non-confidential version of that decision will be published, but it’s not expected for at least several months. The timing of its publication will depend on how quickly EU regulators and Irish officials can agree on what sensitive items need to be removed from the full decision, Vestager said Thursday. Senate Report “If it was up to me, the non-confidential version would have been published yesterday because that is another way of enabling everyone to see how we decided and on what basis we made this decision,” she said. Vestager cited one public source of information that EU regulators used: an investigation by a U.S. Senate panel that examined offshore tax avoidance by Apple, Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. In a May 2013 hearing, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations revealed that an Apple subsidiary in Ireland paid just $10 million in taxes in 2011 on $22 billion in earnings, for an effective tax rate of about 0.05 percent. (That’s akin to paying $500 in tax on $1 million of income.) The subcommittee’s report said its calculations were based on non-public information that Apple had supplied in response to specific questions. ‘Awful’ Decision One irony in the case is that U.S. policy makers took no action in response to that 2013 disclosure and others like it; President Barack Obama’s administration and members of the Republican-controlled Congress have been unable to agree on a plan. This week, however, both agreed that the EU’s back-taxes claim against Apple was inappropriate. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the EU decision “awful” and said it “should be a spur to action” in the U.S. “What’s inappropriate is for, in the name of state aid, Europe to be rewriting tax law retroactively, reaching into a tax base that properly should be a U.S. tax base, because it’s U.S. income,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said during an interview Wednesday with National Public Radio. Apple has said it follows tax laws and has paid all taxes due in Ireland; there’s little reason to doubt that, said Douglas Shackelford, the dean of the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University North Carolina. ‘Guesstimating’ Profit “Apple has followed the letter of the law,” said Shackelford, an international tax scholar. “The EC is saying, ‘Yeah, but you violated the spirit of the law, and so we’re guesstimating what those profits were and how they should have been taxed.” It’s clear that Apple practices effective tax avoidance. Like other multinationals, the company makes efforts to avoid the U.S. corporate income tax, which has a top statutory rate of 35 percent -- the highest in the industrial world. Details that the company has released in public filings show that Apple’s foreign profits are taxed at a rate significantly below even Ireland’s 12.5 percent. In 2014, it reported a foreign effective rate of 6.4 percent. Bob McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a left-leaning research group and think tank, said that number indicates that the company has booked a large portion of its profits in tax havens. “If you believe Apple’s annual reports, that most of its profit is earned in foreign countries, it would be impossible for them to get their rate that low unless almost all of the money is booked in tax havens,” McIntyre said. ‘Head Offices’ EU regulators say the company achieved its tax savings in Ireland by means of official rulings that allowed two subsidiaries there, including Apple Sales International, to allocate their profit to a “head offices” that “existed only on paper and could not have generated such profits.” “These profits allocated to the ‘head offices’ were not subject to tax in any country under specific provisions of the Irish tax law, which are no longer in force,” according to the commission’s news release. It also notes that Apple changed its structure in Ireland in 2015. Apple’s Maestri objected to the commission’s conclusion that most of one Irish unit’s profits were “taxed nowhere.” “These profits are taxed in the United States,” he said Tuesday. However, under an unusual provision in the U.S. tax code, most such foreign profit for Apple would be taxed only when Apple decides it should be -- by bringing the offshore earnings to America. As of last month, Apple had $232 billion in cash, with about $214 billion of that being held overseas. Repatriation Planned The company expects to repatriate billions of dollars to the U.S. next year, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an interview with Irish broadcaster RTE, which aired Thursday. He also continued his criticism of the commission’s finding, calling it “maddening and disappointing.” Overall, U.S. multinationals have accumulated more than $2 trillion in offshore earnings that haven’t been repatriated, and U.S. policy makers are trying to reach agreement on a plan for taxing that income at a reduced rate to encourage companies to bring it home. Treasury officials have expressed concern that the EU’s actions against Apple and other companies might reduce potential tax receipts in the U.S. from such a move. That’s one reason the appeals of the commission’s finding will be closely watched. But without public details on where Apple’s profits were booked or where its taxes were paid, there’s only so much an interested observer can learn for now, said Kimberly Clausing, an economics professor at Reed College who studies international taxation. The 0.005 rate that the commission cited “is probably a fairy tale,” she said, “because the numbers Apple reports for its profits, its taxes paid and the countries where profits are generated are all a fairy tale, too.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Subscribe Now Manage Print Account Manage Digital Account About Us Contact Us Work for Us FAQs Submissions News Tips Letters to the Editor Calendar Events Obituaries Legal Notices Advertising Advertise with Us Place an Ad Classified Ads Online Services Newsletters RSS Feeds Facebook Twitter Mobile Apps Text Alerts Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

 What just happened to Apple, explained Dan Bobkoff Aug. 30, 2016, 5:28 PM 138,612 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook. AP The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, is ordering Apple to pay $14.5 billion in taxes to Ireland. But Ireland doesn't want the money, and Apple says it shouldn't have to pay. And the kind of tax breaks that the EU accuses Ireland of offering Apple are similar to the kind of deals common in, and legal in, the US. What happened? This is what the EU says: Apple Inc., which is based in California, set up two companies in Ireland: Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe. According to the European Commission, these companies had no employees or real offices but still realized large profits. Apple paid virtually no tax to Ireland, or to any country, on these profits because of a former law in Ireland. In the last year that the law was in effect, 2015, Apple Sales International paid just 0.005% tax, according to the commission. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. Thomson Reuters The investigation into Apple by the European Commission was led by Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a member of Denmark's social liberal party. The commission is not a tax authority; instead, its job is to maintain fairness between the EU member states. And that brings us to the most important part in this story: The commission says this law specifically favored Apple for special treatment. When Apple sold iPhones, iPads, and Macs in an EU single-market nation, such as France, the commission said Apple would funnel the profits from France to Ireland and would not pay tax in either country. But this is not really about Apple's tax-avoidance strategies, which are infamous. The European Commission's issue is really not with Apple but with Ireland. Aid versus tax How's this for a tricky balancing act? EU leaders have no issue with different member nations charging different corporate-tax rates. That's why it's acceptable for Ireland to charge businesses a 12.5% income tax whereas France levies 33.3%. The European Commission released this infographic showing how Apple paid virtually no taxes through its Irish companies. European Commission This is crucial because nations want to maintain autonomy over their fiscal policies. That's part of the ongoing power struggle between individual nations and the EU (remember Brexit?). What's not acceptable is what the EU calls "state aid." This is when a country offers something special that's seen as benefiting an individual company. It can be even more basic. If France taxed companies in the north less than those in the south, that's generally state aid in the EU's view. It's the same with trying to get a German company to move to Denmark by abating property taxes for a new headquarters. "The view is that not levying taxes that everyone else has to pay amounts to the same result as giving money to just one company," Philipp Werner, a partner in the law firm Jones Day's Brussels office who has represented multinational companies appealing state-aid decisions, told Business Insider. If Apple had just paid the standard 12.5% income tax in Ireland, the country wouldn't have EU leaders upset in Brussels. Instead, the commission says Ireland gave Apple "selective tax treatment" starting in 1991, with the first of two tax rulings. In effect, Ireland signed off on a plan in which Apple would move money to a stateless "head office" with no meaningful activities. "Therefore, only a small percentage of Apple Sales International's profits were taxed in Ireland, and the rest was taxed nowhere," the commission said in a press release. Ireland explicitly said this was fine by its standards. But the EU contends that this arrangement "gave Apple an undue advantage that is illegal under EU state aid rules." "Apple entered into a deal with Ireland to not pay tax on all those profits," Edward Kleinbard, a professor of law and business at the USC Gould School of Law, told Business Insider. Instead, Apple paid "an arbitrarily small amount to Ireland in return for a vague promise to keep jobs in Ireland." Apple and Ireland aren't the commission's first targets. There were similar rulings against the Starbucks' tax dealings in the Netherlands and a division of Fiat in Luxembourg. Apple and Ireland have a different view Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan. Thomson Reuters Apple was one of the first major tech companies to set up shop in Ireland. At the time, in 1980, Ireland was in bad economic shape. Unemployment was high, and many people left Ireland to try to find work in other countries. Low corporate tax was one way Ireland improved its economy and attracted big companies, and Apple was one of the early companies to benefit. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has categorically rejected the notion that this was a special deal for Apple. "The Irish Revenue don't do deals," Noonan told CNBC on August 30. "They issue opinions to clarify a tax situation for individual companies, but we never do deals." He continued to say that Apple doesn't owe any taxes to Ireland. "They may owe it elsewhere, but not to the Irish authorities." To underscore the delicate relationship, Noonan accused the commission of meddling in the policies of sovereign governments. For its part, Apple CEO Tim Cook shot back, saying in an open letter that the European Commission "has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process." Both Ireland and Apple say the company has become a big part of the Irish economy, with 6,000 workers there. And Cook also objected to the ruling being retroactive. Under EU rules, it can compel a country to collect taxes going back 10 years from the first date it asked for information. Ireland doesn’t want the money Here's one of the ironies: The EU is, in effect, ordering Ireland to collect a lot of money. Most, if not all, of the $14.5 billion would go to Ireland and could be used to pay down debts. But Ireland is not interested. "Although they get a huge amount of money back, they also want to fight it," said Werner at Jones Day. "They're not only thinking about Apple — they're thinking a whole lot of other companies established in Ireland." Losing this battle will hurt Ireland's credibility as an inexpensive place to do business, and a place where tax laws are clear and settled. Why is the US fighting this? US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. REUTERS/Gleb Garanich Another irony: You might think the US would applaud any effort to collect tax from US-based multinationals using Irish subsidiaries to pay less, or zero, tax. But there are a few reasons the US Treasury department is vehemently against this EU ruling and other pending cases targeting companies, such as Amazon. One is simple: It wants to protect US businesses, and the Treasury says they're being unfairly targeted by this EU crackdown. Second, the US wants to preserve tax revenue it hopes one day will come its way. Companies like Apple say US taxes are too high, so they keep foreign earnings overseas. But Congress has long debated ways to get multinational American companies to repatriate some of that cash. The Treasury Department says if the commission wins this case, US companies could use these taxes paid in Europe to offset US taxes. That, it says, "would effectively constitute a transfer of revenue to the EU from the US government and its taxpayers," according to a Treasury white paper. What about other European countries? In his letter, though, Cook may have stepped into another debate over its aggressive tax avoidance by saying, " A company’s profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created." This is a different issue. If Apple made money in France but realized those profits in Ireland, it is up to France, not the EU, to complain and try to get some of that money back. The whole reason Apple's European operations are in Ireland, after all, are for its tax advantages. The question is just whether Apple received illegal special treatment. Wait, don't these tax breaks happen in the US all the time? Tesla's Gigafactory, in Nevada, received the kind of tax breaks that would be illegal in the EU. YouTube/Above Reno One reason all this might seem odd to Americans is that the "special treatment" Ireland is accused of giving Apple is similar to incentives American states give companies all the time legally. Massachusetts, for instance, put together $145 million in incentives to persuade General Electric to move from suburban Connecticut to Boston. Never mind that some research suggests these sweetheart deals often don't pay off. Politicians can't stop offering them. When Tesla said publicly it wanted to build a Gigafactory to produce batteries, states like California, Nex Mexico, and Nevada stumbled over themselves to offer the most generous tax breaks. In the end, Nevada agreed to $1.2 billion in tax incentives to win the deal. If these deals were issued by France to attract a company based in Denmark, it would be illegal under EU rules. What about inversions? Some American companies have gone further than Apple to take advantage of Irish tax breaks. Pharmaceutical firm Allergan has acquired or formed Irish subsidiaries and then "inverted," or transferred its legal headquarters to Ireland. Even if its headquarters were in the US, it is effectively an Irish company. "Inversions are separate but related," Kleinbard said. Companies that invert "take advantage of an easily manipulated definition of what is a US company." Nothing in the European Commission ruling affects inversions. It's up to US authorities to crack down if they want to stop the practice. Congress, for instance, could change tax law to consider a company American if its leadership and most of its workers are based in the US. What's next? Apple, the most profitable company in the world, and Ireland, which has some of the lowest corporate taxes, made easy targets for the European Commission. But it's clearly not done yet. It's targeting McDonald's for allegedly paying no tax on its earnings in Luxembourg. The antitrust regulators are also looking into Amazon. Ireland, however, will almost surely appeal the ruling against its dealings with Apple. It has a lot more on the line than $14.5 billion.

Apple on Thursday fixed critical vulnerabilities in its desktop Safari browser and the OS X operating system. The security update comes after Cupertino last week patched a serious iOS flaw that let malware spy on a users' phone calls and text messages. But Safari's mobile and desktop versions share the same codebase, making Mac users vulnerable, as well. According to Apple's advisory, the Safari 9.1.3 bug could allow a hacker to execute arbitrary code on an unsuspecting victim's Mac by tricking the person into visiting "a maliciously crafted website." Hackers employed the same technique recently when they tried to infiltrate human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor's iPhone. The prominent advocate reportedly received a text message from a "cyber war" company with a link to malware that would have jailbroken his handset and installed surveillance software. The exploit, according to research group Citizen Lab (at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto), is connected to NSO Group, an Israeli company best known for selling a government-exclusive "lawful intercept" spyware product called Pegasus. If Mansoor had activated the malware, it would have allowed NSO access to the phone's camera, microphone, and GPS. "Not only could NSO infect iPhones at the touch of a link, but it seems that the vulnerabilities they were exploiting could be weaponized to target many different platforms," Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak told PCMag in a statement. Related Stagefright-Like Vulnerability Hits Apple Devices Stagefright-Like Vulnerability Hits Apple Devices Apple last week released the latest version of iOS, 9.3.5, which fixes the aforementioned issues. The update includes two improvements to how iOS devices access memory, as well as a patch that prevents visits to malware-laden websites. "Kudos to Apple for proactively patching vulnerabilities that could have been weaponized against OS X users," John Scott-Railton, researcher at Citizen Lab, said. "Ahmed Manor's vigilance, and willingness to share a suspicious text message with researchers, continues to pay dividends in the form of security improvements for hundreds of millions of users."

Apple tax: European commissioner defends €13bn ruling Read more The cabinet decision still needs to be endorsed by parliament next Wednesday but a group of independents in the ruling coalition who were concerned about the appeal have already been won over. “A motion will come before the Dáil [parliament] on Wednesday seeking an endorsement of that [cabinet] decision,” a government spokesman said. The tax deal has proved divisive, with the leftwing Sinn Féin party highlighting some voter concerns that the government is in effect turning down a windfall payment that would fund the struggling national health service for a year. But it also plays into wider debates taking place in Britain and elsewhere about whether large corporations are avoiding their tax responsibilities. The counter-argument is that EC bureaucrats are in danger of chasing away multinationals that bring significant numbers of jobs to countries. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Apple boss Tim Cook. Photograph: Niall Carson/PA Ireland’s finance minister, Michael Noonan, said Europe had overstepped the mark in attempting to dictate tax laws and impose current laws on a tax deal with Apple that had been struck 25 years ago. “I believe that there are some very important principles at stake in this case and that a robust legal challenge before the courts is essential to defend Ireland’s interests,” he said. “How could any investor come to Europe if their business was subject to retrospective taxes two decades later?” Earlier in the week Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, described the EC’s decision as maddening and political. Cook wasconfident that it could be overturned on appeal. “It’s disappointing, it’s clear that this comes from a political place, it has no basis in fact or in law, and unfortunately it’s one of those things we have to work through,” he said. Cook called on Irish ministers to join the case against Brussels, saying it would undermine the other foreign investment in Ireland, which is a major source of jobs. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Noonan. Photograph: Cathal McNaughton/Reuters Noonan has repeatedly condemned the EC, which started investigating Apple’s tax arrangements in Ireland two years ago. But Margrethe Vestager, the EC competition commissioner, has said it was wrong for Apple to have paid the equivalent of 1% corporation tax on its European profits in 2003 and that this was down to 0.0005% by 2014. Apple disputes these figures but Vestager has made her case clear: “Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies - this is illegal under Euopean Union state aid rules. “The commission’s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years.” The US government has waded in on behalf of Apple, arguing that the EC is trying to become the world’s tax police officer.

What would photographers like to see included on the new device? September is often a busy time for gadget lovers. Lots of conferences tend to take place in this month, including IFA and Photokina. Apple is also known to hold its release conferences in September – and this year is no different. There’s an event on September 7th, during which, many are assuming that the new iPhone 7 release date, price and specifications will finally be announced. The iPhone camera has always proved extremely popular, so one of the key highlights of the announcement is likely to be how the camera and imaging specs stack up compared to the previous version. We’ve put together a wishlist of things we’d like to see – some of which may come true when the announcement happens… stay tuned to find out if so. iPhone 7 camera wishlist: sensor size It would be great news if Apple decided to equip the iPhone 7 with a larger sensor as this would be better for low light capture, as well as more creativity when it comes to shallow depth of field. Apple stuck with 8 megapixels for a long time, finally upping it to 12 megapixels for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. This still lags behind some other smartphone manufacturers in terms of resolution, but cramming extra pixels on to a sensor of the same size usually results in poorer low light performance. If Apple decides to increase the sensor size, it wouldn’t be surprising therefore if we also see a jump in resolution. iPhone 7 camera wishlist: lens At the moment, the iPhone 6S sports a fixed lens with an f/2.2 aperture. It seems incredibly unlikely that we’ll see an iPhone with a zoom lens any time soon, but it would be good if aperture could be widened to f/1.8. Again, this would be good news for low light capture, helping to let more light on to the sensor. iPhone 7 camera wishlist: native camera app It’s safe to say that the current native app for the iPhone 6S (and previous versions of the phone) is pretty basic. That’s fine for a lot of users, but for more advanced photographers, it can be a little frustrating. Plenty of Android phones give you the opportunity to change key parameters, such as exposure compensation, ISO, metering and so on. We’d like to see Apple giving us that option straight from the native camera app so it’s always on hand. iPhone 7 camera wishlist: raw shooting The capability to shoot in raw format is something that has been available on Android phones for some time. Apple has already announced that iOS 10 will see the introduction of raw shooting support (so that also means that older phones than the iPhone 7 will be able to access it too). However, it’s not certain whether raw shooting will be included in the native camera app, but rather, limited to any developers who want to include it in third-party apps. Again, we’d prefer to see it as standard in the native app. iPhone 7 camera wishlist: optical image stabilisation At present, OIS is included in the iPhone 6S Plus version of the camera, but not the iPhone 6S. This is likely to be because the larger size of the Plus makes it more difficult to hold steady, thus making stabilisation necessary. But if the technology is there, it would make sense to bring it over to all versions of the phone to help keep shots as sharp as possible at all times. iPhone 7 camera wishlist: battery life Battery life is (probably) the biggest bugbear of any iPhone user. Especially so if you’re using the camera a lot. It would be great if Apple could come up with a way of increasing the battery life. Rumours suggest that the device could be even slimmer than the 6S, which may be bad news for those holding out for an increase in battery size. Quick charging would also be a good bonus for those times that the battery drains. iPhone 7 camera wishlist: increased storage options Many Android phones have Micro SD card capability. No iPhone has ever done that – and while we don’t expect that to come to the iPhone 7, it would be nice if it did. What seems more likely is that Apple will ditch the lowest capacity iPhone (16GB) altogether, and increase the maximum size available to 256GB – hopefully enough for even the most snap-happy photographer. iPhone 7 camera wishlist: weatherproofing It would be great if Apple were able to make its iPhones weather or water resistant. There’s plenty of great photography opportunities when it’s raining, or there’s water in the vicinity, but iPhoneographers may be worried about getting their precious device wet . Just think of how many more photos you’d be able to take if that worry wasn’t there (better get the biggest capacity available, then). We’ll find out how many of wishlist specifications are met on September 7 – stay tuned and let us know if you have any of your own in the comments box below.

The new art can be seen within the radio tab of the Music app on iOS and iTunes on OS X. Apple is expected to touch upon software updates coming to its mobile and desktop operating systems at its iPhone-centric event next Wednesday, September 7. These will include iOS 10 and macOS Sierra, both expected to launch alongside the so-called iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus later this month with an all-new and revamped Apple Music app. (Thanks, Manny!)

They might just think you're suggesting they blow up (i.e. enlarge) the font size and album art size to be even larger than it already is in the upcoming iTunes 12.5.

X Apple case: Government cobbles together decision to appeal ruling The message is: nothing should be taken for granted where Independents are concerned, notably with the Budget Thu, Sep 1, 2016, 20:00 Updated: Fri, Sep 2, 2016, 17:03         The Government, in disarray, has cobbled together a compromise that will allow it to appeal against an EU Commission ruling that Apple owes it €13 billion in back taxes while, at the same time, offering an undertaking that corporate tax arrangements will be more transparent in future. A special meeting of the Dáil will debate these matters next Wednesday when Sinn Féin, Anti-Austerity Alliance and others are likely to condemn the decision and demand the money be used for necessary social spending. Ireland was faced by a lose-lose situation once the EU Commission found it had facilitated Apple in avoiding practically all tax on its European earnings. Appealing the ruling will, at best, provide a fig leaf for past “mistakes” and keep faith with one of the wealthiest companies in the world; not appealing would abrogate an agreed tax arrangement and generate uncertainty involving other multinational corporations. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan carefully prepared for this outcome and offered comfort to Apple. But nobody told Independent Ministers. When a preliminary finding was made against Ireland in 2014, the last government began to get its house in order. Against the backdrop of OECD efforts to close tax havens and ensure multinationals paid a reasonable amount of tax, Mr Noonan admitted mistakes had been made and ended to the so-called “double-Irish” tax avoidance measure used by Apple and other multinationals. Bloomberg estimated Apple faced a $19 billion tax bill. But the government believed its remedial action and determination to challenge any formal ruling would greatly reduce any award. It was wrong. The €13 billion ruling and public demands that the money be spent on hospitals and housing almost unhinged an already shaky Government. Independent Ministers refused to support an appeal in the absence of a Dáil vote and a review of the corporate tax system. It was giving them political cover and in the certain knowledge Fianna Fáil – on whose watch the unorthodox tax arrangements had been made – would provide necessary support in the Dáil. ADVERTISEMENT The confrontation soured relations within Government even further. The unmistakable message is: nothing should be taken for granted where Independents are concerned, notably in relation to the coming Budget. At the same time, Fianna Fáil has grown more assertive in demanding additional spending while, within Fine Gael, there is an expectation Taoiseach Enda Kenny may finally embark on his lap of honour. Uncertainty is as unwelcome and as damaging to confidence within politics as it is in business. Rather than squabble over a potential tax windfall in a distant, uncertain future, politicians should consider how they might resolve existing problems and find a more effective way of doing the critical business of governing.       Topics: Enda Kenny Taoiseach Michael Noonan Eu Fianna Fáil Fine Gael Oecd Sinn Fein Apple Bloomberg Ireland Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Opinion Martyn Turner Opinion Cliff Taylor: Tax-take is up, so why do we feel worse off?

In an announcement on its developer website, the tech giant announced that it’s undertaking a broad review of apps in its App Store and will promptly remove those that might not work or that don’t comply with content guidelines.  The housecleaning effort kicks off September 7, the same day Apple is holding a big press event where it’s expected to introduce the next generation of iPhone​. Starting September 7, Apple will be cleaning out its App Store. CBS News The news should be welcome for Apple users who might find out-of-date apps that are in the sea of more than 2 million apps currently available in the App Store​. Developers will be given a heads up -- Apple will give them 30 days to release an updated version of an app before removing it completely from the store.  For developers concerned about the future of their apps, Apple made it clear that ousted apps could still have a life later on.  “When apps are removed from the App Store, they are not deleted from your account,” Apple​ told developers. Similarly, current users who already downloaded the apps will “experience no interruption to services and will still be able to buy in-app purchases,” the company said.  That being said, Apple stressed that it is crucial that developers update their apps so that they can remain in the App Store and attract new users.  In its most recent App Store guidelines, Apple also made it clear it’s taking steps to combat app spammers. Apple hopes to crack down on apps with names that contain deceptive keywords, like when you search for Snapchat​ or Instagram​ and the search turns up a number of other apps that use “Instagram” or “photo-sharing” in their titles.  “App names must be limited to 50 characters and should not include terms or descriptions that are not the name of the app. Apple​ may modify inappropriate keywords at any time,” the company outlined. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The Apple Harvest Festival is almost here, and officials are working hard to prepare for opening day. The 2016 event runs from Friday, Sept. 30 to Sunday, Oct. 2 and Friday, Oct. 7 to Sunday, Oct. 9, and it will include everything that visitors have come to expect from a parade and road race on the first weekend to the arts and crafts festival in the second weekend. Along the way, visitors are treated to fireworks, a number of contests, and a carnival that spans both weekends. Visitors will pour onto the town green for this year’s festival, and few will notice the behind-the-scenes work carried on by the Apple Harvest hostesses, volunteers, vendors, and committee members that goes into a another successful festival. This week, we talk with Apple Harvest Hostess chair Alyssa Pappas, a former hostess herself. She has been chairing the hostesses for six years. Why do you continue to be involved with the Apple Harvest Festival? I really love the family aspect of the committee. We have really been there for each other, not only within the committee, but in many aspects of  life. I consider them my family. What are your duties and responsibilities? I am in charge of the hostesses. I collect applications, conduct the interviews, and then I have the pleasure of crowning the Apple Harvest Queen at the end of the summer. I get to introduce the ladies at our Apple Harvest gala every year at the Aqua Turf, and I also lend a helping hand with some of the carnival and arts and crafts events. Apple Harvest Festival www.southington.org/AHF What are the biggest changes this year for the festival? This will be the second year that we are welcoming high school juniors as hostesses, too. It has been great to see this year’s seniors (who were juniors last year) mentor some of the new hostesses. What are you most excited about at this year’s festival? The food! There will be so many new vendors coming this year, and I can’t wait to try them all. How can people get involved? If any high school junior or high school senior girl is interested in getting involved next year or has any questions about becoming a hostess, then they are welcome to contact me and get more information. I can be reached at alyssa.anne.pappas@gmail.com or by phone at (860) 877-9086. Don’t forget, if you have a question about something other than hostesses, you can check out the Apple Harvest Festival website (www.Southington. org/AHF) or our facebook page.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | September 2, 2016 -- 15:50 GMT (08:50 PDT) | Topic: Hardware We're getting closer to the unveiling of the new iPhone 7, and the rumor mill is in high gear, with leaks at an all-time high. more iphone news iPhone 7 Plus hands-on: A weekend full of adjustments iPhone 7: Best LCD display ever tested CR: iPhone 7 camera does not outperform iPhone 6s Scratch test raises serious durability concerns Apple's supply pinch: Smart marketing or forecasting? iPhone 7 sales may reach 100m in 2016 due to Note 7 recal l Regular readers will know that I don't pick up and report on every iPhone-related rumor and tidbit floating around the internet. It's all too easy for someone to whip up a fake photo or claim to be a "source familiar with the company" and make some outlandish claim (remember how in the run up to WWDC 2016 "sources" were claiming iMessage was coming to Android?). See also: iOS 10 is still a mess, but at least it's a snappy, stable mess So, what you are going to find here is a distillation of the rumors, with an added sprinkle of a few educated guesses based on an understanding of how Apple operates and its historical patterns. What we know for certain First off, here's what we know for certain -- nothing beyond when Apple plans to unveil it: Sept. 7. Beyond that, nothing. Zero. Zilch. Apple doesn't talk about product transitions until it makes them. Well, that's a promising start, isn't it? I promise that it does get more exciting from here on in. When will it be unveiled? Sept. 7. Naming Right now, the favorite in terms of name for the new iPhone is the iPhone 7. This fits in well with the naming convention that Apple has been using since 2010. Every day carry (EDC) pocket tools and g... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 7 NEXT PREV Release date To be perfectly honest with you, we don't officially know that Apple is planning to unveil a new iPhone anytime soon (consider how many predictions there have been for Mac refreshes or an iPad Air 3 over the past year or so that have amounted to nothing). However, based on historical patterns, as well as supply chain information -- you can't make millions of new iPhones without involving a lot of different companies to manufacture the components -- there is very strong evidence to suggest that there is a new iPhone in the works. Joining the supply chain dots with the iOS 10 release scheduled for this fall, and the fact that Apple has, since the iPhone 5, been unveiling a new iPhone on the first or second Tuesday or Wednesday of September, with the iPhone shipping the second or third Friday after the unveiling. There are suggestions -- which may be nothing more than an educated guess -- that this year's unveiling event will fall on Tuesday, Sept. 6, and that means that the iPhone 7 could be released on Friday Sept. 16 or Sept. 23. If the event is pushed to Tuesday, Sept. 13, then the iPhone 7 will likely land Friday Sept. 23 or Sept. 30. Since Apple normally wants the bulk of the new iPhone sales to go into a single quarter -- historically that quarter being Q1 -- it would make sense for the iPhone to be released nearer the end of the month. The end of the Q4 2016 quarter falls on Sept. 24. What will the iPhone 7 look like? Now we're getting into the meat of the rumors and leaks. After all, Apple can't magic millions of iPhones out of thin air, so it has to involve dozens of companies and countless people in the endeavor. All the data points seem to suggest that the iPhone 7 will look pretty much like the iPhone 6s (or, for that matter, the iPhone 6). In other words, the form factor of the new iPhone will not see much material change. There is a suggestion that Apple will introduce a Space Black iPhone, to match the finishes offered in the Apple Watch range. Apple is also expected to redesign the antenna bands on the back of the iPhone, along with a few other small tweaks that I will cover later. What are the expected big changes? While the look of the iPhone 7 is expected to closely resemble that of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6, there will be some key changes. These are expected to be: The removal of the headphone jack, and the old headphones replaced with Lighting EarPods. This is likely to be a bit controversial, so I'm expecting Apple to wrap it up in a package of leaving the past behind and modernizing the smartphone. After all, the headphone jack has been around for decades, and it is both a mechanical failure point and a way for water, dust, and other schmoo to enter the iPhone. The addition of a second speaker, taking the spot of the headphone jack, and finally bringing true stereo output to the iPhone. Swapping out the Home button for a touch-sensitive pad, likely featuring haptic feedback similar to the Force Click feature on the latest MacBooks. Dual cameras. The purpose of the second camera is said to be better low-light functionality, and allowing for more detailed photos. This feature is expected to be only present on the Plus variant. A recent parts leak also suggests that the iPhone 7 will sport an updated display and resolution bump, with the 4.7-inch display on the iPhone 7 going full 1080p (a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080), while the iPhone 7 Plus will go up to 2K (a screen resolution of 2560 x 1440). There's also a good chance that the True Tone technology found on the iPad Pro (which is used to alter the color temperature of the display to match ambient light) will make it to the iPhone 7. Apple has a habit of testing new technologies on one device before rolling it out to other devices, so this is a real possibility. What about the hardware specs? If past patterns hold true, expect the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to be powered by an A10 processor that offers twice the performance -- both computing and GPU -- of the existing A9 system-on-a-chip hardware. Whether Apple will pull this off with a dual-core chip -- or have to bump the silicon up to a quad-core -- remains to be seen. As far as RAM is concerned, I think a lot of this depends on the display. If Apple upgrades the displays to 1080p on the iPhone 7 and 2K on the iPhone 7 Plus, then 3GB of RAM may be needed to prevent frame drops and an overall degradation of performance. 3GB of RAM could also be useful if Apple is going to wade into virtual reality (VR) waters. 50 free Google Chrome browser extensions SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 51 NEXT PREV Will the iPhone 7 be waterproof? Maybe. The iPhone 6s features a rubber gasket that does a good job of keeping out the elements, and the removal of the headphone jack would be another step in the right direction. In many ways it makes sense for Apple to make the iPhone 7 waterproof -- or at least splashproof -- given how many flagship Android devices now sport this feature. What about storage? It is expected that Apple will drop the 16GB of storage option and offer 32GB as the base option. Whether the lineup will be 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB, or 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB is unknown, but more storage is something that is always on the iPhone owner's wish list (along with a bigger battery). What about the pricing? I expect pricing to remain the same as for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. That means the iPhone 7 will start at $649/£539/AU$1079. Will there be an iPhone 7 Pro? It's an interesting idea, and it might help Apple bump up the average selling price of the iPhone. But what would you put into it to make it compelling and separate it from the rest of the pack? I can't think of anything that deems a whole new variant. What about wireless charging? While there have been a few rumors that Apple has been looking into this, there's nothing to suggest that it's going to happen with the iPhone 7. The technology to make it work on a smartphone with a metal chassis is still in its infancy (hence why other devices that use wireless charging feature a glass back), so while it would be nice, Apple isn't ready to go cut the cord of the charger just yet. Quick take on some of the other rumors Four speakers, a-la iPad Pro: Probably not (takes too much space internally). Virtual reality: Maybe, but I'm not seeing any other company really make any significant money from it. Smart connector, a-la iPad Pro: Since I don't see Apple coming out with a keyboard for the iPhone, I find this unlikely. Dual-SIM: Nope. Better battery life: I fully expect battery life to be the same for the iPhone 7 as for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6. See also: High-performance storage for PC and Mac (August...

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration 1/2 left right A 3D printed Apple logo is seen in front of a displayed European Union flag in this illustration taken September 2, 2016. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration 2/2 By Padraic Halpin and Conor Humphries Ireland's cabinet agreed on Friday to join Apple in appealing against a multi-billion-euro back tax demand that the European Commission has imposed on the iPhone maker, despite misgivings among independents who back the fragile coalition. The Commission's ruling this week that the U.S. tech giant must pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) to Dublin has angered Washington, which accuses the EU of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the U.S. government. With transatlantic tensions rising, the White House said President Barack Obama would raise the issue of tax avoidance by some multinational corporations at a summit of the G20 leading economies in China this weekend. Paradoxically, Ireland is determined not to accept the tax windfall, which would be equivalent to what it spent last year on funding its struggling health service. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the European Union began investigating Apple's Irish tax affairs in 2014, arguing that it had to protect a tax regime that has attracted large numbers of multinational employers. On Wednesday, he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers, whose support is vital for the minority government, to agree to fight the ruling by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager that Apple's low tax arrangements in Ireland constitute illegal state aid. However, he won them over when the cabinet met again on Friday. Noonan said the retroactive nature of the EU ruling was "little short of bizarre and outrageous". "How could any foreign direct investor come into Europe if they thought the valid arrangements they made under law could be overturned a generation later and they be liable to pay back money," he said at a news conference. Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe said Dublin stood behind its corporate tax regime as a means of creating jobs. "This ruling has seismic and entirely negative consequences for job creation in the future," he said. Apple, keen to defend its own interests, has already said it will lodge an appeal. For Fine Gael, the main Irish coalition party, a broader principle is at stake. It wants to take on Brussels to safeguard Ireland's decades-old low corporate tax policy that has drawn in multinationals such as Apple, creating one in 10 jobs in what was once an impoverished country. A FAIR RATE OF TAX The Independent Alliance, a group of five lawmakers, fell in line after the coalition agreed to conduct a review of what tax multinationals pay and what should they pay. Transport Minister Shane Ross, an Alliance member, defended Apple up to a point. "I think they were acting legally. What they were doing was making use of extraordinary loopholes that existed there," he told reporters. "Multinationals provide absolutely vital jobs to the economy ... (but) multinationals should pay a fair rate of tax in Ireland." A failure of the Alliance to come on board would have cast doubt on the government's survival prospects. Dublin has just over two months to lodge an appeal to the EU's General Court. If that fails, Dublin has said it plans to take the case to the European Court of Justice. The issue goes to parliament on Wednesday next week, when lawmakers will be recalled from their summer break. The main opposition party, Fianna Fail, also favors challenging Brussels, so the government should easily win the Dail's backing to fight what is by far the largest anti-competition measure imposed on a company by the EU. Some Irish voters are astounded that the government might turn down the money, and the left-wing Sinn Fein party has led attacks from the opposition. Apple was found to be holding over $181 billion in accumulated profits offshore, more than any U.S. company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning nonprofit groups, a policy critics say is designed to avoid paying U.S taxes. But Apple chief executive Tim Cook has said part of the company's 2014 tax bill would be paid next year when the company repatriates offshore profits to the United States. OBAMA TO TAKE THE LEAD The U.S. government is keen to ensure that it, and not Ireland, gets the revenue. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said leaders of the G20 developed and emerging economies would tackle the wider issue when they meet in the Chinese city of Hangzhou on Sept. 4-5. "The president will ... lead the discussion at the G20 about combating tax avoidance strategies that are implemented by some multinational corporations," Earnest said. "We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair - more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States." A number of G20 governments are worried about how multinationals move profits around so they end up getting taxed in a country that has very low corporate rates. Last year the Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development unveiled new measures to tackle corporate tax avoidance. A number of countries have moved to implement some of them measures, but the United States has not. It needs to change its own tax rules which, for example, allow companies to build up tax-free profits offshore. However, Congress has struggled for years to agree such reforms.

The Commission's ruling this week that the U.S. tech giant must pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) to Dublin has angered Washington, which accuses the EU of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the U.S. government. With transatlantic tensions rising, the White House said President Barack Obama would raise the issue of tax avoidance by some multinational corporations at a summit of the G20 leading economies in China this weekend. Paradoxically, Ireland is determined not to accept the tax windfall, which would be equivalent to what it spent last year on funding its struggling health service. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the European Union began investigating Apple's Irish tax affairs in 2014, arguing that it had to protect a tax regime that has attracted large numbers of multinational employers. On Wednesday, he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers, whose support is vital for the minority government, to agree to fight the ruling by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager that Apple's low tax arrangements in Ireland constitute illegal state aid. However, he won them over when the cabinet met again on Friday. Noonan said the retroactive nature of the EU ruling was "little short of bizarre and outrageous". "How could any foreign direct investor come into Europe if they thought the valid arrangements they made under law could be overturned a generation later and they be liable to pay back money," he said at a news conference. Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe said Dublin stood behind its corporate tax regime as a means of creating jobs. "This ruling has seismic and entirely negative consequences for job creation in the future," he said. Apple, keen to defend its own interests, has already said it will lodge an appeal. For Fine Gael, the main Irish coalition party, a broader principle is at stake. It wants to take on Brussels to safeguard Ireland's decades-old low corporate tax policy that has drawn in multinationals such as Apple, creating one in 10 jobs in what was once an impoverished country. A FAIR RATE OF TAX The Independent Alliance, a group of five lawmakers, fell in line after the coalition agreed to conduct a review of what tax multinationals pay and what should they pay. Transport Minister Shane Ross, an Alliance member, defended Apple up to a point. "I think they were acting legally. What they were doing was making use of extraordinary loopholes that existed there," he told reporters. "Multinationals provide absolutely vital jobs to the economy ... (but) multinationals should pay a fair rate of tax in Ireland." A failure of the Alliance to come on board would have cast doubt on the government's survival prospects. Dublin has just over two months to lodge an appeal to the EU's General Court. If that fails, Dublin has said it plans to take the case to the European Court of Justice. The issue goes to parliament on Wednesday next week, when lawmakers will be recalled from their summer break. The main opposition party, Fianna Fail, also favours challenging Brussels, so the government should easily win the Dail's backing to fight what is by far the largest anti-competition measure imposed on a company by the EU. Some Irish voters are astounded that the government might turn down the money, and the left-wing Sinn Fein party has led attacks from the opposition. Apple was found to be holding over $181 billion in accumulated profits offshore, more than any U.S. company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning nonprofit groups, a policy critics say is designed to avoid paying U.S taxes. But Apple chief executive Tim Cook has said part of the company's 2014 tax bill would be paid next year when the company repatriates offshore profits to the United States. OBAMA TO TAKE THE LEAD The U.S. government is keen to ensure that it, and not Ireland, gets the revenue. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said leaders of the G20 developed and emerging economies would tackle the wider issue when they meet in the Chinese city of Hangzhou on Sept. 4-5. "The president will ... lead the discussion at the G20 about combating tax avoidance strategies that are implemented by some multinational corporations," Earnest said. "We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair - more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States." A number of G20 governments are worried about how multinationals move profits around so they end up getting taxed in a country that has very low corporate rates. Last year the Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development unveiled new measures to tackle corporate tax avoidance. A number of countries have moved to implement some of them measures, but the United States has not. It needs to change its own tax rules which, for example, allow companies to build up tax-free profits offshore. However, Congress has struggled for years to agree such reforms.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A #SocialSkim: Apple's Social Video App, Facebook's Offers Upgrade, Plus 10 More Stories This Week by Christian Neri  |   September 2, 2016  |  947 views Tweet Kindle Email Top This week's all about new trends and upgrades, with an unexpected player thrown into the mix. Apple grabbed social media headlines with chatter about its impending social video app, and Twitter upgraded its ad revenue model to attract YouTuber-like influencers to the platform. We'll also fill you in on the new behavioral targeting soon to make Snapchat marketers by storm, share all we know about Facebook's big update to Offers, and let you in on five easy ways to boost the performance of your YouTube channel. Skim to stay in the know! Apple reportedly working on a social video app The initial Bloomberg report says the company's hardware business is slowing, and so it's looking more at its service offerings as a way to boost revenue. The video sharing and editing app's release is set for some time in 2017, and it's believed to allow users to shoot, apply filters, and draw on media much like on Snapchat and Instagram Stories. It might be integrated directly to Apple's iMessage or camera apps as the battle between mobile operating systems and social messaging apps heats up, with each trying to gain on the fact that young users' mobile usage revolves around their phone cameras. Will Apple finally succeed at something social? 1. Snapchat soon to make behavioral targeting a reality The social network is set to introduce ways for marketers to serve ads to Snapchatters based on the accounts they follow and content they watch, targeting behaviors of users within the app itself. Although keeping an eye on users' behavior on the Web, outside of when they're using the app, isn't currently in the pipeline, it's a future possibility as Snapchat integrates new "login with Snapchat" buttons on external websites, like it has with Bitmoji. The new behavioral targeting capability should arrive in the third quarter of this year, and it should help marketers better serve ads and measure performance. 2. Facebook Offers gets an upgrade Dating back to 2012, it may be one of the oldest features on Facebook, and the social network announced a major upgrade to the platform's Offer section this week that changes the way advertisers create offers and the way users redeem them. Marketers are now able to target people the social network thinks are most likely to use or share their offers, and can also include barcodes or QR codes to help keep track of redemption rates. The update also means consumers have a digital coupon drawer of sorts, where they can collect, keep track, and receive reminders when offers are set to expire. 3. Twitter pulls a page from YouTube's book, plans to pay creators for videos Twitter wants the massive audiences that come along with creators like those on YouTube, and it's finally ready to do something about it. The social network is set to begin sharing ad revenue with video creators on the platform, and it will do so with an even more attractive split than YouTube: 70% for the creator, 30% for Twitter. The revenue split applies only to videos on Twitter—not Twitter-owned platforms Vine or Periscope—and content doesn't have to be exclusive. Creators can also post the content on YouTube and Twitter to get a taste of—or a check from—both. The move might be too late to attract video creators who already brushed Twitter to the side, but it's a valiant effort that could make creators think twice. 4. Facebook's WhatsApp under attack by users for sharing data with... Facebook The latest privacy fiasco to awaken the ire of social media users came via the new terms and conditions on Facebook's WhatsApp, which state that the chat app will now share user data with parent company Facebook. Users can still opt out within the next few weeks, but those who don't will see WhatsApp share their phone number and usage stats with Facebook in an effort to improve the relevancy of the ads it serves and provide better friend suggestions. Is the outcry justified? In this day and age, probably not. 5. Facebook gets with the times, realizes vertical videos won't go away The popularity of apps like Snapchat and Periscope have convinced the biggest social player to take another look at its approach to vertical video. Currently, vertical videos on Facebook News Feeds across the world appear as tiny, square blocks, and users have to navigate away from the News Feed to view them full-screen. With some estimates claiming that vertical video ads have completion rates nine times that of horizontal ones, Facebook plans to roll out an update that will now show vertical videos with a 2:3 aspect ratio—not quite optimized to the level of Snapchat, but far from its current ultra-cropped look. 6. YouTube live video viewing leaps 80%! The Google-owned video platform increased the number of live-stream viewing 80% over the past year in an effort to stay ahead of emerging live video players like Facebook and Snapchat. The stark increase is a big achievement considering the website only introduced the live viewing capability last June, after Facebook had already invested heavily in the format. But live streams weren't the only thing that grew at YouTube this year, as popular YouTubers like PewDiePie and Zoella also helped grow new advertising 30% from the previous year. The live-streaming and ad wars are only just beginning, it seems. 7. Facebook reduces human role in Trending Topics after conservative backlash Following a controversy earlier this year that had the social network battling claims of intentional censoring of conservative news stories in its Trending Topics section of the News Feed, Facebook has given up yet another job to the robots. The new Trending Topics does away with the previously human-generated short descriptions of individual topics in favor of algorithmically selected topics that use various posts from users to help paint a picture of the trending story. Facebook announced the change in a blog post, where the company claimed that it "is a platform for all ideas." However, three days into its new job and the algorithm already peddled a fake story. Off to a solid start. 8. Five ways to enhance YouTube videos for your brand YouTube is filled with tons of tricks and features, some more obvious than others, that can help boost the performance of your videos. From the newbies who've just signed up, to the veterans with an already solid subscriber count and consistent content strategy, we've got five great ways to make your YouTube videos go the extra mile. Covered in detail: creating a brand watermark; using direction cues; optimizing keywords, titles, tags, and descriptions; adding annotations and CTA overlays; and adding subtitles and closed captions. 9. Facebook will soon allow users to activate Safety Check on their own The feature has been a sticking point for the social network in the past, with repeated outcry by some that it was activated only when major disasters struck the "West" and ignored other disasters of equal magnitude in other parts of the world. Facebook appears set to change that, with Mark Zuckerberg confirming that the company is developing a way for users to activate the capability themselves. Details are few and far between, with no indication of how users will qualify to create alerts, but the functionality could help the social giant avoid PR problems. 10. Snapchat makes On-Demand Geofilters a cinch in update Snapchat introduced On-Demand Geofilters back in February in an effort to create some new revenue streams, but the capability was pretty much limited to those with at least a basic understanding of Photoshop or Illustrator, as it required users to design and upload their own filters sized just right for the platform. That changed this week, when the social network introduced a series of templates for birthdays, weddings, and celebrations, allowing users to choose from a selection of overlay graphics, pick a color palette, and even upload their own text or images. With On-Demand filters starting as low as $5 based on the geographic area you cover and the length of time you want the filter active, it's now an even more accessible option. 11. We'll wrap with that time Mark Zuckerberg gave the Pope a drone Well, not a real one (drone, that is). Pope Francis may have already joined Facebook's Instagram in March, but ties between the Pope and the social network became even tighter this week when chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a trip to the Vatican following the devastating Italian earthquake. The two discussed the importance of both connecting people and sharing a message of mercy and tenderness, with Zuckerberg gifting the Pope a model of Facebook's solar-powered drone that's set to provide Internet access to those who lack it. The two worlds of religion and technology, often at odds in the past, collided this week, and gave us hope for continued progress. Also, is it just us, or is this the first time we've seen Zuckerberg in anything other than a T-shirt and jeans?

Samsung Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 7: Which is 2016's best phone? iOS 10 'contains massive security glitch' The iPhone 7 is here at last but the reaction is lukewarm at best. Writing in The Verge, Nilay Patel is at first enthusiastic, but says the device is "incomplete" and seems like a bridge between the iPhone 6, which it closely resembles superficially, and "next year's rumoured drastic iPhone redesign". No headphone jack Patel is critical of Apple's decision to drop the headphone jack – technology that has been standard since Victorian times – without fully supporting wireless headphones or speakers from other manufacturers. As the world's biggest tech firm, Apple gets to decide for all of us when it's time to move on from an existing technology, says Patel, in this case forcing users to buy an adapter for their old headphones at a cost of $9 in the US and £9 in the UK. Apple said it dropped the jack partly so that it could make the phone more water resistant. But Gordon Kelly in Forbes points out that rival smartphone makers have managed to make their handsets as water resistant, or more so, than the iPhone 7 while retaining the headphone jack.  The real reason is that Apple wants to move towards a fully wireless phone with wireless audio devices and wireless charging, says Patel. But that's a long way in the future.  In the meantime, Apple is not allowing third parties to extend its AirPlay interface. Instead, only the tech firm's own new W1 headphones "get the fancy new pairing support". That's "disappointing", says Patel. Poor battery life "How good can a phone be if the battery doesn't even last a day," asks The Guardian's Samuel Gibbs. He points out that the phone is Apple's most expensive yet, with the price inflated in the UK by the EU referendum result. According to Gibbs, the battery life is "poor" and worse than the iPhone 6S when new. Using it for apps, browsing, email and photos, he found it lasted an average of 14 hours between charges – and charging is "tediously slow".  But the device does have a larger battery than the iPhone 6, with Apple claiming an extra two hours between charges. Patel praises the improvement but says he thinks the phone will run for the same time as the 6S under heavy usage. The camera is better – but not much The iPhone 7 camera is an improvement on the previous generation, but only a "step improvement, not a major leap", says Patel. Of course, he adds, that still means it is probably "the best camera most people will ever own". Kelly is impressed, however, saying the camera is where the iPhone 7 "steps into the limelight". As evidence, he cites the "larger f/1.8 aperture", optical image stabilisation and the phone's biggest camera innovation, its rear dual lenses, which only come with the iPhone 7 Plus. In addition to the standard wide-angle camera shared with the standard iPhone 7, the Plus has a telephoto lens fixed at 2x magnification. Nevertheless, the dual camera "feels like a novelty rather than a game-changer", says Kelly, partly because the telephoto lens only works in good lighting conditions – in low light, the phone automatically uses the standard lens and zooms digitally.  For Gibbs, the iPhone 7 camera is "greatly improved", although the rear camera is "not quite the best" available. He gives that honour to the Samsung Galaxy S7.  To upgrade or not to upgrade… So is it worth buying the new iPhone. Not if you already have an iPhone 6 or 6S, says Gordon Kelly. "There's simply not enough here to warrant the substantial cost of an upgrade," no matter how impressive the new phone is when considered on its own merits. "If you need a new phone right now, sure, buy an iPhone 7," says Patel. But this is lukewarm praise: the device is "incomplete", feels more like a "prototype" and should be skipped unless you are an obsessive early adopter. "Is this the best iPhone?" asks Gibbs. "Probably," he concludes. "Should you buy it? Not if you care about battery life." iPhone 7: Hissing handsets and other glitches 20 September Headphone jack controversy aside, the iPhone 7 has had some excellent reviews from critics. CNET gives Apple's latest smartphone four and a half stars out of five, saying the camera upgrades, new water-resistance and power improvements are worthwhile upgrades. Alphr, meanwhile, says it's the best iPhone yet and BGR concludes the camera on the standard device is so good you don't need the dual-camera iPhone 7 Plus. Out of the hands of reviewers and in the real world, however, first adopters have encountered a few little niggles… Hissing handsets It seems the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus devices is apparently making hissing sounds when working hard. My iPhone 7 Plus makes terrible noises when under load. https://t.co/wFM2gImpOb — Stephen Hackett (@ismh) September 17, 2016 HissGate, as the Daily Mirror refers to it, appears to be affecting a batch of the new smartphones.  The paper says it is unclear just how many people have bought hissing devices, but Apple has told those affected to get their phones replaced as soon as possible. High demand means they could be waiting for some weeks, though. Glitching headphones As if removing the headphone jack wasn't annoying enough for many, using the Earpods with the phone actually causes a handful of glitches, says the Daily Telegraph. "Some users have reported that the remote control buttons on the wired headphones malfunction after the EarPods have been plugged in for a few minutes, causing songs to sporadically play and pause and Siri to randomly be activated," says the paper. Apple says the problem is caused by a glitch in the software used to control wired headphones and an update to fix it will arrive shortly. Home button horrors Swiping and scrolling a touchscreen display while wearing gloves has never been easy. Apple's new iPhone has added another hurdle – its pressure-sensitive home button won't work without skin contact. With iOS 10, you can unlock the phone through your fingerprint or by tapping in your passcode. However, in order to bring the entry screen up, you've now you to tap the home button rather than swipe the display so it's a complete dead end. The Telegraph recommends that come winter, iPhone-owners use the assistive touch feature when wearing gloves – that's the small dot you can add to your screen if the home button is completely broken.

ADVERTISEMENT In its ruling, the executive branch of the EU said Ireland and Apple had established sweetheart tax agreements in violation of EU regulations. They ordered that Apple pay what it believed was the proper amount owed without Irish “state aid.” Some members of the Irish cabinet disagree with the appeal and argue that Ireland should accept its portion of the back taxes.  Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has pressed for supporting Apple in the appeal saying that, “is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign Member State competence of taxation.”  U.S. politicians and government officials have criticized the EU’s back tax demands, saying that it shows the EU is targeting U.S. companies. The White House has said that President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaObama dares GOP to make healthcare plans public Trump: Tax dollars will 'speed up' the wall Trump blasts away from new bully pulpit MORE will speak on the matter at the upcoming G20 summit next week.  “We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair — more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.

However, not all of these apps get continual support, some may have been abandoned years ago, so Apple is going to be tidying things up and purging any ‘problematic’ apps from the App Store this month. In a notice sent out to developers this week, Apple confirmed that it will be removing apps that have not been updated for compatibility with the latest version of iOS. The main goal here is to seek out apps that don’t “function as intended” anymore, or do not meet the current review guidelines Apple has put in place to curate the App Store. If Apple finds an app that it considers to not be up to scratch, it will notify the developer and give them 30 days to submit an update before removing it completely. This heads up will not be given for any apps that crash on launch though, they will be removed instantly. Apple’s letter brings up one final big change, going forward app names can only be 50 characters long, this is to combat developers including descriptions in app titles to try and rank higher in searches. KitGuru Says: There are a lot of older apps on the iOS store that don’t necessarily work with newer iPhones or versions of iOS, so a clean-up does seem needed.  Similar Posts Categories Tags Related Related Tags: app storeApplenews Categorized Under: Apps cpc464freak And if your using an older Apple device that needs these older apps, then screw you.

Against its nature, Apple may be warming up to the idea of opening up Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging September 02, 2016 Hello World. (Reuters/Stephen Lam) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging September 02, 2016 Apple historically has been a company that likes secrets. Scientists can’t publicly reveal their research, and prototypes under development are laser marked and tracked—iPad developers had to physically chain the iPads-in-progress to their desks. While much remains under the covers at its dark (manufacturing) side, Tim Cook’s Apple looks ready to have a conversation with its consumers. Apple’s dormant Twitter account today (Sept. 2) showed its first signs of life since its inception in 2011. The standard egg avatar was swapped out for the brand’s logo and the bokeh from a recent event invite served as the background. The account even had a new blue tick for verified accounts. However, there’s been no activity. The page reads: “@Apple hasn’t tweeted yet.” Does that mean Apple is waiting to live tweet updates when it releases the next-gen iPhones and more in less than a week? The company did not immediately respond to Quartz’s request for comment. Since Cook has held the reins, the company has given consumers more insight into the brand and its products. It isn’t as draconian about curbing leaks, and top executives have given more media interviews. Ahead of the latest launch, the Cupertino giant started cleaning house with the App Store, making it harder for publishers to game app search—another step in making the Apple experience smoother for users. Adding to the small nuggets of information making their way online, Apple also launched a series dubbed “Apple Originals” in the company news section on its website. These mini articles with screenshots detail updates to Siri that will let her call you a cab, find your best selfie, or transfer money via third-party apps. By posting its own news, the company ensures it remains in control of the narrative while softening its stance on secrecy. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Galaxy Note 7 Batteries Are Exploding Samsung is recalling every single Galaxy Note 7 it has sold so far, and halting sales of existing stock effective immediately. This is because Galaxy Note 7 handsets have a habit of exploding when their batteries are being charged, with 35 cases having been reported so far. Samsung estimates that the faulty batteries affect around 24 in a million devices, or one in 42,000. Which means the odds are good that your Galaxy Note 7 will be absolutely fine. However, Samsung cannot take any chances with a fault that could severely injure people or set their house alight, leaving the company with little choice but to issue a worldwide recall. I shouldn’t make fun of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. After all, it really is the hottest phone that Samsung has ever made. ? — not Jony Ive (@JonyIveParody) September 2, 2016 Samsung is doing its best to tries to assure customers everything is fine, saying: “We acknowledge the inconvenience this may cause in the market but this is to ensure that Samsung continues to deliver the highest quality products to our customers. We are working closely with our partners to ensure the replacement experience is as convenient and efficient as possible.” This is one of the biggest technology recalls there has ever been, and it’s going to cost Samsung a huge sum of money. Over one million Galaxy Note 7 handsets will be recalled, and the pause in sales is going to hit the company hard. Then there is the inevitable loss in consumer confidence that arises from such an epic failure.

It was only in May, at the 2016 Google I/O developers’ conference, that the company announced a host of Project Ara partners and said it planned to ship a developer edition of the product this fall. It should be noted that Google has yet to comment on this story, so Project Ara may live on in some form or another. Reuters speculates that Google “may work with partners to bring Project Ara’s technology to market, potentially through licensing agreements”. Which would make a lot of sense both for Google and those partners. If Project Ara truly is dead, it’s a sad end to what once looked like being the future of smartphones. Still, Google wasn’t the only company working on such technology Google's Project Ara Will Make You Want a Modular Phone Google's Project Ara Will Make You Want a Modular Phone Modular smartphones may sound like fiction, but they're closer to reality than you might think.

The race to the thinnest phone has finally crushed the battery into an unsustainably small space. Apple phones are already notorious for running out of power in the late afternoon or even earlier. These fires could just as easily have happened to iPhones. Samsung just went half a millimetre too far. The Note 7 is already water cooled to stop the CPU and GPU from crashing, sadly the thing that really needed the cooling was the battery. In seeking an alternative phone after handing back two phones to Samsung I recommend looking at thicker phones. Ultra thin "designer" phones are a triumph of art over function - it's a good job they still look nice with the screen blank after the battery has drained. Apple was lucky that "bendgate" didn't turn into "burngate". It's only a matter of time before other manufacturers super thin offerings start to go bang.

A crunch meeting of government ministers scheduled today was delayed in a last-ditch attempt to persuade a divided cabinet to back the appeal. The three independent ministers in the minority government have demanded a parliamentary debate on the issue and a review into how corporate tax is determined. / AFP PHOTO / PAUL FAITHIreland’s fragile minority government agreed Friday to recommend an appeal against the EU’s tax ruling on Apple but said it was recalling parliament early for a special session to debate the issue. The deal overcomes a split in cabinet over the 13 billion euros ($15 billion) plus interest that the EU says Apple owes in back taxes, putting Ireland at the centre of a row between Europe and the United States. Apple chief Tim Cook has urged the government to appeal the ruling to secure future investments but opinion polls have shown public support for Ireland taking the money and spending it on social services. A finance ministry spokesman told AFP there had been a “unanimous decision by the cabinet to appeal the decision” by the European Commission. Parliament will meet next Wednesday, ahead of its scheduled return on September 27, officials said. Earlier this week, three independent ministers propping up the government had refused to back the appeal and said they wanted greater transparency about corporate tax arrangements for multinationals. But after the cabinet meeting, Shane Ross of the Independent Alliance said he and his colleague Finian McGrath had supported the government position. “We felt there was a state of urgency because there was uncertainty out there in the markets amongst some multinationals,” he said. “We were persuaded by the argument that it was necessary to clear up that uncertainty as soon as possible,” he said. Katherine Zappone, another dissenting independent, confirmed she too had agreed to the appeal “in the public interest”. The back taxes that the European Commission has determined the US tech giant owes are equivalent to around five percent of Ireland’s gross domestic product and almost all of its annual health budget. – ‘Do the right thing’ – “Ireland is caught in a dispute between the EU and US over which it has little control,” the UK-based Financial Times newspaper wrote in an editorial. “Bowing to the commission’s ruling would… be a tacit acknowledgement that there has indeed been something rotten in the low-tax regime that Dublin operates to attract multinationals,” it said. Ireland’s minority government relies on the support of the main opposition Fianna Fail party, which is likely to back the appeal in parliament. Some lawmakers believe Ireland cannot afford to undermine its tax policies, one of the main planks of a highly successful inward investment strategy that has consistently attracted the world’s top tech and pharma multinationals over the past three decades. Others say Ireland should take the money and spend it on services or build more affordable homes to deal with a housing crisis. Ireland has two months to lodge an appeal against the ruling. Fianna Fail technology spokesman James Lawless said earlier that Ireland had to appeal but admitted this would be difficult to explain to voters who wanted the money “gift-wrapped on their doorstep”. “I would be more interested in preserving Ireland’s sovereign tax status,” he said, accusing the European Commission of interfering in Ireland’s tax affairs. “Ireland has been caught in the crossfire between the United States and Europe,” he said. On Thursday, Cook turned up the heat further stating his belief that the Irish government “would do the right thing”. “It is important the government stands strong on that because future investment for business really depends on a level of certainty,” he said.

The tech giant could be ordered to pay billions of euros in back taxes to the government in Dublin. The EU has accused Apple, which employs thousands of people in Ireland, of benefiting unfairly from special arrangements with the country that allowed it to keep its tax bills there to a minimum. As a result, the bloc’s Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager could slap Europe’s biggest ever tax penalty on Apple – with Ireland facing claims it effectively gave illegal state aid. European Commission expected to declare that Ireland's tax arrangements with Apple amounts to illegal state aidhttps://t.co/xzdCB0CJsR— RTÉ News (@rtenews) 30 août 2016 Ireland’s low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of economic policy for 20 years, drawing investors from major multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 workers in the country. Apple and Ireland deny wrongdoing; both have said they will appeal any adverse ruling. Any bill in excess of 1 billion euros would be far more than the 30 million euros each the European Commission previously ordered Dutch authorities to recover from US coffee chain Starbucks and Luxembourg from Fiat Chrysler for their tax deals. Both companies and countries have appealed those decisions. The US government has also weighed into the row over Tim Cook’s company, accusing the European Commission of deliberately targeting American firms – something Brussels denies. A huge tax bill would make all the wrong headlines ahead of early September’s expected unveiling of Apple’s latest iPhone. Hot off the presses. Apple makes it official: SF presser on Sept 7.

As a global nonprofit that certifies businesses that meet the highest standards of positive overall social and environmental impact (called B Corporations), B Lab has had to think through this important and complex issue, acknowledging that there are no black-and-white answers.  We offer up B Lab’s Framework for Evaluating Tax Strategies as a starting point for an important public conversation and an invitation to others to help us further refine our thinking over time. B Lab’s framework reflects both the role that taxes play in contributing to, and the value business receives from, a healthy society.  In short:    The evaluation of a tax strategy should include whether 1) the amount of overall taxes paid over time appropriately reflects the actual amount of income generated by the business; and, 2) the amount of taxes paid over time in each jurisdiction appropriately reflects the actual operations of the business in that jurisdiction.  Before thinking about how the above framework might apply to Apple’s tax strategies, let’s back up a bit to understand why this issue is so important: Businesses create value for society beyond the taxes they pay. Businesses create jobs ― preferably high quality jobs that offer dignity, a living wage and benefits to support a family, and the opportunity to find fulfillment and build assets for long term security. Businesses can provide access to basic goods and services as well those that improve our quality of life. However, in addition to the many different aspects of value that business provides society, business has an obligation to contribute its share of taxes. This is because business exists within the context of society; its proper role is to serve society, not the other way around. Moreover, healthy businesses can only exist over the long term in a healthy society. A healthy society depends upon public expenditures made possible by taxes. These public expenditures benefit business in both direct and indirect ways.  Examples include things like national defense, local law enforcement and the enforcement of contracts, transportation infrastructure, and education, but also things that more directly bolster economic activity like pensions, health insurance, and other income support.  This means, in a fractured global tax system that inevitably has its cracks, the bar for a tax strategy that fulfills social obligations should go beyond simply what is legal. Just as there are individuals and organizations who believe that outsourcing manufacturing overseas is bad corporate citizenship, there will certainly be those who believe the same thing about any tax management strategy that results in the reduction of corporate taxes through the recognition of revenues in lower tax jurisdictions.  A thoughtful critic might say that a company could manage its business without routing its revenues through a low tax market, and therefore any reasons for setting up operations in another jurisdiction are just cover for avoiding taxes. This critique, from B Lab’s perspective, dismisses legitimate business choices that include the appropriate management of tax burden, but are distinguishable from more questionable tax avoidance schemes pursued by many companies. Again, the distinction between tax management and tax avoidance is not always black and white. Given these complexities, there ought to be public debate about the appropriate levels of taxation and the sources and uses of tax receipts, as well as regarding effective and responsible tax strategies. As a starting place, B Lab determined that certain tax strategies would require additional scrutiny for companies seeking certification as a B Corporation, including: Employing a “corporate inversion” where a company’s legal domicile is moved to a low/no-tax jurisdiction while material operations remain in its higher tax country of origin; Employing a “Double Irish” tax strategy where corporate income can be effectively taxed nowhere; Utilizing a “patent box” or other method to transfer intellectual property to a low/no-tax jurisdiction and licensing back the intellectual property to reduce/eliminate local taxes; or Utilizing multiple shell entities or structures to reduce or minimize taxes  The public doesn’t yet know sufficient details of Apple’s tax strategy.  Whether or not a company is seeking B Corp status, the public interest is served when we ask tough questions and demand thoughtful answers.  And as details emerge for Apple, it is helpful to have a framework against which we can evaluate those answers.     And this isn’t just about Apple.   Many companies employ aggressive tax strategies.  Asking companies to apply a framework for evaluating tax strategies will help well-intentioned CEOs and CFOs be more thoughtful about balancing the interests of their shareholders with the interests of society, help boards of directors provide better governance, and help all of us make more informed judgements about whether these companies are fulfilling their obligations as corporate citizens.   Tax avoidance is just one headline-grabbing reason why public trust in business is at an all-time low.  If we want to rebuild trust in the capitalist system, we can start by giving business the frameworks and tools to demonstrate that they govern themselves to align their interests with those of society.  If we want to fulfill the promise of capitalism to create a shared and durable prosperity, then indeed it is essential that business leaders set their sights higher than doing what is legal to doing what is responsible and even beneficial to society, not just their shareholders. Asking good questions about taxes is one good place to start.   Also on HuffPost More: Apple Taxes Comments From Our Partners Presented by LendingTree Close SUBSCRIBE TO & FOLLOW THE MORNING EMAIL The Morning Email helps you start your workday with everything you need to know: breaking news, entertainment and a dash of fun.

By Alistair Charlton September 2, 2016 16:30 BST Apple has invited the media to an event on 7 SeptemberScreenshot Apple is holding a media event on 7 September. As far as press coverage goes, it will likely be the biggest technology event of 2016 and where we will first see the new iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and a range of headphones. Headphones will take centre stage here because, controversially, the iPhone 7 will not have a headphone socket. Instead, headphones must be connected either wirelessly or via the Lightning port. To help ease this transition, Apple will include an adapter in the box allowing regular headphones to be connected to the iPhone 7's power port. The event will takes place at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California, a 50-minute drive from Apple's headquarters at Cupertino. Chief executive Tim Cook will start the presentation at 10am local time (6pm BST) and it is expected to last for between 90 and 120 minutes. Thanks to the usual leaks, rumours and gossip, here is what we expect to see: iPhone 7 A dead-cert, no-brainer. The iPhone 7 will be revealed at this press conference. Apple announced the iPhone 6 and 6S during this second week of September the last two years, so of course the iPhone 7 will arrive then too. It will share a very similar design to its two predecessors, saving a major overhaul for 2017, when the Apple phone will celebrate its tenth anniversary. The general look, shape and size of the iPhone will remain unchanged, apart from the unsightly antenna lines, some of which will be removed. The iPhone 7 is expected to lose its headphone jack, as this mock-up showsMartin Hajek The removal of the headphone jack could make the iPhone 7 slightly thinner than the 6 and 6S. It will also be available in a new colour, a black which is darker than Space Grey and more like the black Apple Watch. Apple will, finally, remove the 16GB storage option. We are not sure exactly what the lineup will look like, but it should start at either 32 or 64GB and run all the way up to either 128GB or an iPad Pro-match 256GB. One of the murkier rumours is that the iPhone 7's Home button will not click. Instead it will be touch sensitive Haptic feedback will buzz your finger or thumb to let you know it has been pressed, augmenting the click itself. As always, the new iPhone will be faster and more powerful than ever before. Less clear is whether the new model will finally get official water resistance, a rumoured blue colour option and wireless charging. These would all be welcome, but seem fairly unlikely at this stage. iPhone 7 Plus This mock-up suggests the iPhone 7 Plus will be called the Pro and would feature a dual rear cameraMartin Hajek The larger iPhone 7 Plus will retain the same 5.5in screen as the iPhone 6S Plus (as opposed to the 4.7in iPhone 6S and 7), but will receive an all-new rear camera with two lenses. This camera, as is teased by the event invitation, will produce images with a greater depth of field, giving them a "bokeh" effect, where objects in the background or foreground can be moved out of focus. The dual lens could also work to emulate a proper optical zoom, rarely seen on smartphones. The iPhone 7 Plus could also benefit from a 256GB storage option (if this doesn't come to the iPhone 7) and the inclusion of the same three-pinned Smart Connector as the iPad Pro. Through this, accessories like a keyboard dock could be attached. Unlike what previous rumours claimed, Apple will not launch a third handset called the iPhone Pro. Instead, the features of this phone will be included in the 7 Plus. AirPods The iPhones will comes with a pair of wired EarPod headphones in the box, which now connect to the Lightning port. But Apple is tipped to have more headphones in production; one, called AirPods, will be a wireless, rechargeable version of the EarPods already on sale. Beats headphone range Apple looks set to unveil a new range of iPhone 7-friendly Beats headphones at a media event on 7 September in San FranciscoReuters As well as the AirPods, Apple will reveal a range of new Beats-branded headphones. An email accidentally sent out from the Beats PR team on 1 September read: "A selection of new Beats by Dre products will be unveiled." It is likely that the new range will include some wireless and some Lightning headphones, at various prices. In all, we expect to see three models revealed on 7 September. Watch 2 or Watch S The Apple Watch could be updated for the first time later in SeptemberReuters A new Apple Watch is in the works, but it isn't yet clear if it will be revealed alongside the iPhone 7 or not. The original Watch shared the stage with the iPhone 6 back in 2014, then arrived in stores some six months later. We expect the lead time to be much shorter this time, but can't say for sure if the new Watch will arrive in time for Christmas. The latest gossip suggests the new Watch will be an interim update (a Watch S, if you like) and will look broadly the same as the current model. Updates are said to include a faster processor, GPS, and a "noticeably thinner" glass display. This means the screen will be the same size, but the depth of the glass and the thickness of the Watch will be reduced. iOS 10 iOS 10 is the latest free software update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touchApple Apple will reveal the final version of iOS 10, its latest software update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. We already know what to expect here and have covered it several times already. New features include revised Control and Notification centres, plus a new Home app, the ability to delete Apple's own apps, and much more. iOS 10 will be made available later in September, just before the iPhone 7 goes on sale. watchOS 3 It's the same story with watchOS 3. Here the Watch gets its biggest software update yet, making it much, much faster and introducing a new Dock to help make switching between apps quicker and easier. macOS Sierra Another piece of software we have seen before, macOS Sierra will also be finished in time for the 7 September event. Aside from some visual and performance upgrades, the biggest feature here is how Siri is coming to Macs for the first time. As with iOS 10 and watchOS 3, macOS Sierra will be shown off here but not made available to the general public for another couple of weeks.

The country’s cabinet agreed to appeal the ruling during a meeting today, with the decision to be finalized by a full vote in parliament next Wednesday, according to Reuters. Immediately after it came down this week, Ireland’s Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, criticized the Commission’s ruling, saying he “profoundly” disagreed with it. At stake for Ireland, he said, was “integrity of our tax system” and the ability to provide “tax certainty to business.” Apple likewise criticized the ruling as an attempt to “ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process.” The US also criticized the decision, but more from the perspective that Apple should be paying these taxes to the US, rather than Ireland. Ireland is in the awkward position of turning down €13 billion The Commission announced its ruling on Tuesday, saying that Apple had benefited from an illegal tax deal in Ireland. That resulted in it paying an effective tax rate on European profits that ranged from 1 percent in 2003 to 0.005 percent in 2014, according to its investigation. The tax deal offered Apple “a significant advantage over other businesses,” the Commission said, which amounted to unfair competition and makes it illegal under European Union law. Its chosen remedy is for Ireland to collect the unpaid taxes of “up to €13 billion, plus interest.” That’s put Ireland in the awkward position of having to turn down billions in order to defend its tax structures. The country has been appealing to tech companies because of its low taxes, with one recently closed loophole allowing Apple and others to save billions over the years. Apple has said it is “confident the decision will be overturned.” More From The Verge The Verge: 2016 Yearbook The best games for your new PC or Mac The 15 best movies of 2016 Behind the scenes at Faraday Future, an electric carmaker on the brink of collapse The Verge 2016 tech report card: Facebook The best apps you didn’t know you needed for your new Android phone Now Trending This is Apple’s click wheel iPhone prototype Displays are the secret superstars of CES How much can police find out from a murderer’s Echo?

"This streaming war shit is so sus," the celebrated producer writes. Metro Boomin, the celebrated producer behind artists like Future ("Jumpman," "Low Life"), Travi$ Scott ("3500") and Kanye West ("Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1," "Waves") is one of the brightest rising stars in hip-hop today. But while many of his collaborators have weighed in on the streaming wars, choosing to debut albums exclusively with Apple Music (Future's Evol, Drake and Future's What a Time To Be Alive) or Tidal (Kanye West's The Life of Pablo), the 22-year-old took to Twitter yesterday to decry the continued fracturing of the streaming marketplace. From Beyonce to Frank Ocean, Breaking Down the Mechanics, and Politics, Behind Streaming Exclusives "Just searched iTunes for 10 minutes for song cry by jay z and couldn't find it, then searched 4 blueprint and remembered tidal vs apple," he wrote on Twitter yesterday. "This streaming war shit is so sus with all the exclusivity bullshit. Just let the kids have the music because that's what it should be about... Shouldn't have to have subscriptions to 2 different services just to listen to blueprint and views. Makes me miss how simple CDs were." Metro's complaints echo those of many in the music industry, as well as plenty of fans, who decry the practice of exclusives that force many to sign up for multiple streaming services in order to hear the latest music from some of the biggest artists in the world. Spotify -- which has thus far stayed out of the exclusives game -- and Apple Music and Tidal all charge $9.99 a month for on-demand access to their catalogs of millions of songs. 'Bad for the Industry': Spotify's Artist Whisperer Troy Carter Slams Exclusives, Updates Company's Subscriber Total And in the wake of Frank Ocean's back-to-back Apple Music exclusive album releases, Endless and Blond, the latter of which was released without his former label Def Jam, Universal Music Group chief Lucian Grainge instituted a ban on one-platform exclusives for all the artists under the purview of the biggest record label in the world. Grainge, as well as other executives in the industry across several different labels, is upset that exclusives don't give new releases the widest market share available, segmenting the available audience to, for instance, Apple Music's 15 million paid subscribers, or Tidal's four million. Metro, similarly, wants his music to be heard by as many people as possible wherever they prefer to listen. Beyonce, Drake and the 'Exclusives' Explosion: How Streaming Has Changed the Way Albums Are Released "I promise all my fans and supporters that my album will not be any kind of streaming exclusive. Fuck the money I do this for the culture," he continued on Twitter. "Apple Music, tidal, Spotify, Pandora, whatever you use, my album will be instantly available and accessible for you. Because thats the point." Metro has released two projects under his own name in his career, the mixtape 19 & Boomin in 2013, which featured contributions from Future, Gucci Mane, Young Thug and more, and the collaborative project with 21 Savage, Savage Mode, released this past July.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers   skip to main content skip to main menu     Samsung issues global Note 7 recall after complaints of exploding batteries By Christian Zibreg, Sep 2, 2016 Tweet 92 Comments It looked like Samsung was well poised to steal some of Apple’s thunder by releasing its Note 7 phablet with a redesigned appearance and wraparound screen ahead of Apple’s iPhone 7 event. But following reports from users around the world about a battery issue that has caused some handsets to catch fire or explode, Samsung has now announced plans to recall every single Note 7 sold in order to prevent further damage and has also abandoned today’s scheduled Note 7 launch in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. After a thorough investigation, Samsung was able to discover the main culprit of exploding Notes: a battery cell issue. As of yesterday, the company knew about 35 globally reported cases of exploding Notes and has now stopped sales of the device because “our customers’ safety is an absolute priority at Samsung”. Here’s Samsung’s statement in full: Samsung is committed to producing the highest quality products and we take every incident report from our valued customers very seriously. In response to recently reported cases of the new Galaxy Note7, we conducted a thorough investigation and found a battery cell issue. To date (as of September 1) there have been 35 cases that have been reported globally and we are currently conducting a thorough inspection with our suppliers to identify possible affected batteries in the market. However, because our customers’ safety is an absolute priority at Samsung, we have stopped sales of the Galaxy Note7. For customers who already have Galaxy Note7 devices, we will voluntarily replace their current device with a new one over the coming weeks. We acknowledge the inconvenience this may cause in the market but this is to ensure that Samsung continues to deliver the highest quality products to our customers. We are working closely with our partners to ensure the replacement experience is as convenient and efficient as possible. The South Korean company should be praised for acknowledging the issue and taking swift action so quickly, before it blew out of proportion and made the evening news, but it remains to be seen if this incident will tarnish the Samsung brand.

Scr-U-gle Samboom haven’t recalled their exploding phone still. n0ahcruz3 Funny you feature this but not the “touch disease” that’s been plaguing some iPhone 6/6+ users which led to a lawsuit for apple. Lol BenjamimDaniel Partiality… that’s the word you’re looking for… George They haven’t even spoken about it once. It’s actually laughable. 5723alex . “touch disease” doesn’t kill, Samsung’s devices exploding may kill as has happened in the past. :|Alain|: That’s exactly what i was going to say. Their argument is invalid Bryan Barrios Weed is Safer than A Samsung Device. legalize it ! Rowan09 Lol n0ahcruz3 Lol of course fire is dangerous duh! Apple had it’s own share of exploding iphones if u recall although not to the point they had to recall it. Remeber the Macbook screen issue? Apple didn’t acknowledge it first it’s laughable Rowan09 You do know when it’s an Apple issue they resolve the issues with the customers some way, especially for new devices. n0ahcruz3 Of course im aware lol hey been an iPhone user as long as i can remember , so i know i was just pointing out why iDB didn’t post anything regarding it. And also any trolling im doing is cause Apple been really slow with their upgrades as a long time iPhone user just frustrated. Lol (not an apple fan tho, but prefers iPhone over android). Rowan09 There’s a reason Apple takes their time because if this was an Apple issue you would see how much worst it would be. Randy Lahey It hasn’t killed anyone so that’s a stupid comment. But nice try. Let me guess, you’re one of those appletard fanboys. Mindless sheep, you’re all hilarious. Ashy Larry Something tells me you aren’t really laughing. LOL! therealjjohnson Screens failing on a 2 year old phone trump a global recall on a device that is catching on fire? Laughable. Jayy What’s the touch disease? Blip dude Look up ifixit’s YouTube video regarding this for a better explanation. But from my understanding (I could be wrong), it sorta connects with bend gate, which can eventually lead to the screen no longer accepting touch responses. Like I said, check ifixit’s YouTube as they actually go in depth with that particular issue. Jayy Alright thank you! I hope that’s not an issue for my 6s plus! Christian Zibreg I hear you. In my view, touch disease is not on the same level as voluntarily issuing a complete recall of 2.5 million units of your flagship product, a move that’s likely going to cost you hundreds of millions of dollars not to mention the reputational hazard and having your brand tarnished by reports of exploding batteries. Jake Platt It won’t damage their reputation at all. Samsung is in good shape currently and have a lot of momentum in the smartphone world. Once customers get their replacement unit and this blows over in a few weeks, it will be forgotten and people will continue to sing the praises of the latest Samsung phones. Sadly, I think Apple’s reputation is the one that is in danger for trailing so far behind in terms of features and sporting the latest technology in their phones. And the iPhone 7 is going to compound that. I feel we may be waiting another year before they make a decent play at an innovative new device. tralalalalalala50 Apple needs more features like exploding phones? I think the main reason for the recall is so that they can bring the phone behind a barn to be shot, the phone is still slower than the iPhone6s 🙂 Jake Platt Well that’s a little naive. No one can argue that Apple’s dominance of the market is under serious threat from competitiors for not pushing the envelope with new iPhone releases. As for that old speed chestnut, yes no one can deny that Apple’s software is far better designed and optimised. I’d also like to mention that 35 exploding units out of the 2.5 million sold is 0.000014% of units affected. That is very low numbers. It’s only due to the safety concern that it poses that this story has any traction at all. tralalalalalala50 Yep, same thing with automobiles. It’s just a phone, no need to make one that explodes. Scr-U-gle Actually they have sold 1.5m units, they shipped 2.5m, and it is now 70 phones in the US alone. The iPhone 6s is 50% faster than the note 7. That is raw processing power, not just software. Third party apps running video effects are showing this speed difference. Mister Miss If you have an Apple product, you would know by now that Apple doesn’t play the “be first” game. They make products that simply work. While I applaud Samsung for trying new and different things, making a phone with 100 features, when the average consumer uses 5 is pointless. On top of that, Samsung’s customer service is not anywhere near Apple’s. Go ahead and buy your GN7 and enjoy the iris scanner, DNA sampler, radioactive night vision teleporter and, oh yeah, headphone jack. The “kitchen sink” approach has never been Apple’s style. Jake Platt I write this from an iPhone 6s. Also own a Galaxy S7. Have owned every iPhone from the iPhone 4 and this is the first year that I am completely unenthusiastic about a new iPhone release. They don’t need a “kitchen sink” approach to excite consumers again. Mister Miss We’re you enthusiastic about the Galaxy Note 7 release? Galaxy S6 or S7? Sony Xperia XA? Huawei Honor 8? Xioami Redmi Pro 4? Meizu MX6? At this point, there are mid range devices that so exactly or better what any galaxy or iOS can do while costing a fraction of the price. iOS and Android are very similar when compared to windows phone. But hey, if phones make your panties wet, more power to you. Jake Platt Well, while I prefer the company of a naked female to make my “panties wet” I was enthusiastic enough about the S7 to get one. Blip dude It doesn’t matter that these issues are not on the same level. It’s still an issue that shouldn’t be happening, especially if the consumer didn’t intentionally try to damage their own device period. PhoneTechJay Relax, Samsung is just catching up, iPhone batteries use to explose too, luckily that isnt a feature anymore. Samsung needs more innovation Mike I heard apple is just getting 32gb as their standard… Congrats now maybe in 4 years you might finally get a better screen from that 720p or 1080p screen… PhoneTechJay If I wanted a 1080p screen I’d have a Plus series iPhone. But idc about the resolution soo…. sherlockeb You’ll care when it’s on your brand new shining iPhone Blip dude Not me. I have a 6S+ with 1080p and have my vids in 720p. Saving on both Data and Storage. Sometimes, I’ll just watch videos in 360/480p if it comes to it. Hell, I even stream 720p on the iPad when I’m on WiFi. Believe it or not some of us really don’t care about resolution, especially on a 5+ inch screen. PhoneTechJay Sorry to disappoint. But I wont. Most iPhone users could care less about the screens resolution.. Its clear as it is so you aren’t really saying anything… Blip dude Thanks, but I honestly don’t need anything better than 1080p. Hell, I watch my content in 720p. I don’t need my phone to be more than 1080p, but Tablets and television I can understand. Believe it or not, there are even Android user who could care less about screen resolution. Mike It’s not about needing. If you have a company like Apple which makes millions of dollars with each release why not add all the features that are available for them to use. It doesn’t even have to be 2k like samsung but they could at least have 1080p on both the 6 and 6+ phones. That’s the only thing I hate about apple. They will release two phones that are exactly the same but won’t include some of the specs that are in the + to the 6. People shouldn’t have to settle for a 720p screen just because they prefer a smaller screen. Like if you look at samsung they have every single spec copied over from the s7 to the n7 which isn’t a bad thing since it lets people buy a bigger or smaller phone that offers what the other phone has. racerhomie2 Bro its a phone 720p and 1080p is more than good enough,its for MUCH better Battery life The King Trust me, I see some of the articles that get posted and others that are avoided all together. While both Android and Apple sites have their issues, its sad to see what is reported and what isn’t on them for the benefit of companies that do not give two craps about them. Scr-U-gle Whats even funnier is how the Androne sites haven’t mentioned the phonebuff real world test of the Note 7 vs the iPhone 6s! You know where the latest greatest Note 7 turns out to be 50% slower than a year old iPhone. Nor are they talking about the S7 lawsuit where the phone exploded in someone’s pocket, no impacts, no charging, just exploded. Two weeks into this latest Samboom debacle and still no recall. Kaboom-gate is only getting worse not better. Troy Looks like we have to apologize to Samsung..they were right… the note 7 is without a doubt the hottest phone out Ashy Larry :|Alain|: AHAHAHAHA what a great pun Jayy Lol Bradley Hines Where’s the apple case at with their touch disease? Anyone? :|Alain|: Well a malfunctioning touchscreen doesn’t put the user’s life at risk. However, An explosion or a phone catching fire is pretty dangerous. And also, this site always posts about apple lawsuits and legal issues. They probably missed this one. Sebastien Your assumption is partly correct. We missed that one on day 1 and day 2. After that it was just old news. We also don’t always report on lawsuits against Apple because most of them are frivolous and in the large majority of cases, plaintiffs usually lose. This said, we should have covered it on day 1. We have limited resources and sometimes more important stuff get prioritized. That’s what happened in this case. Mea culpa. Mike like making articles about ios10 wallpapers? Blip dude Believe me, I prefer a blog that may occasionally focus on iOS 10 wallpapers than a supposed “Apple Fanboy” blog that becomes more focused on Pokemon Go and Snapchat how-tos. Not that I’m bashing on either, just saying. Tommy Gumbs I respect them for this choice. Apple would push it off. Like this “Touchgate and the iphone6 plus I have sitting on a seat with a bad screen that they told me I would have to pay for……and now there is a pending class action suit against them. Or “Antenna gate”. But then again, Apple probably would not have had this issue to begin with. Rowan09 Respect them? They had no choice but to do a recall. Anything that explodes or catches fire will definitely have a recall. I had an iPhone 4 and didn’t have Antenna Gate neither did any of my friends and I owned a 6 Plus and didn’t have any touch gate issue. Regardless non of those issues are life threatening. Remembering when a Chinese person died from electrocution due to using a cheap aftermarket charging while in the bath? Apple started a program that would take after market chargers and replace them with real ones and they didn’t even have to do it because it wasn’t their fault. Every company do things to save face and in case of safety, it’s a must. Tommy Gumbs Dude relax. It’s just the internet. I didn’t even bother reading your whole rant BTW. Rowan09 Lol. I’m cool therealjjohnson You were also correct. therealjjohnson Got owned on your comment then went with the “dude relax its just the internet” lol. Tommy Gumbs I actually didn’t…I just don’t care that much. I could go into his post line by line if I wanted. But…..again, its the internet. 🙂 Rowan09 But yet you made a post on the Internet Tommy Gumbs Well, yea. I will talk via the internet. I won’t get into disagreements though. No time for that. But here you go. You said, “you didn’t have the issue with the iPhone 4 or the iPhone 6.” Well, just because a product has an issue, that does not mean that the problem is inherent of all the products. For example, not every Galaxy is catching fire. I believe I read only 30 something cases have been reported. When it comes to safety, and doing the right thing, this is a fine line. I am a Professor of Business, among other things, and this statement can be argued over and over again. In the 80’s when Tylenol had the unfortunate poisonings, the CEO’s advisors did not want the CEO to remove EVERY bottle from the shelves as the monetary cost would amount to a staggering amount. However, that is what they did. Now, we can speak about examples where the opposite happened and companies looked the other way to save a buck. Lets not talk about idiots using electronic devices while in the bath…. Anyway, if you have read all of this, congratulations. I know I would not have. 🙂 Rowan09 Lol. I see this won’t continue so no point on responding and yes I read people’s comment especially when I make one. Tommy Gumbs Now we are on the same page. 🙂 I will admit that I am upset over the touch gate issue that my iPhone 6 plus has. But, it is not the end of the world. Cheers! Heatfan316 Wrong… #ScratchGate – No replacements Yellow tint amoled – No replacement Galaxy S dropped calls – No replacement Note 7 Lag – No replacement Note 5 S-Pen Design Flaw – No replacement Galaxy S4 Speed Class Action – No replacement Galaxy S3 Sudden Death – No replacement Galaxy S4 Battery Class Action – No replacement 600 million Samsung Galaxy devices vulnerable to hackers – No replacement Samsung convicted of DRAM price fixing Samsung Poisoning it’s own employees and destroying evidence Samsung caught cheating on benchmarks Samsung Chairman Lee Kun Hee resigns over Corruption scandal. Tommy Gumbs I made no reference to any of these instances so please take this argument to the correct thread. Thanks Heatfan316 You made a statement about Samsung’s ‘respectful’ actions in this case and that Apple would push it off. That’s not the case as evidenced by several of Apple’s recalls and the long list of failures by Samsung. Rowan09 Thank you Mike Can you not read? He said “I respect them for this choice.” KEYWORDS TO KNOW: “THIS CHOICE” he isn’t talking about past choices… the only one that was made regarding this article… Heatfan316 Can you not read???? “Apple would push it off.” There is no equivalency between Samsung and Apple. Samsung has exhibited a history of anti consumer and anti employee behavior. Scr-U-gle You forgot Explode-Gate, where the Note 7 explodes and Samboom have still not issued a recall. It just takes a few minutes to look at Androne fan sites where genuine users are complaining that they still are being refused returns at the point of sale. Two weeks into this fiasco and still no actual recall and three times a day Samboom issue contradictory statements. Well, if you buy a cheap Korean knock off, you get a cheap Korean knock off, funny thing is, the rrp is higher than an iPhone! Docservlet It’s almost like some of the ADdroid fans don’t actually know these forums exist. I’ve seen forums full of complaints about malware and how to fix it not to mention this recent ExplodeGate! FAndroids live in incredible denial. leart I’m still using a iphone 4 and never had a single problem with the antenna .. not sure what it was antenna gate… Tommy Gumbs It will depend on which iPhone 4 you have.

Kaboom-gate is getting more ridiculous by the day. It’s like the whole fiasco is being managed by unsure inbred family members who are not really qualified to run an electronics company and are more suited to selling fish and vegetables. Oh wait, that is what Samboom is, fish and vegetable company run by family memebers who should have stuck to what they know instead of getting into the knocking off everyone. Super Guest My baby daddy wuz just talkin to tha VZ rep bout returning tha phone. Life ruined!!! Xee That’s why Samsung made it water resistant – in case it catches fire therealjjohnson touche.

Deputy Boyd Barrett said, “The closing of rank f the entire political establishment to protect Apple’s tax avoidance strategies and to aid them was effectively “economic treason” against the citizens of the country.” Deputy Boyd Barrett said that “to appeal the EU ruling rather than collect the €13 billion in owed taxes from Apple would be to continue the economic treason committed by the political establishment against the citizens of this country – particularly those who are homeless and poor, those suffering the dire crisis in our health service or young people suffering from the chronic lack of funding and investment in our education system.” Deputy Boyd Barrett said the government should “abandon their disgraceful plans to waste more public money appealing the EU ruling and instead collect the taxes from Apple that they owe the people of this country.” Deputy Boyd Barrett concluded saying, that in his opinion “Apple were not the only company that benefited from a systematic policy pursued by successive Fine Gael and Fianna Fail led government’s to facilitate aggressive tax avoidance and outright tax evasion by some of the biggest and most profitable corporations in the world.” Deputy Boyd Barrett called for a “forensic investigation of the tax affairs of all the companies based in Ireland, who benefitted from the so-called “double-Irish” tax scam.” Please Note: Motion submitted Thursday 27th June 10.34am Motion to Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform From Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett “That the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform sub-committee on Global Corporate/Multi-national Taxation Architecture, shall as part of its terms of reference, invite into the committee to give testimony and answer questions, representatives of multinational corporations based here in Ireland, including representatives of Apple, Google, Facebook and other such corporations as the sub committee may deem appropriate”.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: BUSINESS Ireland has decided to fight the EU on Apple tax bill Reuters September 2, 2016 7:50 AM Above: The Apple logo on the side of the company's new retail store in downtown San Francisco, Calif. on May 21, 2016. Image Credit: Ken Yeung/VentureBeat DUBLIN (Reuters) – Ireland’s cabinet agreed on Friday to join Apple in appealing against a multi-billion-euro back tax demand that the European Commission has slapped on the iPhone maker, despite misgivings among independents who back the fragile coalition. The Commission’s ruling this week that the U.S. tech giant must pay up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) to Dublin has angered Washington, which accuses the EU of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the U.S. government. With transatlantic tensions rising, the White House said President Barack Obama would raise the issue of tax avoidance by some multinational corporations at a summit of the G20 leading economies in China this weekend. Paradoxically, Ireland is determined not to receive the tax windfall, which would be equivalent to what it spent last year on funding its struggling health service. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has insisted Dublin would fight any adverse ruling ever since the European Union began investigating Apple’s Irish tax affairs in 2014, arguing that it had to protect a tax regime that has attracted large numbers of multinational employers. On Wednesday, he failed to persuade a group of independent lawmakers, whose support is vital for the minority government, to agree to fight the ruling by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager that Apple’s low tax arrangements in Ireland constitute illegal state aid. However, he won them over at a second attempt when the cabinet met on Friday. Apple, keen to defend its own interests, has already said it will lodge an appeal. For Fine Gael, the main Irish coalition party, a broader principle is at stake. It wants to take on Brussels to safeguard Ireland’s decades-old low corporate tax policy that has drawn in multinationals such as Apple, creating one in 10 jobs in what was once an impoverished country. A fair rate of tax The Independent Alliance, a group of five lawmakers, fell in line after the coalition agreed to conduct a review of what tax multinationals pay and what should they pay. Transport Minister Shane Ross, an Alliance member, defended Apple up to a point. “I think they were acting legally. What they were doing was making use of extraordinary loopholes that existed there,” he told reporters. “Multinationals provide absolutely vital jobs to the economy … (but) multinationals should pay a fair rate of tax in Ireland.” A failure of the Alliance to come on board would have cast doubt on the government’s survival prospects. Dublin has just over two months to lodge an appeal. A government spokesman said the issue would go to parliament on Wednesday next week. The main opposition party, Fianna Fail, also favors challenging Brussels, so the government should easily win the Dail’s backing to fight what is by far the largest anti-competition measure imposed on a company by the EU. Some Irish voters are astounded that the government might turn down the money, and the left-wing Sinn Fein party has led attacks from the opposition. Apple was found to be holding over $181 billion in accumulated profits offshore, more than any U.S. company, in a study published last year by two left-leaning nonprofit groups, a policy critics say is designed to avoid paying U.S taxes. But Apple chief executive Tim Cook has said part of the company’s 2014 tax bill would be paid next year when the company repatriates offshore profits to the United States. Obama to take the lead The U.S. government is keen to ensure that it, and not Ireland, gets the revenue. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said leaders of the G20 developed and emerging economies would tackle the wider issue when they meet in the Chinese city of Hangzhou on Sept. 4-5. “The president will … lead the discussion at the G20 about combating tax avoidance strategies that are implemented by some multinational corporations,” Earnest said. “We need to find a way to make the global system of taxation more fair – more fair to countries around the world, particularly countries like the United States.” A number of G20 governments are worried about how multinationals move profits around so they end up getting taxed in a country that has very low corporate rates. Last year the Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development unveiled new measures to tackle corporate tax avoidance. A number of countries have moved to implement some of them measures, but the United States has not. It needs to change its own tax rules which, for example, allow companies to build up tax-free profits offshore. However, Congress has struggled for years to agree such reforms.

Pestano   |   Sept. 2, 2016 at 10:32 AM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo DUBLIN, Ireland, Sept. 2 (UPI) -- Ireland's cabinet has agreed to appeal against the European Commission's ruling that tech giant Apple must pay back $14.5 billion in allegedly illegal tax benefits. The cabinet held a 30-minute meeting before making the decision on Friday. A government spokesman said a motion to appeal the ruling will be presented to the Dail, the Irish parliament, on Wednesday. The Irish government previously said it "disagrees profoundly" with the decision. Apple CEO Tim Cook on Thursday said he was "very confident" the ruling would be overturned on appeal, calling the decision "maddening." "It is total political crap," Cook told the Irish Independent. "They just picked a number from I don't know where. In the year that the Commission says we paid that tax figure, we actually paid $400m. We believe that makes us the highest taxpayer in Ireland that year." The European Commission on Tuesday ruled Ireland gave illegal tax benefits to Apple. The investigation was part of a European crackdown on corporate tax avoidance. "The European Commission has concluded that Ireland granted undue tax benefits of up to €13 billion to Apple," the agency said in a statement. "This is illegal under EU state aid rules, because it allowed Apple to pay substantially less tax than other businesses. Ireland must now recover the illegal aid." Margrethe Vestager, who is in charge of the commission's competition policies, said Apple paid an effective corporate tax rate of 1 percent on its European profits in 2003 and a 0.005 percent rate in 2014. The deal between Apple and Ireland meant the tech company could allocate European profits to Ireland and pay a minimal tax rate because it owned a small operation in return for Irish workers being hired.

For IT departments managing fleets of mobile devices, the focus will likely be on only two operating systems: Android and iOS. 9 iOS, Android Apps To Creatively Boost Productivity (Click image for larger view and slideshow.) The global smartphone market, which seemed to enjoy steady growth ever since the introduction of the first iPhone 10 years ago, has now hit a significant slowdown, with shipments expected to grow only 1.6% this year, according to new numbers from IDC. This is dramatically down from the 10.4% growth seen in 2015, according to the research firm. A lack of compelling features, market saturation, and a willingness of users and IT to buy "good enough" devices are attributed to the smartphone shipment outlook of 1.46 billion units in 2016. Market growth is coming from emerging markets in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, which will see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.4% from 2015 to 2016. However, in mature markets -- the United States, Western Europe -- it's the reverse, with CAGR of negative 0.2%. These numbers, which IDC released Sept. 1, confirm much of what vendors such as Apple and Samsung have reported in their financial results -- that the market that once saw massive growth has greatly shrunk. In its latest earnings report in July, Apple said it shipped about 40 million iPhones during the quarter compared to 47 million units during the same time a year ago. (Image: bombuscreative/iStockphoto) The long rumored iPhone 7, which Apple will likely announce this month, is expected to help boost the company's shipment numbers. However, observers are torn over whether the new smartphone will be the technological leap forward that will inspire people to buy, or just another also-ran as the company bides its time until next year. In an attempt to bounce back, the industry has launched buy-back programs and other incentives to get consumers into stores and ordering the devices. Larger smartphones, or phablets, are seen as a growth area. Companies will try to blend virtual and augmented reality into these devices to spark interest, but those efforts are likely 12 to 18 months away, so it will be some time before vendors see return on that investment. Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers, noted in a statement: From a technological standpoint, smartphone innovation seems to be in a lull as consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with 'good enough' smartphones. However, with the launch of trade-in or buy-back programs from top vendors and telcos, the industry is aiming to spur early replacements and shorten lifecycles. Upcoming innovations in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) should also help stimulate upgrades in the next 12 to 18 months. For IT departments managing fleets of different devices, IDC's forecast offers some noteworthy insight about mobile operating systems. Specifically, the report confirms that the smartphone market is a two-OS race between Google's Android and Apple's iOS. By the end of the year, Android, which is installed on many different devices from several manufacturers, is expected to have a market share of about 85% worldwide. iOS will own nearly 14% of the market, with Microsoft's Windows Phone accounting for only 0.5%, and the "other" category -- read BlackBerry -- is projected to have a paltry 0.3%. [Read how Tim Cook sees the future of Apple.] However, the more startling numbers are the research firm's market share estimates for 2020, where Windows shrinks to 0.1%, and the "other" category is reduced to zero -- which appears to predict that the BlackBerry OS will cease to exist.

I see the core reason for stagnation and decline in the still ridiculously high cost of operating a smartphone. Yes, prices for decent data plans have come down, but they are still very high compared to other markets. If smartphone manufacturers want to sell more gear they have to get wireless carriers drop the prices drastically and stop nickle and dimimg customers.

The hardware will go first and soon, with the operating system to follow after that. The company is pivoting to back-end services, management and security. Windows Phone remains a mystery. It seems like Microsoft wants to keep the OS around so it can say it's still there, and then use that a base to push out it's other apps to Android and iOS. I think Microsoft wants to focus on Surface and use that as the ultimate PC replacement, and push smartphones further and further away. Reply  |  Post Message  |  Messages List  |  Start a Board Login 50% 50% melgross, User Rank: Ninja 9/2/2016 | 10:35:48 AM Blackberry who? It won't be just the BB10 OS that will be gone, as it's almost gone now, but Blackberry as a phone producer, in its entirety. Will Win Phone be around in 2020? I think it's questionable, at best. Some commentators insist that Win Phone is crucial to Microsoft's future, but it's pretty obvious that it isn't. And while Samsungs Tizen, as a Phone OS, has never gone anywhere, the small number of phones with that that they sell in India alone exceeds the number of Blackberry phones sold worldwide, and likely the number of Win Phone devices as well, as the trajectory of that continues its rapid slide to nowhere.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « It's Official: Samsung Announces Worldwide Note 7 Recall | Main | Ireland Stands United with Apple in Appealing the EU's Tax Ruling as War of Words Escalate » September 02, 2016 Google's Game Changing 'Project Ara' Smartphone Dies on the Vine as just more Vaporware Three weeks ago we reported on a new report posted by Engadget today titled "Six Designs that bust E-Waste" that covered designs and inventions that will keep smartphones from landfills a little longer, in-part or in-whole. In the number three spot Engadget listed Apple's friendly robot called 'Liam' as a top e-waste buster. In the number two spot was theoretical Project Ara that hadn't come to market yet. Now we can scratch Project Ara off that list because news today from Reuters is that Google has plans to shelve the project. We had originally reported a year ago that the project was being delayed until 2016 and that it looked like ball game over back then. It was reported by Strategy Analytics that the "Project Ara team indicated that the electropermanent magnets – magnets that attach/detach the modules to board – had failed drop tests." Google had high hopes to launch the new smartphone in the second half of 2015.   Reuters reports that "Alphabet Inc's Google has suspended Project Ara, its ambitious effort to build what is known as a modular smartphone with interchangeable components, as part of a broader push to streamline the company's hardware efforts, two people with knowledge of the matter said.   The move marks an about-face for the tech company, which announced a host of partners for Project Ara at its developer conference in May and said it would ship a developer edition of the product this autumn."   This is what's so aggravating. Google uses their I/O Developer Conference event to get the press to eat up these fantasy projects like Google Glass and Project Ara and then quietly stop the projects once it's achieved the fake perception and positive press coverage that they sought to falsely sell the idea that they're innovating so much faster than Apple. It's like Windows Vaporware all over again and the press never learns.   While Google will not be releasing the phone itself, the company may work with partners to bring Project Ara's technology to market, potentially through licensing agreements, one of the people with knowledge of the matter said. On the other hand, Android OEM's are simply running with their own version of modular phones without licensing anything from Google, such as the LG G5 smartphone that debuted this year.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Earlier this week, Apple sent out invitations to a Sept. 7 event, drumming up excitement with the tagline "See you on the 7th." Some industry watchers think that's a play on words for the expected name of the new iPhone, the "iPhone 7." Apple has reported two straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines and there are questions about demand for a device that remains the company's main source of profit. Apple hopes faster iPhones with significant camera improvements will prop up sales ahead of an expected larger overhaul in 2017 for the device's 10th anniversary. It's set to release a faster Apple Watch with GPS to try to re-ignite interest in that nascent category. Here's a breakdown of what to expect at Apple's event from each product line: New iPhone A tweaked design that looks similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s, but removes the two inner-most antenna lines on the back of the device for a cleaner look. The same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as the previous two iPhone lines. A pressure-sensitive Home button that provides a vibrating sensation in response to button presses instead of an actual physical click, similar to the latest MacBook trackpads. The removal of the headphone jack in favor of a secondary grille for either an additional speaker or microphone. An improved single-lens rear camera system on the new 4.7-inch model. A new dual-lens camera system on the 5.5-inch model, allowing for deeper zooming with less reduction in clarity and better low-light photography. A faster processor, a successor to the A9 chip in the iPhone 6s. Support for FeliCa-based payments in Japan, in the works for either this year's model or next year's overhaul. New watch A GPS chip for more-accurate fitness tracking. A faster processor for launching applications and navigating the operating system. Battery-life improvements to support the power-intensive addition of GPS. Software updates iOS 10 will be available on the iPhone 5 from 2012 and later. The updated software includes an improved iMessage application with support for new animations, stickers, and third-party plug-ins, voicemail transcription, notifications that show more detail, and an application for controlling smart home appliances. watchOS 3, the new version of the Apple Watch's software, speeds up app launch times, includes a new SOS feature to call emergency services, a new app to monitor breathing, and the ability to use Apple Pay within apps. tvOS 10, the new version of the Apple TV software, is supported by the fourth-generation model (which comes with Siri) and adds the ability to universally sign in to many content apps, a dark mode for navigating through the system at night, and a redesigned view for Apple Music. macOS Sierra, the latest version of the Mac operating system, adds support for Apple Pay transactions on the web, Siri voice control, new photo-management and messaging features, and the ability for Apple Watch wearers to automatically login to their Macs. Coming later One hardware category that may not be discussed in detail on Sept. 7 is the Mac line. However, Apple will begin shipping some of its future Macs as soon as October, according to people familiar with the matter. Here are the details: An overhauled MacBook Pro with a "Dynamic Function Row" display that allows function keys to change based on the task at hand, a faster processor, new graphics card options from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a larger trackpad, flatter keyboard, and USB-C port technology. Updated MacBook Air models with multi-functional USB-C port technology. A faster iMac with new graphics card options from AMD. A 5K standalone monitor developed in conjunction with LG Electronics Inc.

Trending in Apple Apple in 2017: What’s next for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch & Apple TV this year September 2, 2016 AAPL: 107.73 1.00 Comment: Sony Bravia experience is another reason Apple was right to abandon television set plans Ben Lovejoy - Sep. 2nd 2016 7:19 am PT @benlovejoy Feature Apple TV Opinion Apple Television concept by Martin Hajek View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit One of the longest-running rumors about Apple – that it was working on launching a fully fledged television – finally fizzled out last year, when a WSJ report said that the company had ultimately decided against the idea. Instead, Apple is aiming at a (delayed) subscription TV service, complete with original programming. It was speculated at the time that there were two reasons for the decision. First, that Apple had been unable to come up with a compelling differentiator that would have given consumers a reason to buy an Apple television over the many rival products. Second, that there simply wasn’t enough money in the business – margins are slim, and replacement cycles are lengthy. But a Sony Bravia issue reported this week has highlighted a third reason that an Apple television may have turned out to be a very bad idea … Sony has announced that a full fifty of its Bravia smart TV models released in 2012 are losing access to YouTube. Owners are already reporting failed attempts to access the YouTube app on the TVs. Many owners of affected sets have reported that watching videos through the “New YouTube on TV” app has resulted in black screens, freezes, and halted playback. A hardware bug or defect is not the cause of the issue, but rather a specification change made on Google’s end that ‘exceed the capability of the TV’s hardware.’ […] Sony does not cite the exact specification change, but Google recently announced that all YouTube connections will soon be encrypted with HTTPS. At the time, Google noted that older devices might not be able to support modern security standards and lead older clients to cease functioning, so this could be the reason. Affected models go all the way up to the 80-89-inch X series – televisions that came with five-figure price-tags. At one time, you could have simply shrugged, arguing that YouTube is mostly cat videos anyway. But in the years between the launch of the 2012 Bravia models and today, YouTube has become much more of a mainstream entertainment channel. And what can happen with one channel/app can happen with others. This is the problem with the single-box approach to smart TVs: when you combine an extremely expensive display panel with built-in smarts, you’re at the mercy of tech changes. In the online TV space, these are pretty fast-paced. When a change as small as a shift from http to https can rob you of access to a channel, a series of individually small changes can quickly render your once cutting-edge television obsolete over the course of just a few years. Obsolescence is a fact of hi-tech life, of course. Most people swap their iPhone every couple of years. But the more expensive the item, the longer the life we tend to expect from it. iPads tend to be replaced on more of a 3-5 year cycle. Many people keep their Macs 5+ years. Televisions have traditionally had a replacement cycle of 10+ years. Apple has always positioned itself at the premium end of the market, so a full-on Apple television was never going to be cheap. The current premium end of the market is in the 65-inch plus range. If we use Sony pricing as a gauge, the company’s premium models range from $6k for a 65-inch one through $9k for a 75-inch model to, well, ‘price unavailable’ for their 100-inch 4K model (though there are deals on Amazon). I can’t imagine that Apple pricing would have been any lower than that, and it may well have been higher. So an Apple television would likely have cost us somewhere in the $6-10k range. That’s a piece of kit most people would expect to keep for a long time. If we started losing core functionality just four years later – and maybe even sooner – we would have been extremely unhappy. So that’s the third reason Apple probably made the right decision. Far better to buy a dumb display panel of our choice and add a $149 and $199 Apple TV box to it. If the box hits a similar issue four years in – as happened with older Apple TV boxes – we can shrug off the sub-$50 per year cost and buy another one. Very little shrugging would have been done if the same thing had happened to our $10k Apple Television.

The company highlights providing “the only complete heating solution in Europe that’s compatible with Apple HomeKit.” Netatmo’s Smart Thermostat lets you control your HVAC system from your iPhone or with Siri, and the new Smart Valves apply the same concept to room-by-room heating radiators by replacing standard knobs. Netatmo says its new HomeKit-enabled Smart Valves will be available by the end of the year at £59.99 each. Smart Thermostat is available now in the UK and across Europe for £179.00. Netatmo’s Smart Thermostat and Smart Valves are now HomeKit-enabled and allow heating to be voice-controlled London, 2 September 2016 – Netatmo, a revolutionary smart home company developing groundbreaking, intuitive and beautifully-designed connected consumer electronics, announces today the compatibility of its intelligent heating solutions – the Smart Thermostat and Smart Radiator Valves – with Apple HomeKit. Apple HomeKit allows users to control smart home devices and make them work together, right from their iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Via Siri, users can control their heating with their voice. With HomeKit, they can also create customised scenarios between their Netatmo Thermostat, their Netatmo Valves and their other smart home devices. Netatmo offers the only complete heating solution in Europe that’s compatible with Apple HomeKit. “Hey Siri, increase the temperature in the bedroom by 2°C” With Apple HomeKit, it is now possible to control the connected devices of the house with a single gesture from an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch and have them work together. Siri, Apple voice-controlled personal assistant, recognises the connected devices that are compatible with HomeKit. Netatmo’s Smart Thermostat and Smart Radiator Valves allow users to save 37% of energy to heat their home[1]. Netatmo’s Smart Thermostat sets a program to reflect the users’ habits. It also allows users to control their heating remotely from a smartphone. Netatmo’s Smart Valves set a heating schedule for each room of the house, reflecting their occupancy and the family’s rhythm of life. Netatmo’s Smart Thermostat and Smart Valves are designed by Philippe Starck. With HomeKit, the user asks Siri to change the temperature of the house (“Hey Siri, set my Thermostat to 20°C”,) to increase the temperature (“Hey Siri, increase the temperature of my home by 2°C”), or to change the temperature of certain parts of the house (“Hey Siri, decrease the temperature of the bedroom by 2°C”). HomeKit improves comfort at home With HomeKit, the user can create customised scenarios to connect their Netatmo Thermostat and Valves to other smart home devices. For example, the scenario “Leaving home” switches the lights and the heating off and locks the door when the user leaves the house. With a “Wake up” scenario, the shutters open and the heating in the bathroom turns on. The user activates these scenarios with a simple gesture on their Apple Home App, or by voice. HomeKit allows immediate access to the house connected devices. The user checks and changes the temperature of the house and of every room from the lock screen of their iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. When the user is at home, HomeKit uses the home Wi-Fi connection. When not at home, the user can control the heating remotely with HomeKit and Siri if he has an Apple TV.

The breakfast was attended by the cream of US investors in Ireland. The meeting was also attended by Ireland’s Jobs Minister, Mary Mitchell O’Connor TD, as well as the Mayor of Atlanta, Kasim Reed. With the European ruling the obvious elephant in the room, Shanahan was quick to grasp the nettle. “Let me assure you that Ireland’s position has not changed – we do not do tax deals, and it’s simply untrue and a gross mischaracterisation of our taxation regime to say otherwise.” ‘Ireland has one of the most open, consistent and competitive taxation regimes in the world’ – MARTIN SHANAHAN, IDA IRELAND Shanahan was speaking just hours before the Irish Government’s cabinet today agreed to launch an appeal alongside Apple. Irish Govt does not do tax deals “The Irish Government has again reiterated that Ireland did not give favourable tax treatment to Apple. “Ireland has one of the most open, consistent and competitive taxation regimes in the world and, together with our other offerings in terms of talent, access to the European market and pro-enterprise policies, Ireland has been hugely successful in attracting foreign companies to establish and expand in Ireland.” ‘The Commission’s decision appears to be internally contradictory and its basis flawed’ – MARTIN SHANAHAN, IDA IRELAND Shanahan said that the Commission has acknowledged the decision does not call into question Ireland’s general tax system or its corporate tax rate. “This decision does not impact on Ireland’s value proposition and I believe that Ireland will continue to win investment, and, in that light, we welcome Apple’s restated commitment to Ireland today, building on its significant presence here.” He said that Apple has operated continuously in Cork since 1980 and employs nearly 6,000 people across Ireland. “The vast majority are still in Cork — including some of the company’s very first employees, now performing a wide variety of functions as part of Apple’s global footprint. Countless multinational companies followed Apple by investing in Cork, and today the local economy is stronger than ever.” Shanahan reiterated how Ireland is in favour of transparency around international taxation. “Ireland has been a full participant and to the forefront in international efforts to address Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) and abides fully with OECD guidelines. Ireland has made necessary changes to its taxation regime as international tax rules have developed over the years. “The Commission’s decision appears to be internally contradictory and its basis flawed,” Shanahan said.

On September 7, Tim Cook will continue a ritual that he has partaken in for several years now. The Apple CEO will be unveiling the latest iPhone on Wednesday. Now as of yet, it is not clear what Apple’s newest phones will be called. While rumors have been rife that they will most likely be called the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, it could still very well be called the iPhone 6SS. And even though iPhone 6SS doesn’t quite have the same ring to it as does iPhone 7, nothing official has been said regarding the name. Although Apple has been using a predictable naming cycle, there’s still a chance they could break the cycle, given that this year’s iPhone is said to feature fewer updates than usual and keeping all the big updates for next year, which will be the iPhone’s 10th birthday. It will, however, be referred to as the iPhone 7 through this article. Besides, with the unveiling event set to take place on September 7, Apple could be teasing us with its scheduling.

Design & Size Rumors have been rife that Apple will be getting rid of the 3.5-millimeter headphone jacks on its new phones. And if those rumors are true, then the iPhone 7 would become a few inches thinner than its predecessors. New black and matte colors are to be expected alongside the traditional colors that the iPhones have been offered in. Regarding the size, Apple looks set to stick to the usual 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch display sizes. Camera The iPhone 7 is expected to feature dual back-facing cameras, which will effectively improve the camera’s auto-focusing and facilitate low-light photography. And since both phones will come with iOS 10, which was announced earlier this year, it will feature an upgraded Photos App resembling Google Photo’s organization system. Headphone Jack The biggest rumor surrounding the new iPhone is that it will ditch the traditional 3.5-millimeter headphone jacks to make the phone slimmer. The rumor, which was first floated by the Japanese blog Mac Otakara, states that the new iPhone will require the use to connect the phone’s headphones either via the proprietary Lightning connector or via Bluetooth. This move has been criticized by many, including the company’s co-founder Steve Wozniak. Home Button There have been rumors that Apple could swap the traditional physical home button for a vibration that will provide the illusion of clicking. And even if these rumors are true, a major change such as this will probably feature in next year’s major release. For now, the home button is set to stay as it is. Waterproof Not only did Apple recently receive a patent for an editing tool for underwater photos, with the rumored removal of the headphone jack, the iPhone 7 looks set to be a water-proof phone or at least a more water-friendly phone than the previous releases. Release Date Well, Apple usually releases the iPhones on Fridays, a week after announcing them. If you’re waiting to buy one, you might be able to get it as early as September 16. The first generation iPhone was released almost a decade ago, on June 29, 2007. Apple’s co-founder and then-CEO Steve Jobs announced the device that has since gone on to revolutionize the entire mobile phone industry. The most recent iPhone model, iPhone SE, was unveiled earlier this year. A total of nine generations of iPhone models have been released by Apple, each corresponding to one of the major iOS operating systems. The upcoming model will come with the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS 10. Apple’s Tim Cook with the company’s founder the late Steve Jobs. [Photo by Paul Sakuma/AP Photo] The massive commercial success of the iPhone has not only helped Apple become one of the world’s most valuable companies, but it has also revolutionized the entire smartphone industry. The first iPhone, unveiled by Steve Jobs in 2007, was one of the first phones to feature a slate format touchscreen display that could be operated by the fingers, a format that has since been replicated by all modern smartphones.

The number is nearly double Apple’s net profit for the most recent quarter. Here’s how it happened. It Goes Back to a 1991 Deal Apple moved into Ireland in 1980, building infrastructure and jobs for ten years before they attempted to use their position to negotiate a better deal. Which they did, Business Insider explains: “The Irish government agreed a deal with Apple in 1991 to only tax a certain bracket of its earnings, giving it a dramatically lower tax rate than it would have to pay in the US. Apple got its lower tax rate, and Ireland kept Apple in the country. For a long time, that arrangement worked well. But as Apple’s profits soared, the EU started to look more closely at the deal. It’s illegal for a government in the EU to strike a so-called “sweetheart deal” with a company. The European Commission classes those deals as illegal state aid, and it has decided that Ireland’s deal with Apple is exactly that.” What It Means This is the largest amount that the EU has ever ordered a company to pay, which makes the ruling precedent-setting. The closest amount was $1.6 billion requested from French energy giant EDF in 2015. Apple says that the deal could affect how it invests across Europe and the number of its employees in Europe. Apple also stated that they would contest the ruling, and that they were “confident the decision will be overturned.” Related Tags: Apple, EU, Ireland, news, taxes Did you like this article?

Dublin is siding with the world’s richest company and rejecting the huge windfall for its treasury because it says it “disagrees profoundly” with the EU ruling. It fears multinational companies would leave Ireland, or not move there, if it is forced to change its tax and business model. The European Commissioner has ordered the payment on the basis that Apple’s low tax arrangements in Ireland constituted illegal state aid. Apple chief executive Tim Cook has warned if Dublin did not join it in appealing, it would send the wrong message to business in a country whose economic model depends in part on companies like his. Ireland agrees to appeal against €13bn Apple tax repayment demand https://t.co/H82u1BLCSJ pic.twitter.com/YfBw2LF6qQ— City A.M. (@CityAM) September 2, 2016 The decision was delayed by five independent members of the minority coalition government holding out against the idea of an appeal. They agreed after being promised an independent review of the country’s corporate tax system. The review will assess “what tax multinationals do pay and what they should pay”, said junior minister John Halligan of the Independent Alliance.

 Apple really wants you to use Siri — here's why BI Intelligence Sep. 2, 2016, 10:11 AM 15,649 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Apple could build iPhones in India by end of 2017 Lenovo just unveiled a $400 VR headset T-Mobile continues to eat into Verizon, AT&T customer base This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. In an effort to get users up to speed with Siri integration in iOS 10, Apple dedicated a series of blog posts to showcasing ways the voice assistant can be used to control apps on users' devices — including to create and read text messages, search through photos, and send payments to friends. Apple also introduced SiriKit, a set of tools that enable developers to integrate Siri with their apps. Seamless integration with third-party apps and services is integral to voice assistants becoming a primary source of interaction for users.  Releasing a series of blog posts is an unusual move for Apple. The company typically makes its announcements during its Worldwide Developer Conference in June, prior to launching a new device in September, TechCrunch notes.  Apple is likely making this move for three primary reasons: To create hype around the features. Highlighting Siri’s new capabilities could help build up awareness of the voice assistant, thereby encouraging users to explore it and interact with it prior to the official iOS 10 launch in September. To educate end users. Ensuring that consumers know what a service is capable of and how to use it properly increases the chances of it being used. Not having an understanding of how a service functions could result in a negative user experience. This has led some to suggest that Apple’s 3D touch feature, a central selling point of its new suite of devices, failed to make the 6s and 6s Plus attractive. To stake a claim on voice assistant space. The voice assistant space is rapidly gaining traction, with many companies throwing their hat in the ring; other popular voice assistants include Amazon’s Echo, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Google Now. Echo, in particular, is forging ahead in this space, already offering a number of integrated services. Meanwhile, Apple has an advantage over Echo, since Siri is built into all of Apple’s devices, giving it a much larger audience than Amazon's. Voice-powered apps could help spur usage amid the app engagement crisis. The majority of user time spent in-app is allotted to just a handful of apps, which could affect app publishers' ability to monetize their products. Letting users activate and engage with apps through voice rather than having to search for apps manually could result in greater app usage, according to a Global Web Index survey. Two of the three most important reasons for using voice assistants, according to survey respondents, are that it's quicker than using an app or web, and its easier than using the web or apps.  Aside from app engagements, developers have another problem. Cutting through the noise of an overcrowded app market is critical for any app developer looking to build a viable user base. There are now well over 3 million apps available across the world’s five largest app stores. Delivering the right product to the right audience at the right time in this environment is imperative to the success of any app. The challenge of marketing an app effectively has made app-install ads — an ad unit that directs users to download a mobile app — an essential tool for developers seeking to stand out in the Google Play and Apple app stores. This is why it's not surprising that more marketers are using paid channels to drive downloads than ever before. In fact, over 80% of respondents in a survey of the top 100 grossing mobile app developers noted they plan on increasing their spend on app-install ads in 2015. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile app-install ads that looks at the revenues from app-install ads and how they're expected to grow over the next five years. It also looks at the performance of app-install ads and how these metrics are expected to change over time. Furthermore, the report examines the top app-install ad products and pricing models offered by the leading advertising platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, and Google, as well as newer app-install formats from Instagram and Snapchat. Looking to the future, the report examines how companies are shifting their app-install ad spend to new formats, as well as the new tools they're using to improve optimization and ad effectiveness. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Mobile app-install ads — ad units that direct users to download a mobile app — are an essential tool for developers, and they account for a major share of mobile ad spend. We estimate 25% of total US mobile ad revenue was generated by app-install ads in 2015. A combination of new developers entering the space and rising ad budgets will drive increased spending in years to come. US app-install ad revenue will grow to over $7 billion by year-end 2020, according to BI Intelligence estimates. Mobile app install advertisers have traditionally invested heavily in display and interstitial ads, but are moving to mobile video and native install formats. 86% of developers currently use in-feed video app-install ads, and video ads are seen as the most effective app-install format. As formats like video rise in popularity, older formats are losing their appeal for install campaigns. Static nonnative ads are widely used but are not seen as effective. Free app networks and offer walls have also fallen out of favor. Ad platforms are now developing innovative new install formats to earn even more revenue from these lucrative ad units. New approaches, including deep linking and app streaming, are more contextualized and interactive than older ad formats. In full, the report: Forecasts app-install ad spending in the US through 2020.
