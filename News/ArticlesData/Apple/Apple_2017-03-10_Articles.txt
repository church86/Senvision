Apple regains top spot in New Zealand smartphone shipments Chris Keall Friday March 10, 2017 Share iPhone: back on top RELATED AUDIO: Samsung will bounce back, says IDC analyst Chayse Gordon Play Log in or subscribe to listen to audio. Pause Add to MyNBR Radio 0 0:00 0:10 Play NBR radio on Apple shipped the highest number of smartphones over the Christmas quarter, according to IDC’s smartphone shipment results for New Zealand, tracked from October to December 2016. Samsung, which was hit by the Galaxy Note 7 "fire phone" recall, slipped to second. It was the first time that Apple had claimed the slot since the first quarter of 2012.   Vendors shipped a record high volume of 672,000 smartphones during October to December 2016, up from 614,000 smartphones shipped over the same period in 2015. The top three vendors made up close to 80% of these shipments. Apple shipped 221,000 smartphones, Samsung fell to the number two position with 176,000 smartphone shipments, and Huawei closed the number three gap significantly reaching 143,000 smartphone shipments.   Chayse Gorton, client device analyst for IDC New Zealand, believes there are three key reasons contributing to Apples fourth quarter performance in the market.   Apple overcame stock constraints observed after the release of the iPhone 7 models late in the fourth quarter. "Even with some consumers expected to be holding off upgrading their smartphone until the release of the 10th anniversary edition iPhone, forecasted in late 2017, the demand for iPhone 7 has been stronger than anticipated," he says.   Despite looking somewhat similar to the iPhone 6s, updated specifications were enough to entice many consumers to upgrade their Apple smartphone. Mr Gorton suggests, "It's hard to say with confidence that a single feature drove customers to upgrade, such as increased durability", rather he suggests "it is likely a combination of improvements leading to consumers perceiving the iPhone 7 models as superior".    Publicity issues relating to competing vendors enticed a portion of consumers to make the switch to Apple. Samsung's battery cell issues in its recently released Note 7 smartphones, and the subsequent recall, not only led the devices to be excluded from IDC's tracker, but also to some consumers to question their loyalty to the vendor.          2016 was an exciting year, with the overall smartphone market growing 10% year on year, and despite fourth quarter vendor rankings, Samsung holding off Apple to retain the number one position for the year. Overall for 2016, Samsung held 32% share, Apple held 27% share, and Huawei held 14% share.   With Apple successfully winning a quarter for the first time in close to five years, and Huawei closing the gap in third place, it is safe to say the smartphone vendor battleground is shaping up for an interesting year. Earlier, Mr Gorton told NBR he thought Samsung would rebound from its Note 7 issue.  The Korean phone maker is set to unveil its new Galaxy range on March 15.

As to be expected, Apple is remaining more tight-lipped than ever when it comes to details around the iPhone 8. In this article, you’ll find everything we know so far about Apple’s next handset, the iPhone 8. iPhone 8 could release later than September https://t.co/F0w0wXRjCi pic.twitter.com/OXTD9q4MGQ — iDownloadBlog (@iDownloadBlog) March 6, 2017 When will the iPhone 8 be released? According to Business Insider, it’s almost a given that Apple’s next iPhone iteration will be released in September. The iPhone 5, the iPhone 6, and the iPhone 7 were released in September of 2012, 2014, and 2016. That being said, Apple is reportedly struggling to manufacture its high-end OLED phone screens ready in time for a September launch. With that in mind, some analysts have suggested that Apple will instead launch an iPhone 7S model in September and then introduce a radical overhaul of the iPhone line with the iPhone 8 later in the year. Which would be a drastic change for Apple. Whether or not Apple has the iPhone 8 ready for September, the company will reportedly release the iPhone 8 as a premium option alongside the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus anyway. iPhone 8 will likely be the most expensive smartphone Apple has ever released https://t.co/sR7bFC7Nfh pic.twitter.com/q2Aiy8JuGu — Forbes (@Forbes) March 6, 2017 How much will the iPhone 8 cost? As aforementioned, the iPhone 8 is expected to be the biggest overhaul in the iPhone line-up since its launch 10 years ago. However, it’s also expected to be Apple’s most expensive mobile device to date. According to Forbes, Apple’s next flagship phone could cost upwards of $1,000, which would be a considerable increase over the iPhone 7 at just over $700. With that in mind, it’s safe to assume that the aforementioned iPhone 7S models will be cheaper than the iPhone 8, offering the latest generation iPhone for those not all that interested in the new features offered by the iPhone 8. That being said, there’s always the possibility that Apple will surprise fans and take a very different route with the iPhone 8’s release.

We already know that the iPhone 8 will be the biggest overhaul yet in Apple’s smartphone lineup, especially in comparison to the iPhone 7’s relatively underwhelming release. So what should you expect from the revolutionary new iPhone? Undeniably the most reported rumored feature of the upcoming iPhone 8 is an all-new OLED display measuring a massive 5.8-inches. Such a display size would make the iPhone 8 the biggest mobile device ever made by Apple and the biggest mass-market mobile phone available at the moment. That being said, Apple will reportedly shrink the device’s bezels considerably, meaning that despite the larger screen, the iPhone 8’s body will actually be smaller than last year’s iPhone 7 Plus. Whether or not Apple will also offer a smaller model iPhone 8 remains to be seen, however, the iPhone 7S may instead fill that void. Apple patent hints facial recognition and 3D selfies are coming to iPhone 8 https://t.co/ozLXCOaHgj pic.twitter.com/hATzOUkjEO — TNW (@TheNextWeb) March 7, 2017 What’s more, Apple will reportedly use a portion of that large display as a “function area,” similar in nature to the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro. This function area will reportedly adapt and change depending on what the user is doing on the phone and will also incorporate Apple’s iconic home button, which will be absent from the iPhone for the first time in 10 years. However, it’s worth remembering that any details around the iPhone 8 are currently purely speculative. Apple’s next and biggest iteration in their iPhone line-up will reportedly launch in September. Apple is expected to officially unveil the device at an event ahead of its release.

The US Patent and Trademark Office has granted the Cupertino heavyweight a patent for a mysterious technology that enables “enhanced face detection using depth information” through the application of specifically modified hardware and software modules. Follow TNW at SXSW 2017! We're covering the weird and wonderful tech at SXSW, join us in the fun. PARTY TIME While it remains unclear precisely how Apple might integrate the technology with its upcoming iPhone, the patent notes that the facial recognition apparatus will rely on a combination of camera modules, depth sensors and computer imaging techniques to generate depth maps and accurately identify faces in images.   The technology essentially breaks down images in smaller “windows” and proceeds to select one or more locations inside the image to “test for presence of human faces.” The method leverages depth information to make the overall process more accurate and less intensive. The patent further indicates the technology will likely be available for both still images and video. The method, however, does bring its own caveats. As pointed out, the technology becomes less reliable once more faces begin to appear at different locations and depths. This could lead to increased false detection rate. Credit: US Patent and Trademark Office News of this patent follows reports speculating the Big A could be ramping up its augmented reality efforts and possibly introducing a ‘revolutionary’ 3D selfie camera. What adds further credence to these claims is that Apple’s alleged 3D camera will fundamentally rely on infrared modules built by previously acquired 3D sensor manufacturer PrimeSense. The modules in question will purportedly be capable of projecting patterns of optical radiation onto a scene, which in turn will enable devices to split the image in corresponding depth maps. Esteemed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously forecast that the new and improved camera tech will likely land on the higher-priced premium iPhone model, which could surpass the $1,000 mark. Still, this is all speculation at this point and we might have to wait a few more years before we see the new technology in action. via AppleInsider Enhanced face detection using depth information on US Patent and Trademark Office Read next: Why AI will determine the future of fintech AppleGeariPhone Share on Facebook (483) Share on Twitter (275) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

Apple have not held the number one position since the first quarter of 2012. Vendors shipped a record high volume of 672,000 smartphones during October to December 2016, up from 614,000 smartphones shipped over the same period in in 2015. The top three vendors made up close to 80% of these shipments. Apple shipped 221,000 smartphones, Samsung fell to the number two position with 176,000 smartphone shipments, and Huawei closed the number three gap significantly reaching 143,000 smartphone shipments. Chayse Gorton, Client Device Analyst for IDC New Zealand, believes there are three key reasons contributing to Apples fourth quarter performance in the market. Apple overcame stock constraints observed after the release of the iPhone 7 models late in the fourth quarter. Gorton says, "even with some consumers expected to be holding off upgrading their smartphone until the release of the 10th anniversary edition iPhone, forecasted in late 2017, the demand for iPhone 7 has been stronger than anticipated”. Despite looking somewhat similar to the iPhone 6s, updated specifications were enough to entice many consumers to upgrade their Apple smartphone. Gorton suggests, "it's hard to say with confidence that a single feature drove customers to upgrade, such as increased durability", rather he suggests "it is likely a combination of improvements leading to consumers perceiving the iPhone 7 models as superior". Publicity issues relating to competing vendors enticed a portion of consumers to make the switch to Apple. Samsung's battery cell issues in its recently released Note 7 smartphones, and the subsequent recall, not only led the devices to be excluded from IDC's tracker, but also to some consumers to question their loyalty to the vendor. 2016 was an exciting year, with the overall smartphone market growing 10% year on year, and despite fourth quarter vendor rankings, Samsung holding off Apple to retain the number one position for the year. Overall for 2016, Samsung held 32% share, Apple held 27% share, and Huawei held 14% share. With Apple successfully winning a quarter for the first time in close to five years, and Huawei closing the gap in third place, it is safe to say the smartphone vendor battleground is shaping up for an interesting year. http://schema.org/MediaObject" > https://accounts.icharts.net/widget/assets/ichartwidget.css?v=2.1"> https://accounts.icharts.net/icharts/embed/MH/azSxN</a>" height="516" width="450" frameborder="0"> http://chartchannel.icharts.net/chartchannel/smartphone-shipments-new-zealand-2016q4-vendor-share_mhazsxnc">iCharts http://chartchannel.icharts.net/chartchannel/smartphone-shipments-new-zealand-2016q4-vendor-share_mhazsxnc"> idcap_corpcomms@idc.com"> ends © Scoop Media   Tweet         Business Headlines | Sci-Tech Headlines BUSINESS, SCIENCE & TECH > >   South America Trade: New Zealand-Argentina Agricultural Agreement Signed Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy has signed an Agricultural Cooperation Arrangement with Argentina today, aimed at building closer relationships between the two countries.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « A Pair of Apple Patents Covering the 'Portrait Mode' Feature found in the iPhone 7 Plus Model Surfaced Today | Main | Three Southern U.S. States Battle it out for Samsung's new $300 Million Dollar Appliance Plant » March 09, 2017 For 2016, Apple missed the top 50 Granted Patent Winners in Europe and the Top 10 in the U.S   When Apple first sued Samsung for patent infringement it set the Android community into a wild zombie like rage screaming at anything Apple saying that Apple was killing the patent system and that they were trying to patent everything under the sun and on and on the insanity went. So, where did Apple land on the top 50 USPTO granted patent list for 2016? Number eleven with Samsung number two. From the EU's top 50 list of granted patents, Samsung came in number three and Apple didn't even make the list as noted from the EU's Excel spreadsheet below that anyone can download here.   So the next time an Android fan foams at the mouth about Apple being a patent maniac, point them to our report so that they could look in the mirror and see that Samsung is the patent filing freak, not Apple.   As someone who covers both Apple and Samsung granted patents, it's a joke at the level Samsung wins patents. This week alone Samsung was granted 213 patents versus 42 for Apple. And that's just one Android OEM.   If you happen to read any news that Apple files the most patents on the planet, make sure to label that site a supporter of FAKE NEWS.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Apple had already claimed to have already patched most of the exploits, and a recent report from The Wall Street Journal (via 9to5Mac) has revealed that Apple engineers are already working on patching the rest. According to Apple’s previous statement, “While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue to work rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.” The report from the WSJ also revealed that the company’s engineers had previously run into some trouble as the software used to hack their devices wasn’t being shared. However as you might recall, Wikileaks recently announced that they would be sharing the tools and working with these tech companies to help them fix the flaws that were discovered, so hopefully we can expect a patch in the near future that should address these issues. Of course this by no means puts an end to security flaws, holes, or exploits, but we guess at the very least it makes things a bit harder for hackers in the future, regardless of which side they are supposed to represent.

Apple has been scrambling trying to learn more about the remaining exploits and it looks like the help it needs is coming directly from Wikileaks. The organization said it plans to share everything it knows about the hacks with Apple, and it’s going to do the same for other tech companies the CIA targeted, too. Wikileaks giving Apple the CIA’s Phone hacking code The reported exploits were listed in thousands of pages Wikileaks released this week. Products from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and several other companies were listed as targets for CIA surveillance through exploits the agency wasn’t sharing, raising concerns about who was being monitored and if other governments were taking advantage of the same hacks. The exploits were leaked as part of a document collection Wikileaks is calling Vault 7. Apple said most of the exploits listed in the documents have already been patched, and it’s actively looking into the rest. The problem Apple is facing is that without the code the CIA is using, tracking down and patching the exploits is difficult at best. Wikileaks: Share and Share Alike Since the CIA isn’t interested in sharing the code, Wikileaks will. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said, “We have decided to work with [manufacturers] to give them exclusive access to the additional technological details we have so that fixes can be developed and pushed out.” After the companies patch the exploits Wikileaks plans to publish the hacks, according to NPR. Mr. Assange went on to say the CIA is incompetent because it failed to protect the hacks it uses. CIA spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak made it clear how the agency feels about Mr. Assange saying, “As we’ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity.” Wikileaks isn’t offering up a time frame for when it will release the CIA’s exploits. The fact that they’re coming at some point makes it imperative we update our iPhones and iPads as soon as Apple’s security patches are released.

As these hacks and tools are still classified some overzealous prosecutor could theoretically go after Apple et.al. for accepting this information from Wikileaks. March 9, 2017 at 5:30 EDT PM skipaq March 9, 2017 Legally, the CIA is supposed to share the vulnerabilities it discovers with manufacturers. It is shameful that Wikileaks is involved at all. March 9, 2017 at 5:57 EDT PM d'monder March 9, 2017 Wish Wikileaks would’ve told the tech companies first. Until Apple releases some updates (hopefully very soon now), we gotta live with published open exploits. March 9, 2017 at 6:16 EDT PM Lee Dronick March 10, 2017 Assange hadn’t been in the news for a while and he was probably getting yancy about not getting any attention. March 10, 2017 at 7:56 EDT AM Interested Observer March 11, 2017 The CIA obviously knows all about being “not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity.” March 11, 2017 at 6:04 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

I didn’t, until I stumbled upon this by accident, like some of my other tips. Creating subfolders lets you organize your notes in more detailed ways that make sense to you. Here’s how to do it on macOS. Apple Notes Subfolders For macOS When Apple Notes got a makeover with iOS 9 in 2015, I migrated my notes from Evernote. I didn’t have an elaborate system set up in Evernote, so despite the lack of certain features in Notes, it worked for me. There aren’t a lot of ways to organize notes in Apple Notes. Actually, there are just two: folders and subfolders. I knew about folders, of course, but I had no idea it was possible to create subfolders. And creating one is easy. Creating a subfolder: just drag a folder into another. To create a subfolder in Notes on your Mac, all you have to do is drag-and-drop one folder into another. That’s it! Keep in mind that if you delete a folder, then all of the subfolders and notes will also be deleted. Now here’s the caveat: Unfortunately, it’s not possible to create subfolders in iOS Notes. I’m not sure why, and it seems arbitrary for Apple to not allow this. So you’ll have to create your subfolders on macOS, and they will sync over to iOS.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 10 March 2017 | MYT 7:30 AM Seven things worth knowing about the global mobile phone market Dizzying figure: Around 1.5 billion smartphones were bought in 2016. — dpa Consumers are often fixated on the latest incremental improvements being touted by smartphone brands at fairs like the recent Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  Meanwhile the mobile phone industry has exploded to dizzying heights. Here are a few key facts and figures to remind you of the bigger picture of this multi-billion-dollar market.  1. 1.5 billion smartphones were bought in one year  Around 1.5 billion smartphones were bought in 2016. This marks an increase of between 2% and 5% on the previous years. The estimates of the various IT market researchers differ.  2. The world's biggest market: China  Chinese smartphone vendors are now among the largest in the world, thanks mainly to the size of the home market. Huawei, Oppo and BBK are in the global top five, after Samsung and Apple, and together hold a 21% market share.  3. The biggest profit-maker: Apple  When it comes to profitability, Apple – which doesn’t offer cheap devices – remains the undisputed leader, as it has been for years. Market researchers estimate that more than 90% of the profit in the smartphone sector goes to Apple. Chinese vendors are often satisfied with narrow margins and some don’t even make it out of the red.  4. Sales have been cooling  2015 sales were more than 10% up on the previous year, but a cooling down in the smartphone market in 2016 has been put down to economic turbulence in the largest smartphone market, China, as well as in other countries such as Russia.  5. The biggest battle: Apple versus Samsung  Samsung and Apple are the world's largest smartphone vendors, with the iPhone manufacturer edging out the South Koreans this year selling 78 million iPhones and staking out 18% of the market.   6.

The remainder is largely taken by Apple’s iOS – other operating systems such as Windows Phone or Blackberry OS are practically at 0%. 7. 7.4 billion phone connections  Last year around 7.4 billion phone connections were made worldwide, according to expert estimates.

(Reuters/Danish Siddiqui) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging March 09, 2017 Quartz india Apple’s newest iPhones have just cost too much to be a big hit in India, and the company hopes reviving a discontinued model can expand its minuscule market share in Asia’s third-largest economy. Local brands like Micromax and Lava sell dirt-cheap handsets, and the Cupertino, California, giant faces additional competition from Chinese players like Oppo, Vivo, and Gionee, who’ve made a mark in the mid-price range. When Apple tried to reduce retail prices by selling cheaper, refurbished iPhones, the Indian government shelved those efforts, saying it would add to the country’s plethora of e-waste. Apple’s market share has continued to slip, and is now down to a dismal 2%. Apple has finally decided to slash prices in India. It has resurrected a 32GB version of its iPhone 6—ditched when the iPhone 7 launched at the end of 2016—with a new retail price of Rs28,999 ($435), CNET reported. When the model was first launched in 2014, the 16GB variant cost Rs53,500 ($802). That’s a big cut. But will it be enough lure more buyers in a country where the average smartphone costs $158? The cost of high pricing Apple looks to India, one of the fastest growing smartphone markets in the world, as its next frontier for growth. “Apple’s growth in China has slowed, and short of launching the next iPhone, there is little Apple can do to change that,” Avi Greengart, research director of consumer platforms and devices at GlobalData, told Quartz. “India, however, is pure opportunity for Apple.” In the past year, it has made headway. After chief executive Tim Cook attempted to woo Indians by visiting temples and attending Bollywood parties, Apple struck a notable partnership with Reliance Jio, one of the fastest growing mobile operators. Apple also secured permission to set up a distribution center on the outskirts of Mumbai. Just last month, the company solidified plans to start manufacturing in the tech hub of Bangalore. Affordability is a high priority, even for consumers buying luxury goods like smartphones. India has a much lower per capita income, $1,598, than China’s $8,028. And for Apple, reducing prices can conflict with the brand’s aspirational value. But without a cut, India’s price-sensitive market will be hard to convince. The return of the iPhone 6 could be a middle ground. “Apple has two main problems in India—distribution and pricing,” Greengart says. “Relaunching the older iPhone 6 at a lower price could really help Apple make progress as an aspirational device, without diluting the premium it needs to maintain on current products.” Apple also introduced the 32GB version of the iPhone 6 in markets like Taiwan and China, aiming to lure less wealthy consumers. The iPhone is not available through the company’s own physical or online stores. Instead, third-party vendors and telcos are selling it. In India, it’s retailing on Amazon. Competitors have upped their game Cutting down prices is a promising tactic in India, but only if it makes the product more competitive. “The new generations of consumers aren’t as enamored with the Apple brand as were the early adapters,” Carnegie Mellon University fellow Vivek Wadhwa told Quartz. “And Indians won’t pay this kind of money for old models. If they can afford to spend Rs30,000, they will want the latest and greatest.” Most Indians now own Chinese phones that offer bigger screens and an improved user interface, while supporting multiple regional Indian languages. The Chinese brands have also been investing in marketing campaigns and expanding their retail presence. Guangdong-based Oppo, for example, recently set up 35,000 sales points and 180 service centers across India, Bloomberg reported Apple’s services are still light-weight competitors in India. Apple Maps is laden with glitches, thanks to insufficient testing and erroneous data. When Apple Music launched in India in 2015, it couldn’t compete with the multitude of cheaper local music streaming apps like Saavn, Gaana, and Hungaama. And with its pricy package, it only caters to the more affluent buyer. “[Apple] needs to develop a new set of (cheaper) products that are geared towards Indian users and have these in multiple languages,” says Wadhwa. “I give Apple zero chances of success—unless it wakes up and figures out the Indian market.” Most Popular A court’s decision in a Maine labor dispute hinged on the absence of an Oxford comma Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Apple's flagship solution for all of that woe came by the way of the AirPods, $229 headphones with absolutely no wires. For the price, I like AirPods, but they aren't without problems. Fortunately, the Apple-owned Beats has a solution for users who want Bluetooth headphones without those problems, and it comes by way of the new $199 Beats X earbuds. The Beats X are the third product from Beats (and the fourth from all of Apple) to use the new W1 Bluetooth chipset. This Apple-designed chipset should allow for better battery life. It also makes pairing with an Apple device a total snap — as long as your iPhone runs iOS 10.1 or higher. All I had to do to pair was turn the Beats X and bring them near my phone. A "Connect" button instantly popped up and I was off — music ready to be heard wirelessly. Popping the Beats X into my ears was a pleasant experience too. There was none of the typical soreness — even after using them for hours at a time. Beats includes a choice between four different ear tips. For my own tiny ears the smallest tips worked best — and due to the neck strap I didn't have to worry about a bud popping out and disappearing. Like a number of wireless earbuds on the market, including the super popular Jaybirds X3s (and will.i.am's Buttons), the Beats X go with a necklace design. When you don't have Beats X in your ears, they have magnetic tips that connect around your neck, looking like... a necklace. I made fun of the Buttons for having a similar feature; I now take that back. It's a great way to keep the headphones around your neck when not in use, without losing them. Buttons still look idiotic, but this magnetic connector is a total win. The carrying case the Beats X comes with is really bad. I never figured out how to properly stuff the headphones into the case. Also on the necklace is a controller to control volume, call pickup, and to skip or pause a track. Unlike the Jaybirds X3 the controller is light enough that it never tugs an earbud out of the ear. It also solved my biggest complaint with Apple's AirPods — being forced to control the volume with Siri only. The Beats X battery is also nice and light, and resides in the chunky bits that rest on your neck. Plugging the Beats X into the Lightning port that anchors one side of the neck band for 5 minutes gave me another 2 hours of battery life, and fully charged I managed eight hours. That pales in comparison to the 40 (!) you'll get with Beats Solo 3s, and the charging mechanism isn't as good as the carrying case that come with AirPods, but the Beats X hit a nice middle ground. And thanks to the necklace design these things actually work when I'm being active. Even though AirPods fit well in my ears, I would never feel comfortable running with them. I ran with Beats X, and endured a monstrous spin class, without giving it a second thought. They might not be as fitness-focused as Powerbeats 3s, but they work great for active users. They sound great too. There is more bass than you'd get with AirPods or crummy Apple EarPods, but they don't sound overly heavy. Listening to Future's HDNRXX, the bass notes came through exactly as they should. On a track like Remy Ma's "Shether," each and every devastating blow came through loud and clear. I haven't used the Powerbeats 3, but the Beats X sound about the same as the older Powerbeats 2 earphones. Highs and mids were crisp, and bass, while not overly booming, is very much present. The microphone on the cable works fine for voice calls too. All told, Beats X are an excellent alternative to the AirPods. They're great for anyone who wants the easy way to connect to an iPhone, but would also like better battery life and playback controls. Sure, the Beats X don't look as cool as the earring like AirPods, but if your prioritise function over form they're practically perfect. README Even without using wingtips, Beats X stayed in my ears during strenuous activity. At $199), these are pricier than the similarly designed, and similarly sounding Jaybird X3. If you're an Android user and don't care about the Beats name, those are just as good. Pairing with an iPhone is genuinely so easy, it's one of my favourite things ever. The included Lightning cable for charging is very short. This is probably good if you're using it in a car or with a power pack, but might be short in other scenarios. As of right now, Beats does not make these in rose gold, which is absolutely a missed opportunity. Comments scarnon @scarnon Mar 10, 2017, 1:15pm Anyone in the market for this kind of product should check out Sony's XB70BT wireless ear buds. I recently got them swapped over from my shitty Sol Republic Shadow's that I had already had replaced... All the reviews I was able to see say the Sonys have a better bass response than the Beats... They feel like a premium product and the bluetooth range on these is waaaay more than 20m its pretty insane! Check em out or check out some reviews before pumping your money into the Beats brand ;) Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Basically what this does is that it creates a list of websites and articles that you can save to read at a later time when you’re free. Granted there are other apps and services such as Pocket to help with that, but reading list is built into the browser itself. That being said, it seems that Google could be introducing a similar feature of their own. According to 9to5Mac, Google recently pushed out a stable build of Chrome 57 to Mac, Windows, and Linux users, which means that the mobile version is probably around the corner, and as you can see in the screenshot above, Chrome iOS appears to have a reading list feature of its own. However it seems that Google might have actually done a better job with it than Apple because according to the report, Google has managed to separate the articles you’ve saved in “Unread” and “Pages You’ve Read” categories, meaning that you’ll be able to see which articles you’ve already gone through and which you haven’t, which should cut down the confusion. It’s not really a groundbreaking feature but it is one of those quality of life improvements that Apple should have included in Safari. No word on when the latest Chrome will be released for iOS, but we’ll be keeping our eyes peeled. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about Apps, Chrome, Google, iOS and safari.

According to International Business Times, the Pro 5 will likely support Microsoft’s HoloLens. “HoloLens support was earlier reportedly not said to be included in the Surface Pro 5, since HoloLens is not a consumer device. But with the company rolling out the technology to more affordable VR headsets, the tablet is expected to offer HoloLens support.” The Surface Pro 5 will likely support Microsoft’s HoloLens. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] The article adds that the Surface Pro 5 will also support Microsoft’s Windows 10 Creator’s Update, which is expected to be the biggest Windows update since Windows 10. According to iTech Post, the Surface Pro 5 will be compatible with Surface Dial support. “Moreover, the Surface Dial is also expected to be compatible with the next-gen Surface Pro tablet. This relatively new Microsoft product was launched in October and has primarily been designed for the Surface Studio.” The article explains that the Surface Dial is a Bluetooth-enabled accessory that is very much like a mouse. However, it has a dfferent set of features that can have custom functionalities depending on the user’s needs. Digital Trends talks about some other features. “The Surface Pro 4 uses sixth-generation Intel Core processors and offers an excellent 12.3-inch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio, 2,736 x 1,824-pixel resolution, and 267 PPI. Anticipated — and logical — Surface Pro 5 updates, therefore, include a move to seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processors and a 4K display option.” The article adds that in order to make the device as thin as possible, USB-3 ports may be replaced with USB-C ports — something Apple has been doing for the past year. Other possibilities listed include a wireless charging pen and a larger capacity battery. The Surface Pro 5 will definitely compete with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, although the MacBook Pro isn’t a touch-enabled or pen-enabled device. The new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar hasn’t been as well received as Apple had hoped. Many have complained about the battery life and believe that is way overpriced. Digital Trends gives the Pro a very mixed three-star review. The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has received mixed reviews. [Image by Daryl Deino] “Apple’s new MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is a beautiful machine, but it has several flaws, and it’s far too expensive,” says critic Matt Smith, who adds that there are many cheaper Windows machines that have overall better features. Many in the comments section agree with the author. “I couldn’t agree with you more… last good macbook was from 2011,” says Tomas Stejcek. “This is the BEST REVIEW I have read of the new Mac laptop, and trust me, i have read many. Tech reviewers and other industry observers (like myself) agree that this new Mac simply is overpriced for the cost and under implemented for the technology,” claims Mike Drips. However, there are certainly a lot of happy MacBook Pro with Touch Bar owners on Twitter. I'm so in love with my MacBook Pro!!! touch bar is lit. Best decision I ever made — Marisol Valenzuela (@marisolv_3) February 19, 2017 Michael, I've been using my new 2016 MacBook Pro for a couple of weeks and absolutely love it and the touchbar (had a 2011 model). https://t.co/R0Aaq99ZcG — Erich Robinson (@ErichRobinson) January 14, 2017 Besides the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the Surface Pro 5 will compete with laptop hybrids from Dell, HP, Lenovo, and even Samsung, who is about to release the Galaxy Book, which is very much like the Surface Pro except that it includes the keyboard cover. Do you think the Surface Pro 5 will be as successful as the Surface Pro 4? Let us know in the comments section.

Microsoft on WikiLeaks CIA Files: Windows 10 Systems Are Safe GO Microsoft says that systems running Windows 10 are not vulnerable to CIA attacks, as the files mention dated bugs Mar 10, 2017 01:17 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Microsoft has finally issued a statement regarding the WikiLeaks Vault 7 leak of CIA documents regarding the agency's hacking powers, saying that computers running Windows 10 software should be safe.  According to Microsoft's statement, the vulnerabilities mentioned in the CIA files were dated and appeared to target older systems. "We take security issues very seriously and are continuing a deeper analysis to determine if additional steps are necessary to further protect our customers," the company said. Should any additional threats be discovered, Microsoft promises to inform customers. There is no mention whether people using previous Windows versions are safe from CIA attacks or not. Apple, Google, Linux claim users are safe  Microsoft's statement falls in line with what we've been hearing from all over the tech community. Apple and Google have said that customers running their latest software appear to be safe from vulnerabilities and that most of the issues mentioned in the WikiLeaks files have already been fixed. It's unclear what vulnerabilities are yet to be patched or whether there really are any. The Linux Foundation has also addressed the issue with a rather relaxed statement. They said that given the open-source nature of the operating system, with security updates being released every few days, there are little chances for users to be in danger from the CIA as any vulnerabilities they might have been able to exploit have long since been fixed. The major problem exposed by the CIA files WikiLeaks dumped the other day is the fact that the agency expressed a desire to stockpile zero-day vulnerabilities and find ways to exploit them. If its hackers didn't find the security holes, the CIA bought it off the Internet. Such vulnerabilities in iOS and Android were used by the CIA to create malware which got them full access to a target's phone, bypassing even encryption layers set down by apps such as WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram. This, of course, is the exact type of thing any serious malware can do. By refusing to disclose these zero-days to the affected companies, however, the CIA put billions of users at risk. After all, if the CIA found the vulnerability, who's to say other didn't too? Samsung and LG are still looking into the situation and are expected to release statements on the matter too. #Microsoft#Windows 10#WikiLeaks#Vault 7#Google subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news WikiLeaks Will Work with Tech Companies to Fix Security Flaws Exploited by CIA Linux Foundation on Vault 7: Frequent Security Updates Protect Linux Users Google: We've Already Fixed Most Bugs Exposed in WikiLeaks' Vault 7 Files Don't Give Up on Encrypted Messaging Apps Because of the Vault 7 CIA Revelations Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns YouTube Discontinues Annoying Annotations LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000    Windows 10 is safe from the CIA Related Apps Passware Encryption Analyzer: Seamlessly find all password-protected files on your computer and find out how to overcome their encryption with this application Passware Password Recovery Kit Forensic: A complete password recovery and e-discovery solution that can help you decrypt and obtain passwords from almost any file and website Your Freedom: A all-in-one VPN tunneling, firewall and proxy bypassing, anonymization and anti-censorship solution that enables you to browse the Internet in a secure way Bitcoin Password: This easy to use application can help you recover your Bitcoin wallet password by using customizable dictionary, brute force or mixed attacks GridinSoft Anti-Malware: Scan your computer for malware and dangerous files, adware and other malicious components with the help of this intuitive application Passware Password Recovery Kit Basic: A fast and efficient password recovery software that can reveal email, Internet and network passwords and decrypt documents altogether Adlice PEViewer: Analyze the structure of running processes and executable files on your computer to detect potentially dangerous activity on your system Reader comments Over 33 Million Records Leaked from US Corporate Database more on: data leak i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Nintendo is beginning to use mobile platforms to unlock value in its franchises, but the company is still very dependent on performance of new hardware. John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Mar 9, 2017 at 5:24PM Nintendo's turnaround effort hinges on sales of the Switch console. Image source: NVIDIA Inc.  Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) stock is up 50% over the last year following launches of mobile games Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run, as well as the potential of the new Switch gaming console to return Nintendo to growth mode. The recent efforts of Nintendo in mobile gaming demonstrate that the company has large untapped potential on mobile platforms. If management can find the right mobile strategy, it could unlock value in its deep library of intellectual property. Nintendo's untapped potential in mobile gaming Pokemon Go has been downloaded 650 million times since its launch last summer, and is one of the top-grossing games in Apple's app store. But Pokemon Go is developed by Niantic, not Nintendo. Through its fiscal second quarter ending in September 2016, Nintendo earned a small licensing fee of $115 million for the Pokemon name to be used by Niantic. This is a drop in the bucket compared to Nintendo's market value of $24 billion. Still, the successful launch of the game led to growth in Nintendo software sales of past titles in the Pokemon series and also drove a 10% increase in Nintendo 3DS family hardware sales in the second half of 2016. These crossover sales show how a successful mobile-gaming strategy could supplement Nintendo's hardware business long term.  Super Mario Run has been downloaded 78 million times since its December 2016 launch. It's free to download with limited accessibility, and if players wish, they can pay $10 to unlock the full game. Out of the 78 million who downloaded the game, more than 5% chose to pay $10, generating $53 million in revenue for Nintendo. While this conversion rate is better than that of a lot of games that charge less than $5, it was below management's expectations of achieving an ambitious double-digit conversion rate. Mario Bros. is one of Nintendo's most popular franchises, and management wants the game to be enjoyed by everyone, from children to adults. To achieve this, management added an Easy Mode and is currently working on a tutorial, as well as how-to-play videos, to make the game easier to understand for those who have never played a Mario game before. It's unclear if these initiatives will serve as obstacles hindering potential players from buying the game. After all, many mobile games are played for the ease and accessibility of doing something fun to kill time. A different pay model The problem is that Super Mario Run is not among the top 100 highest-grossing games in Apple's app store. Nintendo has released four mobile games so far. Super Mario Run is the best-selling out of the first four, but to really move the needle, Nintendo needs several games to be toward the top of the charts. Management may also need to think about changing its pay model to a traditional free-to-play one. This model has proven very profitable for top game developers. Instead of charging Mario players $10 to unlock the full game, Nintendo could charge micro-transactions for a series of content over time. The potential financial impact for Nintendo could be significant if it can develop the right mobile strategy and sustain a steady cadence of mobile releases through the year. For example, in 2016, Activision Blizzard's King Digital Entertainment generated $537 million in operating income based on a handful of hit mobile games, including Candy Crush and Bubble Witch. However, it's not clear whether Nintendo will ever be as successful as other mobile developers. Mobile is a very crowded field, is completely new for Nintendo, and, more important, may not be in the company's DNA. Nintendo switches it up For now, the company's success completely hinges on its new Switch console, which launched March 3. Management hopes to sell 2 million units in March, and analysts expect up to 11 million units sold within the first year. This would put Switch on pace to sell probably between 30 million to 50 million units in the next three to five years, or less than half of Wii's 101.63 million units sold since its launch just over 10 years ago. The Wii was Nintendo's most successful console in company history, helping Nintendo reach a peak of $18.7 billion in net sales and $5.6 billion in operating income for fiscal year 2009.   These results fueled a rocket ride in the stock up to a peak of about $75 per share in early 2008. Is the stock a good bet? NTDOY data by YCharts. For the current fiscal year ending in March 2017, management is forecasting 20 billion Japanese yen in operating income. There is plenty of upside potential for Nintendo's stock if Switch is a runaway success like the Wii. With Nintendo's family friendly approach to gaming, deep franchise library, and healthy balance sheet, I would never want to bet against the company. I have shares in Nintendo tucked away just in case. However, Nintendo has a shaky history with hardware sales. If a company hasn't demonstrated consistent growth in its track record, investors shouldn't expect the future to look any different.   John Ballard owns shares of Activision Blizzard and Nintendo.

WikiLeaks has offered to help the likes of Google and Apple identify the software holes used by purported CIA hacking tools — and that puts the tech industry in a bind. ASSOCIATED PRESS WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange speaks in this video made available Thursday. ASSOCIATED PRESS WikiLeaks has offered to help the likes of Google and Apple identify the software holes used by purported CIA hacking tools — and that puts the tech industry in a bind. ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — WikiLeaks has offered to help the likes of Google and Apple identify the software holes used by purported CIA hacking tools — and that puts the tech industry in a bind. While companies have a responsibility — not to mention financial incentive — to fix problems in their software, accepting help from WikiLeaks raises legal and ethical questions. And it’s not even clear at this point exactly what kind of information WikiLeaks has to offer. THE PROMISE WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said today that the anti-secrecy site will work with technology companies to help defend them against software vulnerabilities in everyday gadgets such as phones and TVs. In an online news conference, Assange said some companies had asked for more details about the purported CIA cyberespionage toolkit that he revealed in a massive disclosure on Tuesday. “We have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out,” Assange said. The digital blueprints for what he described as “cyberweapons” would be published to the world “once this material is effectively disarmed by us.” Terms for disclosure, if any, weren’t immediately known. Nor was it known how much detail WikiLeaks has on specific vulnerabilities, rather than just the tools capable of exploiting them. LEGAL QUESTIONS Tech companies could run into legal difficulties in accepting the offer, especially if they have government contracts or employees with security clearances. “The unauthorized release of classified documents does not mean it’s unclassified,” said Stewart Baker, a former official at the Department of Homeland Security and former legal counsel for the National Security Agency. “Doing business with WikiLeaks and reviewing classified documents poses a real risk for at least their government contracting arms and their cleared employees,” Baker said. But it’s tough to prosecute cases involving classified documents, said Robert Cattanach, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney. At some point, he and other experts said, courts and the administration may consider such material as having passed into the public domain. TRUST MATTERS But tech companies might face a bigger problem with public perception. “They don’t want to be seen as endorsing or supporting an organization with a tainted reputation and an unclear agenda,” Cattanach said. For instance, WikiLeaks published thousands of emails, some embarrassing, from breached Democratic Party computers and the account of a top aide to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. Those emails were stolen by hackers connected to the Russian government, an act U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Russian attempt to help Donald Trump win the presidency. “You are getting in bed with someone who is ... happy to harm the interests of the United States in whatever way they can,” Baker said. “That does raise concerns of an ethical sort for companies that take their nation seriously.” Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist with the civil-liberties group Center for Democracy and Technology, said companies would have to navigate with care and assume that any discussions will ultimately become public, given WikiLeaks’ past and “Assange’s philosophy of radical transparency.” A BETTER PATH Ideally, the CIA would have shared such vulnerabilities directly with companies, as other government agencies have long done. In such a case, companies would not only be dealing with a known entity in an above-board fashion, they might also obtain a more nuanced understanding of the problems than might be apparent in documents or lines of computer code. And if companies could learn details about how the CIA found these vulnerabilities, they might also find additional vulnerabilities using the same technique, said Johannes Ullrich, director of the Internet Storm Center at the SANS Institute. But there are risks as well. Should tech companies obtain the actual hacking tools, Ullrich said, they’d have to treat them with great caution. Some, for instance, might have unadvertised features that could, for instance, start extracting data as soon as they launch. Raphael Satter in Paris, Paisley Dodds in London, Deb Riechmann in Washington and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this report. This story has been corrected to reflect that purported CIA tools are not aimed at “defeating encryption” but at hijacking computers.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 10 March 2017 | MYT 7:00 AM Apple, Samsung vow to fix flaws, after CIA hacking report Opportunistic agency: The CIA was exploiting weaknesses in hardware and software systems – without informing manufacturers of the flaws in question. — AFP Relaxnews Apple and Samsung vowed Wednesday to quickly fix any vulnerabilities in their products following WikiLeaks' disclosure of an alleged CIA hacking arsenal capable of breaking into iPhones and other devices. The archive released on Tuesday claims to show the CIA exploiting weaknesses it discovers in hardware and software systems – without informing manufacturers of the flaws in question. "While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities," Apple said in an e-mailed statement. "We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates." Samsung offered a similar response. "Protecting consumers' privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung," a statement from the South Korean electronics giant said. "We are aware of the report in question and are urgently looking into the matter." WikiLeaks claims the documents it released on Tuesday are part of a vast trove of leaked CIA documents, tools and code representing "the majority of its hacking arsenal." The CIA would neither confirm nor deny the documents were genuine. According to the documents, the CIA has produced more than 1,000 malware systems -- viruses, trojans, and other software that can infiltrate and take control of target electronics. These hacking tools have allegedly targeted iPhones, Android systems such as the personal phone reportedly still used by President Donald Trump, popular Microsoft software, and Samsung smart TVs. —  AFP Relaxnews   Related Stories You May Be Interested CEO of Australia's Atlassian says he'll meet seven-day Tesla batteries deadline IBM researchers take storage down to the atomic level Expert: Girl who drove on wrong side of highway may have hyperactivity disorder The 'gay moment' that was cut - when Le Fou shows love bite A soft spot for Peter‘s pork noodles Will your parents be a burden to you?

(FILES) This file photo taken on February 05, 2016 shows WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange coming out on the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy to address the media in central London. Photo: BEN STANSALL, AFP/Getty Images WikiLeaks will share CIA hacking data with tech companies 1 / 1 Back to Gallery WikiLeaks will turn over all the details it has on the CIA’s alleged hacking arsenal so that tech companies like Apple and Google can patch holes and fix vulnerabilities in their technology before the activist group makes the code publicly available online, the organization’s founder announced Thursday. Julian Assange took questions on the CIA leak in a lengthy online news conference broadcast on Twitter from Ecuador’s Embassy in London, where Assange has been since he was granted political asylum in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden on rape accusations, which he has denied. Assange said the organization would work with tech companies whose products appeared to be targets of CIA cyberattacks that included breaking into phones, computers, cars and televisions. “WikiLeaks has a lot more information about what has been going on with the cyberweapons program. After considering what we think is the best way to proceed and hearing these calls from some of the manufacturers, we have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details that we have so that fixes can be developed and pushed out, so people can be secure,” Assange said. He did not detail how WikiLeaks would securely pass the information on to tech firms or to which companies the data would be distributed. Once companies have had a chance to ensure that consumer devices are properly protected, Assange said, the group will release the code showing how the CIA managed to break into phones, work around encrypted messaging apps and avoid detection by software designed to defend against cyberattacks. WikiLeaks published a cache of nearly 9,000 documents that the group said had been leaked by a CIA contractor. Though the CIA itself has declined to comment on the authenticity of the documents, several cybersecurity experts interviewed by The Chronicle, including some with previous government experience, said the trove of data appears legitimate. The initial document release on Tuesday was only a piece of a greater stash of information WikiLeaks said it had hesitated to reveal, due to the sensitive nature of the information and how extensively it could endanger people’s personal data. In a statement that accompanied the documents, WikiLeaks said it avoided “the distribution of ‘armed’ cyberweapons” before those tools could be disabled and rendered relatively benign. Companies named in the leak, including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung, said this week that they are investigating the claims and patching security holes. According to the leaked documents, the CIA discovered and kept secret 14 methods of exploiting Apple devices. Those vulnerabilities are known as zero-day attacks, meaning they pounce on security defects unknown even to the company itself and, therefore, have no known fix. The spy agency also collected 24 “weaponized” zero-day exploits against Android devices, the documents said, and engaged in an attack called “Weeping Angel” that turned Samsung Smart TVs into listening devices by putting the television sets in a fake off-mode while hackers used them to record conversations. Security experts were outraged over the leak, in part, they said, because by keeping information about technological vulnerabilities to itself, the spy agency could have put the personal data of countless people at risk of being hacked by cybercriminals or other countries. Assange suggested during Thursday’s news conference that the CIA may have used some of these tools to spy on Americans, which would be a violation of the agency’s legal mandate. He said WikiLeaks had received a list of more than 22,000 IP addresses — numbers that correspond with individual computers — associated with U.S. computers that could have been used in CIA attacks or targeted by CIA hackers. Those IP addresses have not be released nor independently verified. The CIA has denied that it uses electronic surveillance against Americans, and many cybersecurity experts cautioned against trusting Assange, whom many consider to be a tool of Russia. Samsung, Google and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Assange’s offer. Marissa Lang is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The renowned naturalist will narrate stories inspired by some of the most famous documentaries of his career as young viewers use their touch screens to help him on his way. New to the CBeebies Storytime app, the series will begin with David And The Gorilla Quest, based on his encounter with mountain gorillas in Rwanda during his 1978 trip for BBC Natural History's Life On Earth series. Children will have the chance to pick the adventurer's kit, track the gorillas' path through the jungle, and move aside plants so the young Sir David can get through. "I am thrilled that we've brought to life many fond memories of my exploration of the natural world for young children to enjoy and learn," Sir David said. Designed for children aged 0-6, Attenborough's Adventures will help them learn to read as they explore the animal expert's expeditions since his early days filming Zoo Quest in the 1950s, to his debut with virtual reality in last year's Attenborough And The Giant Dinosaur. CBeebies controller Kay Benbow said: "Each story is brought to life with magical things to touch, swipe and play with, and questions to help develop comprehension skills, so the grown-up and child can enjoy reading, playing and learning together. "Sir David has led an extraordinary life, and we're over the moon that his enthralling tales are now helping children to learn while being inspired by the natural world." As the series progresses, young viewers will also follow Sir David in search of dinosaurs, dragons, treasure and a hidden city. The full list of five stories includes: Attenborough's Adventures: David and the Giant Dinosaur Attenborough's Adventures: David and the Hidden City Attenborough's Adventures: David and the Dragon Attenborough's Adventures: David the Treasure Hunter Available to download on Apple, Android and Kindle Fire devices, the series is produced by Laura Howard of the BBC Natural History Unit and illustrated by Will Rose.

Siri is the oldest of the bunch, and researchers including Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, said Apple has squandered its lead when it comes to understanding speech and answering questions. But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localized for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States. Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon's Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say “two-nil” instead of “two-nothing.” At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries. “They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican,” said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, an acoustic model is built that tries to predict words sequences. Then Apple deploys “dictation mode,” its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. But script-writing does not scale, said Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo. “You can’t hire enough writers to come up with the system you’d need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers,” he said. That is years off, he said. The founders of Viv, a startup founded by Siri's original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that. "Viv was built to specifically address the scaling issue for intelligent assistants," said Dag Kittlaus, the CEO and co-founder of Viv. "The only way to leapfrog today's limited functionality versions is to open the system up and let the world teach them."

Siri is the oldest of the bunch, and researchers including Mr Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, said Apple has squandered its lead when it comes to understanding speech and answering questions. But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localised for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States. Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google's Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon's Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say "two-nil" instead of "two-nothing". At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customise Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children's book author writes Cortana's lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries. "They really pride themselves on what's truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican," said Mr Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Mr Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, a language model is built that tries to predict words sequences. Then Apple deploys "dictation mode", its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Mr Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Mr Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. But script-writing does not scale, said Mr Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo. "You can't hire enough writers to come up with the system you'd need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers," he said. That is years off, he said. The founders of Viv, a startup founded by Siri's original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that.

ARRESTS AT BORDER FALL SHARPLY Arrests of people crossing the Mexican border illegally dropped roughly 44 percent during Trump's first month in office — but exactly why isn't quite clear. 8. WHAT'S A PARADOX OF TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY The man who condemns the media as "the enemy of the people" may be the most voracious consumer of news — TV and print — in modern presidential history. 9. MUSHER NODS OFF, GOES MISSING Iditarod race veteran Linwood Fiedler arrives at a checkpoint about an hour behind his dogs after falling asleep and toppling off his sled. 10.

Get The Latest TV Newswire Natural arch seen on Game Of Thrones and Clash Of The Titans collapses By Sam Barsanti @sambarsanti Posted Mar 9, 2017 at 8:23 p.m. Game Of Thrones Game Of Thrones These days, humans tend to make a lot of the cool stuff on Earth, but that’s mostly because it takes the planet itself a very long time to do anything. Unfortunately, the cool stuff the Earth makes can also be undone in an instant, due to the fact that the planet can’t buy Apple Care or whatever to protect its polar ice caps or atmosphere, and that’s exactly what happened to a famous stone arch that has been seen in a number of movies and TV shows. Called the Azure Window, the limestone arch used to be located on Malta’s Gozo Island, and it has appeared in the original Clash Of The Titans and the first episode of Game Of Thrones. According to CNN, Malta had been taking steps to preserve the arch, but natural corrosion and heavy storms finally caused it to break. The country’s prime minister has also been tweeting about the arch, expressing his disappointment over the structure’s collapse: I have just been informed that the beautiful Tieqa tad-Dwejra in #Gozo has collapsed. Updates soon.— Joseph Muscat (@JosephMuscat_JM) March 8, 2017 Reports commissioned over the years indicated that this landmark would be hard hit by unavoidable natural corrosion. That sad day arrived.— Joseph Muscat (@JosephMuscat_JM) March 8, 2017 The site from where one could admire it-Tieqa tad-Dwejra. Heartbreaking. pic.twitter.com/S4XV6MyKRu— Joseph Muscat (@JosephMuscat_JM) March 8, 2017 #Dwejra #AzureWindow site today.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday that the Trump administration would use "the full force of the law … to hold all of those accountable" in hacking of documents that were released this week by WikiLeaks. "Trafficking in national security information, as is alleged WikiLeaks has done here, is a very serious offense," Pence told Bret Baier on Fox News. "It represents a compromise of the security of the American people. "This president and this administration will take that very seriously and use the full force of the law and resources of the United States to hold all of those to account that were involved," he said. "If proven to be true and confirmed publicly, I can assure you that no resource will be spared in holding those [to] account that have leaked information that could well constitute a compromise of methods and a compromise of national security." WikiLeaks published nearly 9,000 documents Tuesday purporting to contain details of CIA hacking operations, including claims that the spy agency could record information from Apple, Google and Samsung smartphones and televisions. Federal officials were investigating the latest dump — and Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions Thursday if WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had broken the law or might face prosecution. "Does the Department of Justice believe Julian Assange has broken the law and is the department aggressively pursuing his detention and prosecution?" Sasse asked in a letter to Sessions. "Frankly, it is amazing that I even have to ask this question of the administration in light of the intelligence community's formal assessment that Mr. Assange's website is a known outlet for foreign propaganda and in light of Mr. Assange's history of recklessly endangering the lives of Americans through his illegal disclosures," he said. Assange also said Thursday that WikiLeaks would help technology companies find and fix software vulnerabilities in their everyday products. In an online news conference, he said that some companies had sought out more details about the alleged CIA toolkit that was revealed in the latest document drop. "We have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out," Assange said. The digital blueprints for what he described as "cyberweapons" would be published to the world "once this material is effectively disarmed by us." The Associated Press contributed to this report.

According to consulting firm Accenture, investment in Fintech firms rose by 10 percent worldwide to the tune of $23.2 billion in 2016. China is leading the charge after securing $10 billion in investments in 55 deals which account for 90 percent of investments in Asia-Pacific. The US came second taking in $6.2 billion in funding. Europe, also saw an 11 percent increase in deals despite Britain seeing a decrease in funding due to the uncertainty from the Brexit vote. “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT The excitement stems from the disruption of traditional financial institutions (FIs) such as banks, insurance, and credit companies by technology. The next unicorn might be among the hundreds of tech startups that are giving Fintech a go. What exactly is going to be the next big thing has yet to be determined, but other developments in computing like artificial intelligence (AI) may play a huge part. Stiffening competition The growing reality is that, while opportunities are abound, competition is also heating up. Take, for example, the number of Fintech startups that aim to digitize routine financial tasks like payments. In the US, the digital wallet and payments segment is fiercely competitive. Pioneers like PayPal see themselves being taken on by other tech giants like Google and Apple, by niche-oriented ventures like Venmo, and even by traditional FIs. Some ventures are seeing bluer oceans by focusing on local and regional markets where conditions are somewhat favorable. The growth of China’s Fintech was largely made possible by the relative age of its current banking system. It was easier for people to use mobile and web-based financial services such as Alibaba’s Ant Financial and Tencent since phones were more pervasive and more convenient to access than traditional financial instruments. In Europe, the new Payment Services Directive (PSD2) set to take effect in 2018 has busted the game wide open. Banks are obligated to open up their application program interfaces (APIs) enabling Fintech apps and services to tap into users’ bank accounts. The line between banks and fintech companies are set to blur so just about everyone in finance is set to compete with old and new players alike. Leveraging technology Convenience has become a fundamental selling point to many users that a number of Fintech ventures have zeroed in on delivering better user experiences for an assortment of financial tasks such as payments, budgeting, banking, and even loan applications. There is a mad scramble among companies to leverage cutting-edge technologies for competitive advantage. Even established tech companies like e-commerce giant Amazon had to give due attention to mobile as users shift their computing habits towards phones and tablets. Enterprises are also working on transitioning to cloud computing for infrastructure. But where do more advanced technologies such as AI come in? The drive to eliminate human fallibility has also made artificial intelligence (AI) driven to the forefront of research and development. Its applications range from sorting what gets shown on your social media newsfeed to self-driving cars. It’s also expected to have a major impact in Fintech due to potential of game changing insights that can be derived from the sheer volume of data that humanity is generating. Enterprising ventures are banking on it to expose the gap in the market that has become increasingly small due to competition. All about algorithms AI and finance are no strangers to each other. Traditional banking and finance have relied heavily on algorithms for automation and analysis. However, these were exclusive only to large and established institutions. Fintech is being aimed at empowering smaller organizations and consumers, and AI is expected to make its benefits accessible to a wider audience. AI has a wide variety of consumer-level applications for smarter and more error-free user experiences. Personal finance applications are now using AI to balance people’s budgets based specifically to a user’s behavior. AI now also serves as robo-advisors to casual traders to guide them in managing their stock portfolios. For enterprises, AI is expected to continue serving functions such as business intelligence and predictive analytics. Merchant services such as payments and fraud detection are also relying on AI to seek out patterns in customer behavior in order to weed out bad transactions. People may soon have very little excuse of not having a handle of their money because of these services Pros and cons Despite the exciting potential AI brings, there are still caveats. A big challenge for Fintech is to develop AI to be as smart as it can. There will be no shortage of people who will try to game and outwit such systems. While AI seeks to eliminate human error, the flipside – losing the human touch – is a common criticism of AI. Smart money decisions are best made through numbers and logic. However, people do have an emotional connection with their money so it will be a challenge for Fintech apps to create experiences that do not alienate its users. Take the sad stories of insurance claims being denied due to strict algorithms that disregard the nuances of the human condition. AI still has a way to go factoring in what is just and moral in its decision making. As for finance as a field and industry, there is also the issue of financial analysts, advisors, bankers, and traders being threatened to obsolescence by AI. A running joke with AI alludes to the Terminator movie franchise where AI seeks to eliminate humanity from existence. Unemployment, however, is rarely a laughing matter. Towards the future With the stiff competition in Fintech, ventures have to deliver a truly valuable products and services in order to stand out. The venture that provides the best user experience often wins but finding this X factor has become increasingly challenging. The developments in AI may provide that something extra especially if it could promise to eliminate the guess work and human error out of finance. It’s for these reasons that AI might just hold the key to what further Fintech innovations can be made. This post is part of our contributor series. It is written and published independently of TNW.

But if you don’t want your keyboard to take up plenty of room, there aren’t a lot of options just yet. That’s why I was glad to get a chance to try out the Lofree Dot, a compact and beautifully designed keyboard from an upcoming gadget maker in China, that marries the feel of robust mechanical switches with the convenience of wireless connectivity. “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT Design The Dot has a small footprint, roughly the size of an Apple Magic keyboard, with hard non-adjustable rubber pegs and keys that mimic the look of traditional typewriters like the Remington 12 from the 1920s. They complement the smooth curves of the tray perfectly, making for an elegant and timeless design that will go with just about any desktop setup. There are discreet switches on the side to turn Bluetooth on and off, as well as to toggle between modes to support Android/PC and macOS/iOS. Overall, the Dot feels sturdy and well built, albeit a bit heavy for its size – but that’s due in part to the built-in rechargeable battery, which can keep it going for several days on a single charge. Features I love that the Dot doesn’t require any setup at all – simply pair it once with your desktop or mobile device and you’re up and running, keyboard shortcuts and all. You can use the Function key for things like volume and media playback control, system sleep mode and the Windows Start button. In addition, you can toggle between multiple levels of backlight strength – a nice touch. Typing on the Dot The Dot features Gateron Blue switches, which are clicky and offer a fair bit of resistance and travel. That basically means that they’re loud and need a solid stroke to engage each key. And because of the way the keycaps dip in the middle, your fingers need to strike from above; gliding across keys the way you might on a laptop’s chiclet keyboard simply isn’t an option here. That doesn’t mean that the typing experience on the Dot isn’t pleasant. It actually feels great beneath your fingers, and you’ll find yourself making less mistakes as you get comfortable with it. However, it’ll take a couple of weeks of getting used to before you’re as quick with it as you were on your previous favorite keyboard. But that’s just for everyday use: If you work extensively with documents or play fast-paced games like I do, you might not enjoy the Dot as much as a standard mechanical keyboard. It’s missing essential keys like Home, End and Page Up/Down, so navigating around a lengthy document or web page might slow you down; I also found it a bit difficult to move around as a ninja space robot in Warframe because the rounded keys aren’t conducive to being mashed as easily as the ones on my other old-school keyboard. Here’s what the keyboard sounds like: Should you buy it? If you’re looking for an elegant desktop accessory to class up your workspace, you’d be hard-pressed to find something more distinctive than the Dot. The gorgeous profile of the body and keys, coupled with the pleasing color schemes on offer, make it a must-have for design enthusiasts. At $99, the look, feel and overall quality certainly warrant the asking price. Add to the fact that it’s a delight to type on, and that it doesn’t require you to replace its batteries and works with your phone or tablet, and you’ve got a winner on your hands. Oh, and its built-in Bluetooth means that it’ll work great with the HTPC in your living room too. That being said, this may not be the best choice for gamers or people who rely extensively on the full array of keys offered on traditional mechanical keyboards – so keep that in mind while ordering it for yourself or as a gift. Check out the Lofree Dot Wireless Mechanical Keyboard’s Indiegogo campaign on this page, where you can order it in three different colorways for $74 with free US shipping. It’ll ship in May, and will be subsequently become available via Amazon.

Now Apple has claimed that most of the exploits have since been patched, and the good news is that Android users can rest assured that they’re safe too. According to a statement Heather Adkins, Google’s director of information security and privacy made to CNET, “As we’ve reviewed the documents, we’re confident that security updates and protections in both Chrome and Android already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities. Our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections.” To be fair it seems that the list of exploits that the CIA kept date all the way back to 2013, which means that there is a very good chance that over the years and thanks to the monthly security updates issued by Google that some of them have been patched already, but it’s still good to hear Google confirming it anyway. Recently Wikileaks also announced that they will be cooperating with tech companies by releasing the tools that the CIA used to hack their software, something that the CIA is apparently none too happy about.

Hooray! Privacy advocates see an upside It appears US spies are using targeted hacking tools in their investigations. The surprise: That could mean your data is safer. Smart Home by Laura Hautala March 9, 2017 4:50 PM PST @lhautala Julian Assange of WikiLeaks during a live-streamed press conference on Thursday. CIA hacking tools described in documents released by WikiLeaks are actually a good sign, privacy experts say. Screenshot by CNET In all this talk of a CIA hacking playbook, is there a silver lining? Privacy advocates seem to think so. That might surprise you. Nothing makes a person feel vulnerable in quite the same way as hearing that everyday electronics are being turned into spy devices. And that's exactly what we heard Tuesday, when WikiLeaks published thousands of documents that appeared to reveal CIA tools for hacking into computers, phones and even smart TVs. CNET is unable to verify whether the documents are real or have been altered. Still, the news prompted Edward Snowden to post on Twitter, "It may not feel like it, but computer security is getting better." Come again? Here's the idea: If CIA spies are spending their time hacking the phones of suspected terrorists or foreign spies, that means they aren't relying on spy programs that are much more intrusive and essentially hack the entire internet. How do WikiLeaks' CIA hacking claims differ from Snowden NSA? After the release of thousands of alleged CIA documents by WikiLeaks, tech companies like Apple and Samsung have responded. But how do the WikiLeaks claims differ from what Edward Snowden exposed about the NSA mass surveillance program? by Lexy Savvides 2:19 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Moose and squirrel, meet spy vs. spy Sure, hacking a smart TV is creepy. But it's a far cry from the National Security Agency programs Snowden, a former NSA contractor, revealed to journalists in 2013. Those programs -- in particular the tools known as Muscular and Upstream -- were designed to suck up huge amounts of internet traffic and store it for the NSA to comb through later. Privacy advocates refer to these as dragnets, and there's every possibility your information has been pulled in by these programs, whether or not you're an American citizen. The spy who hacked me CIA to WikiLeaks: We're doing our jobs by spying Snowden effect: Privacy is good for business Secret loopholes drive NSA's 'unrestrained surveillance' "The NSA has been caught running dragnet intelligence," said Dan Petro, a cybersecurity expert who specializes in spotting networks and devices that are vulnerable to hacking. The agency's programs are so broad, he said, "it sounds like it's something out of a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon." But you can't scoop up that volume of data by hacking a phone, Petro said. In fact, what the WikiLeaks documents show is the opposite of a dragnet, and that's Snowden's point. The NSA didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. The CIA declined to add to its official statement on the WikiLeaks documents, which in part says, "It is CIA's job to be innovative, cutting-edge, and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad. America deserves nothing less." 'Encryption works; patch your software' Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of an encryption tool that scrambles up communications sent on messaging apps Signal and WhatsApp, agrees with Snowden. In fact, it's the increased use of these apps -- and encryption more broadly -- that's forcing spy agencies to turn to hacking their targets, according to a statement put out Tuesday by Marlinspike's company, Open Whisper Systems. "Ubiquitous end-to-end encryption is pushing intelligence agencies like the CIA from a world of undetectable mass surveillance to a world where they have to very selectively use high-risk, expensive, targeted attacks," the statement said. Maybe you're still concerned that the CIA may have the tools to hack the operating system on your phone. OK, fair enough. Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the pro-privacy Electronic Frontier Foundation, says the best defense against hacking tools is updating your software. Indeed, Apple, Google and Microsoft have all said their products are already safe from most of the tools outlined by the WikiLeaks documents, if you're using their latest software. If you can't update your software because you're using a really old device, but you care about keeping hackers out of your phone, it's time to consider an upgrade. "I think for ordinary people, the takeaway is: 'Encryption works; patch your software,'" Galperin said.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 10 March 2017 Dialog to develop chips with China’s Tsinghua BEIJING: Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd is teaming with Britain’s Dialog Semiconductor Plc to develop smartphone chips, a deal that will help the government-linked Chinese technology giant expand its growing semiconductor empire. Unigroup mobile-design subsidiary Spreadtrum & RDA and the British supplier of chips to Apple Inc’s iPhones and iPads are considering a joint venture in eastern China, through which the pair will jointly design communications components. Dialog, which gets almost 70% of its revenue from Apple according to data compiled by Bloomberg, will help Unigroup with crucial mobile power management technology in return for bigger access to the Chinese smartphone and Internet of Things markets. The Chinese company is keen on a deeper foray into the Internet of Things, a market that will blossom in coming years as devices in the home increasingly get connected. Unigroup is simultaneously devising an ambitious expansion in memory chips: Championing China’s effort to wean itself off foreign technology, it’s begun building a US$30bil domestic memory-chip production complex that will become China’s largest when completed. Spreadtrum & RDA plans to launch its first chip for fifth-generation wireless networks in 2018. “We started as a maker of low-end and now, after years of R&D investment, we’re looking forward to gaining a bigger presence in the high-end sector,” said Spreadtrum & RDA chairman Leo Li. – Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: tsinghua , Dialog , semiconductor Related Stories Related Stories Global semicon sales up at nearly US$339b in 2016 Penang freight forwarders see operations improving Aramco’s Rapid entry benefits selected companies Dialog Q2 revenue rises to RM856.78mil Taiwan's TSMC says ops mostly fine after minor quake You May Be Interested Expert: Girl who drove on wrong side of highway may have hyperactivity disorder The 'gay moment' that was cut - when Le Fou shows love bite A soft spot for Peter‘s pork noodles Will your parents be a burden to you?

The Belfast super-fly travels to New York on Monday ahead of his younger brother Michael’s St Patrick’s Day pro debut at Madison Square Garden. While it is a trip the 30-year-old has been eagerly looking forward to, he first has the small matter of his own big fight to attend to. Nicaraguan Yader Cardoza (21-10-1) will be in the opposite corner to the elder Conlan at Belfast’s Waterfront Hall tonight, live on BoxNation which features on the Eir Sports pack and Sky TV. The vacant WBC title is up for grabs as Jamie looks to extend his undefeated record to 19-0 before celebrating in the Big Apple. “That’s the light at the end of a long tunnel after a tough camp,” said Jamie. “But I know I’ve got a job to do on Friday first. I’m glad I’m fighting before Mick so I can relax for his fight. It’s good we’re going away on the Monday because I get to move on quickly. I don’t like fussing over a fight – when I win it’s over with. It’s back to business, cash the cheque and then move on!” Already ranked No 2 in the world by the WBO, Jamie reckons both Conlans will be competing for world straps sooner rather than later. “We’re in this together but just on two different paths,” said the 30-year-old. “Things are going well and I’ll just have to keep the momentum.” Paddy Barnes also features on the card in his second pro bout and the three-time Olympian is keen to show Top Rank what they are missing next week. Barnes made a cheeky Twitter pitch to Michael Conlan’s US promoters in a bid to book an undercard bout on the New York bill, but his hopes were scuppered when the February 18 Belfast fight bill was rescheduled for tonight due to Jamie Conlan picking up a chest infection. “After Top Rank see my fight, I think they’ll be kicking themselves I’m not on the New York bill,” laughed the 29-year-old, who will be fancied to easily overcome Adrian Dimas Garzon tonight as the 40-year-old Argentine fighter was defeated by Jamie Conlan in four rounds back in 2015. The elder Conlan has a bigger test on his hands, however, in the form of former world-title challenger Cardoza. Both fighters have predicted a “war”, but the home fighter insists he is more than ready despite being forced to take a break from training due to his recent illness. “After the break, I’m really ready now, mentally, physically,” said Conlan. “It gave me time to work on the gameplan and study my opponent, which I don’t usually really do. I’ve just got to control the fight. He can go flat-out for 12 rounds so I’ve to expect that.” The Frank Warren-promoted show also features a solid undercard, with two Dublin v Belfast battles the likely highlights. Declan Geraghty and Belfast puncher James Tennyson clash for the Irish super-featherweight title, while Jake Hanney and Tyrone McKenna meet for the BUI Celtic light-middle title.

Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) Mar 9, 2017 at 5:02PM Japanese consumer electronics manufacturer Sharp Corporation (NASDAQOTH:SHCAY) has recently caught investors' attention. Since hitting lows of less than $1 a share last summer, shares had rebounded to just under $3 as of early March. The 100-year-old company is undergoing an overhaul and is worth a review now that it's come under new leadership. Data by YCharts. 1. Foxconn owns most of Sharp Last spring, Taiwan-based Foxconn (NASDAQOTH:FXCOF) and Sharp announced an alliance in which the former would assume ownership of about two-thirds of the latter. The final purchase was valued at $3.5 billion. Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer, best known for its work constructing the iPhone, made the buy to gain access to Sharp's display-screen technology and consumer electronics division. Foxconn also replaced the CEO with former Foxconn Vice President J.W. Tai. Image source: Sharp. The new head of Sharp has been busy slashing costs and refocusing the company's sprawling enterprise down to the most profitable areas. Sharp and Foxconn management see both companies benefiting from a sharing of technology, new sales distribution opportunities, and new pricing power ability with big customers such as Apple and Samsung. 2. Sharp is investing in the future The biggest moneymaker for Sharp is the display device segment. Through three quarters of Sharp's fiscal year, as reported in early February, sales of display devices such as televisions and smartphones made up 40% of total sales. While that division had declined 31% year over year, much of that drop has to do with the company's switch to a licensing model instead of in-house manufacturing. The company is still working to fix issues with its bread-and-butter division, but the new management team also wants to make a push into new technologies. Sharp will be working on the TV market, specifically eyeing new 8K ultra-high-definition models. Yes, a replacement for your new 4K TV is already being planned. In tandem with that move, less profitable areas are being reorganized. On Feb. 24, it was announced that Sharp and Foxconn will both be bundling up their healthcare and medical-related businesses into a new wholly owned subsidiary to help improve performance and increase collaboration between the two businesses. Image source: Sharp. 3. After years of bleeding, Sharp just turned a profit During Sharp's last fiscal year, the company did $21.8 billion in revenue at today's exchange rates. However, that translated into both operating losses and net losses. In fact, the company was running steep losses for four out of the past five years, the only exception being 2014, when sales hit a peak. Metric 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Revenue 2,455,850 2,478,586 2,927,186 2,786,256 2,461,589 Operating income (loss) (37,552) (146,266) 108,560 (48,065) (161,967) Net income (loss) (376,076) (545,347) 11,559 (222,347) (255,972) Data source: Sharp Corporation fiscal year 2016 third-quarter report. All figures in millions of Japanese yen.  Under the tutelage of Foxconn, though, Sharp has quickly turned things around. In the second quarter, the company swung to an operating profit of 2.5 billion yen and in the third quarter improved further to a net profit of 4.2 billion yen. This improvement comes in spite of another year of lower sales. The quick turnaround has been pulled off by restructuring segments of the business (such as the aforementioned TV unit's switch to a licensing model), cost-cutting, and paying down debt. Sharp sees the last quarter of its fiscal year running at another bottom-line profit. What to consider Sharp and its new majority owner, Foxconn, still have a lot of work ahead. After years of losing money, Sharp is short on assets and long on debt and faces substantial competition in the global technology sector. Still, the speed at which the company has turned the ship around this year looks encouraging. For investors who like high-stakes bets on struggling businesses trying to rebound, Sharp could be worth a look. Nicholas Rossolillo has no position in any stocks mentioned.

This is especially true in light of the recent Wikileaks Vault7 release. The government clearly doesn’t believe we should have absolute privacy, since FBI Director James Comey says it doesn’t exist in the United States. We’ve examined some options for encrypted email on macOS. Now, how can we try to ensure the email communications from our iOS devices stay private? Let’s take a gander at a couple of options for encrypted email on the iPhone and iPad. Email encryption can be done on the iPhone and iPad with the right app. (Image Credit: JÉSHOOTS) The Built-In App Is a No Go For whatever reason, Apple hasn’t made it as easy to send and receive encrypted email from Mail for iOS as it is on the Mac. The whole process is cumbersome and often doesn’t work. So, let’s just move on to options that do work, shall we? Try ProtonMail for Encrypted Emails One free option for the iPhone and iPad is ProtonMail, a service and free app based in Switzerland. ProtonMail offers end-to-end encryption of all of your email, and it’s easy to use. Emails are stored on ProtonMail’s servers encrypted, and the company can’t decrypt them. AES, RSA, and OpenPGP are used to keep everything secure. There are several account options for ProtonMail. The free account uses the @protonmail.com domain, has 500MB of storage, and limits you to 150 messages per day. For the Plus account, costing US $4 per month, you get 5GB of storage and can send up to 1,000 messages per day. You can also use your own domain, with up to five email aliases. If you need even more, ProtonMail’s Visionary account is $24 per month. It includes 20GB of storage, up to 50 email aliases, support for up to 10 domains, and no sending limits. If you use ProtonMail to send to other users of the service, it’s all seamlessly encrypted. When you send to external recipients, you will need to set a password to encrypt the message. Setting the encryption password in ProtonMail Your recipient will then get a link emailed to them. They click the link, enter the password, and view the email. You can retrieve your encrypted email on any web browser ProtonMail works pretty well, and doesn’t require technical knowledge of keypairs and all of that jazz.

This means that Chrome 57 for iOS is next around the corner and one of the features that will arrive as part of that update is a Reading List feature similar to that of what’s currently support in Safari… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case As you can see in the screenshot above, Chrome’s new Reading List feature is accessible from the menu in the upper-right corner. Simply tap the three dots and you’ll see the reading list option appear. Next to the Reading List option, you’ll also see the number of unread articles you still have in your queue. Once you send an article to your reading list, it will appear in a new “Reading List” interface. The feature separates items you’ve saved into “Unread” and “Pages You’ve Read” sections, making it easy to manage everything. This is something that Apple’s own Reading List functionality is currently lacking. Other than that, however, Google Chrome’s new feature is very similar to what’s currently supported in Safari on iOS and macOS. Currently, Chrome on the desktop doesn’t support a first-party Reading List feature, though there are extensions that provide similar functionalities. Nevertheless, it’s unclear how or if Chrome on iOS and the desktop will sync with one another. Google is currently testing Reading List in the Chrome Beta for iOS build, so it’s likely that the feature will make its way to the stable channel at some point in the near future. It’s possible that the feature may change slightly before it launches to the public, though. Given the name similarity to Apple’s own Reading List feature, we wouldn’t be surprised if the name is one thing that does change. Chrome for iOS is available on the App Store and you can download it now to ensure that you have the Reading List feature as soon as it becomes available. Two more screenshots of the feature can be seen below and you can read about Chrome 57’s new features over on our sister site, 9to5Google. The update includes a handful of improvements for developers, though the major changes were saved for Chrome on Android. Thanks, Chase!

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it (The Washington Post) By Eugene Robinson By Eugene Robinson Opinion writer March 9 Follow @Eugene_Robinson It’s time to put an end to the myth that Republicans believe in fiscal responsibility. Saving taxpayer dollars takes a back seat to the ideological imperative of blaming and shaming the poor. Witness the GOP’s long-awaited plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. House committees are moving forward on the legislation before the Congressional Budget Office has even had a chance to estimate how much the measure will cost. Why the rush? Because if the plan doesn’t snatch away health insurance coverage from millions of people — and both President Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) swear it won’t — then it’s surely going to cost a ton. The Republican plan would take away the ACA’s subsidies and replace them with refundable tax credits based on age for incomes up to $75,000 for an individual and $150,000 for a married couple. This means a windfall for those who are older and well-to-do. In essence, the plan would expand government assistance to encompass many who don’t really need it — in order to avoid targeting help toward those who do. The GOP plan would also eliminate the ACA’s penalty fee for not having health insurance, which goes into the public till — and replace it with a different penalty fee that goes to the insurance companies. Apparently Republicans have no problem committing what they once called “extortion” if the benefit goes to private companies, not the common good. Keep in mind that Trump and GOP leaders in Congress promise that after dealing with health care they will seek huge tax cuts, including for the wealthy. As fiscal policy, how does this make sense? (Reuters) It doesn’t. It only makes sense as ideology. In today’s Republican Party, policies have to satisfy the belief that the less fortunate are poor by choice. Rarely do Republicans just come out and accuse the poor of being lazy freeloaders, but Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) came close. He suggested that “rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care.” The priciest iPhone advertised on Apple’s website is a 7 Plus model with 256 gigabytes of storage and all the bells and whistles. It costs $969. If Chaffetz will cancel his health insurance plan, I will write him a check for that amount — and wish him the best of luck providing health care for his family. Maybe he’ll be able to pay for a single visit to the emergency room. It would be one thing if the GOP’s mean-spirited ideology actually saved money, but it doesn’t. Quite the contrary, in fact. When you ask Republicans what they’re going to cut, they mention foreign aid — which totals about $35 billion , or slightly less than 1 percent of federal spending. They threaten to eviscerate smaller agencies by cutting $6 billion here or $8 billion there — but at the same time, they applaud Trump’s pledge to increase the nearly $600 billion defense budget by an incredible 10 percent. They’re going to end up spending more — perhaps lots more — and collecting less in tax revenue. And this is the party that claims to care about deficits and debt? But wait, Republicans say, we’re going to “save” the big entitlement programs by trimming benefits. Yeah, sure. I’m not holding my breath. The problem is that Medicare and Social Security serve middle-class and upper-crust taxpayers, including many who share the GOP’s punish-the-poor belief system. If you think these ACA-focused town halls are hostile, just you wait. The fact is that among recent administrations, at least, Democratic presidents have been the relative skinflints. Bill Clinton, you will recall, actually balanced the budget — and yes, he had help from Republicans in Congress. Barack Obama spent heavily at first to save the economy, which was teetering on the edge of a dreadful abyss, but he ended up slashing the deficit in half and presiding over years of uninterrupted economic growth. George W. Bush, on the other hand, fought hugely expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq without accounting for them in his budgets. He also convinced Congress to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs, which was compassionate but costly. Trump promises to be even more of a big spender. Among other things, he promises a trillion-dollar program to renew the nation’s infrastructure. Imagine the Republican howling if Obama had suggested such a thing. The GOP will surely persist in its sanctimony about balanced budgets, but no one should pay any attention. Republicans, we see what you’re doing.

He still remembers the day he attended Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963. “We didn’t realize how many people would show up and no one realized what a moving speech that would be. That moment has always stayed with me,” he said. He decided to change his major from physics to economics because he wanted to understand inequality as well as discrimination and also hoped to do something about these problems plaguing the country. The Great Divide is based on the author’s long history of academic research on the subject of inequality, which began when he was a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a Fulbright scholar at Cambridge. “No one today can deny that there is a great divide in America, separating the very richest. Sometimes described as the 1 percent and the rest. Their lives are the different, they have different worries, different aspirations and different lifestyles,” Stiglitz writes. Stiglitz was always aware of the lack of interest among the general public and even economists on the subject of inequality, and always wondered how he could make his ideas accessible to a wider public. Cullen Murphy, editor at The Atlantic Monthly and then at Vanity Fair, provided him with the opportunity to reach a more popular audience. Stiglitz went on to write articles for The Atlantic Monthly, Vanity Fair and The Great Divide Series (which provided the title of this book) for the New York Times. Under the tutelage of Cullen, he not only improved his writing skills, but also one of his articles, “Capitals Fools,” (included in this book) won the prestigious Gerald Loeb Award for outstanding journalism. This book is a collection of articles and essays published in newspapers and magazines on the subject of inequality. The emergence of the “great divide” is deeply connected to the crisis that surfaced in the United States in 2008 and spread to the rest of the world. The seeds that eventually grew into the Great Recession were sown under Reagan. He championed deregulation policies that caused the disappearance of regulatory walls between investment and commercial banks. Stiglitz singles out the Ronald Reagan era, as a turning point: “If somebody had said, I have a deal for you: we are going to lower the tax rates at the top and deregulate, and the outcome a third of a century later is that 90 percent of you are going to go to the top 10 percent. It is inconceivable that any democratic society would have voted for that package. But it was not sold that way,” he told Justin Sutcliffe in an interview. Under President Clinton the deficits turned into surpluses but Bush operated the “largest turnaround (in the wrong direction ) in the nation’s history.” The ill-prepared war in Iraq would cost trillions of dollars. Bush also offered tax cuts for the rich and money was not used to strengthen the economy but to fill up the bank accounts of the 1 percent. Subsequently, the Obama administration claimed that it prevented the economy from falling into another crisis. However, the growth is still very weak, standard of life for the middle-class has almost reaching the level of 1992. “The recovery was designed by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent,” Stiglitz said. The emergence of the 1 percent and the growth of inequality are linked to the increasing financialization of the world’s economy. The article on the 1 percent is one of the most interesting in the book, and originally published in Vanity Fair. It went viral and eventually led to the publication of “The Price of Inequality.” In an interview with Sutcliffe, Stiglitz, speaking about inequality, said that, “what is depressing is that we have become so slow to recognize it and to begin to put in place policies that might address it even as evidence has accumulated.” In the United States, the top 1 percent owns nearly a quarter of the nation’s income and the average wages of male high-school leavers have dropped by 12 percent in 25 years. Today’s inequality is caused essentially by the financial industry, which implemented new regulations to manipulate the financial system. The government loaned money to financial institutions close to zero percent interest while regulators ignored the lack of transparency and conflicts of interest. Wealth begets power, which in turn begets more wealth. Most of the US senators and the representatives in the House are part of the 1 percent. Wealthy people are mostly not subjected to higher taxes, and furthermore, the rules of economic globalization are designed to give the rich an advantage. With the emergence of the 1 percent, America no longer offers equality of opportunity. Youth unemployment has reached around 20 percent and one out of seven Americans is on food stamps. The argument that inequality is a good thing because if the rich benefit, so does everyone else, is not true. Most Americans have been unable to maintain their standard of living. An average male worker is paid today the same income he received 35 years ago. When there is too much money at the top of society, spending by the average American is automatically reduced. Most of us do not seem to understand this because we associate the wealthy with excessive spending. “But the phenomenon makes sense when you do the math,” explains Stiglitz. “Consider someone like Mitt Romney, whose income in 2010 was $21.7 million. Even if Romney chose to live a much more indulgent lifestyle, he would spend only a fraction of that sum in a typical year to support himself and his wife in their several homes. But take the same amount of money and divide it among 500 people, say, in the form of jobs paying $43,400 apiece, and you’ll find that almost all of the money gets spent,” writes Stiglitz. America is a country that respects money, but Americans no longer trust Wall Street leaders and the world of finance. Banks played with people’s money allocating huge amounts into housing. They lied and misled their clients, giving them false hopes based on gross miscalculations, which turned out to be unaffordable. In the end thousands of people lost their life’s savings and their homes. On the other hand, international companies like Apple Inc., Google Inc., and General Electric Co., whose products are the envy of the rest of the world, are using too much of their inventiveness to avoid paying their share of taxes. They hire the best lawyers who know how to avoid taxes staying within the law. Apple and Google represent the opportunities granted by globalization, but their attitudes regarding tax evasion have clearly shown what is going wrong with that unregulated system. “The Mauritius Miracle” is another excellent article; it has been downloaded a million times! Stiglitz visited this small island situated off the east coast of Africa to understand why it was called the “Mauritius Miracle.” This country has advanced from a sugar-based monoculture 50 years ago to a diversified economy that includes tourism, finance, textiles, and Mauritius is now investing in advanced technology. Most Mauritians own their own homes (87 percent) without causing a housing bubble. Politicians implemented the right policies for their Island. They chose to increase social cohesion, welfare and economic growth. They also decided that military spending was unnecessary and, finally, they realized that without natural resources, Mauritians were their only asset. Mauritius is also characterized by “a strong commitment to democratic institutions and cooperation between workers, government and employers, precisely the opposite of the kind of dissension and division being engendered by conservatives in the US today, ” Stiglitz writes. In this collection of writings, Stiglitz dwells extensively on the increasing financialization of the world’s economy, a major cause of the growth of inequality. He discusses his proposals for establishing a well-functioning market economy that not only creates jobs but also creates increases in income that are shared. With his usual charisma and passion he claims that political and economic inequality is essentially due to unjust policies and it is more than ever a choice that we must not make. • [email protected] Joseph Stiglitz, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics (2001), chief economist of Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers (1995-1997), chief economist at the World Bank (1997-2000) and now professor at Columbia University, developed a social conscience when he was a student at Amherst College.

An average male worker is paid today the same income he received 35 years ago. When there is too much money at the top of society, spending by the average American is automatically reduced. Most of us do not seem to understand this because we associate the wealthy with excessive spending. “But the phenomenon makes sense when you do the math,” explains Stiglitz. “Consider someone like Mitt Romney, whose income in 2010 was $21.7 million. Even if Romney chose to live a much more indulgent lifestyle, he would spend only a fraction of that sum in a typical year to support himself and his wife in their several homes. But take the same amount of money and divide it among 500 people, say, in the form of jobs paying $43,400 apiece, and you’ll find that almost all of the money gets spent,” writes Stiglitz. America is a country that respects money, but Americans no longer trust Wall Street leaders and the world of finance. Banks played with people’s money allocating huge amounts into housing. They lied and misled their clients, giving them false hopes based on gross miscalculations, which turned out to be unaffordable. In the end thousands of people lost their life’s savings and their homes. On the other hand, international companies like Apple Inc., Google Inc., and General Electric Co., whose products are the envy of the rest of the world, are using too much of their inventiveness to avoid paying their share of taxes. They hire the best lawyers who know how to avoid taxes staying within the law. Apple and Google represent the opportunities granted by globalization, but their attitudes regarding tax evasion have clearly shown what is going wrong with that unregulated system. “The Mauritius Miracle” is another excellent article; it has been downloaded a million times! Stiglitz visited this small island situated off the east coast of Africa to understand why it was called the “Mauritius Miracle.” This country has advanced from a sugar-based monoculture 50 years ago to a diversified economy that includes tourism, finance, textiles, and Mauritius is now investing in advanced technology. Most Mauritians own their own homes (87 percent) without causing a housing bubble. Politicians implemented the right policies for their Island. They chose to increase social cohesion, welfare and economic growth. They also decided that military spending was unnecessary and, finally, they realized that without natural resources, Mauritians were their only asset. Mauritius is also characterized by “a strong commitment to democratic institutions and cooperation between workers, government and employers, precisely the opposite of the kind of dissension and division being engendered by conservatives in the US today, ” Stiglitz writes. In this collection of writings, Stiglitz dwells extensively on the increasing financialization of the world’s economy, a major cause of the growth of inequality. He discusses his proposals for establishing a well-functioning market economy that not only creates jobs but also creates increases in income that are shared. With his usual charisma and passion he claims that political and economic inequality is essentially due to unjust policies and it is more than ever a choice that we must not make. • [email protected] Comments View the discussion thread.

If the Central Intelligence Agency disclosures are confirmed to be the work of an intelligence agency contractor, as government investigators currently suspect, it would be at least the third public case in recent years in which special software and human resources programs intended to catch so-called insider threats have not worked. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Thursday accused the CIA of “devastating incompetence” for keeping hacking secrets in one place and said he would work with tech giants to develop fixes after he leaked them. “This is a historic act of devastating incompetence, to have created such an arsenal and then stored it all in one place,” Assange told a press conference streamed live from Ecuador’s embassy in London, where he has been living as a fugitive from justice since 2012. “It is impossible to keep effective control of cyber weapons... If you build them, eventually you will lose them,” Assange said. He said his anti-secrecy website had “a lot more information” about the Central Intelligence Agency’s hacking operation but would hold off on publishing it until WikiLeaks had spoken to tech manufacturers about fixes. “We have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have so fixes can be developed and then pushed out. “Once this material is effectively disarmed by us we will publish additional details about what has been occurring,” he added. Part of the problem in combating leaks is that the number of government employees and contractors with access to highly sensitive information has exploded in recent years, due in part to greater information-sharing across the government that was mandated in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Budget constraints that force agencies to rely on contractors rather than permanent staff have also contributed to the problem, intelligence officials say. Government estimates of how many people have been granted Top Secret clearances range from the high hundreds of thousands to more than a million across thousands of public agencies and private companies. Government agencies estimate that there is one insider threat for every 6,000 to 8,000 employees, an intelligence agency contractor said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting his employer. The contractor said there is too much sharing of information internally, with many workers having access to material they do not need. Two officials speaking on condition of anonymity said intelligence agencies have been aware since the end of last year of the breach, which led to WikiLeaks releasing thousands of pages of information on its website on Tuesday. According to the documents, CIA hackers could get into Apple Inc. iPhones, devices running Google’s Android software and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software. The White House said on Wednesday that President Donald Trump was “extremely concerned” about the CIA security breach that led to the WikiLeaks release. “Anybody who leaks classified information will be held to the highest degree of law,” spokesman Sean Spicer said. The two officials told Reuters they believed the published documents about CIA hacking techniques used between 2013 and 2016 were authentic. One of the officials with knowledge of the investigation said companies that are contractors for the CIA have been checking to see which of their employees had access to the material that WikiLeaks published, and then going over their computer logs, e-mails and other communications for any evidence of who might be responsible. On Tuesday in a press release, WikiLeaks itself said the CIA had “lost control” of an archive of hacking methods and it appeared to have been circulated “among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.” The agency said in a statement that its mission was to collect foreign intelligence abroad “to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries” and to be “innovative, cutting-edge, and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad.” The CIA is legally prohibited from surveillance inside the US and “does not do so,” the statement added. A US government source familiar with the matter said it would be normal for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the CIA both to open investigations into such leaks. US officials previously have confirmed that prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia for years have been conducting a federal grand jury investigation of WikiLeaks and its personnel. US Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and a Democrat on the intelligence committee, said the government needed to stop the breaches. “I think we really need to take a look at the contractor portion of the employee workforce, because you have to be loyal to America to work for an intelligence agency, otherwise don’t do it,” Feinstein said. Both US Senate and US House of Representatives intelligence committees have either opened or are expected to open inquiries into the CIA breach, congressional officials said.

Speaking at a press conference, Assange said that WikiLeaks has "a lot" of unpublished information about CIA hacking and spying that the organization will release if the tech companies fix security gaps, reports CNN. Earlier this week, WikiLeaks published what it claimed were internal CIA documents showing that the agency has an extensive worldwide hacking operation that allows it to infiltrate phones and televisions to spy on people. Assange told reporters that WikiLeaks was offering to share details of the CIA's hacking tools in the name of security and accountability. "We want to secure communications technology because without secure communications technology, journalists are not able to effectively hold the state to account," he said. Shortly after the documents were published, Apple and Google said that they have already eliminated many of the potential vulnerabilities, while Samsung and Microsoft said they were aware of the leaks and looking into them. WikiLeaks has stated the CIA hacking tools were stolen and ended up in the hands of "former U.S. government hackers and contractors," one of whom leaked the documents to the organization.

And it comes with TurboPower™ charger that gives 8 hours of battery life in just 15 mins. Now use your phone better, without giving battery life a second thought. Facebook/Moto If latest reports are to be believed, the Motorola Moto Z 2017 has been spotted in two leaked renders. One of the photos show Moto Z’s front portion showcasing the large screen, the front camera and the front-facing LED flash. The bottom of the screen has the oval fingerprint scanner. Power button and volume rockers are on the right side. According to The Marshalltown, this leaked image could also be that of Moto Z Force or Moto Z Play. The Moto Z 2017 is expected sometime in June as Lenovo released the 2016 Moto Z in that month. The second leaked image reportedly shows the Moto Z 2017 with a moto mod. This mod converts the smartphone into a proper gaming device. Rumours suggest that the device will sport a 4GB or 6GB RAM, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and 128GB of storage space. If the leaked images are really that of Moto Z 2017, then it is quite an impressive looking smartphone. It seems to be having a 5.5-inch QHD Display. One can watch the leaked image of the Moto Z 2017 at Android Guys. Meanwhile, Google Assistant has arrived on a number of Android devices including Moto Z Force Droid and OnePlus 3/3T. Fans believe it may also come to Apple iPhones. Google Assistant is more conversational than Google Now. Google Assistant has a more personal touch, even though it handles, many of the same tasks as Google always has. According to PhoneArena, activating the Google Assistant is as easy as saying “OK Google.” Users can also press the Home Button to activate it. The virtual assistant can also be found on the Allo messaging app, Google Home, certain Android Wear smart watches and on Android Auto. Users will understand the difference between Google Assistant and Google Now when they ask follow-up questions. Any Android phone having Android 6.0 or higher will receive the Google Assistant update. Around 500 million Android phones are currently receiving the update. Moto Z Force Droid, OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T have already received the update. Apple fans may be a bit disappointed as Management Director for Google, Gummi Hafsteinsson, revealed during the MWC 2017 that there are no plans of bringing the Google Assistant to iOS devices. However, Google had previously revealed plans of bringing its virtual assistant to as many devices as possible. This means Google Assistant may come to iOS devices after all, reports MobiPicker.

The South Korean tech firm, which has been in India for 21 years, is fighting back from a tough year in 2016. While it remains a market leader in India, the company saw its market share in the smartphone category drop against aggressive Chinese competitors, such as Oppo. Its smartphone flagship Note 7 was recalled globally, then the company's heir Jay Y. Lee was ensnared in an ongoing corruption scandal engulfing South Korea's government. He is now facing trial in one of the country's most high profile cases ever. But despite the upheaval for Samsung outside of India, on the subcontinent senior executives are more optimistic: the evolution in marketing strategy, alongside agency partner Cheil India, had started before last year’s troubles and so far has been successful. (For more about how Samsung has sought to localise its Indian marketing strategy, read Warc's report: How Apple and Facebook misread India, but Samsung and Vivo got it right.) "In the subcontinent region if Samsung can be seen more as an Indian brand, that is really where we are headed," said Ranjivjit Singh, SVP for Corporate Marketing and CMO at Samsung India Electronics in comments to Advertising Age. Part of the strategy involves advertising which focuses on storytelling and takes a more emotional approach, a popular move in India, compared to the product specific advertising commonly seen in other Asian markets. "We've been writing stories to connect with Indian consumers, in a very Indian way," said Sagar Mahabaleshwarkar, Cheil India's Chief Creative Officer. Ads focusing on new features are likely to remain, he said, but Samsung is "concentrating on technology that's more meaningful to consumers".

Tony Cardenas, D-Calif., left, and Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Calif., pause Thursday as members of the committee argue the details of the GOP’s “Obamacare” replacement bill after working all night. (Photo: AP) 121 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — It’s time to put an end to the myth that Republicans believe in fiscal responsibility. Saving taxpayer dollars takes a back seat to the ideological imperative of blaming and shaming the poor. Witness the GOP’s long-awaited plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. House committees are moving forward on the legislation before the Congressional Budget Office has even had a chance to estimate how much the measure will cost. Why the rush? Because if the plan doesn’t snatch away health insurance coverage from millions of people — and both President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan swear it won’t — then it’s surely going to cost a ton. The Republican plan would take away the ACA’s subsidies and replace them with refundable tax credits based on age, not income. This means a windfall for those who are older and well-to-do. In essence, the plan would expand government assistance to encompass many who don’t really need it — in order to avoid targeting help toward those who do. The GOP plan would also eliminate the ACA’s penalty fee for not having health insurance, which goes into the public till — and replace it with a different penalty fee that goes to the insurance companies. Apparently Republicans have no problem committing what they once called “extortion” if the benefit goes to private companies, not the common good. Keep in mind that Trump and GOP leaders in Congress promise that after dealing with health care they will seek huge tax cuts, including for the wealthy. As fiscal policy, how does this make sense? It doesn’t. It only makes sense as ideology. In today’s Republican Party, policies have to satisfy the belief that the less fortunate are poor by choice. Rarely do Republicans just come out and accuse the poor of being lazy freeloaders, but Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, came close. He suggested that “rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care.” The priciest iPhone advertised on Apple’s website is a 7 Plus model with 256 gigabytes of storage and all the bells and whistles. It costs $969. If Chaffetz will cancel the cushy health insurance plan he is provided as a member of the House, I will write him a check for that amount — and wish him the best of luck providing health care for his family. Maybe he’ll be able to pay for a single visit to the emergency room. It would be one thing if the GOP’s mean-spirited ideology actually saved money, but it doesn’t. Quite the contrary, in fact. When you ask Republicans what they’re going to cut, they mention foreign aid — which totals about $35 billion, or slightly less than 1 percent of federal spending. They threaten to eviscerate smaller agencies by cutting $6 billion here or $8 billion there — but at the same time, they applaud Trump’s pledge to increase the $600 billion defense budget by an incredible 10 percent. They’re going to end up spending more — perhaps lots more — and collecting less in tax revenue. And this is the party that claims to care about deficits and debt? But wait, Republicans say, we’re going to “save” the big entitlement programs by trimming benefits. Yeah, sure. I’m not holding my breath. The problem is that Medicare and Social Security serve middle-class and upper-crust taxpayers, including many who share the GOP’s punish-the-poor belief system. If you think these ACA-focused town halls are hostile, just you wait. The fact is that among recent administrations, at least, Democratic presidents have been the relative skinflints. Bill Clinton, you will recall, actually balanced the budget — and yes, he had help from Republicans in Congress. Barack Obama spent heavily at first to save the economy, which was teetering on the edge of a dreadful abyss, but he ended up slashing the deficit in half and presiding over years of uninterrupted economic growth. George W. Bush, on the other hand, fought hugely expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq without accounting for them in his budgets. He also convinced Congress to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs, which was compassionate but costly. Trump promises to be even more of a big spender. Among other things, he promises a trillion-dollar program to renew the nation’s infrastructure. Imagine the Republican howling if Obama had suggested such a thing. The GOP will surely persist in its sanctimony about balanced budgets, but no one should pay any attention. Republicans, we see what you’re doing.

Source: NV Energy NV Energy has filed for approval from the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) for a new voluntary subscription solar pricing programme that would offer non-subscribing customers a way to purchase renewable resources that cost less than rooftop solar. Nevada’s monopoly utility made the filing on Tuesday. The programme, if approved, would allow customers to subscribe each month to at least 100kWh blocks of solar energy generated within the state, and would not be required to commit for a long term. It would first be offered to residential customers and soon after would add in commercial customers ineligible for the NV GreenEnergy Rider (NGR) programme. Projections peg each block of power at US$2 dollars, which would render the programme one of the lowest-cost options for power in the country, according to NV Energy. However this charge would be in addition to a customer’s monthly bill. Starting off, the programme's initial capacity is around 7.33MW coming from power generated by Boulder Solar I, which has set aside 10MW for the programme, as well as the Techren II facility, which is a joint venture with Apple. The latter has set aside 5MW for the programme and will be online by 2019. The motivation for the programme was to offer a voluntary subscription service option for residential and small C&I customers, as none currently exists. The utility also stressed in the filing that it would give such customers “affordable and flexible new choice to help meet their individual energy related environmental goals”. “This programme is specifically designed for customers who may not have access to a rooftop, but who would like a low-cost, renewable energy option or for those whom building their own rooftop system isn’t a great option,” said Pat Egan, NV Energy senior vice president of renewable energy and smart infrastructure to the Reno-Gazette Journal. The idea is that it will not only provide customers with more energy choices, but also attract new customers. The programme allows for customers to be up to 100% green with no long term commitment and no major investment required. This caters to those who might not be able to raise the initial upfront cost that rooftop solar requires, or those that might not have a suitable roof. If approved by the PUC, the programme will be on offer first for Nevada Power customers and then for Sierra Power customers. Regulators have up to 210 days from the date of filing to make a decision on the proposal.  Tags: us, usa, nevada, nv energy, utility, public utilities commission, puc, rooftop solar, residential, commercial, finance Also read...

After months of irrelevant banter and confusing rhetoric, someone is ready to lead. Different organizations have attempted to gain control of OWS, but now the destiny of the movement is clear. A voice for Occupy Wall Street has stepped up. It’s time is now. Ladies and gentlemen … Miley Cyrus. Yes, Miley Cyrus has offered her support for Occupy Wall Street. This week on her website, the social conscience of a generation released a video “dedicated to the thousands of people who are standing up for what they believe in.” The video posted by Cyrus edits Occupy Wall Street video clips over her song “Liberty Walk” from the CD “Can’t be Tamed” — available at Best Buy (NYSE-BBY) for $9.99. Someone needs to take Miley aside and explain to her that the only reason she is relevant is because she made a shitload of Wall Street dough off the “Hannah Montana” franchise, a fictitious corporate nom de plume created for her by Disney (NYSE-DIS). Without The Mouse’s creation of Hannah Montana — movie available at Target (AMEX-TDTF) for $8.19 — Miley Cyrus would be covering “Achy Breaky Heart” in the lobby of the Hampton Inn (NYSE-HIL) in Ashland, Kentucky. I have no particular animosity towards Miss Cyrus. Last week at her nineteenth birthday party she admitted to being a “stoner.” This was following an earlier video of her smoking “legal” pot from a glass bong. For those of us who went to college in the ’70s — a generation one toke away from being an entire graduating class of Lindsay Lohans — her smoking habit is almost endearing. Miley Cyrus’s support for Occupy Wall Street points out the absurdity of the entire protest. Back in June, M Magazine declared Miley Cyrus to be the richest teen in the world and placed her personal wealth at $120,000,000.00. That’s a lot of zeros for someone who wants to show support for people who hate greed. Don’t blame Miley Cyrus for the hypocrisy of OWS. Just peruse the pictures from the various OWS locations. Participants in the Wall Street bash-a-thon are drinking Starbucks (NASDAQ-SBUX) coffee, talking on their Apple (NASDAQ-AAPL) iPhones and browsing the Internet on their Hewlett Packard (NYSE-HPQ) laptops. The fact of the matter is the Occupiers — just like Miley Cyrus — are addicted to corporate America. The irony of people protesting greed while drinking $5.00 cups of coffee is priceless. The great philosopher, Pogo, once said, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” Of course, after he said that, Pogo was fired and is now living in a tent in Zuccotti Park. The thought that protesters support the very system they despise must send a chill right through their North Face (NYSE-VFC) jackets and Ugg boots (NASDAQ-GS). Somewhere in Seattle, Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, is looking at a picture of a protester drinking a cup of his coffee and laughing his ass off.

Here's what investors need to know now. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Mar 9, 2017 at 5:07PM What happened Shares of Universal Display Corporation (NASDAQ:OLED) jumped 28.6% in the month of February, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after the OLED specialist announced strong fourth-quarter 2016 results and encouraging guidance. So what Revenue for the quarter grew 19.7% year over year, to $74.6 million, and it resulted in a 42.7% increase in net income to 25.8 million. Net income per share also climbed 41%, to $0.55. By comparison, Wall Street was looking for revenue of just $68.6 million, and earnings of $0.42 per share. IMAGE SOURCE: UNIVERSAL DISPLAY. Universal Display's growth was driven by a combination of higher OLED material sales (up 5%, to $29.2 million), an increase in royalty and license fees (up 27%, to $43.6 million), and $1.8 million in contract research services revenue from its acquisition of Adesis last year. But more importantly -- and just as Universal Display management suggested last August -- the company finally saw customers commence adoption of its next-generation phosphorescent OLED emitter products. The company also made a $15 million investment in a Barberton, Ohio, manufacturing plant owned by PPG Industries, which should double commercial production capacity for its emitters. Now what Universal Display also told investors to expect full-year 2017 revenue to be in the range of $230 million to $250 million, or up 15.6% to 25.7% from 2016. That includes a $15 million license fee increase under Universal Display's long-term deal with Samsung Display, and -- if recent supply chain reports prove accurate -- the continued adoption of its flagship materials by other technology behemoths, including Apple. Of course, Universal Display was quick to note that the OLED industry is still in its early stages, so there are many variables that could temporarily stifle that growth. But as the company's technology becomes more ubiquitous with each passing day, it's no surprise to see Universal Display stock trading near all-time highs right now.

Will it overtake PayPal? John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Mar 9, 2017 at 6:06PM Mobile payments is growing 33% per year. IMAGE SOURCE:    Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently announced that its Pay with Amazon payment volume nearly doubled in 2016. The online retailer has seen a boost in its momentum after expanding its payments service into France, Italy, and Spain, as well as other markets like government payments, travel, and digital goods, among others. The company reported that more than 33 million customers have used Amazon Payments to make a purchase. Amazon payments' strengths and weaknesses One advantage of using Amazon's payment service is that it uses payment information already stored by many of Amazon.com's 300 million customers. In addition, since Amazon customers are already accustomed to shopping online or on mobile, merchants could see Amazon as a very beneficial partner. On the other hand, merchants may see Amazon as a threat. Some merchants may be concerned about Amazon gaining access to customer spending patterns. However, like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), it's in Amazon's interest to spread its brand ubiquity, not to risk its business reputation by a significant breach of trust with business partners. Another advantage for Amazon is the incentives the company could offer customers to use Amazon Payments in the future. Amazon revealed that more than 50% of Pay with Amazon customers are Prime members. Knowing Amazon's relentless focus on steadily delivering new features and deals to its Prime customers, Amazon could offer special discounts to Prime members for using Amazon payments. PayPal's competitive advantage Despite these apparent advantages, Amazon has been rather quiet about its payments service. This could reflect Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos' policy to keep quiet about all investments within the company to prevent prowling competitors from knowing too much. But it could also reflect other competing investments within the company. Payments is not mentioned much on earnings conference calls by either analysts or management. Amazon is spending billions expanding its distribution infrastructure, blanketing the U.S. with its massive fulfillment centers, and expanding around the world, especially in India. There are also other projects like drone delivery, Prime video content, Amazon bookstores, and Amazon Web Services. Amazon has a lot going on, whereas PayPal is purely focused on payment solutions. While Amazon Payments is still not offered by many large retailers, PayPal has been quickly signing partnerships with credit card companies and banks to spread its payments service to as many point-of-sale locations as possible. PayPal also has a first-mover advantage over Amazon. The company has signed up 200 million customer accounts as opposed to Amazon's 33 million who have used Pay with Amazon. The size and momentum of PayPal's business gives it a tremendous advantage over Amazon payments. One validation of PayPal's advantage is CEO Dan Schulman's recent disclosure that his company and Amazon have been in discussions about a potential partnership. This not only points to PayPal's strong position in the payments market, but it also reveals that payments is not Amazon's main focus. PayPal and Amazon will probably play nice At the heart of Amazon's business strategy is its drive to be customer-centric, and this puts Amazon in a tough spot. Amazon is trying to grow its payments service, but at the same time, Amazon management must recognize that there are customers who would like to pay with PayPal instead of storing payment information on Amazon. Most of these customers are likely not Amazon Prime customers, which have made up most of Amazon's payment volume. Prime customers are very locked in to the Amazon ecosystem and are likely comfortable with stored payment information on Amazon as a result. The value PayPal brings to Amazon is a way to expand Amazon's reach to non-Prime customers. For all of the awesome growth of Amazon's business over the last 20 years, e-commerce still makes up less than 10% of retail sales in the U.S. alone. There are still millions of people in the U.S. who haven't signed up for Prime yet, or who have hardly shopped on Amazon. Offering PayPal as a checkout option would probably not matter much to Amazon's growth. It would likely benefit PayPal more than Amazon, which is why a deal may not come to fruition. Still, Amazon's core business is retail, not payments. In the end, Amazon is more interested in selling whatever its customers want to buy, and that could mean seeing PayPal more as a partner, as opposed to a rival. An example of this strategy already in practice is Apple. PayPal competes with Apple Pay, but at the same time, Apple offers PayPal as a payment option in iTunes. There is a huge market opportunity for all payment providers Trying to understand why these companies are partnering while simultaneously competing with each other can be confusing. One answer is to remember the size of the market opportunity for these companies. PayPal management puts the market opportunity at $100 trillion. Think about that for a second. I don't think I've ever heard of a market opportunity approaching anything close to that by any other company. The payments market is a wide-open space with plenty of room for several competing services to grow for a long time. John Ballard owns shares of PayPal Holdings.

Saving taxpayer dollars takes a back seat to the ideological imperative of blaming and shaming the poor. Witness the GOP’s long-awaited plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. House committees are moving forward on the legislation before the Congressional Budget Office has even had a chance to estimate how much the measure will cost. Why the rush? Because if the plan doesn’t snatch away health insurance coverage from millions of people — and both President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan swear it won’t — then it’s surely going to cost a ton. __________ Overpromises leave GOP in a fix on health care A look at the opposing sides on the GOP health care bill Industry groups oppose GOP health bill, Ryan seeks unity __________ The Republican plan would take away the law’s subsidies and replace them with refundable tax credits based on age, not income. This means a windfall for those who are older and well-to-do. In essence, the plan would expand government assistance to encompass many who don’t really need it — in order to avoid targeting help toward those who do. The GOP plan would also eliminate the penalty fee for not having health insurance, which goes into the public till — and replace it with a different penalty fee that goes to the insurance companies. Apparently Republicans have no problem committing what they once called “extortion” if the benefit goes to private companies, just not the common good. Keep in mind that Trump and GOP leaders in Congress promise that after dealing with health care they will seek huge tax cuts, including for the wealthy. As fiscal policy, this doesn’t make sense. In today’s Republican Party, policies have to satisfy the belief that the less fortunate are poor by choice. It only makes sense as ideology. In today’s Republican Party, policies have to satisfy the belief that the less fortunate are poor by choice. Rarely do Republicans just come out and accuse the poor of being lazy freeloaders, but Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, came close. He suggested that “rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest in their own health care.” The priciest iPhone advertised on Apple’s website costs $969. If Chaffetz will cancel the cushy health insurance plan he is provided as a member of the House, I will write him a check for that amount — and wish him the best of luck providing health care for his family. Maybe he’ll be able to pay for a single visit to the emergency room. It would be one thing if the GOP’s mean-spirited ideology actually saved money, but it doesn’t. Quite the contrary, in fact. Imagine the Republican howling if Obama had suggested such a thing. When you ask Republicans what they’re going to cut, they mention foreign aid — which totals about $35 billion, or slightly less than 1 percent of federal spending. They threaten to eviscerate smaller agencies by cutting $6 billion here or $8 billion there — but at the same time, they applaud Trump’s pledge to increase the $600 billion defense budget by an incredible 10 percent. And this is the party that claims to care about deficits and debt? But wait, Republicans say, we’re going to “save” the big entitlement programs by trimming benefits.I’m not holding my breath. The problem is that Medicare and Social Security serve middle-class and upper-crust taxpayers, including many who share the GOP’s punish-the-poor belief system. If you think these Obamacare-focused town halls are hostile, just you wait. The fact is that among recent administrations, at least, Democratic presidents have been the relative skinflints. Bill Clinton, you will recall, actually balanced the budget — and yes, he had help from Republicans in Congress. Barack Obama spent heavily at first to save the economy, which was teetering on the edge of a dreadful abyss, but he ended up slashing the deficit in half and presiding over years of uninterrupted economic growth. George W. Bush, on the other hand, fought hugely expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq without accounting for them in his budgets. He also convinced Congress to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs, which was compassionate but costly. Trump promises to be even more of a big spender. Among other things, he promises a trillion-dollar program to renew the nation’s infrastructure. Imagine the Republican howling if Obama had suggested such a thing. The GOP will surely persist in its sanctimony about balanced budgets, but no one should pay any attention. Republicans, we see what you’re doing. Contact Mr. Robinson at eugenerobinson@washpost.com.

Hours after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange accused the Central Intelligence Agency of “devastating incompetence” for failing to protect its hacking secrets, Trump’s spokesman echoed that, branding its systems “outdated.” Trump has “grave concern... about the release of national security and classified information that threatens and undermines our nation’s security,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. “He believes that the systems at the CIA are outdated and need to be updated.” The White House terminology was milder than earlier this year when the president blasted US intelligence agencies over media leaks, and accused them of playing politics with their findings on Russian interference in last year’s election. But it added new pressure on the CIA and its incoming chief, Mike Pompeo, as US intelligence agencies continue to suffer losses of top secret materials—most famously with Edward Snowden’s 2013 exposure of NSA spying. Assange: CIA was ‘careless’ On Tuesday, WikiLeaks published nearly 9,000 documents it said were only part of a huge trove leaked from the CIA.  WikiLeaks said the leaked archive represented the CIA’s entire arsenal of cyber-attack plans, guides and malware programs—though it held back the programs themselves from release. “This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA,” it said. yesterday Assange gave a press conference on the leak, which again put the crusading anti-secrets group in the midst of US politics. Speaking via streaming video from Ecuador’s embassy in London, where he has been living as a fugitive from justice since 2012, he waved off criticism of WikiLeaks while blasting the CIA for its poor controls. “This is a historic act of devastating incompetence, to have created such an arsenal and then stored it all in one place,” Assange said. “It is impossible to keep effective control of cyber weapons... If you build them, eventually you will lose them.” The documents show that, using a tool chest of malware like viruses and trojans, CIA hackers can turn a TV into a listening device, bypass popular encryption apps, and possibly control people’s cars. Assange called the CIA “careless” for losing control of its cyber weaponry, which WikiLeaks suggested had reached it via private contractors that the US agency hires to develop hacking tools. He said it might already have circulated into the hands of criminals and US enemies. “It’s quite possible numerous people already might have it,” Assange said. He claimed that WikiLeaks possesses “a lot more information” about the CIA’s hacking, but would refrain from publishing it until it can speak to tech manufacturers affected. Much of the agency’s cyber operations focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in popular networking equipment, consumer electronics, and software, including Apple’s iPhones and smartphones running the Android operating system. “We have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have so fixes can be developed and then pushed out,” Assange said. “Once this material is effectively disarmed by us we will publish additional details about what has been occurring.” CIA questions Assange ‘integrity’ The CIA defended itself while criticising the WikiLeaks founder.  “As we’ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,” said spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak. “Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries.” She reiterated that cyber operations are an integral part of the CIA’s job, rebuffing Assange’s suggestion that the agency had quietly gone into competition with the main US signals intelligence body, the National Security Agency. Hacking is a normal part of its mission “to be innovative, cutting-edge, and the first line of defence in protecting this country from enemies abroad,” Horniak said. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week British foreign minister to visit Russia to discuss differences Trump to speak at conservative forum, as some question his immigration, trade views French teen school shooter tackled by 'hero' teacher (VIDEO) Iraqi forces besiege Islamic State around Mosul Old City Children among hundreds of Rohingya detained in Myanmar crackdown Trump to speak at conservative forum, as some question his immigration, trade views British foreign minister to visit Russia to discuss differences Indonesian Buddhists caned under Shariah law for first time Thai police end search of temple without finding monk Headphone batteries explode on flight to Australia Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Related Articles Top senators: No evidence Trump Tower bugged by Obama Former Trump aide Flynn paid over US$55,000 by Russian entities Why the Whitney’s humanist, pro-diversity biennial is a revelation Iraqi forces besiege Islamic State around Mosul Old City Trump’s impact in Asean — Tunku Zain Al-‘Abidin Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Name: Subject: Message: Google gets permission to build its cool “tent” campus Newsby John Callaham1 week ago 2 412 8 Last week, we got a chance to see some of Google’s revised proposals for its new campus, which included a tent-like main building. This week, the company received final approval from the City of Mountain View, California to build its campus, with the official groundbreaking set to happen sometime in April. See also: Google is acquiring data science company Kaggle 1 week ago According to Business Insider, the new campus will be the first time that Google will actually build a structure on its own, rather than occupy buildings that were already made. The official name for the tent building itself is Charleston East, although we predict the company might come up with a cooler name than that when it gets closer to completion. When finished, the two-story structure will cover about 595,000 square feet. The tent has been designed so that it can regulate the climate inside the building. It is also not supposed to be too loud inside, which will be good for what will likely be the massive amount of Google employees that will occupy the offices. Construction of this unique looking building is expected to take about two years, which means that it should be finished sometime in 2019. Google’s tent campus will be competing, at least in terms of the coolness factor, with Apple’s new “space ship” campus in nearby Cupertino, California, called Apple Park. The first employees are expected to start moving in sometime in April, with the final construction slated to end later this year. What do you think of Google’s tent building? Is it cool looking or does the design not work for you? Let us know what you think in the comments!

This is not the outrageous domestic mass surveillance by the National Security Agency revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013. The CIA is not legally allowed to operate within the U.S., and the FBI would have to get legal authorization to use these hacking tools against U.S. citizens. Still, to make sure the CIA isn’t overstepping, it would be worth a congressional inquiry. While it’s no secret that the CIA will use any means to gather intelligence, this is apparently the largest leak of its files in history. The documents suggest the agency has amassed more than 1,000 viruses and other hacking tools to get into smartphones, messaging apps and even Samsung smart televisions to collect text and voice messages before they are encrypted. Unlike Snowden, WikiLeaks didn’t include examples of how people were targeted, which lessens the damage to national security. The anti-secrecy site also didn’t disclose actual hacking tools. But WikiLeaks did assert that the CIA purposely didn’t warn Apple, Google, Microsoft and other companies about the vulnerabilities in their products, which would undercut a pledge by President Obama to do so. Tech companies have to scramble to reassure customers. The CIA needs to do its own reassurance — that it has control of its hacking arsenal. A federal investigation is being launched to find the source of the leak. Given the history of WikiLeaks releasing embarrassing Democratic e-mails during the campaign, the timing of this leak is interesting. President Trump has warred with the CIA, which says that Russian agents gave those e-mails to WikiLeaks to help him. Trump partisans are already using the leak to attack the agency, focusing on one section that says the CIA can impersonate Russian hackers. Whatever the fallout from this massive leak, it should be another big red flag: In the digital age, you have to work and live as if your electronic trail might be seen by someone else. As FBI Director James Comey said Wednesday, “There is no such thing as absolute privacy in America.” FROM AN EDITORIAL IN THE SACRAMENTO BEE View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It all began in 1969 in San Francisco, where Brilliant had come for an internship after medical school and volunteered to work at the recently closed federal prison on Alcatraz Island, which was occupied by a group of about 100 Native American protesters. That stint got him on the evening news. DR. LARRY BRILLIANT: Somebody from Warner Brothers saw me on television, and they called me the next day and they said, we’re starting a movie in two or three days. We’re going to be gathering at the same place I got off the boat, and it’s going to be a movie about hippies and rock ‘n’ roll. It’s going to have the Grateful Dead and the Jefferson Airplane and Pink Floyd. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He joined the crew as a doctor, the film was a flop, but Brilliant became friends with some of the era’s iconic figures. MAN: What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400,000. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They included the Woodstock emcee who became famous in clown costume as Wavy Gravy. DR. LARRY BRILLIANT: This is Wavy Gravy. MAN: I am so honored to meet you. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: At 80, he’s slowed only physically. The friends still gather often and recount their adventures, including a journey across Europe toward India. They had planned to feed flood victims in what was then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. WAVY GRAVY, Entertainer: And the idea was that we had so much media from doing the free kitchen at Woodstock, that if we got there and started feeding people, that it would embarrass the government: My God, there’s hippies doing it. We better do it better! FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For Larry Brilliant and his wife, Girija, this was a transformative journey. They became disciples of a spiritual leader or guru, Neem Karoli Baba. Were you able to converse with him in Hindi? DR. LARRY BRILLIANT: Yes. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Hindi was a big asset for the assignment the guru gave him: to help eradicate small pox in India and Bangladesh, which were among last holdouts for the virus that had killed half-a-billion people through history. DR. LARRY BRILLIANT: Bad disease. Most people thought it could never be eradicated. We had had a vaccine for 200 years, and what we were doing is we were vaccinating everybody. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That strategy worked in the West and developed countries, but could never work in India, he says, with a population then of 600 million people, some 20 million of whom were on a bus or train on any given day. The hippie doctor coaxed his way into the World Health Organization team that took a different approach: tracking down every single infected person and vaccinating everyone around them, creating a so-called ring of immunity, so the virus couldn’t spread. It was a Herculean task. DR. LARRY BRILLIANT: We had to visit every house in India every month for 20 months. We made two billion house calls, 150,000 people, doctors from 170 countries. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Smallpox became the first disease ever eradicated from the planet. Brilliant went on to become a leading expert on infectious disease, a consultant to the White House most recently when Ebola threatened to escalate. MAN: What is it going to take to prevent an outbreak? FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Today, Larry Brilliant heads a group called the Skoll Global Threats Fund, which focuses on issues like climate change, nuclear proliferation, and pandemics. It is an affiliate of the Skoll Foundation, which also helps fund the NewsHour. MAN: It’s about detect and report. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: These epidemiologists are setting up pilot studies to gather data in 28 countries, trying to determine early patterns of how a disease breaks out. DR. LARRY BRILLIANT: Wouldn’t you like to create advisory panels and partnerships with tech companies, major universities, epi departments? FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Brilliant has raised millions of philanthropic dollars for other efforts that include the Seva Foundation, an eye care charity now in several countries that he started with Wavy Gravy. After the smallpox campaign, Larry Brilliant began forging ties in Silicon Valley, where he’s been a kind of guru to many tech industry leaders, including the late Apple founder, Steve Jobs. The two men met in the ’70s here in India, where both had come seeking spiritual harbor. DR. LARRY BRILLIANT: We have Shiva and Krishna to welcome you. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The Brilliants’ California home is replete with symbols that reflect an embrace of all major religions. DR. LARRY BRILLIANT: When I was with Neem Karoli Baba, he would always say sab ek, all one. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That was the spirit of the ’60s and ’70s, he writes, when beautiful flowers blossomed alongside vicious weeds, an era that was neither all Martin Luther King nor all Charles Manson. For the PBS NewsHour, this is Fred de Sam Lazaro, in Mill Valley, California. HARI SREENIVASAN: Fred’s reporting is part of the Under-Told Stories Project at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota.

By Ellen Nakashima, Elizabeth Dwoskin and Devlin Barrett Washington Post  March 10, 2017 WASHINGTON — WikiLeaks will release to tech firms the software code of CIA hacking tools that were designed to compromise smartphones and other products, the group’s founder said Thursday, attempting to position himself as a defender of cyber security and probably further antagonizing the intelligence community. “We have decided to work with [the firms],” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said at a news conference, “to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have so that fixes can be developed and pushed out, so that people can be secured.” Advertisement Once the patches are sent out — or, as Assange put it, ‘‘once this material is effectively disarmed by us’’ — WikiLeaks will release more details publicly, he said. Assange’s remarks come two days after the radical transparency site put up a cache of files describing secret CIA hacking techniques and tools aimed at, for example, seizing control of iPhones and Google’s Android phones, turning some Samsung television sets into bugging devices, and getting data from devices not connected to the Internet. The release stopped short of releasing the code itself. Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays.

Sign up for more newsletters here The CIA continues to have no comment on the authenticity of the documents released, which WikiLeaks said is the first tranche of more to come. Independent experts have said the files appear to describe authentic ‘‘exploits,’’ or tools that hackers can use to penetrate a device, but many of them are dated and appear to have already been patched by tech firms. And researchers said they have been long aware of a number of the techniques. A CIA spokesman, Jonathan Liu, suggested that WikiLeaks’ pronouncements of the scale and impact of its Tuesday ‘‘Vault 7’’ release are exaggerated. ‘‘As we’ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,’’ Liu said. ‘‘Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states, and other adversaries.’’ US laws and policies bar the CIA from conducting electronic surveillance of individuals on US soil. ‘‘And CIA does not do so,’’ Liu said. Advertisement Within the CIA, officials were aware before the WikiLeaks release of a loss of sensitive data, according to people familiar with the matter. The CIA’s internal security personnel, who apparently had not told the FBI, were pursuing the matter, but the scope and severity of the problem was unclear until WikiLeaks posted online the roughly 9,000 documents on Tuesday, these individuals said. An immediate challenge for FBI investigators hunting for a possible mole is to pare down a list of suspects from the pool of people who had access to the information leaked — a challenging task, given that hundreds and potentially thousands of people had access to the data. After Assange’s news conference Thursday, tech companies deliberated the consequences of taking data from WikiLeaks, according to a person familiar with the discussions. They considered the legal implications of using information from documents obtained illegally and the political fallout from doing so. They questioned whether Assange was attempting to further drive a wedge between the technology industry and the US government. Some national security experts wondered why WikiLeaks had not already shared the software flaws. ‘‘If WikiLeaks were really concerned about user security, they could’ve handed these vulnerabilities over to vendors immediately upon receiving this archive,’’ said Adam Klein, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and an expert on national security and digital surveillance. ‘‘But we know they’ve had it for some time and haven’t done so.’’ And Alex Rice, chief executive of HackerOne, the startup that enlists hackers to share security flaws with tech companies for a profit, said, ‘‘This is a critical step that WikiLeaks should have taken immediately upon receipt of such information.’’ But others praised WikiLeaks’s vow to share data with tech companies. ‘‘It’s incredibly good news’’ for personal cyber security, said Nathan White, senior legislative manager for Access Now, a digital rights group. He noted how WikiLeaks also stands to gain from the move, since it has been criticized for publishing information without vetting it for privacy and security in the past. Apple declined to comment on Assange’s statements. The company said earlier this week that ‘‘many’’ of the vulnerabilities identified in the WikiLeaks documents had already been patched, and encouraged customers to download the most recent security update. Roughly 80 percent of customers using Apple’s iOS software have downloaded the latest update, the company said. Google declined to comment. The CIA dismissed any suggestion that WikiLeaks’ release served the interests of privacy and security. ‘‘The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the intelligence community’s ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries,’’ Liu said. ‘‘Such disclosures not only jeopardize US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm.’’ Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican and a Judiciary Committee member, on Thursday sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the issue. He asked if the Justice Department believed that Assange broke the law by releasing the CIA materials. Sasse said he looked forward to a ‘‘prompt response.’’ Loading comments...
