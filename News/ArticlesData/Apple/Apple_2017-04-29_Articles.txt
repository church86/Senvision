The world’s largest publicly-traded technology company and one of the main suppliers of components to the iPhone, its most important product, have traded accusations of lying, making threats and trying to create an illegal monopoly. The fight involves billions of dollars of technology licensing revenue that, if permanently cut off or reduced, would damage Qualcomm’s main source of profit and help bolster Apple’s margins. Apple told Qualcomm it will stop paying licensing revenue to contract manufacturers of the iPhone, the mechanism by which it’s paid the chipmaker since the best-selling smartphone debuted in 2007, the San Diego, California-based company said in a statement. Qualcomm removed any assumption it will get those fees from its forecast for the current period. Apple doesn’t have a direct license with Qualcomm, unlike other phone makers. “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,” Apple said in a statement. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court. As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own.” Qualcomm said revenue in its fiscal third quarter ending June will be $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion, down from last week’s prediction of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. It’s also short of the $5.78 billion average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share will range between 52 cents and 62 cents, compared with the earlier forecast of 67 cents to 92 cents. Minus certain items, profit per share will be 75 cents to 85 cents. For Qualcomm, Apple’s move is a further infringement on its legal agreements with the contract makers of the iPhone, who also make devices for other companies. Those agreements predate Apple’s entry into the phone market and are still legally enforceable. “While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade.” He said Apple’s interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to other parties is wrongful and part of the Cupertino, California-based company’s global attack on Qualcomm. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said Qualcomm’s largest customer has declared “all-out war,” leaving a dark cloud over earnings and its stock price. “Even if one believed this was a worst case scenario, we struggle to see a resolution anytime soon as the parties entrench,” Rasgon wrote in a note to investors Friday. Qualcomm managed expectations around the dispute poorly, he added. Shares fell as much as 4.1 percent to $51.05 Friday morning. It was the lowest intraday price since June. They were trading at $52.91 at 12:16 p.m. in New York. Apple stock edged 0.2 percent higher to $144.12, close to a record. Qualcomm’s lucrative licensing division funds an industry-leading research-and-development budget, which has helped its chips stay ahead of rivals. That strategy, which has helped the company more than double revenue since 2010, is under threat as the dispute with Apple worsens and it deals with regulatory investigations in the U.S., South Korea, Taiwan and Europe. It says Apple instigated those investigations by making false claims to government agencies. Apple’s end goal is to lower the fees, Qualcomm said. When it began it’s suit against Qualcomm in January, Apple accused Qualcomm of monopolizing the market for chips used in wireless devices and withholding $1 billion in retaliation for cooperating with South Korean antitrust authorities. Apple also said it wants back some of the billions of dollars it claims it was overcharged in “Qualcomm’s illegal scheme” to control the market for mobile phone chips. It wants a court to change how Qualcomm charges for its technology. Patents controlled by Qualcomm cover the basics of all high-speed data capable mobile phone systems. It charges a percentage of the total selling price of the phone regardless of whether the device uses a Qualcomm chip or not. Qualcomm had given a wider-than-normal forecast range for the current quarter, reflecting the possibility that Apple may pressure its suppliers, company President Derek Aberle said last week. “We’d expect that they will pay, consistent with their obligations,” he said at the time. “We can’t completely discount the possibility that Apple will continue to interfere and cause them to pay less than they owe.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email In this article: Apple IncQualcomm Inc.

According to the latest report published by IDC, the combined smartphone shipments by the three Chinese firms increased by 15.5 million units on-year to 77.9 million units in the first quarter. During the same period, Samsung and Apple remained essentially flat with shipments reaching 79.2 million units and 51.6 million units, respectively. The combined market share of the three Chinese firms increased by 3.7 percentage points on-year to 22.4 percent in the January-March period, while Samsung and Apple’s share dropped by 1 percentage point and 0.5 percent point to 22.8 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively. IDC said the clear winners in the global smartphone market were currently Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo, which have all outpaced market growth for over a year. The Oppo booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain Shin Ji-hye/The Korea Herald “Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets” said Anthony Scarsella, research manager with IDC’s worldwide quarterly mobile phone tracker. The prices of Chinese handsets’ premium phones are around half those of Samsung and Apple. Huawei’s first premium phone P9, unveiled late last year, is sold for around 600,000 won ($520) and Oppo’s flagship model R9 is around 500,000 won. Samsung and Apple’s premium phones are sold for around 1 million won. The report said the world’s largest smartphone maker Samsung’s strong sales were also driven by affordable models. “Samsung’s affordable models J-series and A-series drove significant volumes in both emerging and developed markets due to flagship-like design at more affordable price points,” IDC said. Also, substantial discounts on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge helped boost last year’s flagship models -- the new S8 and S8 Plus, the company said. IDC predicted the global smartphone industry would see a rebound this year after suffering a single digit growth of 2.5 percent last year. Prior to the disappointing 2016, the global smartphone market enjoyed double-digit growth for 9 years from 2007 to 2015. Worldwide smartphone shipments grew 4.3 percent in the first quarter on-year, which was slightly higher than IDC’s previous forecast of 3.6 percent growth. “There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry, as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and strong first quarter results certainly support this argument,” said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC’s worldwide quarterly mobile device trackers. The report said big flagship announcements from Huawei with the P10 devices and Samsung with the Galaxy S8 devices show that innovation is still possible. Despite any formal announcements from Apple, it is safe to say the industry is highly anticipating this year’s iPhone announcements, the report said.  By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

Amazon and Google could get some tough competition from Apple in the smart speaker segment. Apple is reportedly developing a smart speaker, similar to that of Amazon Echo and Google Home. The leak comes from prolific tipster Sonny Dickson. “Apple is currently finalizing designs for their Apple competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device”, Dickson said on Twitter. Apple is currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device. — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 He later added: “It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run an variant iOS”. Dickson told Mashable’s Jen Ryall that the smart speaker will sport a design that’s inspired by the Mac Pro, and the UE Boom’s mesh styling.  Dickson did not mention anything about a release date for the device, or a price. He however believes that Apple could launch the device at this year’s WWDC. More from @SonnyDickson on Apple’s Alexa competitor. – Concave top with the controls, fat with the speaker mesh portion covering it all. 1/2 — Jen Ryall (@jennijenni) April 28, 2017 AirPlay functionality in the upcoming in the Siri-powered speaker has been reported before, alongside a Siri DK release, notes 9to5Mac. However, the surprising part is that speaker speaker will include “Beats technology”. It’s being said that Apple might add Beat’s audio tech into its own smart speaker system. This is not the first time we’re hearing that Apple is developing a smart speaker. Back in May 2016, The Information reported that Apple could launch an “Amazon Eco-like device with a speaker and microphone built-in”. At that time, it was suggested that the device could be launched at the company’s annual WWDC. Two months later, CNET reported that Apple’s Siri-powered speaker would be “self-aware” abd able to detect the people who are in close proximity to the device using “on-board” cameras equipped with some sort of facial recognition software. In February 2017, however,  Times’s Tim Bajarin said that Apple was no longer interested in developing an intelligent speaker. Instead, Apple is “more interested in turning Siri into an omnipresent AI assistant across devices, rather than designing a single device specifically to serve as a Siri machine”. Amazon’s Echo is perhaps the most popular voice-based smart speaker on the market today. Earlier in the week, the company revealed its latest Echo device, the Echo Look that comes with a built-in cameras. Amazon’s Echo devices are powered by the company’s Alexa assistant.

By Rene Ritchie Saturday, Apr 29, 2017 at 9:00 am EDT 45 Comments Should you get the aluminum, stainless steel, or ceramic Apple Watch? Here's how to pick! Apple Watch Series 2 comes in your choice of three different materials with distinct properties and price points all their own. There's anodized aluminum — the same material Apple uses for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. There's stainless steel, which is heavier but stronger and a favorite of many watch-wearers. And there's ceramic, which replaces last year's 18K gold on the high end with something even more scratch-proof — and expensive — than steel. So, which should you choose? Price points Heavy materials Scratch and damage resistance Color matches Who should get the aluminum Apple Watch? Who should get the stainless steel Apple Watch? Who should get the ceramic Apple Watch? Price points The different Apple Watch materials all come with different price points, from entry-level to high-end. Aluminum starts at $369. Stainless steel starts at $599. Ceramic starts at $1249. So, if price is your most important consideration, aluminum is priced the lowest. Heavy materials Aluminum weights: 38mm: 28.8g 42mm: 34.2g Stainless steel weights: 38mm: 41.5g 42mm: 52.4g Ceramic weights: 38mm (rose gold): 39.2g 42mm (rose gold): 45.6g So, if you want the lightest Apple Watch possible, you want the aluminum Apple Watch. Scratch and damage resistance Unfortunately, with great lightness does not come great hardness. Here's how the different materials hold up to damage. The aluminum Apple Watch is the "softest" and the anodization could scratch or chip. The stainless steel Apple Watch is much, much harder, especially the black model with diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating. The ceramic Apple Watch is even harder than steel but is potentially easier to shatter if dropped onto a hard surface. So, if resistance to damage is the absolute most important thing to you, the stainless steel watch in general, and the space black version in particular, offer the best combination of scratch and shatter resistance. Color matches Apple Watch comes in a variety of colors, depending on the material. Silver aluminum Space gray aluminum Gold aluminum Rose gold aluminum Polished stainless steel Space black stainless steel White ceramic When you buy additional bands, though, the lugs won't always match the case. Sport bands have colored lugs. Woven nylon have colored lugs. Leather buckles and loops have polished stainless steel lugs. Stainless steel link bracelet and Milanese loop have polished stainless steel lugs. Space gray steel link bracelet and Milanese loop have space black lugs. So, if matching the lugs to the case is important to you, stainless steel offers the widest possible compatibility. Who should get the aluminum Apple Watch? If you're into physical fitness and you want the lightest Apple Watch you can get; if you're going to be rough enough with it — or likely to lose it — and want the most affordable replacement option possible; if you're not sure about Apple Watch and want to try it out at the lowest cost-of-entry; or if you simply love the way the bead-blasted aluminum and those gold and rose gold options look, you should get the aluminum Apple Watch. See at Apple Who should get the stainless steel Apple Watch? If you love watches and want something heavy but not too heavy; classic on the outside but ultra-modern within; made out of strong materials like stainless steel and sapphire crystal; and with the widest range matching bands possible; or if you want a watch but aren't precious about your metals, the stainless steel is for you. See at Apple Who should get the ceramic Apple Watch? If money is no object; if you're into ceramic watches in general, if you want the most scratch-resistant surface possible, if iPod-white is your jam, or if you simply want something that stands out in a crowd, you want the ceramic Apple Watch.

Much harder. The problem is that the aluminum underneath is soft, so the hard surface can be scratched through, if enough pressure is used. I don't know if the Watch is decoratively anodized, or hard anodized. The difference is the thickness. Hard anodization is up to ten times as thick as decorative anodization. It's used on machine surfaces and parts. Anodized aluminum doesn't chip. It's not paint. It can gauge out, if enough force at the right (or wrong) angle is used. It may look like a chip, but it's not. You can tell with a magnifier. The black SS is coated with a microscopic layer of carbon. It's laid on by a gaseous diffusion method. It's effectively black diamond, and is the hardest surface of all the watches, including the ceramic. I've had mine since the first day the Series 2 came out, and there's not one scratch. The regular SS will get fine scratches, but the same is true of all SS watches, and isn't something to bother about. It adds character. The ceramic body is also very hard, though not as much as the diamond SS model. But it's very resistant to scratching as well. While it might break if dropped on a concrete floor, it's very unlikely. All ceramics used for watches are very strong. It could get a tiny chip though. 0 4 hours ago Reply jakeair I have the space gray aluminum 38 mm. An anodized aluminum surface is actually harder than stainless steel. Compare an aluminum watch with a stainless steel watch and you'll see the stainless steel watch has many visible scratches; my aluminum watch does not. So for superficial scratch resistance, the anodized aluminum is better. If you tend to drop the watch from 6 feet onto concrete then the stainless steel would be a better choice. 0 7 hours ago Reply skellener When Apple revs the watch and creates a big round face, large beefy bezel and is readable in bright sunlight (like my Garmin Fenix 3), I'll have a look at it. Until then, I'll pass. 0 12 hours ago Reply melgross Good for you. 0 4 hours ago Reply mrkeynes I have the space gray aluminum Apple Watch series 2. I'm happy with it, plus I believe the dark gray/black goes with anything 0 15 hours ago Reply andsoitgoes As someone who is trying to exercise more and improve my health, the tie ins with apps like Up and Strata are sure appealing and would certainly be fantastic to have. But while I'm used to dropping $1k on a phone or slightly less on an iPad, I'm finding it really hard to justify extending out over $500 (yay Canada's weaker dollar) to purchase a product with the kind of battery life seen here. But thankfully, as with most Apple products, things improve as the years progress and by the time the 3rd generation releases, the prior generation will be available with better specs and a much lower price point. I just need to convince my clearly weak willpower that I can make do as is. But damn it's a nice watch. 0 2 years ago Reply pbalrog I think it'll be interesting to see what people buy when the "s" comes out in a year. Despite what people say last year's apple watch isn't going to have any real resale value, so do you buy a $1000 watch and make it last two years or two cheap ones? I'm betting the sports model will do better in the second gen. I'll also bet that a lot of nice bands will end up recycled onto cheap watches when it's time to upgrade. Unless of course Apple sell the next version in a band free config. 0 2 years ago Reply jayzero76 The waterproof one! 0 2 years ago Reply bsincick I will go for the Black case with link bracelet.

I have a Pebble, but I don't wear it because the band gives me a rash, so the Sport bands are probably not an option. I'd have to buy an iPhone first though, and as I don't own or need a mobile phone at present, this is unlikely. So, no Apple Watch for me. 0 2 years ago Reply cisneroscad Has anyone noticed that the Sport comes with 2 bands while the Watch only comes with one? 0 2 years ago Reply Galley It comes with two different length bands, to fit a wider range of wrist sizes. Some of the other bands are sold in different lengths. 0 2 years ago Reply cisneroscad I guess I needed to specify to only compare the models with Sport Band. Apple Watch Sport comes with 2 Sport Band (S/M & M/L) and Apple Watch with Sport Band comes with only 1 (not specified which one) I Just find it curious that you pay more for the watch and get 1 band less, if your wrist is between 150-180 mm for 38mm watch or 160-185mm for the 42mm watch you'd have 2 bands for the life of your watch or you could re-sell one of them to anyone who didn't get the Sport Band. Although the Sizing Guide specifies that the Sport Band come with both bands, I guess we will have to wait until release day to be certain if it comes with 1 or 2. 0 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee The way I see it out of all the watches they offer, there are only two basic models. The Apple Watch (steel) is the watch the way Apple wanted to design it, with the materials that are best for the design. The Sport watch only exists because they needed a "cheap" variant below $500. It's the same Apple Watch, but with all the expensive stuff swapped out for cheap replacements that are only about half as good. The Editions are irrelevant nonsense, but their design is identical to the basic Apple Watch. The only difference is the precious metals, which have all been treated to "behave like steel". The Sport Watch is the only real different one. It's the only one where they made compromises and swapped out all the good materials for lesser ones to lower the price. It's the only one that will perform differently. The one that will scratch and break more easily. The one that might not last as long. 1 2 years ago Reply rey4Christ I'm thinking I'll get the sport with black or white band. Then one day get another band. I don't want to spend to much first in I know once the next one comes out I'm going to want to get it, also I want to know if I would get good use out of the watch. 0 2 years ago Reply cardfan Who should get the Apple Edition? No one. Only consider this if you want to be laughed at. Who should get the Sport? Glass, cheap aluminum, and a cheap rubber band. The watch's equivalent of 16gb or too little RAM. No doubt it'll be the best seller of the bunch. Who should get the Steel? The ones made to look halfway normal due to bands offered. These are what Apple want you to get. They also won't scratch on contact like the cheaper glass and aluminum. 1 2 years ago Reply ultravisitor No one should get the Edition. -4 2 years ago Reply TechShizzle Quit trying to spend (or not spend) OTHER PEOPLE'S money.

I won't truly be able to decide until I can try some of these on. I actually really like the way the silver sports watch looks. But I don't like the bands options. I'll probably get the steel with the black band and see if I can pick up the tan leather sports strap. Hopefully third party bands will come before summer. It would be nice if Apple released some different bands as well.

But if the sport looks good with the Milanese, I may be swayed 2 2 years ago Reply cclauson I don't think it will look terrible, but bear in mind the stainless Milanese is finished to match the steel case, so there will be a slight variation on finishes with the Sport. -1 2 years ago Reply iPandorum Slate black apple watch sport... It's a 1st gen so don't want to splurge just yet. 3rd gen we will see Sent from the iMore App 4 2 years ago Reply Matt Bauman1 Agree. While I'd like the space gray steel, I don't want to pay that price for a first gen device. So I'll go space gray sport with black rubber band. Buy a third party link bracelet when available. 0 2 years ago Reply Galley I'm leaning toward the stainless steel watch because it does have better materials and may have better resale value. If the space black model was available with a black sport band for $599, I would jump on it. I will need to see the stainless steel models in person before I make a decision. I would probably be happy with a space gray aluminum model, though. 3 2 years ago Reply Audizine I really like the black stainless steal also. And wanted with the black link bracelet until I saw the price. So then I wanted with the black sports band. But that's not available. I really want the watch because of the sapphire glass and stainless steal. But looking at the photos. I just don't like the shiny stainless steal. Wish it was a brushed steal or something. I guess I'll have to wait and see it in person. But for now space gray aluminum it is. 1 2 years ago Reply Chaka Jon Hoping Apple has a sudden change of heart by the 10th, and offers the Black Steel with the sport band. That would be my first choice. 1 2 years ago Reply Audizine That would be awesome! 0 2 years ago Reply Chaka Jon Or at the very least, offer the Silver Aluminum Sport with a back band. As we get closer to the 10th, I guess I'll have to make my final choice: Space Gray Aluminum Sport or Stainless Steel with black sport band. I may end up pre-ordering both, then decide which one I want between the 10th-24th, after trying them both on at the Apple Store. 0 2 years ago Reply Matt Bauman1 Me too. Sent from the iMore App 1 2 years ago Reply cclauson Same. My baseline is that I beat the crap out of a 15 year old Rolex with stainless case and sapphire crystal. It shows fine scratches on the case, but the crystal is perfect. I can't tell you how many times I've banged it and expected to find a crack afterward. No issues. I'm sure all sapphire is not created equal, but I've not had luck with the Ion-X display on the 6 Plus. 1 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee Taste is personal, but for me ... I don't see why when given a choice between "nice shiny steel thing," and "nice shiny steel thing painted *black*," that anyone would pick the black one. Apple does the best anodising in the world and their "coatings" are excellent, but a coating is a coating. It's obvious that sooner or later it will get scuffed up and the real steel will be showing through the scratches after a while. This is simply how coatings work. 1 2 years ago Reply anon4777630 I'm in the same boat. I was hoping to get the black stainless steel with the sport band since they offer the normal stainless steel with one. With the black link bracelet as the only option they've priced me out of the market. 0 2 years ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Research firm IDC said overall smartphone shipments grew 4.3 per cent in the first quarter, slightly better than its prior forecast, to 347 million units. “The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists,” said IDC analyst Ryan Reith. “There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and the strong first quarter results certainly support this argument.” Reith said the 2017 market will feel the impact of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship handset, and a widely expected announcement from Apple for its new iPhone later this year. According to the survey, Samsung led the market in the first quarter with a 22.8 per cent share to 14.9 per cent for Apple, with little growth for the top two vendors. But Huawei’s sales jumped 21.7 per cent to give it a 9.8 per cent share, and fellow Chinese makers Oppo and Vivo, the number four and five vendors, respectively, also boosted their sales. IDC said the bulk of smartphone growth is likely to come from low-cost handset makers. “Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets,” said IDC’s Anthony Scarsella. “Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies’ portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models.” He added that makers “have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment.” The report is based on preliminary quarterly estimates, with Apple due to report sales figures next week. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Samsung, Apple keep top spots in smartphone market Taking steps to avoid phishing scams What to expect from Microsoft’s May 2 event Deforestation from a tree’s perspective at the TED conference Here’s a first look at the Fitbit Alta HR (VIDEO) Watch the US$3m 'Dota 2' Kiev Major live from today Hands on with the Samsung S8+ Is Spotify working on a mysterious connected device?

Source: AAP 30 Apr 2017 - 12:10 PM  UPDATED 4 HOURS AGO Tweet Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn, maker of Apple iPhones, has announced it's in talks with the United States government to boost investment there. The world's largest maker of electronic products for international brands, said in a statement that it was studying a major expansion in the US. Foxconn Technology Group thanked the White House's Office of American Innovation, created by President Donald Trump and directed by Jared Kushner, for its efforts to pave the way for the company's negotiations with the US government. This statement follows a two-day visit by Foxconn President Terry Gou to the White House. Gou told the media Hon Hai planned to make a "capital intensive investment" in the US market. "We are planning a series of investments in America. This project will include capital intensive investment and skilled labour and high technology," Gou said. Media in Taiwan say Gou, accompanied by a delegation including Foxconn vice-president Tai Jeng-wu visited the White House and met with Trump. Foxconn, in late January, said if its customers like Apple co-operate, it could make investments in the US worth more than $US7 billion ($A9.3 billion). The Taiwanese company has manufacturing facilities in China with more than one million employees.

The picture of the supposed iPhone 8 case was uploaded by KK Sneak Leaks and was spotted by 9to5Mac. Read: iPhone Wireless Charging: Apple Wants You To Charge Your Device Via Wi-Fi In The Future iPhone 8 News: Vertical Dual-Cameras The leaked photo of the clear iPhone 8 case suggests the smartphone will come with a dual-camera positioned vertically instead of horizontally, different from how it's currently placed on the iPhone 7. The case backs up a recent Bloomberg report that said Apple was reportedly testing versions of the iPhone 8 for better photos by positioning the dual-camera system vertically. This week, a schematic leak suggested the cameras on the 10th anniversary phone will be vertically aligned. Another rumor pointed to a vertical camera module would make the device ideal for augmented reality games. Here’s the leaked schematic of the iPhone 8 released this week: The leaked picture of the iPhone 8 case also shows a longer power button on the bottom of the device, compared to the current lightning port, which is smaller. iPhone 8 Embedded Touch ID Numerous reports have claimed Apple will release the iPhone 8 with the Touch ID embedded in the screen display. However, an analyst said this month that integrating the new Touch ID onto the display was the feature causing Apple the most trouble. Some reports have said Apple will embed the Touch ID on the back of the phone rather than the front of the display. However, Friday’s leaked iPhone case image suggests the Touch ID will be located on the front of the device. Read: iPhone 8 Debuting With 2700mAh Battery Despite iPhone 7-Like Form Factor Rumored Features For Apple’s iPhone 8 Apple is expected to release the OLED display iPhone 8 this September alongside two LCD versions, the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. However, some reports have suggested the iPhone 8 could be delayed because of some features. The 10th anniversary iPhone could come with a price tag exceeding $1,000. The three new models this year are expected to measure 4.7-inches, 5.5-inches and a 5.8-inch version. The 2017 iPhones are rumored to come with True Tone display, which is currently available on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The 10th anniversary iPhone is rumored to come with an array of new features. The iPhone 8, which could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition, is rumored to come with an OLED screen display, wireless charging, and a 3D-sensing camera which could allow for augmented reality and virtual reality capabilities. Other rumors suggest the iPhone 8 will feature a Smart Connector for wireless charging and AR and VR accessories.

(AP) Tech giant withholds royalties, which will cost Qualcomm up to $500m Apple is refusing to pay any royalties owed to mobile chip maker Qualcomm for some of the features in the iPhone, escalating a patent feud that has turned the former business partners into bitter adversaries. The latest twist in the dispute represents a major blow for Qualcomm, which depends on licensing fees for a large portion of its revenue. Apple's decision to withhold royalties will cost Qualcomm up to $500 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm released. "This is getting ugly, the level of hostility just went up another notch," said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. As retaliation, Qualcomm could seek a court order halting iPhone sales until Apple pays the royalties that Qualcomm contends it's owed, Moorhead said. Qualcomm hasn't threatened to go to that extreme yet, but its top lawyer made it clear on Friday that the San Diego company is girding for a fierce fight with its Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world's most valuable company. "We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. Apple concedes it and its suppliers owe Qualcomm some licensing fees on iPhone sales. But Apple believes Qualcomm has been abusing its power in the mobile chip market to charge for royalties on features that aren't covered by its patents. Qualcomm, in turn, has accused Apple of breaking contracts in an attempt to lower its licensing fees and also interfering in deals negotiated with iPhone suppliers. The stalemate prompted Apple to sue Qualcomm in January in a federal complaint. Qualcomm denied the allegations and fired back with its own lawsuit against Apple earlier this month. In a Friday statement, Apple said it won't pay Qualcomm any further royalties until the courts determine the amount, a process that could take several years. "As we've said before, Qualcomm's demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own," Apple said. Rosenberg reiterated that Qualcomm holds "valid and enforceable" licensing agreements on various features in iPhones. Apple's suspension of royalty payments marks "the latest step in Apple's global attack on Qualcomm," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. Apple isn't alone in its accusations against Qualcomm. The US Federal Trade Commission also has filed a lawsuit alleging that Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. With the loss of iPhone royalty payments, Qualcomm now expects its revenue for its April-June quarter to range from $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, down from its previous forecast of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. Qualcomm now expects its earnings for the period to range from 75¢ to 85¢ per share. That's down from an earlier projection of 90¢ to $1.15 per share. Investors shook off the shock of Qualcomm's lowered guidance after initially driving down the company's stock. Its stock rose 53¢, or one per cent, to $53.74 on Friday. The stock has fallen by about 15 per cent since Apple filed its lawsuit.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple takes supplier clean energy program to Japan Ibiden’s products help bring together the integrated circuitry and chip packages in Apple devices. Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Keeping in mind the scale of the technology in the state, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) proposed some regulations governing the use of the technology on the state roads in March. On Friday, some companies invested in the technology — including tech giant Apple — petitioned the state to consider changing its proposed rules. Read: Apple Self-Driving Technology: 5 Facts You Need To Know ​ “Apple believes that all those developing and deploying automated vehicles should follow rigorous safety principles in design, testing, and production. Such principles should not, however, inhibit companies from making consequential progress—there is no need to compromise safety or innovation,” Steve Kenner Director of Product Integrity, Apple said in a letter addressed to Brian G. Soublet, deputy director and chief counsel, Department of Motor Vehicles, Legal Affairs Division, State of California. Tesla had written a similar letter to the DMV on Monday in which it had been even more explicit than Apple in its opposition to the proposed rules “NHTSA’s Policy explicitly states that the Safety Assessment requested in the Vehicle Performance Guidance is a voluntary submission that is not a necessary precursor to testing AVs on public roads or as part of a state’s test program," the company wrote in the letter. "Notwithstanding, the DMV’s Rulemaking requires manufacturers to submit a copy of their Safety Assessment to NHTSA as part of their application to test AVs that do not require a human driver as well as their application to deploy AVs on public roads. In doing so, the DMV inappropriately transfers federal regulatory authority to itself and contravenes the spirit of voluntary cooperation that NHTSA intended for with the Safety Assessment." "Tesla instead believes that the DMV should strive for consistency with NHTSA’s Policy and the Rulemaking should instead request (without imposing a requirement) for manufacturers to submit a Safety Assessment,” Tesla added, voicing its opposition to the proposed safety rules by the state authority.  Both the companies have concerns about how the proposed rules require the companies to report "disengagements" with the self-driving vehicles and state that the rules might restrict the design of and equipment used in self-driving vehicles, which would in turn “stifle innovation.” The companies argue that the rules should require reporting only serious instances of disengagements, which require human drivers to take over control to avoid accidents or violating traffic rules.  Furthermore, Apple says that the state’s restriction on using self-driving vehicles without a human driver should be removed, as it would act as an impediment to testing cars autonomously. Read: Are Self-Driving Cars Safe? One In Four Cars On U.S. Roads In 2035 Will Be Self-Driven, Study Says Self-driving legislation presents a unique opportunity for lawmakers, as the technology basically differs from the foundation on which traffic rules are formulated — human driving. The new technology is expected to eventually remove, or at least reduce, the reliance on human driving. Traffic rules, traffic lights and even roads might be needed to be designed to accommodate self-driving vehicles once the technology becomes mainstream.

According to Fortune, Qualcomm depends on royalties for 80 percent of its pre-tax profit. As a result of Apple’s escalation, Qualcomm has been forced to cut its Q2 revenue forecast by $500 million USD. The company has told shareholders it now expects quarterly revenue to land between $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion. Apple does not pay Qualcomm royalties directly; instead, with licensing agreements related to the iPhone and iPad, Qualcomm charges the company’s manufacturing partners, who then pass the bill to Apple. Qualcomm revealed those manufacturers had started withholding payments earlier this month. However, the company did not provide specific financial guidance at the time. “Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own.” Apple says it has spent the past five years unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate a direct licensing agreement with Qualcomm. “They have refused to negotiate fair terms,” the tech giant said in a statement. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court. As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own.” Qualcomm, meanwhile, said, “Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm. We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.” In January, Apple filed a $1-= billion lawsuit against Qualcomm, accusing the company of abusing its position as market leader to force unfair licensing agreements upon its customers. Qualcomm responded with a countersuit in which it argued Apple broke contract and said the company was unwilling to pay fair market value for its patents. Qualcomm has been the subject of multiple anti-trust investigations involving regulators in the U.S., E.U. and South Korea. Since the start of the year, the company’s stock has shed 20 percent of its value. Qualcomm was recently forced to pay BlackBerry $814 million in overpaid royalties.

Word is that Apple is working on a money transfer service akin to the PayPal-owned app Venmo, allowing iPhone owners to send cash to each other directly, according to Recode. A source claims the new Apple-powered payment service will be announced later this year — possibly during this fall's iPhone 8 launch event — though another source claims an announcement date and launch window have yet to be determined. The report also says Apple is in talks with credit card company Visa to create its own debit cards. These pre-paid cards would allow iPhone users to send money via Apple's payment service and make purchases immediately, rather than marry a credit card to their Apple Pay or wait for a bank transaction to clear. This isn't the first time we've heard reports of an Apple-branded, Venmo-like service, though we still recommend taking such reports with healthy skepticism until confirmed.  If we're lucky, we may learn more about Apple's plan to replace your wallet during Apple's annual WWDC conference, which is set for June 5-9 this year.

The latest twist in the dispute represents a blow for Qualcomm, which depends on licensing fees for a large portion of its revenue. Apple's decision will cost Qualcomm up to $500 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm released Friday. "This is getting ugly, the level of hostility just went up another notch," said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. As retaliation, Qualcomm could seek a court order halting iPhone sales until Apple pays the royalties Qualcomm contends it's owed, Moorhead said. Qualcomm hasn't threatened to go to that extreme yet, but its top lawyer made it clear on Friday that the San Diego company is girding for a fierce fight with its Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world's most valuable company. "We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. Apple concedes it and its suppliers owe Qualcomm some licensing fees on iPhone sales. But Apple believes Qualcomm has been abusing its power in the mobile chip market to charge for royalties on features that aren't covered by its patents.

"Apple had asked for a set of concessions. For a period of 15 years all the components that Apple imports, they want them to be free of duty. We have a phased manufacturing programme (PMP) because we want more and more value addition to come to the country. We want them to understand how this PMP will work and how they can dove tail into that," Ministry of Electronics and IT Secretary Aruna Sundararajan told reporters on Saturday. She was speaking on the sidelines of the annual session of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has approved PMP and the government set to notify it. "Right now the value addition is minimal. We want to take it up. For that purpose we have just announced phased manufacturing programme for mobile phones," Sundararajan said. According to Indian Cellular Association, the PMP is expected to increase local value addition in mobile phone manufacturing to increase to 39-50 per cent in next 3 years. Under PMP, the government has already imposed additional duty on import of mobile charger, battery pack and wired headset in 2016-17. In 2017-18, key components like mobile microphone and receiver, USB Cable, key pads will attract duty benefits. Components like camera module, mobile antenna etc will be given incentives or duty benefit in 2018-19 if procured locally by handset makers. Mobile phone makers will get benefit of tax or incentives on the touch panels, mobile screen, vibrator motor or ringer from 2019-20 onwards under the program. The phased manufacturing programme was proposed by a joint panel of the industry and the government - Fast Track Task Force. The panel set up under the MeitY has set target of 500 million handset production by 2019 and export target of 120 million mobile phones by 2019-20, taking annual manufacturing output in the range of Rs 1.5-3 lakh crore. In 2016-17, total value of mobile phone to be produced in India is likely to reach Rs 90,000 crore from Rs 54,000 crore in 2015-16.

After the rumor mill churned out reports last week about Apple's (aapl) apparent iPhone ambitions, this past week centered mainly on its automobile plans. There was talk of Apple bringing on prominent staffers from NASA and elsewhere to bolster its rumored car team, and even a report that suggested the company was already trying out its technology on Silicon Valley Roads. This is Fortune’s weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week’s roundup, click here. Meanwhile, talk of Apple's next big iPhone, believed to be known as the iPhone 8, iPhone X, or iPhone Edition, continued to surface, and Apple's ongoing spat with Qualcomm took another turn. All in all, it was an eventful week for Apple. Here are some of the biggest Apple stories from the past week: Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter Apple has quietly poached important talent from NASA to help it rev up its Apple Car. The California Department of Motor Vehicles this week revealed six Apple employees who are authorized to ride in the company's self-driving car tests. Among them are prominent NASA employees, including Shilpa Gulati, an "experience roboticist" who previously helped created a vehicle that could used to explore one of Jupiter's moons. Apple has also signed on Jeremy Ma, who formerly worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Just weeks after the California DMV gave Apple a permit to test self-driving cars across the state, Apple has petitioned state government to tweak its self-driving car test rules. Apple said that the changes, which would include revisions to how data is reported, could improve the rate at which the self-driving car technology is developed. Apple is said to be preparing three new iPhones this year, including one that could come with a major update over last year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. However, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said this week that the new handset, which could be known as iPhone 8, might have been delayed from its planned September launch to October or November. Kuo said that Apple is having trouble sourcing enough components and experiencing some other manufacturing difficulties. Apple, of course, hasn't commented on its future smartphone plans. Apple's ever-contentious feud with Qualcomm escalated on Friday after Qualcomm announced that the iPhone maker stopped paying it royalties in the first quarter. Apple sued Qualcomm in January, accusing the chipmaker of charging exorbitant royalties. Apple has now stopped paying its chip royalties to Qualcomm altogether. In a statement, Apple said that it's tried to negotiate with Qualcomm, but has been unable to get "fair terms." Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus accounted for 68% of total iPhone sales in the U.S. last quarter. However, that was down from the more than 70% share last year's iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus secured in the same quarter in 2016, according to research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. The research firm said Apple is having trouble attracting Android users, but has lost few iPhone users to other companies. A Dutch judge this week said Apple must replace iPads suffering from problems with Wi-Fi connectivity with new tablets. According to the lawsuit, Apple was replacing damaged iPads in the country with refurbished models. The company's AppleCare warranty program allows for replacement devices to be refurbished, but the judge said Apple must give customers new models. Apple's original content series Carpool Karaoke has been delayed. Apple had planned to hold a premiere party in March, but rescheduled it without explanation. Apple planned to hold the event on Monday, but again postponed with without giving a reason. The company had previously said Carpool Karaoke would premiere on Apple Music in April. Now, it's saying the show is coming "later this year." One more thing...Apple's artificial intelligence chief Tom Gruber said at the TED Conference this week that he believes artificial intelligence could, in the not-so-distant future, remember every memory humans have. Yes, even those they'd like to forget. Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc. All rights reserved.

By Ian King. Added by Agency Staff on 29 April 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, Qualcomm Tweet Apple has cut off billions of dollars in payments to Qualcomm, turning a contract dispute into what one analyst called an “all-out war” that has forced the chip supplier to slash forecasts given only days ago. The world’s largest publicly traded technology company and one of the main suppliers of components to the iPhone, its most important product, have traded accusations of lying, making threats and trying to create an illegal monopoly. The fight involves billions of dollars of technology licensing revenue that, if permanently cut off or reduced, would damage Qualcomm’s main source of profit and help bolster Apple’s margins. Apple told Qualcomm it will stop paying licensing revenue to contract manufacturers of the iPhone, the mechanism by which it’s paid the chip maker since the best-selling smartphone debuted in 2007, the San Diego, California-based company said in a statement. Qualcomm removed any assumption it will get those fees from its forecast for the current period. Apple doesn’t have a direct licence with Qualcomm, unlike other phone makers. “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,” Apple said in a statement. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court. As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own.” Qualcomm said revenue in its fiscal third quarter ending June will be US$4,8bn to $5,6bn, down from last week’s prediction of $5,3bn to $6,1bn. It’s also short of the $5,8bn average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share will range between $0,52 and $0,62, compared to the earlier forecast of $0,67 to $0,92. Minus certain items, profit per share will be $0,75 to $0,85. For Qualcomm, Apple’s move is a further infringement on its legal agreements with the contract makers of the iPhone, who also make devices for other companies. Those agreements predate Apple’s entry into the phone market and are still legally enforceable. “While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade.” He said Apple’s interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to other parties is wrongful and part of the Cupertino, California-based company’s global attack on Qualcomm. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, said Qualcomm’s largest customer has declared “all-out war”, leaving a dark cloud over earnings and its stock price. “Even if one believed this was a worst-case scenario, we struggle to see a resolution anytime soon as the parties entrench,” Rasgon wrote in a note to investors on Friday. Qualcomm managed expectations around the dispute poorly, he added. Qualcomm’s head office in San Diego, California Shares fell as much as 4,1% to $51,05 on Friday morning. It was the lowest intraday price since June. They were trading at $52,91 at 12.16pm in New York. Apple stock edged 0,2% higher to $144,12, close to a record. Qualcomm’s lucrative licensing division funds an industry-leading research and development budget, which has helped its chips stay ahead of rivals. That strategy, which has helped the company more than double revenue since 2010, is under threat as the dispute with Apple worsens and it deals with regulatory investigations in the US, South Korea, Taiwan and Europe. It says Apple instigated those investigations by making false claims to government agencies. Apple’s end goal is to lower the fees, Qualcomm said. When it began its suit against Qualcomm in January, Apple accused Qualcomm of monopolising the market for chips used in wireless devices and withholding $1bn in retaliation for cooperating with Korean antitrust authorities. Apple also said it wants back some of the billions of dollars it claims it was overcharged in “Qualcomm’s illegal scheme” to control the market for mobile phone chips. It wants a court to change how Qualcomm charges for its technology. Patents controlled by Qualcomm cover the basics of all high-speed data-capable mobile phone systems. It charges a percentage of the total selling price of the phone regardless of whether the device uses a Qualcomm chip or not. Qualcomm had given a wider-than-normal forecast range for the current quarter, reflecting the possibility that Apple may pressure its suppliers, company president Derek Aberle said last week. “We’d expect that they will pay, consistent with their obligations,” he said at the time. “We can’t completely discount the possibility that Apple will continue to interfere and cause them to pay less than they owe.”  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 6Biometric bank cards coming to SA 5SABC seeks government bailout 5Among connected in SA, Facebook now bigger than TV 4DOC ‘wants new luxury cars’ 3SA mulls annual wealth tax Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Apple sued the company in January and asked for USD 1 billion back in fees, saying it overpaid for using Qualcomm’s technology due to the chipmaker abusing dominant market position. Qualcomm filed a counter claim in April, denied the claims and said that Apple had breached and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations. But as a result of the payments being withheld, Qualcomm said it must downgrade its guidance for the third quarter to exclude the royalty revenues. It therefore now expects revenues of USD 4.8-5.6 billion, from its previous guidance of USD 5.3-6.1 billion and the result recorded the year earlier of 6.0 billion. Earnings per share are now seen at USD 0.52-0.62 from the previous guidance of 0.67-0.92 and the 0.97 reported the year before. Diluted EPS is now forecast at USD 0.75-0.85 from the guidance given before of 0.90-1.15 and the 1.16 posted in 2016. Qualcomm said the Apple was “improperly interfering” with long-standing agreements and that the licenses remain valid and enforceable.  Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s intellectual property but insists contract terms be changed.

"Apple had asked for a set of concessions. For a period of 15 years all the components that Apple imports, they want them to be free of duty. We have a phased manufacturing programme (PMP) because we want more and more value addition to come to the country. We want them to understand how this PMP will work and how they can dove tail into that," Ministry of Electronics and IT Secretary Aruna Sundararajan told reporters today. She was speaking on the sidelines of the annual session of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has approved PMP and the government set to notify it. "Right now the value addition is minimal. We want to take it up. For that purpose we have just announced phased manufacturing programme for mobile phones," Sundararajan said. According to Indian Cellular Association, the PMP is expected to increase local value addition in mobile phone manufacturing to increase to 39-50 percent in next 3 years. Under PMP, the government has already imposed additional duty on import of mobile charger, battery pack and wired headset in 2016-17. In 2017-18, key components like mobile microphone and receiver, USB Cable, key pads will attract duty benefits. Components like camera module, mobile antenna etc will be given incentives or duty benefit in 2018-19 if procured locally by handset makers. Mobile phone makers will get benefit of tax or incentives on the touch panels, mobile screen, vibrator motor or ringer from 2019-20 onwards under the program. The phased manufacturing programme was proposed by a joint panel of the industry and the government - Fast Track Task Force. The panel set up under the MeitY has set target of 500 million handset production by 2019 and export target of 120 million mobile phones by 2019-20, taking annual manufacturing output in the range of Rs 1.5-3 lakh crore. In 2016-17, total value of mobile phone to be produced in India is likely to reach Rs 90,000 crore from Rs 54,000 crore in 2015-16.   TAGS iPhoneAppleApple manufacturing schemeApple India plantApple India International Business Ohio family surprised when Mark Zuckerberg comes to dinner From Zee News 10 Photos which prove Zaheer Khan – Sagarika Ghatge make an...

Now, depending on who you speak to there are a couple of theories as to what’s going on. The most likely is that Apple will release two iPhone 7s handsets - these handsets that will look and feel like the current iPhone 7 - alongside a brand new model that will be called the iPhone 8. Why would Apple do this? Simple: OLED panels – or rather, a lack of them, to be precise. The other reason is that Apple will be able to retail this handset as an ULTRA-PREMIUM handset – and that means $1000+ per unit, probably. Apple simply cannot source enough OLED panels from its suppliers to satisfy demands. This is why OLED will only appear on one handset in 2017. In 2018 and beyond, all models should feature OLED panels, as Apple’s supplier ramp up production. The upshot to this approach is that Apple can use OLED panels as a big USP on its bigger and more expensive iPhone. “Apple ordered 100 million OLED panels from Samsung Display for use in the iPhone 8. However, it is now thought that order has been increased to 160 million, which is worth an additional $4.3 billion to Samsung,” notes PC Mag. OLED displays serve up richer colours, deeper blacks and have faster refresh rates. They’re also flexible, opening up a myriad of options and potential for design – things like curved aspects and truly flexible handsets. The iPhone 8 – AKA The Mac Daddy – will have all the new, flagship features: so, improved imaging, improved display technology, the all-screen frontage, masses of storage. Basically, all the cool stuff you’ve been reading about for the last 12 months. This will be Apple’s NEW flagship, just as the iPad Pro is its new (and more costly) iPad flagship. iPhone 7s vs iPhone 8: Expect BIG Differences – And Not Just In Price The iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will likely retail for the same price as the current models. Though there will be some parity with the larger, more impressive iPhone 8 – wireless charging, for one. “Only the 5.8-inch 2017 iPhone will feature a glass and stainless steel design,” reports BGR, “while the 4.7-inch iPhone will have an aluminium housing just like this year’s iPhones.” The report added: “The 5.8-inch iPhone is believed to be the iPhone 8, which is expected to feature a steel frame that will hold the internal components, covered by glass front and rear panels. Apple used similar designs in the past for the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S.” The iPhone 8 model will be dramatically more expensive; I’ve heard talk of the handset costing more than $1000/£1000 which is insanely expensive for a phone – even if it is one that packs in a lot of new stuff. "Kuo says Apple will remove the home button completely and replace it on the iPhone 8 with a ‘function area’ akin to the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro line. The function area will be contextual, adapting to whatever users need depending on what they are doing,” notes Forbes. It added: “Interestingly Kuo says the end result is the iPhone 8 will be almost bezel-less with a mammoth 5.8-inch display squeezed into a chassis no larger than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. Exclude the function area, however, and the actual usable size of the display will be 5.15-inches - which is roughly in line with upcoming rivals like the Galaxy S8 (also tipped for a 5.8-inch display and onscreen controls).” iPhone 7s Design? All rumours currently point to the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus sharing the same design as last year’s models. The upshot to this is that Apple will be able to, maybe, reduce the price to entice user adoption. The logic here is simple: If you’re bored and want something new, get the iPhone 8.  If you’re happy enough with the iPhone 7s and its price, go with that.  Apple is basically giving you a choice – but in the end it will win either way. Personally speaking, I can see A LOT of people going for the iPhone 8. I think Apple knows this which is why it has limited all the big changes to one handset. Supply chain reports indicate that Apple is struggling to source enough OLED panels for the iPhone 8. Adding OLED to ALL iPhone releases in 2017 would further exasperate this problem. Hence the two model split. Apple has tasked BOE, a Chinese OLED producer with filling the gap between now and 2018: “BOE is currently in the process of building two OLED plants in the southwestern province of Sichuan, according to today’s report. The company is investing close to $14.5 billion in the process, building plants in Chengdu and Mianyang,” reports 9to5Mac.

Apple Watch Series 2 Is The New Apple Watch NikeLab With Exclusive Band & Watch Faces. April 29, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) A limited edition Apple Watch Series 2 smartwatch is now available as Apple Watch NikeLab. The new watch is now available exclusively at select Nike stores. For the first time, you won’t be able to buy an Apple Watch from the official Apple stores (except Apple Watch Store at Isetan Shinjuku, Tokyo). Here’s what makes Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch NikeLab different from each other. Design The standard Apple Watch when combined with Nike’s exclusive Nike Sports Band brings the Apple Watch NikeLab. It is undoubtedly a great deal for fitness conscious Apple fans. This is not the first time when Apple and Nike together introduced a watch, the Nike+ is also a result of this partnership. In terms of design, you can expect nothing more than a neutral tone sports band that comes in light cream and black color. The band features NikeLab: Innovation x Innovators logo on the pin. The case is available in Space Grey color and when combined with Nike’s black and white sports band, it gives a relaxing look. Features In terms of features, the standard Apple Watch lacks exclusive Nike apps and watch faces, of course. Just like its predecessor Nike+, the Apple Watch NikeLab also comes in 38mm and 42mm case sizes. The Apple Watch Series 2 limited edition brings all the features of its predecessor. The watch sports the same integration with the exclusive Siri commands, Nike+ Run Club app, GPS, brighter display and water resistance capability. There’s no difference in the processor as the limited edition is also powered by the same dual core processor. The operating system watchOS3, on which the Series 2 smartwatch runs, the limited edition also runs on the same. ?One of the most interesting things about Series 2 watch is that user can take the watch in water up to 50 meters, which is obviously a pretty long distance. However, this is not very useful feature because you cannot consider wearing at the times of deep diving. The water resistance is only good for swimmers and frequent travelers. The back of the smartwatch sports a Nike swoosh. The Apple Watch Series 2 limited Edition NikeLab is an ideal companion for people who are more interested in running than any other activities. Price From April 27, the limited edition Apple Watch NikeLab is on sale. The price tags of the watches as mentioned on the Nike’s official website suggest that you can get the 38mm watch at the price of US$369 and the 42mm model for US$399. Just like the other Apple products, you can also avail the Apple Care+ coverage for an additional cost. Specifications If you didn’t follow the release of Apple’s standard Watch Series 2, here’s what you should know about its features. The smartwatch comes equipped with a built-in GPS and GLONASS. It also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity. One of the highly appreciated features of the Apple Watch is the heart rate sensor, which is present in the limited edition as well. As far as the sensors are concerned, you will find accelerometer, gyroscope and ambient light sensor in the smartwatch. When In Use From workout to accessing phone features, Apple’s standard Watch Series 2 is one of the leading smartwatches to connect your iPhone with. The device notifies the users about any messages, calls and emails. But this is not the only thing Apple Watch can do. The new edition watch is also a great travel companion, as it can support many travel apps that include, but are not limited to navigation, currency converters and apps that help users in exploring destinations on the go. From gym to shopping, everywhere the Apple Watch Series 2 can come handy. And for the fitness freaks, NikeLab adds a lot more to explore and enjoy. Staff Writer; Corey Shaw Have any Tech Tips? News?

"Apple had asked for a set of concessions. For a period of 15 years all the components that Apple imports, they want them to be free of duty. We have a phased manufacturing programme (PMP) because we want more value addition to come to the country. We want them to understand how this PMP will work and how they can dovetail into that," Ministry of Electronics and IT Secretary Aruna Sundararajan told reporters on Saturday. She was speaking on the sidelines of the annual session of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has approved PMP and the government is set to notify it. "Right now the value addition is minimal. We want to take it up. For that purpose we have just announced a phased manufacturing programme for mobile phones," Sundararajan said. According to Indian Cellular Association, the PMP is expected to increase local value addition in mobile phone manufacturing to increase to 39-50 per cent in next 3 years. Under PMP, the government has already imposed additional duty on import of mobile charger, battery pack and wired headset in 2016-17. In 2017-18, key components like mobile microphone and receiver, USB Cable, key pads will attract duty benefits. Components like camera module and mobile antenna, among others will be given incentives or duty benefit during 2018-19 if procured locally by handset makers. Mobile phone makers will get the benefit of tax or incentives on the touch panels, mobile screen, vibrator motor or ringer from 2019-20 onwards under the program. The phased manufacturing programme was proposed by a joint panel of the industry and the government - Fast Track Task Force. The panel set up under the MeitY has set target of 500 million handset production by 2019 and export target of 120 million mobile phones by 2019-20, taking annual manufacturing output in the range of Rs 1.5-3 lakh crore. During 2016-17, the total value of mobile phone to be produced in India is likely to reach Rs 90,000 crore from Rs 54,000 crore in 2015-16.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) added $1.38 last week (nearly 1%), closing at $143.65 on Friday. The company remains the best-performing stock by a wide margin among the 30 equities that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The company’s stock is up 24.03% year to date, well above second-place Boeing’s 18.72% improvement. The share price peaked Tuesday afternoon at $144.90 and the low point for the week came Monday when shares touched $143.18. Apple is scheduled to report earnings after markets close next Tuesday. Analysts expect earnings per share of $2.02 and revenues of $52.97 billion. In the same period last year, Apple reported earnings per share of $1.90 and revenues of $50.56 billion. While no one expects Apple’s iPhone sales to be anywhere near the 78.3 million it sold in the holiday quarter, sales could rise to around 52 million in the company’s second fiscal quarter. Another item analysts and investors will be looking at is Apple’s services business. Sales rose 18% in the previous quarter to $7.2 billion and contributed $20 billion to 2016 revenues. That number should continue to grow. On the legal front, Apple upped the stakes in its battle with Qualcomm over royalty payments. On Friday the chipmaker said that Apple has indicated that it will not pay its iPhone suppliers for sales related to royalties in the first calendar quarter of 2017. Qualcomm also said that Apple intends to continue this cut-off until the dispute between the two companies is resolved. According to MacRumors, the loss of the royalty payments could total around $500 million in lost revenues for Qualcomm. Apple shares closed at $143.65 on Friday, in a 52-week range of $89.47 to $145.46. The consensus 12-month price target is $148.96 in a price target range of $104 to $185 per share.

Chris Mills BGR News April 28, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Another day, another analyst shouting BUY BUY BUY on Apple’s stock, based on the upcoming iPhone 8 launch. This week, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha raised his estimate for the firm’s stock price to $170, based on his belief that “pent-up demand” for a new iPhone will create a “supercycle” of upgrades, sending Apple’s profits into the stratosphere and investors into a tizzy. No-one’s denying that Apple is going to make a dumpster-truck of money on the iPhone 8, and will continue being the world’s greatest smartphone company, etcetera. But the size of the iPhone 8 launch, and the company’s current valuation, is still being blown way out of proportion. Don't Miss: iPhone 8 schematics leak offers plenty of good news – and some big surprises Cast your mind back to November 2016: a simpler time, when we didn’t know Donald Trump would be President, and Apple’s stock was trading at $104. Today, it’s at $143, and supposed to go to $170. Between then and now, the only significant thing that’s changed is a bunch of rumors about the upcoming iPhone 8 launch. But somehow, based on that, Apple’s perceived value has risen by over $250 billion and counting. Sure, Apple’s services sectors are doing well, and Trump’s tax plans could be more friendly to Apple. But analysts still seem to be betting that the iPhone 8 will create at least $100 billion in extra value over a “boring” iPhone launch. Let’s put that in perspective. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch, the last major iPhone refresh, saw Apple sell 300,000 more iPhones than the year before. During Q4 2016, the quarter in which Apple launched the iPhone 7, Apple collected $11 billion in net income. If the analyst’s prediction is right and Apple’s stock rises to $170, that puts Apple’s market cap at nearly $900 billion. It was $585 billion in November 2016, which means that between November last year and the iPhone 8 launch, Apple will be $300 billion more valuable. So, the conclusion is one of these: Pre-November last year, analysts and the stock market were undervaluing Apple by hundreds of billions of dollars, or; The iPhone 8 and more iTunes sales are going to create $300 billion in extra value, or; The current valuation of Apple is insane and based on gut feel and hype, rather than a sane economic valuation of the company. To be clear, I still think that Apple’s stock is going to go up when the iPhone 8 launches, and the company will remain in rude health for years. But a stock price and a market valuation isn’t meant to be an arbitrary number that goes up and down, based on on quarterly results: it’s meant to represent the value of a company, taking into account current assets, profits, and future perspectives. Unless Apple’s entire future has got 60% better in the last year, analysts are guessing, rather than analyzing anything.

Now, the company has revealed that its earnings from royalties will be heavily affected as Apple has withheld payments. Qualcomm relies on royalties from Apple's contract manufacturers mainly based in China, but the company is alleged to be overcharging them and does not have any fixed agreements in place. Apple believes that the issue can only be resolved in the court and will not be paying any royalty amounts to its contractors until a correct amount is determined. Since the parties could not reach an agreement on fair terms, Apple has taken the decision on its own to stop the payments. Qualcomm has lowered its revenue forecast from the $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion range to the $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion range for the third quarter, as it has not received royalty payments for sales from the quarter that ended on March 31, 2017. The newer revenue forecast may seem a little too low, until you realize that between the two of them, Samsung and Apple account for about 40% of Qualcomm's revenues. This decision therefore, impacts the chip maker quite significantly. It doesn't seem like the tussle between the two tech giants will resolve any time soon, but for now Qualcomm seems to be in a tough position.

Starting on Friday, Apple Music will be the service that supplies the songs, replacing UK-based provider 7digital, according to people familiar with the companies’ plans.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, after all, has clashed with Trump on everything from iPhone encryption to immigration, and was even reportedly on an early short list of potential running mates for Hillary Clinton. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 143.65 -0.14 -0.10% Boeing Co BA ▲ 184.83 +1.61 +0.88% Under Armour Inc UA ▼ 19.41 -0.41 -2.07% Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.A ▼ 247,780.00 -2,170.00 -0.87% But as Trump's first 100 days come to a close, one thing is clear: Apple stock is the biggest winner of his presidency so far. Apple shares have returned more than 20% since Trump entered the White House, making the tech company the best-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average during the first 100 days. Driving Apple's gains: a great quarterly earnings report, a tax climate that could be a boon for Apple shareholders, and the stock's growing reputation as a haven for dividend-conscious retirement investors. Apple stock has run up about four times as much as the market overall, even as the so-called Trump Bump created one of the best 100-day rallies for any president elected since World War II. Since Trump was elected in November, Apple has risen 29%, eclipsing the Dow's 14% return over that period-though Boeing just barely scraped ahead, with its shares up nearly 30%. Even though Apple shares sank after Trump announced an immigration ban from several predominantly Muslim countries in late January, the tech company reversed those losses the following day when it revealed in its earnings report that its new iPhone 7 was a hit, and that it sold more iPhones over the holiday season than Wall Street had expected. Trump's proposed policies, though still in flux, have also been a boon to Apple, whose CEO Cook has participated in the President's summits of business leaders. Most notably, Apple would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Trump's promise to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, which would allow the iPhone maker to potentially bring much of its massive overseas cash hoard back to the U.S. without taking a major hit from taxes. (On the flip side, Trump's tax reform plan has hurt other stocks like Under Armour, which was the market's worst performer in the first 100 days, in part due to fears that the President's suggested import tax could more than cancel out benefits of a rate cut.)© Photograph by Drew Angerer-Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump, Peter Thiel and Apple CEO Tim Cook (right), during a meeting with technology executives at Trump Tower, December 14, 2016 in New York City. Still, a flush few months for Apple's stock haven't stopped Cook from openly disagreeing with Trump's agenda, even going so far as to threaten to sue the administration over its immigration ban. It's not just Trump who has given Apple a boost in the last few months. Warren Buffett has been taking bigger and bigger bites of Apple stock lately, a bet that has paid off for the legendary Berkshire Hathaway investor in the form of profits in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars-and helped send Apple shares to new all-time highs. The octogenarian stock-picker, after all, has long loved dividend stocks, and Apple's 1.6% dividend yield (relatively high for a tech stock) has made it increasingly popular with yield-seeking investors, especially those planning for retirement. If tax reform, the Trump Bump and the next iPhone continue pushing the stock higher, retirees who bet their entire nest egg on Apple stock might not seem so crazy after all.

Time to give it go on the first of my 5 devices. Sounds like a good one, time will tell. Thanks! 04/18/2017 Shiki Reply Okay, well it says that 10.3.1 came out early April but did they actually test it out. I updated and it has been crashing my app and I feel the need to get a new phone. In my opinion this iOS is great just a minor mistakes in between. 04/29/2017 Winston Shaw Reply I lost my previous iPad 2 to an earlier Apple iOS update and Apple just smiled and said I’d just have to buy a new iPad. Cynic that I am I can’t help but wonder if the main purpose of these updates is to brick existing iPads and force users to replace them??? I can think of no other industry that is not held accountable for its “mistakes.” Maybe it’s time to rethink the rules these guys play by!

Earlier on Friday Qualcomm lowered its quarterly earnings forecast, noting that Apple, via its suppliers, had stopped making payments. "We've been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms," Apple told Axios in a statement. "Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court. As we've said before, Qualcomm's demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own." The context: Apple is suing Qualcomm for $1 billion and Qualcomm has filed a countersuit of its own. The legal battle is fraught for both sides, though, with Apple being one of Qualcomm's biggest customers and Apple needing Qualcomm's modems for the Verizon and Sprint versions of the iPhone.

Follow Axios Neal Rothschild 5 hrs ago Featured Trump unloads on press in WHCD-night speech Carolyn Kaster / AP President Trump used the night of the White House Correspondents' Dinner to unleash a prolonged diatribe against the news media. Speaking in Harrisburg, Pa. on day 100 of his presidency, he attacked: Keep reading ... words Those attending the WHCD: "A large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation's capital right now...I could not be more glad than to be more than 100 miles away from DC." Popular cable networks: "Media outlets like MSNBC and CNN are fake news." The New York Times: "Pretty soon they'll only be on the internet. The paper's getting smaller and smaller...like a comic book." In conclusion: "If the media's job is to be honest and tell the truth, then I think we would all agree the media deserves a very, very big fat failing grade." Claiming 'fake news' credit: "Everybody's using the term fake news. Where did you hear it first, folks?" Bonus dig from Mike Pence: "Left-wing activists and their willing allies in the media — while they've been ignoring the facts and spreading that fake news, the American people know the truth."

Neal Rothschild 5 hrs ago Featured Trump drums up accomplishments in campaign-style speech Patrick Semansky / AP On his 100th day in office, President Trump spoke for an hour in Harrisburg, Pa., outlining what he's done in office, while rehashing campaign talking points. Is there any place like a Trump rally? Keep reading ... words Accomplishments cited: Foreign relationships (Germany, Japan, China, and UK mentioned), Gorsuch appointment, TPP withdrawal, Buy American, Hire American executive order, bullish stock market, green light for Keystone and Dakota Access Pipeline construction, scrapping regulations, reduction in illegal border crossings, 28 bills passed, and return of Egyptian-American prisoner Aya Hijazi. Explaining decision not to label China a currency manipulator: "China is helping us possibly or probably with the North Korean situation, OK? Which is a great thing." Campaign déjà vu: "We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country." "We will repeal and replace Obamacare, you watch." "We will renegotiate NAFTA." "The previous administration gave us a mess." Show less Politics Link copied to clipboard. David Nather 5 hrs ago Featured Trump: Don't compare my health care plan to Obama's Carolyn Kaster / AP President Trump suggested tonight that it's not fair to compare the Republican health care plan to the Affordable Care Act, because the law is "dying, dying, dying" and won't be around anyway. "They always like to compare — well, what about [Obamacare]? Obamacare's dead," Trump said at a rally in Harrisburg, PA. "It's gone ... The insurance companies are fleeing." Between the lines: His comments suggested that he might try to use the law's problems — including the steep premium hikes last year — to dismiss the comparisons people are making to the GOP replacement plan, which aren't flattering. The biggest criticisms: it would cover 24 million fewer people than the ACA, and under some of the latest changes, it might not give the same protections to people with pre-existing conditions. Pass the "damn thing": "I'll be so angry at Congressman [Mike] Kelly and Congressman [Tom] Marino and all of our congressmen in this room if we don't get that damn thing passed quickly." (He later gave them a "just kidding" wave: "They'll get it done.") Health Care Link copied to clipboard. Stef W. Kight 8 hrs ago Featured Samantha Bee imagines the U.S. with Hillary as President TBS This afternoon TBS's Samantha Bee hosted her special edition of Full Frontal — Not the White House Correspondents' Dinner. She roasted CNN and Fox News as well as presidents Woodrow Wilson, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and George W. Bush — played by Will Ferrell who Bush recently praised for his SNL impressions on him. But of course, Donald Trump got the most of the roasts. The last act imagined a world in which Hillary Clinton was president. The highlights ... words The agenda: Opening the show, in a pre-recorded clip of Allison Janney playing the White House Press Secretary taking questions from internet trolls, Janney is asked if Ms. Bee was trying to undermine President Trump and the press with her event. Janney replies, "No, she's trying to undermine just one one of those." To which the crowd erupted in cheers and laughter. The kicker: The event took place in D.C. on the same day as the official White House Correspondents Dinner, which Donald Trump and his White House refused to attend. The puzzler: Barack Obama was notably left out of the roasts. Show less Politics Link copied to clipboard. David Nather 9 hrs ago Featured Ohio lawmakers might freeze Medicaid enrollment, defying Kasich Ron Schwane / AP Ohio's John Kasich is one of the most famous Republican governors to expand Medicaid, but GOP lawmakers weren't thrilled — and now they're looking at freezing Medicaid enrollment so they can pass the state budget, the Associated Press reports. "With Medicaid being such a huge issue in our budget, our answer can't be to put more people on," said state Rep. Larry Householder, who supports the freeze. The takeaway: Even GOP governors who went along with the expansion under the Affordable Care Act can't always maintain support within their party. If the freeze passes, it will put pressure on Kasich to show how deeply committed he is to the expansion. Health Care Link copied to clipboard. Alexi McCammond 10 hrs ago Featured Paul Manafort's foreign agent saga continues Carolyn Kaster / AP Mercury LLC, a Washington-based lobbying firm under Paul Manafort's direction, registered as a foreign agent yesterday, per the AP. They lobbied for and set up meetings with Ukrainian political officials in an attempt to influence the campaign based on their pro-Russian interests, specifically for former Russian President Yanukovych. Flashback: Earlier this month, Manafort was reportedly registering as a foreign agent, his spokesman James Maloni told AP. But yesterday, Maloni said that is no longer happening, despite what he said before. Manafort's role: The registration revealed that he was involved with the firm's lobbying work, attending meetings and offering consulting. One meeting (of the four he attended) was with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California — in 2014, after the meeting, he voted against an aid package intended for the government that replaced Yanukovych's, per AP. Furthermore, Manafort and Rick Gates, another Trump campaign aide, directed certain tasks for Mercury, making their lobbyists set up meetings with various Ukrainian senators and political officials. What's next: Manafort still needs to formally disclose his involvement with foreign, pro-Russian lobbying firms, so he's considering other options after receiving guidance from the federal authorities about that.

Kight 10 hrs ago Featured Facts Matter How the WHCD became a celebrity affair Evan Agostini / AP The issue: The 2017 White House Correspondents' Association dinner will go on, despite President Trump, all White House staff, and many celebrities declining the invitation. It has evolved significantly over the years, so how did it originate? The facts: The WHCA was founded in 1914 after there were (false) rumors that President Woodrow Wilson was selecting a small group of reporters to attend his press briefings. The association held their first dinner in 1920, and four years later, President Calvin Coolidge attended. The 1987 dinner had the first "celebrity" guest, according to the Washington Post, when Baltimore Sun correspondent Michael Kelly invited the beautiful administrative assistant Fawn Hall, who was involved in the Iran-Contra affair. This inspired a trend of inviting the most "newsworthy" or intriguing person whom reporters would want to talk about, making the dinner a Hollywood affair. Why it matters: Skeptics have said the event — where reporters party with government and are made celebrity-like — isn't journalistically kosher. For better or worse, it's become a tradition, which Trump has now broken... for this year, at least. Politics Link copied to clipboard. Mike Allen 11 hrs ago Featured Fox in a box Richard Drew / AP The profitable, influential, seemingly impregnable Fox News is suddenly vulnerable. In a massive disruption for right-wing media, Fox talent is on the market, the purge of the old-boy clique may continue, and there's huge internal paranoia about further lawsuits and revelations. On top of that, there are episodic pushes from the next generation of Murdoch leadership for changes in culture and personality. So at a time when all of cable is vulnerable as viewer habits change, Fox is caught between the America-first instincts of its base viewers, and the globalist impulses for Rupert Murdoch's sons. Keep reading ... words A woman to run Fox News? The Hollywood Reporter reports that James and Lachlan Murdoch have quietly put out feelers for a new head of Fox News to replace Bill Shine, the Roger Ailes consigliere. "[T]he preference ... is that the new leader be female." And competitors are moving to take advantage: Mediaite reports that "an alternative conservative network is being actively discussed amongst conservative fat cats": "[S]erious discussions are underway to create an alternative conservative cable network on the belief that the Fox News Network is moving too far to the left. ... The potential aim? Putting 'the old band' back together." "Sinclair Broadcasting [home of Sharyl Attkisson] expands its footprint," by Axios' Shannon Vavra and Sara Fischer: "[N]ew hires and acquisitions around the U.S. come at an optimal time to snatch up conservative audiences; TheBlaze and Fox News just let go of their star anchors, Tomi Lahren and Bill O'Reilly." Why it matters: Reinvigorated conservative media could help Trump as he heads toward midterms and a reelection race, with outlets scrambling to lock in Trump Nation with boosterish coverage.

Alexi McCammond 12 hrs ago Featured Trump's bizarre obsession with the election map Lee Jin-man / AP President Trump wanted to celebrate his 100th day in office with an image of the 2016 electoral map displayed on the front page of the Washington Post. "He encouraged me to take it home to my colleagues at the Washington Post and try to run it on the front page of our newspaper," said WaPo's Washington Correspondent Philip Rucker during a MSNBC interview Friday. Why it matters: It has been five months since the election and 100 days since Trump was sworn in as president, yet he continues to have a bizarre, never-ending obsession with how many electoral votes he received — with copies of the electoral map ready to present to anyone who will listen. Trump in 2012: "The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy." And then in 2016: The Electoral College is actually genius. -Trump Keep reading ... words Understanding the origin of his obsession Exactly one week after the election, Trump tweeted: "The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!" (See GIF below for how that played out.) This was seemingly the first time he recognized the EC as another intriguing layer to his hyper-competitive participation in the election — it became a challenge to overcome, something else to win. "I did what was almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College!" He then considered his feat an even greater win, thus strengthening his obsession. Big league accomplishment: "Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!" Reddit/Giphy One-track mind For Trump, there's never a wrong time to cite his electoral college victory: When asked about the rise of anti-Semitism during a February presser with Israeli PM: "Well, I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory we had. 306 Electoral College votes. We were not supposed to crack 220." During a joint presser with Canadian PM Trudeau, he was asked about deporting Syrian refugees and said, "That's what I said I would do. I'm just doing what I said I would do, and we won by a very, very large electoral college vote." In the middle of discussing Chinese President Xi Jinping with three Reuters reporters, Trump handed them three copies of the election map he had printed out that were sitting atop his desk in the Oval Office. "Here, you can take that, that's the final map of the numbers. It's pretty good, right? The red is obviously us." He gave a speech to the NRA yesterday, the first POTUS to do so since Raegan, and spent the first portion of it talking about his electoral college victory. He listed the states he won, touted his 306 (actually 304) EC votes. "Big sports fans said [the election] was the single most exciting event they're ever seen." 5 minutes into his speech at a Louisville rally in March, Trump called Nov. 8 "a beautiful day" adding "they weren't giving us a chance, saying, 'There is no way to 270.' ...And you remember for the Republicans, the Electoral College has been very, very hard to win."

Shannon Vavra 14 hrs ago Featured Facts Matter Why big oil companies are leaving Canada The issue Big international oil powerhouses (ConocoPhillips, Statoil, Shell) are pulling out or retreating (ExxonMobil) from their Canadian oil sands investments — a seemingly counterintuitive strategy given that the Canadian oil sands are the third largest reserve of crude oil in the world. The facts They're reconsidering to save on costs. The oil sands in Canada have some of the highest operating costs in the world paired with low profits. Plus, Canadian oil sands have greenhouse-intensive sources of crude oil and have limited pipeline access to markets, which leaves little flexibility for oil companies. Instead, some big oil is seeking out lower-cost and higher-stability operations in the Permian Basin in New Mexico and Texas, the second largest oil field in the world whose crude production increased in all but three months last year. Crude oil is expected to increase to 2.4 million barrels per day in May, according to the EIA. ExxonMobil, Shell, and Chevron (also considering leaving the Canadian oil sands) are already in on these advantages — they invested $10 billion this year in the Permian Basin. ConocoPhillips has legacy acreage in the basin, and is likely to increase production this year, too, per The Motley Fool. Why it matters Companies' departure from Canada's oil sands came as a shock on Wall Street, but it is becoming more common. Plus, this will shift international energy dynamics: Saudi Arabia, which has the largest oil field in the world ahead of the Permian Basin, could be weakened by this competing investment. And many of the Canadian companies now have room to nudge into their own oil sands and consolidate their ownership, giving them a competitive edge. Business Link copied to clipboard. Alexi McCammond 14 hrs ago Featured How Trump could pay more taxes under his plan A new NYT analysis of Trump's tax reform plan found the proposed changes would likely benefit high-income earners and could save him tens of millions of dollars in taxes. But, their findings also revealed one way Trump could actually pay more taxes if his reform plan is approved. More deductibles, more problems: Based on Trump's 2005 tax returns (the only documents available to the public), he could end up paying $3 to $5 million more in taxes for his deductions. That year he claimed more than $17 million in itemized deductibles — likely from his local and state income taxes while living in NYC, per the analysis — but only charity donations, mortgage interest, and retirement contributions would be deductible under his new plan.

We know for sure that all Apple fans are extremely curious to see the update for the iMac 2017. The Cupertino Company product hadn’t received an update in quite a while now. Moreover, Apple confirmed that they will be working on the new iMacs and we should receive official details soon enough. However, for now we have to do what we can with the rumors. Display Features One of the main rumors is the fact that the iMac 2017 will have a premium 8K display. Yep, 4K is a thing of the past already, or at least this is what it seems from the rumors. Internal Features Rumor has it that the high-end iMac 2017 will run on the Intel Xeon E3-1285 V6 CPU. It will also come with 64 GB RAM, plus 2 TB internal storage. Graphics Regarding the graphics, people speculate that the iMac 2017 may change the tradition of the mobile-class GPU. According to one leak, the machine might present a desktop-class GPU for the high-end version.  Needless to say, everybody is curious to see how the new product will perform. And one more thing: under these circumstances, Apple will compete directly with the rest of the desktops found on the market. Keyboard From what it seems, the iMac 2017 will not present the Magic keyboard like we are accustomed. Instead of that, we may see a special new keyboard that will most likely include a Touch Bar. As such, people are glad to see a comeback of the beloved Touch Bar, which is particularly handy for people who work in creative fields. According to the reports, the iMac will have the regular USB-C ports, together with the Lightning ones. The product should arrive sometime in the second half of this year, and everybody is curious to find out more!

On self-driving car testing in California, Waymo has asked the state to remove its liability proposal. (AFP) Other industry players, including Waymo Ford, Uber Toyota Motor and Tesla, also want the same Apple urged California to toughen up its proposed policy on testing self-driving cars, a move that would result in more public data that could help Apple catch up to rivals in the self-driving space by giving it a better window into their strengths and weaknesses. In a letter, Apple suggested a series of changes to the draft policy that is under development and said it looks forward to working with California and others "so that rapid technology development may be realised while ensuring the safety of the travelling public". Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet, Ford Motor, Uber Technologies, Toyota Motor, Tesla Motors and others also filed comments suggesting changes. California said on Tuesday it would review comments before deciding whether to make changes to the policy that aims to allow companies to test vehicles without traditional steering wheels and controls or human back-up drivers. The state is at the forefront of a crowded race to develop self-driving vehicles and the proposed changes from automakers and technology companies help provide insight into current efforts. In its letter, Apple said California should revise how companies report self-driving system "disengagements". California currently requires companies to report how many times the self-driving system was deactivated and control handed back to humans because of a system failure or a situation tied to traffic, weather or road conditions that required human intervention for safety reasons. But Apple wants those rules to extend to humans stepping in to prevent even minor traffic violations. Apple contends the reporting rules as written leave too much wiggle room for car makers and "caused public confusion and misunderstanding", wrote Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity. Apple also asked regulators to revisit language around the definition of an autonomous vehicle to clarify that permits are required in advanced systems even when a safety driver is present. The exact wording around when permits are needed became a sticking point between Uber and state officials last year when the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered Uber to cease its self-driving tests in San Francisco. Apple also said the state's rules for development vehicles used only in testing could "restrict both the design and equipment that can be used in test vehicles".   'Stifle innovation' Tesla said California should not bar testing of autonomous vehicles that are 10,000 pounds (4,535 kg) or more, a move that Apple also joined. Tesla said such a move could "stifle innovation", and bar a company from testing a heavy autonomous vehicle that might be used to haul parts on private property rather than on public roads, pushing developers in this sector out of the state. Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, in 2016 announced plans for new electric vehicles, including a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi and a public transport bus. The electric vehicle pioneer said earlier this month it plans to unveil a commercial truck in September. Tesla also said California should not prohibit the sale of non-self-driving vehicles previously used for autonomous vehicle testing. Tesla said that under the proposal, if it loads a vehicle with autonomous testing software and then replaces it with conventional production software it could be barred from selling the vehicle. Separately, Tesla is recruiting engineers from Mexico to work on robotics and other automated equipment at its California factory, according to LinkedIn postings viewed by Reuters, part of a hiring push to ready the plant for mass production of the upcoming Model 3. The electric vehicle maker, which prides itself on its "Made in America" credentials, aims to build 500,000 cars a year by 2018 at its plant in Fremont, California, south of San Francisco. That would be a six-fold increase from 2016. Uber, meanwhile, said California should allow paying members of the public to ride in autonomous vehicles with drivers, saying: "There is no reason to deny those riders an opportunity to travel in an autonomous test vehicle and provide honest feedback." Uber rival Lyft asked the state to remove a requirement that it notify local authorities of autonomous vehicle testing. Waymo asked California to remove its liability proposal. On Tuesday, General Motors had said the state's proposed liability rules could make automakers liable regardless of fault for any crash. GM also said that automakers should be allowed to reuse autonomous vehicles and parts after testing or if the vehicle is scrapped. Volkswagen and Daimler submitted joint comments seeking changes to the extent of data required to be retained in crashes involving self-driving cars. A number of automakers have said they plan to begin deploying self-driving vehicles, some in commercial fleets, by 2020-21.

Peter Bright (US) - Apr 29, 2017 12:23 pm UTC reader comments 222 Share this story Microsoft's third-quarter financial results were published yesterday, and they had many high points: cloud revenue is growing well (though we have some misgivings about how the numbers are reported), Windows outperformed the PC market, and Office 365 passed 100 million corporate seats. But there were a couple of significant black marks: Phone revenue has dropped to effectively zero, and Surface revenue was down sharply year on year, with a 26-percent drop in revenue. The phone revenue is no big surprise: Microsoft has all but abandoned the market, and the last phones to sport a Microsoft logo—the Lumia 950 and 950 XL—are no longer sold. The company has been winding down its phone operation, writing off the entire value of the phone business it bought from Nokia and laying off thousands of former Nokia employees in the process. But the story with Surface is more unsettling. In its analyst call, Microsoft ascribed the drop in Surface revenue to "product end-of-lifecycle dynamics," whatever that means. The company's 10Q filing used rather clearer language: Microsoft simply didn't sell as many Surface systems. The Surface range has two main products: the Surface Pro 4, a tablet-style two-in-one, and the Surface Book, a laptop with a detachable screen. These systems were launched in November 2015. The Surface Pro 4 available today, about 18 months later, is unchanged. Surface Book has been slightly updated—a variant with a better GPU was added in November 2016. But it, too, is little altered. These portable systems were joined late last year by the Surface Studio, a fascinating but flawed desktop system. With its high price—it starts at a dollar shy of three thousand bucks—and niche utility—it's compelling if you're in the market for a Wacom digitiser, but otherwise something of a curate's egg—Surface Studio is not designed to be a big seller with mainstream appeal. Microsoft didn't offer numbers, but we'd imagine that the majority of Surface sales are of the portables. The march of technology Eighteen months is a long time to wait for systems to be refreshed. The Pro 4 and Book were early adopters of Intel's Skylake processors, but Skylake is now a generation old. Kaby Lake, which started shipping last autumn, is not a huge advance over Skylake, but it's a more power-efficient design that offers meaningful improvements in battery life, improved encoding and decoding support for 4K video, and, for the low-power Y-series parts, meaningful improvements in performance. Surface Pro 4 uses a Y-series part in the cheapest model, and it would stand to make big gains from a Kaby Lake upgrade. Microsoft wouldn't even have to do much work to make such a switch; Kaby Lake is pretty much a drop-in replacement for Skylake. Enlarge / Microsoft's Surface Book. Nathan Fitch The last 18 months have also seen significant growth in the adoption of USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3, which offer standardised single-cable charging and docking. While Thunderbolt 3 is still young, hardware companies are experimenting with concepts such as Thunderbolt 3 monitors that charge laptops over the same cable used to carry the display signal, external GPUs, and docking stations that are no longer specific to particular hardware models (or even OEMs). Indeed, it feels like a natural fit for a revised version of the existing Surface Dock, or even, dare we dream, a standalone version of the mouth-wateringly beautiful touch screen of the Surface Studio. USB Type-C is rapidly gaining adoption; it has already become the norm for phone charging (for Android, at least) and increasingly is being favoured for laptop charging. The slimline ports enable thinner PCs, and the ability to use a single port for power, USB connectivity, and video output is compelling. No Surface product supports either technology. The Surface portable line-up, the bread and butter of the Surface brand, is looking very neglected. Further ReadingSurface Book with Performance Base: Finally arriving in the UK on April 20 At their release, the Pro 4 and Book were both arguably class-leading machines: 18 months later, they look sad and stale. Last November, we felt that we couldn't recommend the Surface Book's version with the updated GPU to most buyers—we couldn't justify buying a Skylake system with Nvidia 900-series graphics when the state of the art was Kaby Lake and 1000-series GPUs. Six months later, the machine looks even less appealing. With this stagnation, falling sales are inevitable. Until Microsoft shows the brand some love, the decline will only continue. We're not expecting to see that love any time soon, either; the company's guidance for the current quarter is that Surface sales will continue to fall. Microsoft is holding an event next week, and we expect there to be some hardware element, but we've also heard from sources close to the matter that there won't be updates to the Surface Pro or Surface Book. Either do hardware properly, or stop pretending If Microsoft wants to make PC hardware, it needs to do so properly and commit to the same kinds of updates as other PC OEMs. Almost every other PC OEM has refreshed its systems for Kaby Lake. Almost every other PC OEM has adopted, at least for machines in the premium space that Surface occupies, USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3. Surface Pro—a machine which, in its early generations, arguably defined that particular style of two-in-one systems—is no longer unique. HP, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, and others all have solid two-in-one offerings. These machines are modelled after the Surface Pro concept, but they now embody that concept better than Microsoft's own system. The Surface has been out-Surfaced. The failure to do anything with Surface for so long makes us wonder just what Microsoft is up to. If the company is serious about its hardware ambitions—and officially, at least, it still says that its intent is to produce market-leading systems under the Surface brand—then it has to take its hardware seriously. That means refreshing it to keep pace with the competition. Further ReadingImagining a new Mac Pro, the “iMac Pro,” and the future of Apple’s desktops One hardware company has a similarly lackadaisical approach to updating: Apple. In recent years, refreshes of Mac laptops and desktop systems across the lineup have slowed down. While the company has been quick to pick up Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C on at least some of its machines, the broader failure to keep pace with the state of the art is a continued source of frustration for Apple loyalists. But Apple's hardware sales remain robust, because Apple, in a very important way, is not like Microsoft or any other PC OEM: if you want to run macOS in a legal and supported way, you simply have no option but to buy Apple hardware. There's no corresponding necessity when it comes to buying Surface. Microsoft is but one Windows OEM of many, and if Microsoft's hardware isn't offering the right feature mix, a system from HP or Dell or Lenovo or Samsung or some other company probably will. It's fine for Microsoft to take inspiration from Apple's close cooperation between hardware and software development; it's not fine for Microsoft to mimic Apple's unpredictable and inconsistent system refresh policies. The PC market dynamics don't allow it. Enlarge / Instead of a full refresh, Microsoft released the Surface Book with Performance Base. The base is a little fatter, its battery is bigger, and its GPU is faster. Peter Bright When Microsoft first started making hardware, there was widespread uncertainty as to what the company was hoping to do. General consensus was that Redmond's aim was to serve as a kind of trailblazer, building the kinds of systems that the company wanted to see in the world while pushing the PC market in the direction it wanted. But this kind of hobby approach is a problem. Without assurances of a long-term commitment to hardware development, many would-be customers will avoid the systems. This is particularly acute in the corporate space: support lifecycles and extended system availability are essential when buying a fleet of systems. Microsoft recognised this concern and took action to address it. Surface systems were offered through the usual corporate channel partners like Ingram Micro and through cloud subscriptions, and the company promised that Surface Pro 3 peripherals would remain compatible with Surface Pro 4. The message was clear: Microsoft wasn't merely dabbling in hardware, it was investing in building a serious hardware brand. After some early missteps, the hardware was solid and well-received, revenue grew steadily, and Surface looked like it was becoming an integral part of Microsoft's ecosystem. That feels like it's now in jeopardy. Troubling precedent It doesn't help that Microsoft's hardware track record is more than a little shaky, and scepticism about its commitment and seriousness to hardware is well-earned. After a difficult start, Windows Phone was finally on an upward trajectory, especially in the EU where, in some countries, it had broken double-digit market share. But lackluster hardware—including a complete failure to offer a competitive new flagship phone in 2014—and lack of clear messaging saw a complete reversal of fortunes. The ultimate result was felt this quarter: Phone revenue is now essentially zero, even as work on the mobile version of Windows 10 continues. Enlarge / The last high-end phones Microsoft released were the Lumia 950 (pictured) and 950 XL, which came out in November 2015. Peter Bright Surface RT and Surface 2, Microsoft's ARM-based two-in-one machines, similarly raise questions about the company's commitment to hardware. Although Windows 10 itself has been built for ARM systems (and a version of Windows 10 for ARM is on the market in the Internet of Things guise), Microsoft opted not to offer a Windows 10 upgrade for Surface RT or Surface 2. This leaves the machines basically orphaned. Microsoft's inaction has taken a promising prestige PC brand and turned it into a borderline embarrassment. The question of whether Microsoft cares about hardware and is in it for the long haul is once again a live one. We've seen similar levels of neglect before. It was ruinous for the Nokia phone business and devastating for Windows Phone. Windows on the desktop is, of course, going to prove more robust—it doesn't live and die on the fortunes of Surface in the way that Windows Phone hinged on Nokia and Lumia. But everything invested in building the Surface brand is now in doubt. Further ReadingFull Windows 10 is coming to ARM, this time with 32-bit x86 compatibilityThat's bad for anyone who likes the machines, including those corporate buyers who have made the leap to Microsoft hardware. It's even worse for the software company's future ambitions: later this year, we're going to see a new generation of ARM machines running Windows. But with the way the company has treated its other hardware endeavors, who would want to take the gamble? Microsoft has developed a habit of ignoring and abandoning its niche hardware platforms; what reason is there to believe that Windows 10 for ARM will be any different?

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Waiting for iPhone 8 this year? Don't hold your breath Apple will instead continue its iPhone line with iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models this year. Sami Khan   April 29, 2017 17:55 IST Apple is rumoured to make significant modifications to its next-generation iPhone 8 to compete against Samsung's radically designed Galaxy S8.Apple There's a lot of chatter about the new iPhone 8 coming this year, which is going to be a big deal since it marks the tenth year anniversary of the first iPhone. Apple has been rumoured to make significant improvements, possibly the biggest ones we've seen so far. The launch of the 2017 iPhone is still months away, but that hasn't stopped rumours, leaks and speculations from forming a rough idea of what to expect from Apple this year. So far, everything about the iPhone 8 looks promising, from OLED display to a redesigned glass back and no home button, but it looks like the hopes of millions of fans will be shattered. As per a fresh report, citing some gossip from the Foxconn sources, Apple has placed orders for iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Foxconn is Apple's biggest supplier of iPhones and also the world's largest electronics manufacturer. We haven't been able to verify the authenticity of the source yet, but if true, this might spell trouble for Apple. Apple fans are riding high on the hopes to see an iPhone 8 (also called iPhone X and iPhone Edition), and the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus would bring disappointment. Going by Apple's tradition, any succeeding model with the moniker "s" is a plain upgrade over the predecessor. Let's take iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s for instance. While the iPhone 6 was the first iPhone ever to have ditched the signature 4-inch screen and come with massive design overhaul, the iPhone 6s looked pretty much the same with only some incremental upgrades under the hood. In this case, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s would replicate the iPhone 7 and bring some upgrades that may seem worthy, but not meet the high expectations of fans and critics. But all this could be just a rumour, like many other speculations. The source also added that the packaging materials for the new iPhones will start arriving at Foxconn in the last week of June, which is when we will have a clear idea of what the new iPhones might look like. That's if the packaging materials slip through the tight doors of the manufacturing facilities. In any case, Apple will be celebrating its tenth year iPhone anniversary this year. If the latest report holds true, it is safe to assume that the Cupertino tech giant might launch a third model with top-notch specs and massive changes, something that has been speculated in the past.

Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, said it will not receive royalties from Apple`s contract manufacturers for sales made during the quarter ended March 31. San Diego, California-based Qualcomm also slashed its profit and revenue forecasts for the current quarter, to account for the lost royalty revenue. Qualcomm`s shares fell 4 percent to $51.06 in premarket trading. Apple sued Qualcomm in January, accusing the company of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. "Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court," an Apple spokesman said via email on Friday. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm`s revenue in its most recent fiscal year. "Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade," Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm`s general counsel, said in a statement on Friday. Qualcomm said it now expects revenue of $4.8 billion-$5.6 billion for its third fiscal quarter, down from the $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion it had previously expected. Qualcomm lowered its forecast for current-quarter adjusted profit to 75-85 cents per share, from 90 cents-$1.15 per share. "(Apple`s) contract manufacturers may make some form of partial payment, but initial indications are that any payment would likely be insignificant," Qualcomm said. Qualcomm added that its earlier forecast had accounted for several payment scenarios, but did not include a situation where no payment was made and no revenue was recognized. Through Thursday, Qualcomm`s shares had fallen about 17 percent since Apple filed its lawsuit.   TAGS Apple IncRoyalty paymentsQualcomm IncQualcomm chipsApple sales Economy Petrol prices likely to get cheaper by Rs 2 per litre From Zee News 10 Photos which prove Zaheer Khan – Sagarika Ghatge make an...

From Trump’s tax proposals to crude oil’s struggles to retain the $50 mark to the Nasdaq Composite cruising above 6,000 for the first time, there are a lot of headlines worth watching. However, we are still in the thick of earnings season. And for many companies, the specific successes and failures they show in their first-quarter results could matter much more than the headlines scrolling across the bottom of your favorite cable news show. In fact, there are seven big-name companies with a lot at stake in the next few days. These reports could not only spark a big short-term move, but plot a course for these stocks across the rest of the year that doesn’t waver much regardless of what the broader picture holds. Here are seven must-watch earnings that you should keep your eye on over the next week: Frontier Communications, after the close on Tuesday Frontier Communications Corp. FTR, -1.57%  is the worst performer in the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.19%  year-to-date with a decline of 46%. That’s because Frontier is having issues integrating Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -1.63%  landline operations, struggling mightily against secular declines in the cable TV business and facing the sad reality that it can’t compete with the scale of big telecoms. Many investors have hung on for the quarterly dividend of 10.5 cents a share –—a staggering 23% annual yield at current prices — but this could very well be the earnings report that sees those distributions slashed or eliminated. If that happens, look out below. Apple, after the close on Tuesday Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.10% reported strong fiscal first-quarter numbers in January, posting record earnings and revenue for the all-important holiday season. As a result, shares of Apple are now up about 24% year-to-date vs. more than 6% gains for the broader market in the same period. But will the snapback in iPhone sales continue in advance of the gadget’s 10th anniversary and newest offering in a few months? Wall Street is still optimistic, but a report that fails to meet the market’s lofty expectations could result in tough going for Apple stock this summer. Also read: Apple earnings: As users spend more, services revenue grows Tesla, after the close on Wednesday Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.76%  is once again expecting to post a quarterly loss, but that hasn’t stopped Wall Street from bidding up shares to a new all-time high in advance of this all-important earnings report. Profits have long been second place to growth metrics and the overall tone Elon Musk & Co. present about the growth and evolution of the business. Particularly noteworthy this time will be plans for the mass-market Model 3 electric car and the outlook for production capacity. If Tesla shows it’s living up to the hype — or better yet, wows analysts with another ambitious idea — then shares should power higher. If the tone is subdued and the numbers are soft, expect downside and volatility for the stock. Read: It’s all about the Model 3 amid a record run for Tesla stock Square, after the close on Wednesday While Jack Dorsey took plenty of heat for deciding to split time as CEO of both Twitter Inc. TWTR, -0.78%  and Square Inc. SQ, +0.05% the latter has certainly come into its own recently under his leadership. During the past six months, Square is up more than 60% vs. about 12% gains for the S&P 500 in the same period. That success is driven in large part thanks to impressive earnings in February that included a much narrower loss and revenue that topped expectations. That sparked a double-digit gain in just two trading days for Square … but will the latest numbers mirror that success and keep momentum going, or will Square stumble? Fitbit, after the close on Wednesday Fitbit Inc. FIT, -3.54%  is stuck in a rather unprofitable rut, and set to see sales decline by double digits this year to boot. But it’s banking big on R&D and new products, including the Fitbit Charge 2 and Fitbit Flex 2 that dropped in late 2016. Sure, the company is synonymous with wearable fitness trackers, but if those new products don’t pan out and start to show an upgrade cycle among users, then who cares what else is coming in the next few quarters? On the other hand, the stock is near all-time lows, and expectations might be so depressed that even a glimmer of hope on Wednesday could cause some short squeezes and bottom-fishing on Wall Street. Read: 5 doomed stocks to sell in May Facebook, after the close on Wednesday Facebook Inc. FB, +1.73%  has moved in a nearly constant march higher since mid-2013, thanks in part to a nonstop string of earnings beats since 2013. Despite its scale, Facebook continues to grow and thrive, but how long can it last? Problems with fake news and overstated video ad views have started to crop up in the past year, but that hasn’t stopped shares from surging 30% year-to-date. Can Facebook keep it up, or will it produce numbers that instead prompt investors to worry about growth or its current valuation? Activision Blizzard, after the close on Thursday Activision Blizzard ATVI, +0.65% has soared more than 50% in the past 12 months, winning over investors as it established a steady flow of in-game revenue from its hit titles. Of course, it has also been panned by serious gamers as a company that has put profits before the user experience with “pay-to-win” games that reward credit-card swipes over actual skill. So far, there has been nothing but good news from blockbuster titles like “Call of Duty” and “Overwatch” raking in the cash. But investors need to closely watch digital sales to see if the company is at risk of pumping this well dry too quickly, or if it really has figured out a better way to make money off gaming. In 2016, Activision nearly doubled its digital sales over 2015, and the trajectory in 2017 will truly make or break this stock.

By TimMullaney Writer In the predictions biz, it’s inevitable that you’re wrong sometimes. Or “early,” “premature,” “half-right,” or the other excuses we use. But here’s a prediction I’d thought I’d stash in a dark corner of my archive of 2015-era foolishness, which suddenly looks correct after all: Apple AAPL, -0.10%   may still hit $1 trillion in stock-market value in 2017, and second-quarter earnings May 2 may make this even clearer. That, at least, is the analysis of Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha, whose report last week said Apple’s worth $170 to $176 a share. The higher number works out to $935 billion in market valuation, up from above $754 billion at Friday’s close — close to the $1 trillion target. The best part: None of the weaker parts of 2015’s Trillion-Dollar-Apple case have to come true to make it likely. Back then, I was skeptical of all three members of the Holy Trinity of the Fanboy Case. Apple Pay is, as I predicted, a rounding error in Apple’s greater scheme, while the Apple Car program is still vaporware (despite the company asking for permission to test driverless cars on California roads). And the Apple Watch sold an estimated $2.6 billion worth of watches in the holiday quarter, a pace for about a third of what bullish 2015 estimates supposed. Instead, Garcha says Apple’s services business, which includes Apple Pay but also the much larger App Store and iTunes businesses, is the driver; he says it can double revenue, to $52 billion, though he’s vague about when. Other analysts, and me, think the stock’s real driver is the iPhone 8, with new features like wireless charging and an all-glass front surface sparking forecasts that the initial production run will top 100 million units. What I missed back then was the drop in sales to Greater China that would slam Apple shares last year. I said Apple’s value would hit $1 trillion in early 2017; thanks to China, now it looks like the fourth quarter, or early 2018. That’s not the worst mistake: Calculating when markets might stop ignoring flaws, like China’s debt load, that have long been apparent is more art than science. At least I didn’t predict 2018 Watch sales of $26 billion like Deutsche Bank. My calculation then was that Apple needed profits to boost its operating business’ valuation to about $750 billion from $600 million, while its then-$140 billion cash pile grew to $250 billion. But Apple has generated so much cash since then that the job has gotten easier: It looks likely to have $350 billion in cash by year-end, so the operating business only needs to be worth $650 billion. That’s not difficult: Garcha’s says Apple will make $73.7 billion this fiscal year before non-cash charges, taxes and interest. A $650 billion valuation is 8.7 times that, modest even for a relatively mature company, let alone one boosting EBITDA by double digits this year and next. So what happened to let Apple maybe hit the target after all? A few not-very-complicated things. First, China stabilized. The 47% drop in the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.08%   from June 2015 to January 2016 helped Apple’s Greater China sales drop 17% in fiscal 2016. But it ended, as market panics tend to do. You don’t have to think China’s stocks are now undervalued — I don’t — to believe that an economy growing 6%-plus per year can let local sales stabilize, or even make up some losses. Second, iPhone sales have been pretty good. Even with China’s problems, iPhone sales rose 5% in the first quarter. Third, Apple’s cash pile grew faster than I expected. As Apple had $247 billion of cash and securities on Dec. 31, matching the $250 billion I thought it would have this year. Given that Apple had almost $24 billion in free cash flow in the December 2016 quarter, the idea that this could be $350 billion by December isn’t far-fetched. That’s because… Fourth, the iPhone 8 got closer to market. With all those cool new features. Sure, Apple could still fall short. Garcha’s analysis assumes Apple builds its high-margin services business through high-profile acquisitions like Disney DIS, -0.21%   or Netflix NFLX, -0.57% which are speculative. China is debt-ridden and untransparent, as ever. And putting Apple’s offshore cash to work — say, to buy Disney — depends on President Donald Trump getting a corporate-tax bill through Congress. But the real case for Apple, blurred by the mad love of its trade press, is that the iPhone’s a machine, the services businesses grew 22% last year, and cash is real money. Investing should always be so straightforward.

It's capable of delivering desktop-grade performance in a compact, manageable size. Apple's tablet celebrated its one -year birthday last month, so it comes as no surprise that retailers are offering solid discounts on Apple's tablet. However, none beat Best Buy's current sale. The retailer is taking $100 off all iPad Pro 9.7-inch WiFi models with price starting at $499.99 for the 32GB model, $599.99 for the 128GB model, and $699.99 for the 256GB model. Each tablet is $100 cheaper than Apple's price. When it comes to portability, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro leads the field beating larger competitors like Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 and the Samsung Galaxy TabPro S. At 0.98 pounds, it's also about a half pound lighter than the immediate competition. Buy on Best Buy The iPad Pro uses Apple's desktop-like A9X processor. It has a glorious 2048 x 1536 resolution display paired with 2GB of RAM. That keeps the tablet running smooth no matter what you're doing. Other benefits of the iPad Pro are a 12-MP rear camera, 5-MP FaceTime camera, and the ability to record 4K video. You could argue that the new $329 iPad is a better value, but the iPad Pro has it beat with a better screen, better graphics performance, and stylus support.  Currently at $100 off, it's as cheap as it's ever been.

Andrew Small @ASmall_Word Apr 28, 2017 Comments Share on Facebook Tweet A woman pushes a car in front of "The Spirit of East Harlem" mural in New York City. (Eduardo Munoz/Reuters) As America’s mightiest metropolis, New York City serves as both outlier and example. The Big Apple’s economy dwarfs nations, but slice the city into its five boroughs and stark class divisions appear. A new report from New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer reveals just how profoundly the city has been transforming in the 21st century by comparing business and neighborhood details in 2000 and 2015. Dig around in the data and you’ll find detailed portraits of the city before and after gentrification, for better or worse. The report leads with the good news: The number of businesses has increased and business establishment growth picked up more in the 22 lower-income communities of the city (an increase of 41 percent) than the 33 higher-income districts (an increase of 12 percent). The report touts the growth of high-income industries in these neighborhoods. Data from United States Census Bureau. “Zip Code Business Patterns.” 2000-2015. (NYC Comptroller) But business growth was even more pronounced in gentrifying neighborhoods. The 15 gentrifying neighborhoods as identified by the Furman Center saw a 45 percent jump in the number of businesses (a 45 percent increase from 28,132 to 42,261). As the report notes, all but one of the neighborhoods with the fastest business growth were gentrifying, with the biggest increases in Central Harlem and Crown Heights. Greenpoint and Williamsburg weren’t far behind. The ten New York City neighborhoods with the largest business growth from 2000 to 2015 (NYC Comptroller) Another thing to celebrate according the report: more grocery stores, banks, and restaurants. The number of supermarkets—defined as grocery stores with 10+ employees—rose 68 percent (from 189 to 318), retail banks 47 percent (from 199 to 292), and retail and restaurants 62 percent (from 10,562 to 17,144). In East New York and Starrett City, the number of supermarkets jumped from 7 to 29; in Bedford Park, Fordham North, and Norwood from 17 to 31; and in Crown Heights North and Prospect Heights from 6 to 17. The summary also points to business growth that create jobs with higher average wages outside of Manhattan. Businesses in professional and technical services more than doubled (from 992 to 1,987) in the four boroughs where those jobs pay an average yearly wage of $56,666. Information business increased from 278 to 547 in an industry that pays an average wage of $73,062 outside Manhattan. They point to increases in middle-class industries as well, with another 931 construction businesses growing, 380 transportation and warehousing businesses, and 222 wholesale trade businesses. The raw demographic turnover suggests not everyone shares in a neighborhood’s economic success. But there’s bad news in the report, too (even when it looks good). The largest business growth outside of Manhattan from 2000 to 2015 was a 128 percent increase in accommodation and food services. But this big job growth has been in a low-wage sector: The average yearly wage is $21,538 outside of Manhattan. While businesses increased citywide, 82 percent of business establishments in lower-income neighborhoods had fewer than ten employees. Worse, New York City has gone in the wrong direction on black-owned businesses—a steep 31.4 percent decline from 2007 to 2012, compared to the national average of 2.4 percent increase, as indicated in the table below. Black-owned businesses in America’s 25 largest cities with at least 500 businesses (NYC Comptroller) The second part of the report, the Neighborhood Economic Profiles, is a data-rich snapshot of the city’s five boroughs and 55 sub-boroughs in 2000 and 2015. With top-lines on the number of businesses, median household income, and the unemployment rate, it’s a good way to take stock of how each individual neighborhood has changed in a decade and a half. Borough Businesses in 2015 Percent Change Median Household Income Unemployment Rate in 2015 Unemployment Rate in 2000 Bronx 17,705 26% $35,000 10.3% 13.5% Brooklyn 56,341 48% $50,200 7.7% 9.9% Manhattan 105,553 -2% $74,600 5.9% 8.1% Queens 48,477 33% $60,000 6.9% 7.3% Staten Island 9,122 22% $71,000 5.2% 5.8% The report rolls through neighborhood-level business creation stats (14 industries and eight sub-sectors), employment numbers, and the population of individual income brackets. However, the report’s neighborhood-specific format does not lend itself easily to parsing out a comparison of this granular data on neighborhood demographics (age, education, birth place, race) and urban indicators (land use, work place, and commute method). So CityLab asked the NYC Comptrollers Office to compile the data they collected into a spreadsheet. Ten neighborhoods with the largest percent decline in population of black residents from 2000 to 2015, compared with white population. (Andrew Small/CityLab) With a few adjustments, such as highlighting the neighborhoods according to the Furman Center’s definitions of gentrifying (yellow), high income (green), and non-gentrifying (blue) neighborhoods and adding column filters to sort the data by each variable, we can dissect the neighborhood changes a lot more closely. The above table, for example, ranks the ten sub-boroughs where the population of black residents has had the largest percentage decrease. Or take a look at this next chart, which shows where the white population has increased the most since 2000. In Bed-Stuy, the share of white residents increased by 1,235 percent, while the black population decreased by 17 percent. Ten neighborhoods with the largest percent increase in population of white residents from 2000 to 2015, compared to black residents. (Andrew Small/CityLab) Though some scholars dispute gentrification’s impact on displacement, with regression analysis failing to see a one-to-one relationship between people moving in and people out, the raw demographic turnover suggests not everyone shares in a neighborhood’s economic success. The Comptroller’s report acknowledges these disparities and has recommendations to address the barriers to entry and advancement. With a set of more sophisticated statistical tools, this data could reward further study, especially given its population profiles for different economic tiers: We’re working an a fuller map to show what these factors look like across the city.

Keeping in mind the scale of the technology in the state, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) proposed some regulations governing the use of the technology on the state roads in March. On Friday, some companies invested in the technology — including tech giant Apple — petitioned the state to consider changing its proposed rules. Read: Apple Self-Driving Technology: 5 Facts You Need To Know ​ “Apple believes that all those developing and deploying automated vehicles should follow rigorous safety principles in design, testing, and production. Such principles should not, however, inhibit companies from making consequential progress—there is no need to compromise safety or innovation,” Steve Kenner Director of Product Integrity, Apple said in a letter addressed to Brian G. Soublet, deputy director and chief counsel, Department of Motor Vehicles, Legal Affairs Division, State of California. Tesla had written a similar letter to the DMV on Monday in which it had been even more explicit than Apple in its opposition to the proposed rules “NHTSA’s Policy explicitly states that the Safety Assessment requested in the Vehicle Performance Guidance is a voluntary submission that is not a necessary precursor to testing AVs on public roads or as part of a state’s test program," the company wrote in the letter. "Notwithstanding, the DMV’s Rulemaking requires manufacturers to submit a copy of their Safety Assessment to NHTSA as part of their application to test AVs that do not require a human driver as well as their application to deploy AVs on public roads. In doing so, the DMV inappropriately transfers federal regulatory authority to itself and contravenes the spirit of voluntary cooperation that NHTSA intended for with the Safety Assessment." "Tesla instead believes that the DMV should strive for consistency with NHTSA’s Policy and the Rulemaking should instead request (without imposing a requirement) for manufacturers to submit a Safety Assessment,” Tesla added, voicing its opposition to the proposed safety rules by the state authority.  Both the companies have concerns about how the proposed rules require the companies to report "disengagements" with the self-driving vehicles and state that the rules might restrict the design of and equipment used in self-driving vehicles, which would in turn “stifle innovation.” The companies argue that the rules should require reporting only serious instances of disengagements, which require human drivers to take over control to avoid accidents or violating traffic rules.  Furthermore, Apple says that the state’s restriction on using self-driving vehicles without a human driver should be removed, as it would act as an impediment to testing cars autonomously. Read: Are Self-Driving Cars Safe? One In Four Cars On U.S. Roads In 2035 Will Be Self-Driven, Study Says Self-driving legislation presents a unique opportunity for lawmakers, as the technology basically differs from the foundation on which traffic rules are formulated — human driving. The new technology is expected to eventually remove, or at least reduce, the reliance on human driving. Traffic rules, traffic lights and even roads might be needed to be designed to accommodate self-driving vehicles once the technology becomes mainstream.

This wireless charging won't be like what Samsung and LG offer on its latest flagships that requires you to place the phone on the charger. The technique was laid out in a patent that Apple filed in US and first reported by AppleInsider. Titled "Wireless Charging and Communications Systems With Dual-Frequency Patch Antennas", the patent lists several ideas how the company can make the next level of wireless charging work. Also Read: iPhone 8 rumour roundup: True Tone OLED display, wireless charging and more It shows working at the heart is a basic cellular and Wi-Fi technology similar to what mobile phone towers and Wi-Fi routers already use to route calls or internet data. The only difference is, instead of transferring voice and data signals, these cellular (700MHz-2700MHz) and Wi-Fi signals (2.4 GHz-60GHz) will transfer electric power. At the receiving end will be a Patch Antenna slapped on the phone's back, literally made in form of a patch that could take the charge from wireless signal and give it to the battery. The fact that true wireless charging is nearly impossible to achieve, even on paper, it does makes the Apple patent a stuff of innovation. But it is still a patent and not a working technology so take this with a bag of salt. The concept of directing all the signal strength in a particular direction is termed beem steering and Apple's AirPort routers already use them to max out communication speeds. But the patent lists new technologies like dual mode circuitry, dual-polarization, dual-frequency patch antennas consistent with beam forming layouts and talks of integrating the communications and power transfer circuitry for the wireless charging to happen in mid-air. The transmitter will communicate with the patch antenna to effectively locate the device in its range and direct all the power to it, maximizing the power transferred. Though theoretically, Apple could make this work on paper. However, the charging power carried by these waves to the nearby mobile phone would be much lesser in comparison to that transferred by your regular charger. Though Apple might be able to achieve better results someday using highly efficient components but the technology is highly unlikely to make its way on the upcoming anniversary edition of the 2017. Also Read: iPhone 8 dummy unit showcases design similar to original iPhone Some new sketches of the back of the iPhone 8 leaked by Onleaks (above) recently showed that space for a squircle patch is left out underneath the rear of the phone. It clearly looks very similar in size to the wireless charging paraphernalia on the Galaxy S8, which hints the next iPhone could get inductive cable-free charging it is long rumoured for. But it would still need to be kept on a pad.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Apple stops paying iPhone royalties to Qualcomm Apple is withholding payments to contract manufacturers that are owed to Qualcomm until the legal dispute between the two companies is resolved. As a result, Qualcomm has slashed its current-quarter profit and revenue forecasts. The company has lowered its revenue guidance to a range of $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion for the fiscal third quarter from $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. Apple had sued Qualcomm in January this year saying that Qualcomm has been charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. Now Apple is withholding payments to those third-party suppliers, which those suppliers would then normally pay to Qualcomm. Earlier this month, Qualcomm responded to Apple suit over patent licensing and has also filed countersuit including charge of limiting performance of Qualcomm modem chips in iPhone 7. Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm said, Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm’s licensees. These license agreements remain valid and enforceable. While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts. Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade. Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm. We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Tech Leak Shows Apple Is Having Issues By Costea Lestoc. Published on April 29, 2017. 0 Recently, both Bloomberg and Ming-Chi Kuo, the reputed Apple analyst, reported that Apple has been confronting with some technical issues, and this in turn may lead to the delay of the release of their 2017 flagship device. Now a third source comes to confirm this, and we refer to Nikkei, which is the largest financial newspaper in the world. What Does the Report Say? According to this new source, the production for the new iPhone, which also marks the 10th anniversary of this brand, is encountering some serious difficulties. From what we gathered until now, the suppliers are trying hard to finish up essential components of the device, such as the display, the wireless charging technology, plus the printed circuit boards. Nikkei also reported that Samsung is having trouble with fulfilling the supply of OLED panels for Apple’s new flagship device. Meanwhile, Arthur Liao from Fubon Securities also declared that Apple is attempting to find a solution for the overheating problem with the wireless modules. Sean Kao from IDC adds that there are some problems with the circuit boards produced in mass. But There Are Some Good News Too Kao also said that the problems with the production stem from the fact that the design they conceived was made for a smaller printed circuit board, and thus it can’t allow a much more powerful battery. Moreover, there are some other reports that show Apple also relies on a Plan B. All the sources said that Apple would rather delay the release date than compromise on the quality. And of course, most fans are okay with this, since everybody wants a quality product. Nikkei showed that the delay may even reach too months, which would mean that the new phone would be released quite close to Christmas.

Apple seems to be working on new ways to charge iPhones and iPads wirelessly without using the signals emitted by radio frequencies such as Wi-Fi. The company recently filed a patent that will allow users to charge their iPhones and iPad without physically plugging the cable. The new way proposes directing the electromagnetic frequencies, normally used for data transmission, towards device as a "beam" of energy. Apple has been working on new ways to charge its devices for a long time now. It first filled a patent to wirelessly charge the iMac at a distance of on metre back in 2010. Apple was also reportedly working with partners to develop this system for mobile devices. It was said to feature with the iPhone as early as 2017. If the rumours are to be believed, Apple will introduce the technology with its tenth anniversary iPhone, slated to launch in September this year. The company has also roped in an industry group called the Wireless Power Consortium in February.  There are claims that indicate that Apple might not introduce the short-range "inductive" wireless charging seen on the Apple Watch and its rival Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S8. Instead, it will only introduce the technology when it had developed a log-range system. There are rumours floating that the next iPhone will feature a "inductive charging station". The smartphone is also rumoured to come with a glass case that could support the feature.

(Reuters) South Korean giant Samsung Electronics regained the top status in the global smartphone market in the first quarter of the year, even before the release of its flagship Galaxy S8, a report said on Saturday. According to market research firm IDC, the South Korean tech giant sold about 7.9 million smartphones during the January-March period to account for a market share of 22.8 per cent. Its US arch-rival Apple came in second with a 14.9 per cent share. The latest figure marks a turnaround from the October-December period of 2016 when Apple stood as the top player. Stung by the suspension of the Galaxy Note 7 phablet, Samsung still managed to take up 18.5 per cent of the market in the fourth quarter of last year. Also watch: The company stopped the production of the smartphone following reports of the devices catching fire while charging. Also, Huawei Technologies, Oppo and Vivo followed Apple and Samsung in the top five, with a combined market share of 22.4 per cent in the first quarter this year, up from 18.7 per cent tallied a year earlier. Huawei led the pack with a 9.8 per cent market share during the same period, nearly posting a double-digit market share, the data showed. Oppo followed with a 7.4 per cent market share and Vivo with 5.4 per cent, according to the data. Pre-orders for its new flagship Galaxy S8 and S8+ devices have reached 80,000 units within a week of the launch in India and are expected to hit 150,000 units by the end of this month. No Comments.

Given Echo’s success ( Echo Look announcement notwithstanding), there doesn’t really seem to be a way for Apple to avoid creating such a device, particularly if it wants to become a meaningful smart home player — which it does. Investors have been hearing about Apple’s ” Echo killer ” for months, and some new details may be emerging from the rumor mill. Echo has become a runaway success. Image source: Amazon. Rumor has it Known tech leaker Sonny Dickson shared some purported details about the device on social media yesterday. The Mac maker is reportedly finalizing its designs. Like tvOS, which is essentially a heavily modified version of iOS, the new device may also run a „variant” of Apple’s mobile operating system. It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run an variant iOS – Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 Mashable reached out to Dickson and got more details. More claims from @SonnyDickson on Apple’s Alexa competitor: -Think Mac Pro style. – Same style UE boom mesh. – Possible release WWDC. 2/2 – Jen Ryall (@jennijenni) April 28, 2017 The product should look similar to Apple’s current Mac Pro, which is to say you could potentially mistake it for a trash can (or is it a jet engine?). It could have mesh portions covering the speakers with a concave top where the controls are located. Perhaps most importantly, we could get a glimpse of the device as early as WWDC, Apple’s worldwide developer conference, which takes place June 5-9 this year in San Jose, California. Questions remain That pretty much sums up the recent leaks. But as usual, what’s harder to ascertain may be more important to investors. It’s not unusual for hardware details to leak out of the supply chain, but things like pricing strategy or product branding don’t produce physical evidence, and those have greater impact on Apple’s competitiveness. The flagship Echo costs $180, while Alphabet ‚s Google Home costs $129. There should be little doubt that Apple will price its response at a premium, so we’re probably talking about a price point of $200 or $250, if not more. The challenge here is that while Apple almost always comes in at the top of a market, Siri has been pretty underwhelming compared to Alexa or Google Assistant. Since the virtual assistant is utterly critical to the user experience given the voice-activated nature of this category, it’s much harder to justify premium pricing. Apple is also behind its rivals in terms of third-party integrations and search capabilities, only really opening up Siri to third-party developers less than a year ago with a Siri SDK. Maybe Apple hopes to integrate its Siri Speaker (or will it be called „Apple Home”?) with other Apple products, like having it be able to read calendar events off your phone or announce incoming texts and phone calls, for example. But those minor conveniences may not compete well against the thousands of Skills that Alexa has learned, or Google Home’s ability to Google things for you.

Saurabh Singh Last Updated: APR 29, 2017 New Delhi Email Author Apple launched the pocket-rocket iPhone SE in March last year. Although it was mostly geared towards emerging markets like India -- to replace the iPhone 4S, 5S and 5C -- the iPhone SE cost an atrocious Rs 39,900 to begin with. Way more than what it cost in the US. Way more than what it should have cost even after levying the necessary taxes. The price has since gone down and the iPhone SE can now be purchased for as little as Rs 20,000.Â  In March 2017, Apple refreshed the iPhone SE doubling the internal memory of the incumbent 16GB and 64GB versions while keeping rest of the innards unchanged. Which means the iPhone SE is now available for buying with 32GB and 128GB of internal memory. Since the 32GB and 128GB versions have replaced the 16GB and 64GB versions, Apple -- like always -- has ceased production of the latter. Moving on, the iPhone SE will only be available in 32GB and 128GB versions. The 16GB and 64GB versions will be available until stocks last. Also Read: 5 reasons why iPhone SE at Rs 19,999 is totally worth it, 1 reason why it's not The refreshed iPhone SE starts at Rs 27,200 which is rather generous of Apple considering the Cupertino major's history in the country. Whether or not, it's worth it, is a different story. As for the 16GB iPhone SE retailing for Rs 20,000 well, it could have been a much sweeter deal if only it wasn't a 16 gig affair. But, that's how iPhones have always been. Hard to get. Especially in India. The iPhone SE is essentially the iPhone 5S with iPhone 6S hardware. It's not a mini iPhone 6S though. Apple doesn't make minis. While there's technically nothing wrong with the iPhone SE's design, you can't help but notice that it is dated. The iPhone 5S came out in 2013 after all. One look at the iPhone SE, and it's really hard to tell the difference. The differences therein are so subtle only hardcore Apple fans would be able to point them out. The iPhone SE carries forward the same physical dimensions -- size and weight -- as well making it seem like a recycled iPhone 5S. There would be some who would still go for it, and yet others, who wouldn't. It's all subjective. Similar is the case with the iPhone SE's 4-inch screen. Apple believes there are buyers who still prefer it. Although it has itself moved on to a 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch form factor. For someone who has been using the iPhone 5S -- it wouldn't be a surprise because the iPhone 5S was pretty brilliant -- switching on to an iPhone SE will be very natural, a walk in the park to say the least. In fact, I think the iPhone SE is a perfect tribute to the iPhone 5S and for someone who's been using the iPhone 5S, the iPhone SE is ideally the way to go. Provided you're not into Netflix. The advent of Internet streaming services has given way to the proverbial phablet form factor. Smartphones have quite literally become entertainment hubs. A 4-inch phone, in such a case, wouldn't serve your purpose. You need a bigger screen. Also, for someone who's looking to switch from a larger phone to an iPhone SE, the transition could well be catastrophic. Hardware is where the iPhone SE really shines though. It's practically the iPhone 6S, inside out, in this regard. Which invariably means that it is mighty powerful. The iPhone SE, just like the iPhone 6S, is powered by Apple's in-house A9 processor that is 70 per cent faster and has a 90 per cent faster GPU as compared to the previous generation A8 chip found inside the iPhone 6. It comes with 2GB of RAM and iOS 9 software. It comes with an M9 motion co-processor inside that brings in an 'always on' Siri voice assistant that is always on and always listening. But, it doesn't come with the iPhone 6S' marquee feature: 3D Touch. In the iPhone SE, you do not get a pressure-sensitive screen that would respond differently to different kinds of taps. You do not get the 'peek' and a 'pop' gestures. And you do not get Apple's 'Taptic Engine' that lets you know what you're doing all the time by giving you a different tactile sensation for each kind of interaction. But, 3D Touch or the lack of it isn't necessarily a deal breaker. For someone who is quite picky about next-generation technology, it could be, perhaps. Next in line is the camera. It's pretty awesome. The iPhone SE comes with a 12-megapixel iSight camera that can record 4K videos, just like the iPhone 6S. And just like the iPhone 6S, the iPhone SE can also shoot 'Live Photos'. For the uninitiated, Live Photos are GIFs with sound. Problem is the iPhone SE ships with a rather forgettable 1.2-megapixel FaceTime camera. For someone who is all gung-ho about selfies, that could be a deal-breaker. The fact that there are some pretty neat camera phones at under Rs 20,000 that can take good selfies as well doesn't help the iPhone SE's case much. Also Read: Moto G5 Plus vs iPhone SE: Pure Android or best of iOS The iPhone SE is definitely a recommended buy at Rs 20,000. It comes with a premium design, a good screen, great Apple-certified hardware and software, an amazing rear-facing camera and great battery life. But, then it isn't for everybody. A 4-inch phone -- even though it's coming from Apple -- has a niche target audience -- with the major chunk being hardcore Apple fans -- in this day and age. The fact that it's still quite expensive for what it's worth -- 16GB memory with no expandable storage option for Rs 20,000 -- doesn't work in its favor as well.

Apple reportedly stopped paying royalties starting with devices sold during the March quarter, CNET reported on Friday. Qualcomm is now forced to cut its expectations about how much revenue and earnings it will make in its third fiscal quarter that ends in June. "While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm's valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts," Don Rosenberg, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Qualcomm, was quoted as saying. "Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade. Apple's continued interference with Qualcomm's agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple's global attack on Qualcomm," Rosenberg added. Qualcomm is one of the world's biggest provider of mobile chips and derives revenue majorly from licensing that technology to hundreds of handset manufacturers and others. Meanwhile, Apple said that the company has been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms. "Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court," the company was quoted as saying. "As we've said before, Qualcomm's demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own," it added. Earlier in April, the US chip manufacturer lambasted Apple for breaching deals between the two companies and urged that the lawsuit filed in January against them by the iPhone maker should be rejected. Qualcomm also accused Apple of harming its business and sought unspecified damages. Apple sued Qualcomm in January for nearly one billion dollars over royalties, with the Cupertino-based tech giant alleging the wireless chipmaker did not give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. But Qualcomm refuted the allegations, saying that Apple had intentionally mischaracterised the agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology they had invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers "through our licensing programme".

Of course, on the final day of the 2016-2017 season, new champions will be crowned, with the battle for the trainer’s championship, between nine-times champion Willie Mullins and Gordon Elliott, seeking a first crown, going down to the wire. Jamie Codd will be crowned champion amateur for the first time – following a lengthy tussle with Patrick Mullins, while, after a tremendous season, Rachael Blackmore will become the first female conditional champion. On the track, and back to the scene of her impressive defeat of Let’s Dance in the juvenile championship race last year, Apple’s Jade is undoubtedly the one to beat in the mares race. A dual Grade 1 winner as a juvenile, Gordon Elliott’s charge has won both the Hatton’s Grace (ending Vroum Vroum Mag’s unbeaten record) and Cheltenham’s OLBG Mares Hurdle, at the top level, this season. In the Cheltenham race, she beat Vroum Vroum Mag and Limini, which had beaten her in her ‘prep’ outing on this track. 2017 Cheltenham Festival, Prestbury Park, Cheltenham, England 14/3/2017 The OLBG Mares Hurdle Apple's Jade ridden by Bryan Cooper (right) beats Vroom Vroom Mag ridden by Paul Townend to win the race Mandatory Credit ©INPHO/Dan Sheridan A five-year-old, open to further improvement, Apple’s Jade is rated 154 and is the horse to beat. But her supporters will be worried, not just by the fact Mullins, seeking a fifth successive win in the race, runs Augusta Kate, conqueror of Let’s Dance in a Grade 1 mares novice at Fairyhouse last week. But the interesting aspect of the Mullins challenge is the fact Ruby Walsh has opted to ride the unexposed Karalee instead, on the back of her smooth, recent success in Limerick, her first outing since landing her maiden in Killarney in May 2015. If she is superior to 146-rated Augusta Kate, and riding arrangements suggest she is, Ruby’s mount might be capable of shaking-up Apple’s Jade. The AES Champion 4-Y-0 Hurdle could also develop into a head-to-head between the Mullins and Elliott camps, with Bapaume and Mega Fortune leading their respective challenges. The leading fancies were separated by just a short-head when filling second and third spots behind the classy Defi Du Seuil in the Triumph at Cheltenham, with Bapaume enjoying that narrow advantage. In their previous clash, in Leopardstown’s Spring Juvenile Hurdle, Mega Fortune had come out on top, winning by three and a half lengths. And, in their previous clash, at Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting, Bapaume triumphed, with Mega Fortune third. Joseph O’Brien’s Landofhopeandglory also ties in with the leading fancies on form. And, with ground conditions expected to suit Bapaume better, the Mullins runner gets the vote. Peter O’Hehir selections for Punchestown Day Five 2.35. Mtada Supreme 3.10. Bless The Wings 3.50.

It’s been an up and down season, with a few more injuries along the away – it started badly, but it’s been a good spring, with Grade 1 winners at Cheltenham, Fairyhouse and Punchestown. And I’m happy to report that Apple’s Jade has come out of her Cheltenham win, in the OLBG Mares Hurdle, very well. I’ve sat on her a few times since. She looks great and is in very good form, ready to run another big race on a course where she was impressive beating Let’s Dance this day last year. She improved as the season went on last year and produced her best displays in the spring. Her win at Cheltenham last month, beating Vroum Vroum Mag and Limini, was a very good performance. Augusta Kate, which beat Let’s Dance at Fairyhouse, is a serious rival today. And Ruby had decided to ride the lightly-raced Karalee instead of her. Karalee is obviously held in high regard and must be doing things right at home. So our mare will have to be at her best. I’ll be on Dinaria Des Obeaux in the AES Champion 4-Y-0 Hurdle, the last Grade 1 of our season. I’ve won this race for the last two years, on Petite Parisienne and Apple’s Jade. But I’m not expecting lighting to strike again. ‘Dinaria’ is a nice filly. But she was well held when fourth to Project Bluebook in Fairyhouse last week. She needs softer ground than she’ll encounter today. And she’ll probably struggle against the likes of Mega Fortune and Bapaume. Ruby Walsh riding Bapaume clears the last fence on the way to winning The Knight Frank Juvenile Hurdle at Leopardstown My handicap rides are Automated in the valuable ‘Ballymore’ and Marinero in the ‘Pat Taaffe’. Automated ran okay in the Coral Cup in Cheltenham – he didn’t get the best of runs and, although he’s held by a couple of rivals on that form, I’m expecting a good run from him. I won on him over this trip (two and a half miles) at Navan in December, when he beat Scoir Mear. He has a nice racing weight, will like the ground and should run well. But don’t expect to see him too soon – he’s a hold-up horse and I’ll be waiting as long as I can. Marinero’s jumping has let him down in recent runs. But he’a horse with plenty of ability and, if he gets his act together, he could finish in the shake-up.

The Lexus fitted with various sensors is the latest entrant in the quest to make driverless cars commercially viable. Apple, a late comer, likely will face fierce competition from Google’s Waymo, which has carried out millions of miles of road testing, and Uber, which has been testing autonomous cars for months. Apple’s initiative, officially called Project Titan, is driven by hardware developed by Velodyne Lidar, while Apple is expected to develop the software. Based on documents obtained by Business Insider, Apple’s cars sound very much like other self-driving cars. The cars are “capable of sending electronic commands for steering, accelerating, and decelerating and may carry out portions of the dynamic driving task,” according to the documents. As with other driverless cars, humans are still present and can override the self-driving mode at any time. Despite being somewhat late to the game, Apple may find an opening in the way of a potentially lengthy legal battle between Waymo and Uber, with Waymo alleging that Uber stole its trade secrets. On Thursday, Uber executive Anthony Levandowski recused himself from work on driverless cars in the wake of the lawsuit, which alleges he stole intellectual property while employed at Google.   Credit : Voice of America (VOA) | Photo Credit: AP Advertisements Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Skype (Opens in new window) Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) About the Author New Delhi Times Bureau - Related News Critics question top US prosecutor’s style after blunt words Duterte opens ASEAN summit with oblique swipe at US, EU N.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Prep Baseball: Wilson battles flu, beats Warriors for Agape League lead Friday Apr 28, 2017 at 12:01 AM Apr 28, 2017 at 10:19 PM Matthew Peters Staff Writer @DP_MattPeters APPLE VALLEY — Cameron Wilson had the flu throughout the week. He didn’t attend, let alone play in, Hesperia Christian’s Tuesday game. At various points he said he was on his hand and knees. But he knew he had to be ready to play Apple Valley Christian with first place in the Agape League on the line Friday afternoon. Wilson, a senior pitcher, had enough energy to make it through seven innings and helped the Patriots to a 7-4 victory. And he still had the energy to have his catcher jump into his arms after finishing the game with a strikeout. The Patriots had earned some hugs at that point. The win gives Hesperia Christian (10-2, 8-1 Agape League) the season series against the Warriors and a game lead with three league games remaining in season. It puts the Patriots in prime position to repeat as the league champs because they’ve outscored their next three league opponents (Victor Valley Christian, Bethel Christian and Lucerne Valley Christian) 94-9 so far this season. When asked how he felt Friday morning Wilson paused for a moment before saying, “I knew that I’d be alright, but still feeling real sick.” He got a B12 shot before game and felt good enough to pitch against the Patriots’ chief rival. “All week I was feeling awful,” Wilson said. “I’ve been on antibiotics all week and nausea medication. I was on my hands and knees throwing up in the bathroom. It was pretty bad, but I knew I had to get it together for the all the seniors on this team.” Wilson finished the game allowing four hits, four runs and four walks while collecting 10 strikeouts. He also went 2 for 2 with an RBI and two runs scored. The rivalry between the Patriots and the Warriors (12-4, 7-2 Agape League) has been a spirited to put it mildly. The two teams have gone back and forth in baseball and basketball for years. In baseball, Hesperia Christian won Agape League titles in 2014 and 2016, while Apple Valley Christian held the crown in 2015. On Friday, there was a lot of chatter throughout the game and a brief protest by Apple Valley Christian on Wilson’s pitch count before the end of the game. Wilson transferred from Excelsior in the offseason. Still, it didn’t take him long to get acclimated to the rivalry. “They are like our AAE,” said Wilson, referencing Excelsior’s top rival. “I kind of got the vibe in practice so I went with it.” Munoz said the teams are “kind of sick of each other. They bring out the best in us. And the worst in us and vice versa.” Hesperia Christian beat Apple Valley Christian 9-1 in the first matchup of the season before falling 5-4 in the second. Hesperia Christian took a 1-0 lead in the first inning Friday but couldn’t get to Grant Lyles again until the fourth inning. Connor Scott and Aaron Hough got the Patriots started in the fourth by reaching base on back-to-back errors. Then the top of the Patriots’ lineup did the damage. Jonathan Flores also reached on an error with a pop up to right and that gave Scott enough time to come home for 2-0 lead. Trevor Bragg crushed a double to left field to make it 3-0 and Wilson helped his own cause with a single to center for another run. Zach Schilling, who was 2 for 4 with a run, added another double to make it 5-0. Scott was 2 for 3 with a run and RBI. Bradyon Hampton was 2 for 4 with a run. Apple Valley Christian’s Aidan Delgado went 1 for 2 with a double. After allowing just one hit in the first four innings, Wilson struggled in the fifth inning. Apple Valley Christian got back into the game as he gave up three hits, a walk and four runs to make it 5-4. Hesperia Christian coach Michael Munoz contemplated taking him out of the game, but Wilson eventually recovered. He ended the threat in the fifth with a strikeout. That was the start of a run of four straight strikeouts and six strikeouts in the final seven batters he faced. Hesperia Christian added a run in both the sixth and seventh innings to give Wilson more than enough insurance.

This phrase was first used in 1922, which went on to become ‘An Apple a day keeps the doctor away’ in the 20th century. It gives us the impression that apple is the most nutritious fruit around. While it may be true to some extent, there are fruits like banana, cherries, papaya, oranges and blueberries that are also heavily loaded with nutrients. Then why was apple the only fruit that was made part of the folklore? The reason that this phrase lasted so long is because there is indeed some truth to it. Apples can prevent the buildup of cholesterol and can also manage blood pressure. Some studies even suggest that it can even protect you against some cancers. According to Boyer and Liu, when the adage was created, ‘apples were easy to grow. In fact, they still are easy to grow. And they can be in storage for almost a year after being harvested. Some studies also establish that apple’s nutritional value remains relatively intact for as long as 200 days after harvest.’ Moreover, you cannot deny the convenience of the fruit. It is easy-to-eat and since it consists of 85 per cent water and lots of fibre, it makes you full without burdening you with calories. Apple is among the most nutritious fruits, but it definitely doesn’t keep the doctor away. The key is to have a varied diet. Nutritionists across the globe are recommending 3:4 ratio diet – which means three different colours of fruits and four different colours of vegetables every day. So next time you go shopping, do not forget to pick citrus fruits, seasonal fruits and berries besides apples.

The ultrabook is powered by the Intel Core i7 processor. Reuters/Steve Marcus Both Apple MacBook Pro 15 and Dell XPS 15 are workhorses for professionals who are always on the go. While there is tough competition in the hybrid laptop market, it will be interesting to see how these two will fare against each other. Price is always a deciding factor for most. The MacBook Pro 15 costs US$2,399 (AU$3,200 approx). In comparison, the Dell laptop costs $350 less. The two are almost similar when it comes to size. While Dell goes for a traditional keyboard, it’s still better than the XPS 13. The Apple device uses the Butterfly keyboard, commonly found in MacBooks. The Apple device has retained the headphone jack, though it also offers four Thunderbolt 3 USB ports. The Dell XPS 15 also offers a headphone jack. In addition to that it comes with one USB 3.1 Thunderbolt 3/Type C, two USB 3.0 Type A ports, a Kensington lock port and a full-size HDMI 1.4. When it comes to battery performance, the Apple laptop beats Dell hands-down. The former can play a 4K resolution video at about 255 nits in brightness and Wi-Fi off for about nine hours, before going blank. XPS 15 provides only 5.5 hours, reports PC World. This is surprising for many as the Apple laptop packs a 74-watt-hour battery, as opposed to Dell’s 97 watt-hours. The XPS 15 however has a denser pixel screen, sitting at 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. The Apple device has a 2,880 x 1,600 pixel screen. In terms of gaming performance, the Dell laptop is a clear winner. The laptops are portable workstations for those who are away from office. MacBook Pro track pads have arguably been the benchmark. The MacBook Pro 15 has an unusually large track pad with glass surface and low friction level. On the other hand, the XPS 15’s track pad is equally good, though with a little more friction. In fact, the XPS laptop wins this track pad race because of a full 10-point touch-screen. The Touch Bar on MacBook still needs improvement. A big problem with the traditional keyboard in the XPS 15 is that it is a bit too little. However, upgrading the MacBook Pro 15 is more problematic than the Dell laptop. The CPU, GPU, RAM and even the SSD are soldered down. This is not the case with XPS 15 where the user can drop the 32GB RAM and install a larger 1TB NVMe PCIe SSD. Thus as is evident, Dell has released a laptop that is worthy of giving Apple competition and even emerge as a winner. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple MacBook Pro 15 and Dell XPS 15.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive State launches investigation following influx of crime at Bright Futures Academy Friday Apr 28, 2017 at 12:01 AM Apr 28, 2017 at 11:08 PM Charity Lindsey Staff Writer @DP_CharityMatthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — While awaiting a hearing to appeal the town’s intent to revoke its business license, a private school received a sudden visit Friday from investigators with the California Department of Education. In March, town officials received a San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department report that included 132 calls for service at Bright Futures Academy within a nearly 15-month period. Deputies responded to incidents involving a riot, gang activity, assaults, sexual batteries and thefts, among others, which spurred the CDE investigation, according to Assistant Communications Director Robert Oakes. “Because these were serious allegations, our Special Education Division folks got together and immediately sent investigators to the site,” Oakes said. The team flew in this week and, although Oakes expected them “to take formal action” by 4:30 p.m. Friday, he told the Daily Press their investigation would continue into next week. Bright Futures declined to comment on the investigation, but Chief Operating Officer Pamela Lamberth criticized the Sheriff’s report last week, calling it “inflated” for including medical aid, follow-up and after-hours calls, as well as 39 false alarms she said were caused by “faulty sensors” in the school’s alarm system. Lamberth also said she was concerned by the town’s lack of communication with the school prior to announcing its intent to revoke the business license. Bright Futures isn’t a typical private school; it’s a nonpublic, nonsectarian school (NPS), which serves students with “exceptional needs” through authorized state and federal funds, according to California Education Code. About half of the 78 students at the Apple Valley site have autism and intellectual disabilities, according to school officials, while the rest have emotional disturbance or learning disabilities. Twenty-two criminal reports were filed and eight arrests have been made at the school between Dec. 28, 2015, and March 11, 2017, according to Apple Valley station Capt. Frank Bell, who told the Daily Press a call from February 2016 involved “inappropriate touching” between a Bright Futures staffer and an underage student. “That case involved a 28-year-old female teacher’s aide who was also a monitor on the bus,” Bell said in an email. “The victim was a 15-year-old male student. An allegation was made alleging inappropriate touching between the two while riding on the bus, and a report was taken.” Bell said an investigation was submitted to the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s office. Charges haven’t been filed, but DA spokesperson Christopher Lee said the case is pending further investigation. CDE’s current investigation isn’t the first time the department has probed a Bright Futures school. In April of last year, CDE Information Officer Peter Tira confirmed to the Daily Press the school’s Perris site was being investigated by the department. Bright Futures spokesperson Janet Zimmerman said the previous investigation was “based on an anonymous complaint” at the Perris school, one of six Bright Futures locations listed in the CDE school directory. School officials say three are currently in operation — Apple Valley, Twentynine Palms and Riverside. CDE data shows the Perris site was closed within 10 months of opening, which Zimmerman said was due to “too few students” attending. The 20 students were moved to the Riverside location. Zimmerman said investigators “found nothing” in Perris last year; CDE officials have not yet confirmed this. Since an NPS like Bright Futures must be certified by CDE each year, the department’s investigation in Apple Valley has the potential to put a freeze on enrollment, Oakes said, but no action has yet been taken. Bright Future’s appeal hearing before the Town Council is scheduled for June 13, a letter to school officials shows. Charity Lindsey may be contacted at CLindsey@VVDailyPress.com or 760-951-6245.

Hot Topics: Latest police blotters Murder victim ID-ed Woman gets 40-year sentence FFA holds petting zoo Arson charge in wildfire Obits Print   Email   Font Resize Schools Honoring education's best By Katie Collins For the Fort Morgan Times Posted:   04/28/2017 06:14:31 PM MDT ...and the winners are: Educators and staff honored for outstanding achievement during the 2017 Crystal Apple Awards banquet held Thursday night included,, pictured from left to right: Back Row: Dr. Kerry Hart (Rotary Lifetime Achievement Award), Marcia Bledsoe (Sherman Early Childhood Center), Jay Broda (Cargill Student Choice Award), Dan Marler (Morgan Community College), Peggy Edson (Fort Morgan Middle School) and Allison Howe (Making A Difference in Education Award. Front Row: Adrianna Nickell (Fort Morgan High School), Vickie Segelke (Pioneer Elementary), Mary Rodriguez (Green Acres Elementary), Sheri Hulkovich (Baker Elementary), Connie Schingle (Columbine Elementary) and Peyman Javadi (Lincoln School). (Katie Collins / Fort Morgan Times) Fort Morgan Middle School's Crystal Apple Award winner Peggy Edson was presented her honor from Principal Jason Frasco. (Katie Collins / Fort Morgan Times) The best and brightest minds involved in Fort Morgan education gathered at the Country Steak Out last night where, even for a Thursday, teachers and staff managed to unwind with good food, great company and a signature style of humor that seems to spread easily through Fort Morgan schools. The 15th annual Crystal Apple Awards had area educators and employees in fine spirits as they celebrated the night with style, enjoying sensational eats, honors and even stories of strength and staunch hilarity that made the evening a rare opportunity to roast fellow colleagues, as well as bestow honors for those who make extra time and efforts to ensure their students soar. Crystal Apple Award winner Marcia Bledsoel is flanked with mighty superhero sisters as Assistant Director of Personnel for the Fort Morgan School District Ron Plug paints a colorful picture of a day at the Sherman School during last night's presentation. (Katie Collins / Fort Morgan Times) Fort Morgan Re-3 Superintendent Ron Echols was the host for the evening which he framed around the sentiment that all educators have a rare gift at their disposal - the gift of inspiration and change. After starting with a round of trivia for his district teachers, Echols pointed out that even these great events and people who made their mark on history could not hold a candle to the power that teachers have to make memories. After asking some of his area educators to stand and name their most memorable past teachers, Echols said, "My point here is that these great events and individuals helped to shape our country's history, but are still not as memorable to us as our favorite teachers were. Most of these people and places we've already forgotten," he continued, "but great teachers are rare." Advertisement As Fort Morgan High School Principal Ben Bauman noted during his award presentation to FMHS winner Adrianna Nickell, nominations for favorite educators tend to highlight the same efforts each year, so for the 2017 ceremony, hilarity and humor served an essential function; to provide light even in the midst of struggle. "'Goes the extra mile', 'always has a smile'; these are a few descriptions we see every year of our outstanding educators," said Bauman. "So, this year... I'd like to transform this into more of a roast," he exclaimed, much to the delight of the crowd filled with past Crystal Apple honorees as well. Indeed, a unique sense of humor outlined the careers of many 2017 apple honorees, who enjoyed a buffet, centerpiece and even Rockies ticket giveaways, during the event organized annually by the Crystal Apple Committee and Fort Morgan Times staff. Those educators and staff from Fort Morgan Re-3 schools and MCC who earned apples during the 15th annual affair included: •Former MCC President Dr. Kerry Hart - Rotary Lifetime Achievement Award •Allison Howe - Making A Difference in Education Award •Jay Broda - Cargill Student Choice Award •Dan Marler - Morgan Community College •Peyman Javadi - Lincoln High School •Adrianna Nickell - Fort Morgan High School •Peggy Edson - Fort Morgan Middle School •Sheri Hulkovich - Baker Elementary School •Vickie Segelke - Pioneer Elementary School •Mary Rodriquez - Green Acres Elementary School •Connie Schingle - Columbine Elementary School •Marcia Bledsoe - Sherman Early Childhood Center A more in-depth feature for each 2017 Crystal Apple Award winner is also designed and organized annually by staff at the Fort Morgan Times and this year's 15th annual special section is available inserted in this edition. A large crowd attended the annual banquet.

The "Mad Money" host said that with the federal government funded through the next week, investors can finally relax and gear up for yet another earnings-filled agenda. With that in mind, here are the stocks and events on Cramer's radar this coming week: Monday: Advanced Micro Devices, Cardinal Health Advanced Micro Devices: After shares of competitor Intel slid on its earnings miss on Thursday, Cramer is unsure that even the best of earnings reports from this chipmaker will garner a positive market reaction. "As I have repeatedly said, there is nothing wrong with the company AMD," Cramer said. "What can I say? The market's fallen out of love with last year's darlings." Cardinal Health: Once the health care services company reports earnings, Cramer thinks investors will start to notice its monumental acquisition of part of Medtronic's business, which will make it a more streamlined hospital supplier. Tuesday: CVS Health, Mastercard, Apple CVS: The health care retailer's stock has been under pressure lately as even pharmacies are squeezed by the rise of Amazon, but Cramer says there could be a hidden upside to earnings. "All that said, it's hard to really dislike a well run company like this that sells at just 13 times earnings. I say wait and see. Maybe numbers come down, maybe that's your chance," the "Mad Money" host said. Mastercard: Other payment services names like Visa and PayPal have reported great numbers this quarter, so Cramer expects a good report from Mastercard as well. "Here's one where you might want to see if the stock gets hit after it reports so you can come in at a lower price," he said. "That's been the pattern with the stock of this amazing company. It might be a great way to get in on a trend that still has a lot of room to run: the paper to plastic secular growth story." Apple: Expectations are sky-high for the tech titan's after-the-bell earnings report, and Cramer thinks they are justified. "Apple's doing so many things right. It's making the best products, developing a deep ecosystem with a substantial service revenue stream," he said. Plus, Apple's upcoming iPhone release is rumored to have an array of new features that makes the smartphone more functional and easier to handle, which should boost sales and new customer numbers, Cramer said. The company also stands to massively benefit from repatriation if the administration is able to implement it. All said and done, Cramer says investors should own the stock, not trade it, and eager buyers should hope for a post-earnings dip so they can buy it at a discount. Wednesday: Sprint, Facebook, Kraft Heinz Sprint: Cramer likes the stock of this telecommunications player, which will report its quarterly earnings Wednesday morning, but the "Mad Money" host is concerned that it may just be pushing along instead of really growing. T-Mobile CEO John Legere told Cramer he may be open to buying Sprint, but antitrust issues may stand in the way of a merger or acquisition, Cramer warned. "Any merger would lessen the competition for something that's become a modern day necessity," he said. "You really have to own these for fundamentals, not potential deals, and if that's the case, T-Mobile remains best of breed." Facebook: The social media colossus reports earnings after the bell, and unless its numbers are substantially better, Cramer expects a slight sell-off. "I like how competitive Facebook is," the "Mad Money" host said. "If you don't own it now, I think you might as well wait to see if we get that kind of weird sell-off that we usually get even after it reports a great number." Kraft Heinz: Investors will be tuned into the consumer goods name when it reports because it always seems to be on the lookout for a takeover candidate despite botching its proposal to buy Unilever last quarter. Cramer prefers Unilever's stock, but said that if Kraft Heinz floats the idea of a deal, it could get a boost. "We know, though, it takes two to tango, and I'm hard pressed to see who would possibly want to sell in that consumer packaged goods industry as the remaining players seem to have no inclination to let go of the reins," Cramer said. Thursday: Dunkin' Donuts, Activision Blizzard Dunkin' Donuts: Cramer contended that this coffeemaker, which will report earnings Thursday, "has quietly become a better investment than Starbucks over the last year, going from $46 to $55, while Starbucks has only traveled up four points." The "Mad Money" host credited the company's execution for the rise, saying that it has outperformed Starbucks in terms of stemming the U.S. slowdown. Activision Blizzard: The gaming sector is one of Cramer's favorite secular growth stories in the stay-at-home economy, and Activision Blizzard's earnings reports have a tendency to spur selling. "I say the trend's your friend," Cramer said. "This franchise is worth buying if it gets hit." Friday: Non-farm payrolls The Labor Department will release its monthly non-farm payroll data. The hiring statistics could have a detrimental effect on bank stocks if they are low, but Cramer expects the opposite. "If April turns out to have been a robust hiring month, and I think it will be, that gives the Fed breathing room to raise interest rates twice, and therefore the bank stocks will soar," he said. So with Washington policymakers at bay for now and the market digesting this week's madness, Cramer said to focus on the stocks that get unjustly beaten down for chances to buy high quality names next week. "This week we have a couple of stocks that tend to act badly after they report. Those are your best bets for investments. Otherwise, get ready for still one more opportunity to buy some Apple stock as Wall Street's naysayers try to say its best days are behind it. But, of course, they say that to each other on their iPhones," the "Mad Money" host said.

According to Mr. Kelly’s analysis of a Nikkei report, the release date of the “iPhone 8” will be delayed because of a combination of production issues with the curved OLED display and overheating issues in the wireless charging modules. The problem is, he names the wrong device. Mr. Kelly’s article reveals the importance for iPhone news contributors to keep their rumors and facts straight. Various mockups have appeared of the iPhone 8, but the iPhone 7S is supposed to look very similar to its predecessor but with a glass body (Image Credit: BGR One Year, Two Devices In Mr. Kelly’s article, he focuses solely on the upcoming iPhone 7S. However, he seems to think that device will feature the curved OLED display and wireless charging capability. That’s not what we’re hearing from the rumor mill, though, and it doesn’t make sense. We’re hearing that Apple will, in fact, release two new iPhones in 2017, much like the company did in 2016 with the iPhone 7 and SE models. The iPhone 7S will likely be a modest upgrade over the current generation. According to the Nikkei piece that Mr. Kelly references, it will include “minor improvements including a glass body.” It will not, however, incorporate the curved OLED display or wireless charging. Apple is expected to announce the true next-generation iPhone at around the same time. It’s this device that Ming Chi Kuo and Nikkei’s sources say is delayed. Mr. Kelly is right that we don’t know what the future device will be called, but nobody’s thinking it will be the iPhone 7S. Current thoughts include iPhone 8, iPhone Edition, iPhone Anniversary Edition, and iPhone X. A Good Look at History Tells Us a Lot Where Mr. Kelly has failed is in understanding Apple’s pattern throughout history in releasing new iPhones. While it’s true that in odd-numbered years, Cupertino unleashes “S” models, those have always been modest upgrades over their predecessors. With the iPhone 4S, we got Siri. The iPhone 5S saw the addition of Touch ID. When the iPhone 6S came out, it introduced us to Force Touch. All of these new devices had one thing in common, though – they all used the same basic form factor as the iPhone that preceded them. We didn’t see major changes to the handset. We could typically use the same cases and other accessories that manufacturers released for the non-S models. What we didn’t see was a change to the overall shape of the device, like we would notice if the 7S came with a curved OLED display. Again, One Year, Two Devices Just like 2016, when the iPhone 7 and SE came out, we expect to see two new iPhone models in 2017. The iPhone 7S, which Mr. Kelly seems to think will be the major upgrade, will only feature modest updates. Perhaps the glass body, or maybe Apple has another software/hardware feature to introduce that won’t change the form factor of the device. On the other hand, the major upgrade to the iPhone lineup is expected to be one to truly take notice of. The rumors say that device will perhaps be called the iPhone Anniversary Edition to commemorate 10 years of iPhones. It’s expected to feature the curved OLED display and major enhancements to charging and performance. It’s Friday, so Let’s Wrap This Up Mr. Kelly seriously needs to get his rumors and history straight if he’s going to be taken seriously in the Apple news arena. His article, “iPhone 7S Leak Reveals Apple Has Problems,” is both right and wrong at the same time. The article correctly sums up that rumors say next generation of the iPhone is running into design and production snags. Where Mr. Kelly seems tripped up is he incorrectly ascribes those facts to the wrong device. From all that we and others have heard, the iPhone 7S is right on schedule. It’s the iPhone 8 that’s delayed. One year, two devices.

New details to add fuel to the fires of speculation came out recently, and now we’re thinking that Cupertino’s Siri speaker might look remarkably similar to the Mac Pro. There Will Always Be Leaks As secretive as Apple is, there are almost always leaks. This time, though, we actually have a name to the leaker – a certain Sonny Dickson. Mr. Dickson shared details with Mashable’s Jen Ryall, who posted much of the information via Twitter. More claims from @SonnyDickson on Apple’s Alexa competitor: – Think Mac Pro style. – Same style UE boom mesh. – Possible release WWDC. 2/2 — Jen Ryall (@jennijenni) April 28, 2017 This isn’t the first time Mr. Dickson has unveiled Apple’s secrets. The young man from Ocean Grove, Australia seems to have great connections, and was the first to release photographs of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C, iPad mini 2, and the fifth-generation iPad. He was also the first person to reveal detailed images of the Touch ID sensor on the iPhone 5S. In 2015, he unearthed and divulged quite a bit of information about the Force Touch feature on the iPhone 6S. All that to say, the kid’s leaks seem to be legitimate. What to Expect from the Siri Speaker Mr. Dickson told Ms. Ryall that Cupertino is currently putting the finishing touches on the design of its Amazon Echo competitor. Expected to be marketed as a Siri and AirPlay device, the project is codenamed “B238” and will supposedly borrow design cues from the Mac Pro. Internally, the speaker is said to feature Beats speaker technology. Mr. Dickson says the B238 is a round, “fat” device with a concave top where you will locate the physical controls. Speaker mesh similar to that used in the UE Boom will cover the round body of the device. Mr. Dickson says we should “think Mac Pro style” when imagining what the Siri speaker will look like. The device would allow you to use Siri without your iPhone or iPad, and I expect it would allow quite a few of the HomeKit features that currently depend upon a fourth-generation Apple TV or newer iPad. Coming Sooner Than You Might Expect Mr. Dickson even revealed when the new Siri speaker is expected to debut. He informed Ms. Ryall of a possible release during Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference, slated to take place from June 5 to June 9 this year. We’ll certainly be waiting.

First Apple has made a great fuss about how much better having your AI with you is than having one over there in the other room. True they have suddenly reversed direction in the past, but this is one area I think they’re right. Second, Siri will need to get a LOT, like a power of ten, better before this would be useful. I don’t need a dedicated speaker in the room that I can ask “Who wrote the song ‘Muskrat Love”. I would like a device I could say ‘I don’t know what to do this weekend’ and it would look at my activity history, and what’s going on locally, my bank balance, and the weather, and suggest something. If Siri was to the point where I could converse with it, not just ask specific questions, then I’d use it a lot more. On my phone and, maybe even on a speaker or in the car, or wherever. April 28, 2017 at 4:18 EDT PM Doug Petrosky April 28, 2017 First, I don’t remember them ever saying such a thing, and second what digital assistant has access to my bank account because everything else you mentioned Siri would have access to. So back to my standard beef when discussions lead to HomeKit bashing. 1) 95% of homes don’t have existing IOT hardware. 2) 90% of the major IOT things are homekit or have a homekit equivalent. 3) Many, (i’d even argue most) homekit devices are more secure because security is a design focus but also, they don’t have an unencrypted foot print. Most IOT devices rely on an external site to allow access, but if you configure as HomeKit, you never make a connection to those sites. You only control locally or through the VPN tunnel created between your device and your 4th gen AppleTV. My Hunter Fan’s are an excellent example. The app wanted me to register with their website for remote access but because homekit handles that for me, I never set this up and my fan’s don’t communicate with that site and are thus not available to attack through that vector. Bottomline, Echo or Siri…… Siri All the way! April 28, 2017 at 6:09 EDT PM tmckee007 April 30, 2017 I like it. I’d buy one. April 30, 2017 at 1:13 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

By: AP | San Francisco | Published:April 29, 2017 9:46 am Apple’s decision to withhold royalties will cost Qualcomm up to 0 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm released. Apple is refusing to pay any royalties owed to mobile chip maker Qualcomm for some of the features in the iPhone, escalating a patent feud that has turned the former business partners into bitter adversaries. The latest twist in the dispute represents a major blow for Qualcomm, which depends on licensing fees for a large portion of its revenue. Apple’s decision to withhold royalties will cost Qualcomm up to $500 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm released Friday. “This is getting ugly, the level of hostility just went up another notch,” said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. As retaliation, Qualcomm could seek a court order halting iPhone sales until Apple pays the royalties that Qualcomm contends it’s owed, Moorhead said. Qualcomm hasn’t threatened to go to that extreme yet, but its top lawyer made it clear on Friday that the San Diego company is girding for a fierce fight with its Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world’s most valuable company. “We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. Qualcomm now expects its earnings for the period to range from 75 to 85 cents per share. Apple concedes it and its suppliers owe Qualcomm some licensing fees on iPhone sales. But Apple believes Qualcomm has been abusing its power in the mobile chip market to charge for royalties on features that aren’t covered by its patents. Qualcomm, in turn, has accused Apple of breaking contracts in an attempt to lower its licensing fees and also interfering in deals negotiated with iPhone suppliers. The stalemate prompted Apple to sue Qualcomm in January in a federal complaint. Qualcomm denied the allegations and fired back with its own lawsuit against Apple earlier this month. In a Friday statement, Apple said it won’t pay Qualcomm any further royalties until the courts determine the amount, a process that could take several years. “As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own,” Apple said. Rosenberg reiterated that Qualcomm holds “valid and enforceable” licensing agreements on various features in iPhones. Apple’s suspension of royalty payments marks “the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. Apple isn’t alone in its accusations against Qualcomm. The US Federal Trade Commission also has filed a lawsuit alleging that Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. With the loss of iPhone royalty payments, Qualcomm now expects its revenue for its April-June quarter to range from $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, down from its previous forecast of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. Qualcomm now expects its earnings for the period to range from 75 to 85 cents per share. That’s down from an earlier projection of 90 cents to $1.15 per share. Investors shook off the shock of Qualcomm’s lowered guidance after initially driving down the company’s stock. Its stock rose 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.74 on Friday. The stock has fallen by about 15 percent since Apple filed its lawsuit.

The new campus, dubbed 'Apple Park,' is nearing completion and is set to begin moving in Apple employees this spring season. Former Cupertino mayor Gilbert Wong described to the Mercury News the moment Jobs unveiled his plans for his spaceship-like campus.

Share this article Share Aerial photographs of the 175-acre campus that cost roughly $5bn show the giant circular structure. The giant saucer-like building will house 13,000 employees across more than 2.8million square feet of office space. The campus will also have nearly 80 acres of parking to accommodate 11,000 commuters in sprawling Silicon Valley. Since Apple unveiled its plans in 2011, the move-in date has slowly receded. Jobs' initial projection was 2015, but this spring is now most likely, according to people involved in the project. The campus was dreamed up by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died of respiratory arrest caused by a a pancreatic tumor in October 2011 Former Cupertino mayor Gilbert Wong described the moment Jobs unveiled his plans for his spaceship-like campus Wong said: 'I’m sure you’ve watched The Willy Wonka movie.' He added: 'He had this little key and you don’t know what’s behind this door' The main building boasts the world's largest piece of curved glass and will be surrounded by a lush canopy of thousands of trees Professor Louise Mozingo said Apple is 'creating an icon' and added: 'It's not about maximizing the productivity of the office space, it's about creating a symbolic center for this global company' More than $1bn was allocated for the interior of the main building alone, according to a former construction manager. The campus is something of an exception to the trend of radically open offices aimed at fostering collaboration, said Louise Mozingo, a professor and chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at University of California, Berkeley.  Its central office building - a massive ring of glass frequently likened to a spaceship - could be a challenge just to navigate, she noted. 'It's not about maximizing the productivity of the office space, it's about creating a symbolic center for this global company,' she said. 'They are creating an icon.' The main building - which boasts the world's largest piece of curved glass - will be surrounded by a lush canopy of thousands of trees.  An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The campus will have a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space It will also have jogging and cycling trails and more than one thousand bikes will be kept on site at all times Parking for the campus will be hidden from view which will enable 80 per cent of its surface area to be covered in trees The auditorium will be underground and will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches The auditorium (not pictured) will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will also be an access point for employees and guests Technology companies have long favored generic office parks, but the Apple Campus 2 marks a new chapter in Silicon Valley architecture.  Little remains from the cement-laden campus Apple acquired from Hewlett-Packard, though the iPhone maker preserved a century-old barn that remained intact. But what was most striking to those who worked on the project was Apple managers' insistence on treating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics. Apple's in-house construction team enforced many rules, including one stipulating that no vents or pipes would be reflected in the glass. And guidelines for the special wood used frequently throughout the building ran to some 30 pages.  The company's keen design sense enhanced the project, but its expectations sometimes clashed with construction realities, a former architect said. 'With phones, you can build to very, very minute tolerances,' he said. 'You would never design to that level of tolerance on a building. Your doors would jam.' The building's power will primarily be provided by natural gas and the local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies The building will stay eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air-conditioning for 70 per cent of the year The campus will also use both low energy LED lighting where natural light doesn’t reach and on-site recycling The building was described by the San Francisco Weekly as a ‘massive glass doughnut' for its glass-plated walls and circular shape more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Lesson learned?

But Mr de la Torre ultimately saw that Apple executives were not trying to evoke the iPhone per se, but rather following something akin to the Platonic ideal of form and dimension. 'They have arrived at design principles somehow through many years of experimentation, and they are faithful to those principles,' Mr de la Torre said.

Each of the thousands of ceiling panels had to win approval from both Apple's in-house team and the general contractor, once at the shop and then again at the construction site. 'The things you can't see, they all mattered to Apple,' the former construction manager said. One of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold. The construction team pushed back, but Apple held firm.  'We spent months trying not to do that because that's time, money and stuff that's never been done before,' the former construction manager said.  Signage also required a delicate balancing act, as Apple wanted all signs to reflect its sleek, minimalist aesthetic, but the fire department needed to ensure the building could be swiftly navigated in an emergency.  KEY FEATURES OF APPLE'S SPACESHIP-LIKE CAMPUS 2 Appearing as a giant saucer, the Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will be home to 13,000 Apple employees. There will be jogging and cycling trails, with more than one thousand bikes kept on site at all times, which staff can use to make their way around. The Spaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space. Apple Campus 2 will additionally have underground parking hidden from view, meaning 80 per cent of the site can be covered in trees. The site was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt. Elsewhere underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will also be an access point for employees and guests. The building's power will primarily be provided by natural gas and the local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies. The glass structure will also be fitted with solar panels.  The circular, four-story building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was described by the San Francisco Weekly as a ‘massive glass doughnut.' The building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air-conditioning for 70 per cent of the year, low energy LED lighting where natural light doesn’t reach, and on-site recycling.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > iPhone 7 Plus Qualcomm LTE Modem Outperforms Intel LTE Modem by Significant Margin iPhone 7 Plus Qualcomm LTE Modem Outperforms Intel LTE Modem by Significant Margin Thursday, 20 October 2016 With the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple elected to use LTE modems from two different sources, Qualcomm and Intel. The A1778 and A1784 iPhone models use a GSM-only Intel XMM7360 modem while the A1660 and 1661 iPhone models use a GSM/CDMA-compatible Qualcomm MDM9645M modem. Apple's decision has already caused some disappointment among customers because the GSM-only Intel modem is not compatible with as many carrier networks as the GSM/CDMA Qualcomm modem, and now independent testing conducted by Cellular Insights suggests there are some significant performance differences between the two modems, with the Qualcomm modem outperforming the Intel modem. Using an R&S TS7124 RF Shielded Box, two R&S CMW500, one R&S CMWC controller, and four Vivaldi antennas, Cellular Insights created a setup to simulate LTE performance at different distances from a cellular tower using two iPhone 7 Plus devices, one with an Intel modem and one with a Qualcomm modem. The goal of the test was to measure the highest achievable LTE throughput starting at a Reference Signal Received Quality of -85dBm (a strong signal) and gradually reducing the power level to simulate moving away from a cellular tower where signal is weaker. Three LTE bands were tested: Band 12, Band 4 (the most common band in North America), and Band 7. In all three tests, both the iPhone 7 Plus models offered similar performance in ideal conditions, but as power levels decreased, Cellular Insights saw "unexplainable sharp dips in performance" in the Intel modem, finding a gap "north of 30%" in favor of the Qualcomm iPhone 7 Plus. In the charts, the Qualcomm modem maintains noticeably higher throughput speeds than the Intel modem as signal strength decreases. In real world conditions, this would suggest the Qualcomm modem does better in areas where the cellular connection is weak, with faster throughput speeds. Cellular Insights describes the Band 12 test below: Both iPhone 7 Plus variants perform similarly in ideal conditions. At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical. [...] At -121dBm, the Intel variant performed more in line with its Qualcomm counterpart. Overall, the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm Cellular Insights also created a chart that compares the edge of cell performance of several different smartphones. The increasing numbers on the X-axis below represent increasingly poor signal strength, while on the Y-axis, a higher throughput number indicates better performance. The iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem demonstrates the poorest performance of all phones tested. According to Cellular Insights, in every single test, the iPhone 7 Plus with a Qualcomm modem "had a significant performance edge" over the iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem. For more information on the testing methodology and greater technical detail on the results, make sure to check out Cellular Insights' full comparison article.Related Roundup: iPhone 7 Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Buzz60 - on October 27, 2016< > Embed The iPhone 7 Secret: Is One Model Much Slower? 01:10 Reports show the newest versions of the iPhone 7 are powered by different modems and one is slower.

Amazon just announced the Echo Look, a new camera and style assistant From Google Glass to the Apple Newton, a museum in Sweden is shining a spotlight on some of the tech sector’s biggest misses. The Museum of Failure as it’s known, has products from Apple, Sony, Kodak and Google, as well as several other makers, all of which struggled with consumers. The collection covers over sixty “failed products and services from around the world,” according to a description on the museum’s web page. Samuel West, the museum’s curator, advises companies on how to successfully innovate by learning from failure. “A lot of tech failures are because immature technology is launched [such as] Google Glass, Apple Newton,” West told Fox News in an email. A tech product can be marketed “before it actually works and way before it is useful,” he said. But that’s all part of ultimately coming up with a successful innovation. “Innovation always requires an acceptance of failure…if you’re afraid of failure, innovation is impossible,” West added. Here are some of the notable flops from the exhibition, due to open in June in Helsingborg, Sweden. More On: gadgets Crimes are being solved by witnesses without eyes or ears How a fitness tracker could save your life The days of cracked phone screens will soon be over Prison inmates might be getting free tablets for some reason Kodak DC40 digital camera Innovation doesn’t succeed if a company doesn’t embrace emerging business models. That happened with Kodak, an early leader in digital cameras and is probably one of the best examples of innovation that failed. The DC40, manufactured by Kodak, was also branded as the Apple QuickTake 100. (Yes, Apple sold a standalone camera once.) “[Kodak’s] failure was an inability to truly embrace the new business models [that] disruptive change opens up,” according to an annotation attached to the Museum’s DC40 exhibit. “Kodak created a digital camera, invested in the technology, and even understood that photos would be shared online.” What Kodak failed to do was realize that online photo sharing was a new business, “not just a way to expand the [photo] printing business,” according to the annotation. Google Glass Google’s attempt to make smart glasses the next big thing in personal gadgets failed because the technology “still didn’t have any useful applications,” West told Fox News. Privacy concerns, due to the potential for furtive video recording, were also its downfall. Nokia N-gageReuters Despite the failure with consumers, Google Glass has gone on to have somthing of a second life, resonating in the healthcare and medical professions. Nokia N-gage The combination phone and gaming device failed at both, especially when you tried to put it to your ear and use it as a phone. “Poor design and lack of games made it flop. Great idea, lousy implementation,” according to West. Orbitoclast Lobotomy This 1948 technology for performing lobotomies was supposed to make them quicker and easier than before. “The tool was a success but the lobotomy as treatment was a terrible failure,” West said. Harley-Davidson Perfume This was a “brand extension failure” according to West. Bikers were not impressed. Other notable failures include the Apple Newton, which suffered from poor handwriting recognition, questionable utility, and a high price. (Apple did go on to create the iPhone, however.) Another was the Twitter Peek, “the world’s first dedicated Twitter device,” as described on the product’s package. Gizmodo described it as being “so dumb it makes my brain hurt.” Last but not least was the Sony Betamax, one of the most oft-cited flops. “Sony refused to collaborate with other manufacturers, while JVC focused on building a collaborative ecosystem by licensing the VHS format,” according to an annotation attached to the Betamax exhibit. “The classic story of tech innovation failure demonstrates that technical excellence and being first to market is not enough.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under apple ,  gadgets ,  google glass ,  harley-davidson ,  inventions ,  museums ,  nokia ,  sweden ,  Tech ,  twitter Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Jeff Bezos close to eclipsing Bill Gates as world's riches...

This appears to be the earliest stage of real-world testing, but Apple is not taking its time. They're in an arms race. The company just obtained a permit to test this technology in California April 14. The permit covered "three vehicles, all Lexus RX450h, and six drivers."

The kit included sensors that helped the car observe the world around it, according to Engadget. The sensors came “off the shelf” from third parties like Velodyne—they were not custom, Apple-designed hardware. A New York Times report from September stated Apple was rethinking its strategy in pursuing self-driving cars, but the company's recent actions indicate the tech behemoth is fully committed to seeing this through. Apple is on a mission to be the leader in this realm, but it will face competition, as Alphabet and Tesla are among the companies vying to get self-driving cars—AKA “autonomous-car technology”—on the road. California has granted permits for the testing to 30 companies so far. These companies include startups, car makers, automotive suppliers, and giants like Apple and Google.

It’s apparently been thinking of introducing such a platform since 2015 and has started up talks again with payments industry partners. Multiple sources familiar with these discussions told Recode that the service would basically allow iPhone users to send money to other iPhone users digitally. It’ll have to face-off against heavyweights like Venmo, Paypal, and Square Cash, with its main advantage being the in-built convenience of having the service baked into iOS. Apple’s current venture into transactions, Apple Pay, hasn’t been as successful as the firm had hoped it would be. Several sources in US banks believe that usage of the platform has been lighter than expected. The company is reportedly looking to address this by partnering up with Visa for a pre-paid card. Also See: First photos of Apple’s self-driving car surface This alleged pre-paid card may run on Visa’s debit network and be connected with the aforementioned peer-to-peer service. People would be able to send cash to the possibly virtual card via the new platform. This cash could then be spent in offline stores, websites, and apps. Apple has a financial incentive for the card as well. It probably won’t charge its customers for using the money-transfer service, so the only way it can earn money is through its own debit card. However, the card is apparently raising concerns among banking executives who will have to battle with Apple to woo consumers.

Photo / AP Apple is investigating ways to charge iPhones and iPads wirelessly and without contact using the signal emitted by radio frequencies such as Wi-Fi, a patent filing has revealed. The indication the company is working on the system will raise hopes that the end of having to physically plug a cable into a mobile device in order to charge it could be around the corner. Filings reveal Apple is looking at ways to re-power its devices using mobile, Wi-Fi and millimetre wave signals. It proposes directing telectromagnetic frequencies, normally used for data transmission, towards device as a "beam" of energy. Long-range wireless charging isn't a new concept and Apple has been working on different ways to achieve it for a number of years. It first filed a patent for a way to wirelessly recharge an iMac at a distance of one metre back in 2010. Last year, Bloomberg reported that the company was working with partners to develop the system for mobile devices. It said it could be introduced to the iPhone as early as 2017. While the patent filing is the greatest hint yet that Apple is working on the technology, it only covers the theory behind the method rather than an actual way to do it. Rumours suggest that Apple is planning to introduce wireless charging to the iPhone for the first time this year in time for its ten year anniversary. Adding weight to reports, the company joined an industry group called the Wireless Power Consortium in February. However, the method of wireless charging that Apple could use is still unclear. It had been claimed that the iPhone would not feature the short-range "inductive" wireless charging used on the Watch and rival phones. Instead, Apple was said to be waiting to introduce wireless charging on the handsets only when it had developed a long-range system. But the recent patent appears to be too early stage. Apple patented a separate "inductive charging station" concept for the iPhone last Autumn, paving the way for short-range wireless charging on the iPhone 8. The upcoming handset is rumoured to come with a glass case that could support the feature. - Daily Telegraph UK By Cara McGoogan Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Apple Users Are In New Merriam-Webster Dictionary Definition By AJ Dellinger On 04/28/17 AT 9:09 PM Close Apple fanboys have always had a reputation for undying loyalty to the brand, but Merriam-Webster is taking that characterization to a new level by using them as an example for new dictionary entry “sheeple.” According to the newly added word, a “sheeple” is an informal term that is used to describe "people who are docile, compliant, or easily influenced" and can be likened or compared to sheep. Read: Apple Vs. Qualcomm: Apple Ceases Royalty Payments Amid Lawsuits, Qualcomm Stock Price Plummets To show the word in action, Merriam-Webster included two example sentences, including one that takes a shot at the folks who prefer Apple’s computers and mobile devices over the alternatives. “Apple's debuted a battery case for the juice-sucking iPhone—an ungainly lumpy case the sheeple will happily shell out $99 for,” the sentence reads. A second, much more innocuous sentence was also included. “James Nichols, who ran the family farm here, stamped dollar bills with red ink in protest against currency and told his neighbors that they were ‘sheeple’ for obeying authority like livestock,” it reads. According to Merriam-Webster’s history for the word, sheeple was first used in 1945—more than 30 years before Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple and 62 years before the company would introduce the device that would apparently help herd the sheeple. Read: iPhone Wireless Charging: Apple Wants You To Charge Your Device Via Wi-Fi In The Future The case referenced in the sentence is the Smart Battery Case Apple introduced in 2015 for the iPhone 6 and 6s. The accessory was the company’s first attempt at cracking the market for battery cases, and its odd, rubbery design with a bump in the middle where the battery was located tended to stand out for all the wrong reasons. It did, however, add an additional 18 hours of continuous internet usage or 20 hours of video streaming to the iPhone, which pretty successfully counters the “battery-sucking” tendencies the popular handset has. And while the example sentence may suggest a blind loyalty to Apple and its products, the company likely isn’t complaining about such a reputation—especially since it pays off come quarterly earnings. The 2017 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index conducted by Brand Keys found Apple generated the most loyal companies in many of the tech categories it offers products in, including computers, tablets, smartphones, online music and headphones via its subsidary Beats by Dre. In addition to “sheeple,” Merriam-Webster also added the term “intersectionality,” which it defines as “the complex, cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination (such as racism, sexism, and classism) combine, overlap, or intersect especially in the experiences of marginalized individuals or groups.” Related Stories New Mac Malware Can Bypass Apple’s Security Tools Apple Wants iPhones To Charge Via Wi-Fi, Patent Shows Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Google indeed did launch their own take in the form of the Google Home, but Apple’s version has yet to surface. We have heard that the company is close to finalizing a design, and now more details have surfaced. In a tweet by Mashable’s Jen Ryall, she shares additional details about Apple’s Echo competitor that were provided by Sonny Dickson. According to those details, Apple’s Echo competitor is expected to feature a design that is in the style of the Mac Pro. Chances are it won’t be quite as big or look exactly the same, but there will apparently be some stylistic similarities. More claims from @SonnyDickson on Apple’s Alexa competitor: – Think Mac Pro style. – Same style UE boom mesh. – Possible release WWDC. 2/2 — Jen Ryall (@jennijenni) April 28, 2017 It will sport a concave top with controls, a speaker mesh portion covering it all that is similar to the UE Boom’s mesh, and that it will most likely be launched at WWDC 2017 which kicks off this coming June. We know that Apple has used WWDC to launch new products before so it wouldn’t really be surprising to see them do it again. We can only assume that it will be powered by Siri, and since it is WWDC, perhaps Apple could even announce and share plans on how developers could potentially help to create “skills” for the device like what is being done with Amazon’s Alexa, but until then take it with a grain of salt.

Apple even alleged that Qualcomm had withheld payments to Apple as a form of “punishment” for cooperating with the Korea Fair Trade Commission. In what feels a bit ironic, a report from Bloomberg has revealed that Apple is now the one who is withholding payments to Qualcomm over royalties for patents used. As a result, Qualcomm claims that they will now have to revise its financials and lower forecasts due to the lack of revenue from the royalties that they were expected to receive. According to Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, “While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts. Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade.” Apple has also issued a statement which reads, “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms. Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court.  As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own.” In the meantime it doesn’t look like this spat between both companies will be coming to a close anytime soon, especially since Qualcomm has filed their own countersuit against Apple.

It’s been not even a month since it was discovered that Apple was granted permission to testing their self-driving technology on California roads and it looks like the company wants to change how things are being done. In a report from Reuters, Apple has sent in a letter to the California DMV and asked them to change their policy when it comes to reporting disengagements with regards to self-driving cars. For those wondering, disengagements is when a self-driving car stops driving itself and controls are handed back to its accompanying human driver. Sometimes this is intentional, sometimes it can be accidental, but California’s rules state that all incidents of disengagement need to be reported. Apple claims that inconsistencies in how disengagements are reported could lead to the public being misled or confused with regards to the safety/viability of the technology. “Apple believes that public acceptance is essential to the advancement of automated vehicles. Access to transparent and intuitive data on the safety of the vehicles being tested will be central to gaining public acceptance. However, the current and proposed disengagement reporting requirements do not achieve this result.” Whether or not this will happen remains to be seen. In the meantime photos of Apple’s self-driving test car has already been spotted on the roads making its round. Filed in Apple >Transportation. Read more about Legal and self-driving cars.

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 143.65 -0.14 -0.10% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 924.99 +6.61 +0.72% Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD ▼ 13.30 -0.32 -2.35% Intel Corp INTC ▼ 36.15 -1.28 -3.42% AdChoices "Apple's doing so many things right. It's making the best products, developing a deep ecosystem with a substantial service revenue stream," the "Mad Money" host said Plus, Apple's upcoming iPhone release is rumored to have an array of new features that makes the smartphone more functional and easier to handle, which should boost sales and new customer numbers, Cramer said. The company also stands to massively benefit from repatriation if the administration is able to implement it. All said and done, Cramer says investors should own the stock, not trade it, and eager buyers should hope for a post-earnings dip so they can buy it at a discount. As the busiest week of earnings season came to a close, Cramer breathed a sigh of relief despite Friday's mild pullback caused by a weaker-than-expected GDP number. Read more from CNBC's Jim Cramer The "Mad Money" host said that with the federal government funded through the next week, investors can finally relax and gear up for yet another earnings-filled agenda. On Monday, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reports earnings, and after shares of competitor Intel (INTC) slid on its earnings miss on Thursday, Cramer is unsure that even the best of earnings reports from this chipmaker will garner a positive market reaction. Aside from Apple, Tuesday will bring an earnings report from health-care retailer CVS (CVS), where Cramer says there could be a hidden upside to earnings. "It's hard to really dislike a well run company like this that sells at just 13 times earnings. I say wait and see. Maybe numbers come down, maybe that's your chance," the "Mad Money" host said. On Wednesday, the market will get Facebook (FB)'s results. The social media colossus reports earnings after the bell, and unless its numbers are substantially better, Cramer expects a slight sell-off. "I like how competitive Facebook is," Cramer said. "If you don't own it now, I think you might as well wait to see if we get that kind of weird sell-off that we usually get even after it reports a great number." The gaming sector is one of Cramer's favorite secular growth stories in the stay-at-home economy, and Activision Blizzard's earnings reports have a tendency to spur selling, which may happen when it releases numbers on Thursday. "I say the trend's your friend," Cramer said. "This franchise is worth buying if it gets hit." The Labor Department will release its monthly non-farm payroll data on Friday. The statistics could have a detrimental effect on bank stocks if they are low, but Cramer expects the opposite. "If April turns out to have been a robust hiring month, and I think it will be, that gives the Fed breathing room to raise interest rates twice, and therefore the bank stocks will soar," he said. © Provided by CNBC When Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) reported earnings at the same exact time Thursday night, Cramer found it difficult to compare the two and pick a winner. "The problem is that in some ways, this is a real apples-to-oranges situation," the "Mad Money" host said. Amazon, for example, chooses to promote faith-based investing, assuring shareholders that their India business will flourish and that robots will save time at their fulfillment centers. Alphabet went about energizing investors in a different way. They talked about how their search engines help local businesses and about their cloud operations, which compete with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft (MSFT) Azure. Cramer also spoke with Stephen Milligan, the CEO of Western Digital (WDC), a data storage player and one of the world's biggest hard disk drive manufacturers. Milligan said that the company's longtime partnership with troubled electronics giant Toshiba was worth preserving despite the Japanese giant's current difficulties. "The joint venture that we've had with Toshiba is 17 years running. I would contend that it's probably one of the most successful technology joint ventures in the history of our industry. And so our first goal is let's keep that joint venture healthy," Milligan told Cramer on Friday. While the CEO acknowledged that helping Toshiba could create a bit of an overhang in terms of how investors perceive Western Digital, his main focus remained on growing his own business. "Rest assured, we're going to do our very best to make sure that we protect our interests and advance not only our position, but the stakeholders that Toshiba has, and really come to a resolution that helps us to continue to be successful going forward," the CEO said. Upon the release of BioMarin's (BMRN) orphan drug Brineura, which made headlines for its $702,000-per-year price tag, chairman and CEO JJ Bienaimé said the system will have the final say on whether the sky-high price is fair. "Obviously, the system will have to determine that," he told Cramer on Friday. But I would say that CLN2, the disease that Brineura is being used for, is an absolutely devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which, unfortunately, the patients will lose their life, most of the time by [age] 12." And although Washington lawmakers have knocked pharmaceutical companies for high drug costs, Bienaimé said most policymakers understand the industry's inevitable trial-and-error aspects. "I think, hopefully, ... if there is any kind of regulations coming around health care, that they will make sure that those regulations protect innovation and protect innovative biotech companies," Bienaimé said. Finally, Cramer spoke with AGCO (AGCO) Chairman, President and CEO Martin Richenhagen to understand more about how President Donald Trump's protectionist slant might affect the agricultural landscape. AGCO manufactures agricultural equipment like tractors that require steel to produce. Richenhagen said that if the current administration were to follow through with placing high tariffs on non-U.S. steel, the effects would be felt industry-wide. "For us, of course, if steel's prices would go up because of this kind of protectionism, it wouldn't be so good because finally our customers would have to pay. So that's true for all of us, for the whole industry," the CEO told Cramer on Friday. Richenhagen added that while the move would benefit the steel industry, it was "not really a great strategy" to implement tariffs without explicitly informing consumers of their effects. "All kind of protectionism finally has to be paid for," he said. "And I think consumers should know that." In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Bank of the Internet USA (BOFI): "I don't know. Too much risk there, my friend. I'd rather own JPMorgan (JPM). I think that's a little more, let's just say, strong." Agilent Technologies (A): "Oh my, I like Agilent so much. I like the quarter. You can win two ways here: you can win on an acquisition or you can win on earnings. That's how good that quarter was. Terrific." Questions for Cramer?

X Apple’s Jade takes centre stage on final day of jumps season Irish Stallion Farms Mares Champion Hurdle win could be vital for Gordon Elliott Sat, Apr 29, 2017, 01:00 Brian O'Connor Apple’s Jade ridden by Bryan Cooper clears the last on the way to winning the AES Champion Four Year Old Hurdle at Punchestown last year. Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA          As the curtain descends on a momentous 2016-17 National Hunt season there’s an aptness to Apple’s Jade taking centre stage at Punchestown on Saturday. So many of the main threads in a remarkable campaign are summed up in the fortunes of Apple’s Jade who tries for a third Grade One victory this season in the Irish Stallion Farms Mares Champion Hurdle. A year ago she landed the other top-flight prize on the Punchestown festival’s final card – the AES Champion Four Year Old Hurdle – when trained by Willie Mullins and her route to the top of the senior tree looked straightforward. September’s seismic split between Mullins and Michael O’Leary’s Gigginstown Stud team meant it proved to be anything but. Switched to the champion trainer’s great challenger, Gordon Elliott, Apple’s Jade had Champion Hurdle ambitions ruled out by two initial defeats but her quality rose to the top in a memorable Hatton’s Grace victory and in even more famous Cheltenham success last month.   That she carried O’Leary’s colours to a dramatic defeat of the Mullins pair, Vroum Vroum Mag and Limini, which was vital to Elliott deposing Mullins as the Cheltenham festival’s leading trainer, neatly summed up so much of what has transpired this season. Now she returns to action against four Mullins mares in what is, bar the British outsider, Lady Buttons, practically a private Grade One face off between the sport’s superpowers. Patrick Mullins secures Punchestown festival hat-trick Patrick Mullins completes dream treble with Montalbano Wicklow Brave holds out to win Champion Hurdle On form it’s a relatively straightforward assignment for Apple’s Jade but the intriguing element is Ruby Walsh’s decision to overlook a trio of proven top-flight winners and opt to ride a stable companion who has won two ordinary races in two years. Karalee really could be anything. But just three lifetime starts in all means she has a mountain to climb in terms of experience alone. Apple’s Jade is one of 13 declarations on the card for Elliott who will hope that isn’t an unlucky omen in terms of his trainer’s title ambitions. But considering he has usually had a numerical edge this season it’s noteworthy that Mullins has a massive team of 20 declared for the final day. Headline act That they don’t include Annie Power will be a regret for many and there’s also no denying the absence of the season’s outstanding four year old, Defi Du Seuil, robs the big juvenile prize of a headline act. This could turn into another Mullins-Elliott show and it will be the fifth time that Bapaume and Mega Fortune have clashed this term. Each has finished ahead of the other on two occasions although it has been Mega Fortune who has had an edge the last two times, including when just a short head in front of his rival as they chased home Defi Du Seuil in the Triumph. Mullins’s slight disappointment with Bapaume at Cheltenham – “I thought he might run a little bit better than he did: hopefully he can find some improvement” – is interesting and ground conditions could swing things towards a fifth win in a row for the champion trainer in this race.    Mullins dominates the top of the €100,000 handicap hurdle but could have a value option at the other end of the scale in Pique Sous. The new champion conditional Rachel Blackmore takes 3lbs off Pique Sous who ran here over two miles earlier this week and was predictably outpaced in the closing stages. Britain’s National Hunt campaign also winds up at Sandown on Saturday where Special Tiara flies the Irish flag in the four-runner Celebration Chase. Special Tiara memorably took advantage of Douvan’s flop at Cheltenham to assume the two-mile crown so on quick ground, and over Sandown’s famous obstacles, Henry De Bromhead’s star represents a true test for the star novice Altior. Nicky Henderson’s seven year old is widely expected to be the stable’s successor to Sprinter Sacre and has already put up some huge performances for a novice on official figures. Such theory is one thing but Special Tiara is a proper seasoned two-miler who also has the in-form Noel Fehily on his back. “Altior looks very good but our lad has every chance. He put up a superb performance at Cheltenham and beat Fox Norton. And we’ve seen what he has gone on to do at Aintree and Punchestown,” said De Bromhead.       Topics: Ruby Walsh Noel Fehily Annie Power Rachel Blackmore Brian O'connor Gordon Elliott Michael O'leary Willie Mullins Henry De Bromhead Read More Bacardys takes Champion Novice Hurdle to increase Willie Mullins’ lead Arctic Fire can secure Punchestown Champion Hurdle Willie Mullins closes gap in battle for trainers’ title Unowhatimeanharry turns tables on Nichols Canyon Tony Keenan’s tips: Punchestown Friday Punchestown day three: Previews, analysis and tips Sizing John wins Punchestown Gold Cup for the ages  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Other Sports Joshua triumphs over Klitschko in heavyweight fight for the ages Other Sports Katie Taylor claims first pro title with crushing display Sport Sideline Cut: Sporting life no fairytale story when reality bites Other Sports Ian O’Riordan: Has sport become bad for our health?

Qualcomm says Apple’s refusal to pay royalties related to technology used in smartphones will take a big bite out of its profit and revenue.

Qualcomm says Apple has indicated that it won’t pay fees until the dispute is resolved. Representatives for the Cupertino, California-based iPhone did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday, April 28, 2017. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is refusing to pay any royalties owed to mobile chip maker Qualcomm for some of the features in the iPhone, escalating a patent feud that has turned the former business partners into bitter adversaries. The latest twist in the dispute represents a major blow for Qualcomm, which depends on licensing fees for a large portion of its revenue. Apple's decision to withhold royalties will cost Qualcomm up to $500 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm released Friday. "This is getting ugly, the level of hostility just went up another notch," said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. As retaliation, Qualcomm could seek a court order halting iPhone sales until Apple pays the royalties that Qualcomm contends it's owed, Moorhead said. Qualcomm hasn't threatened to go to that extreme yet, but its top lawyer made it clear on Friday that the San Diego company is girding for a fierce fight with its Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world's most valuable company. "We will continue vigorously to defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. Apple concedes it and its suppliers owe Qualcomm some licensing fees on iPhone sales. But Apple believes Qualcomm has been abusing its power in the mobile chip market to charge for royalties on features that aren't covered by its patents. Qualcomm, in turn, has accused Apple of breaking contracts in an attempt to lower its licensing fees and also interfering in deals negotiated with iPhone suppliers. The stalemate prompted Apple to sue Qualcomm in January in a federal complaint. Qualcomm denied the allegations and fired back with its own lawsuit against Apple earlier this month. In a Friday statement, Apple said it won't pay Qualcomm any further royalties until the courts determine the amount, a process that could take several years.

"As we've said before, Qualcomm's demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own," Apple said. Rosenberg reiterated that Qualcomm holds "valid and enforceable" licensing agreements on various features in iPhones. Apple's suspension of royalty payments marks "the latest step in Apple's global attack on Qualcomm," said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel. Apple isn't alone in its accusations against Qualcomm. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also has filed a lawsuit alleging that Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. With the loss of iPhone royalty payments, Qualcomm now expects its revenue for its April-June quarter to range from $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, down from its previous forecast of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. Qualcomm now expects its earnings for the period to range from 75 to 85 cents per share. That's down from an earlier projection of 90 cents to $1.15 per share. Investors shook off the shock of Qualcomm's lowered guidance after initially driving down the company's stock. Its stock rose 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.74 on Friday. The stock has fallen by about 15 percent since Apple filed its lawsuit. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube Apple is a company that is notorious for closing off its own apps or services to non-Apple products. For example it took Apple years before deciding to open up Siri to third-party developers, where prior to recent times Siri was pretty much limited to what Apple said that it could do. However it seems that Apple could be relaxing their control because the company has recently announced that they have teamed up with Musical.ly. This collaboration will see Musical.ly users be able to access the library of Apple Music for use in their music video clips. For those who are unfamiliar, Musical.ly is an app that lets users create 15 second music videos with a bunch of effects, allowing users to put together some quirky lip synced music videos to their favorite songs. 🚨🚨 Did you know?? We’ve teamed up with @musicallyapp to bring you full versions of your favorite songs without having to leave the app! pic.twitter.com/3eC21V6cme — Apple Music (@AppleMusic) April 28, 2017 While access to a larger library is no doubt a boon for Musical.ly, it also helps to create awareness and visibility for Apple Music where it could potentially result in more users subscribing to the service. Given Apple’s plans for Apple Music which apparently will have a more video-centric focus in the future, this visibility will no doubt help them gain an audience. As it stands, Spotify is still pretty much the king of music streaming services, although Apple Music appears to be catching up pretty fast. In the meantime for those curious about Musical.ly, check out the video above to get an idea of what the app is about. Filed in Apple >Audio. Read more about apple music, Apps and Music.

In a letter made public on Friday, Apple suggested a series of changes to the draft policy that is under development and said it looks forward to working with California and others "so that rapid technology development may be realised while ensuring the safety of the travelling public." Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet Inc, Ford Motor Co, Uber Technologies Inc, Toyota Motor Corp, Tesla Motors Inc and others also filed comments suggesting changes. California said on Tuesday it would review comments before deciding whether to make changes to the policy that aims to allow companies to test vehicles without traditional steering wheels and controls or human back-up drivers. The state is at the forefront of a crowded race to develop self-driving vehicles and the proposed changes from automakers and technology companies help provide insight into current efforts. In its letter, Apple said California should revise how companies report self-driving system "disengagements." California currently requires companies to report how many times the self-driving system was deactivated and control handed back to humans because of a system failure or a situation tied to traffic, weather or road conditions that required human intervention for safety reasons. But Apple wants those rules to extend to humans stepping in to prevent even minor traffic violations. Apple contends the reporting rules as written leave too much wiggle room for car makers and "caused public confusion and misunderstanding," wrote Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity. Apple also asked regulators to revisit language around the definition of an autonomous vehicle to clarify that permits are required in advanced systems even when a safety driver is present. The exact wording around when permits are needed became a sticking point between Uber and state officials last year when the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered Uber to cease its self-driving tests in San Francisco. Apple also said the state's rules for development vehicles used only in testing could "restrict both the design and equipment that can be used in test vehicles." A late entrant to the self-driving race, Apple secured a permit earlier this month to test autonomous vehicles in California. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building a car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts. The company declined to comment on Friday. 'Stifle innovation' Tesla said California should not bar testing of autonomous vehicles that are 10,000 pounds (4,535kg) or more, a move that Apple also joined. Tesla said such a move could "stifle innovation," and bar a company from testing a heavy autonomous vehicle that might be used to haul parts on private property rather than on public roads, pushing developers in this sector out of the state. Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, in 2016 announced plans for new electric vehicles, including a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi and a public transport bus. The electric vehicle pioneer said earlier this month it plans to unveil a commercial truck in September. Tesla also said California should not prohibit the sale of non-self-driving vehicles previously used for autonomous vehicle testing. Tesla said that under the proposal, if it loads a vehicle with autonomous testing software and then replaces it with conventional production software it could be barred from selling the vehicle. Uber said California should allow paying members of the public to ride in autonomous vehicles with drivers, saying: "There is no reason to deny those riders an opportunity to travel in an autonomous test vehicle and provide honest feedback." Lyft Inc, a ride-hailing service rival of Uber, asked the state to remove a requirement that it notify local authorities of autonomous vehicle testing. Waymo asked California to remove its liability proposal. On Tuesday, General Motors Co had said the state's proposed liability rules could make automakers liable regardless of fault for any crash. GM also said that automakers should be allowed to reuse autonomous vehicles and parts after testing or if the vehicle is scrapped. Volkswagen AG and Daimler AG submitted joint comments seeking changes to the extent of data required to be retained in crashes involving self-driving cars. A number of automakers have said they plan to begin deploying self-driving vehicles, some in commercial fleets, by 2020-21. © Thomson Reuters 2017 For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

Two employees of nightlife-rating app Bartrendr claim they were ordered to be pretend partygoers and post constantly in order to make the app seem popular. The now-defunct app encouraged users to post comments on beers and bar scenes in real time. The California bosses were so desperate to drum up business that they ordered workers to adopt “multiple pseudonyms or personas in order to give the application the appearance of more user interaction,” according to a lawsuit filed by Staci Spector, 47, and Lisa Garcia, 46. They often worked more than 80 hours a week but were only paid $1,500 a month, they claim. Spector and Garcia were fired in May 2015 after complaining, they charge in a wrongful-termination suit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. Social Standards, the company behind the app, didn’t respond to a message.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple celebrates Earth Day with new initiatives and stories of innovation The report also highlights the latest information about Apple’s global forestry partnerships. This year, through its partnership with WWF in China, Apple has transitioned approximately 320,000 acres of forest in China toward Forest Stewardship Council certification. This advancement means, in just two years, the company has now reached its goal of protecting and creating enough sustainably managed forests to cover all its packaging needs. Apple’s forestry work is just the beginning of its efforts to conserve the world’s precious resources. The company also announced the ambitious goal of creating a closed loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material.

It was his favorite setting for thought. Apple Park captures his spirit uncannily well,” said Laurene Powell Jobs. “He would have flourished, as the people of Apple surely will, on this luminously designed campus.” “Steve invested so much of his energy creating and supporting vital, creative environments. We have approached the design, engineering and making of our new campus with the same enthusiasm and design principles that characterize our products,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “Connecting extraordinarily advanced buildings with rolling parkland creates a wonderfully open environment for people to create, collaborate and work together. We have been extremely fortunate to be able to work closely, over many years, with the remarkable architectural practice Foster + Partners.” CategoriesUncategorized TagsPress Release Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Apple’s WWDC returns to San Jose June 5-9, 2017 Next PostNext Apple introduces iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition Search Recent Posts Test our new Product Navigator!

In an earnings call with a Wall Street analyst, the company said this was by design and part of an effort to “take a long term view” of the platform, according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Pichai continued by noting that Maps is still seeing strong user growth years after its initial launch thanks to its growth in emerging markets. He also said that with the rise of augmented reality, it’s likely that Maps will soon play a bigger role in the company’s future strategy. The most interesting details gleaned from the investor call, however, relate to Google’s future monetization plans for Maps. “I’m sure you have noticed changes in Google Maps with the last few months. If you open Google Maps, you’re traveling or out on a Friday evening, we start surfacing a lot more info about what you can do, places to eat and so on. So those are beginning to get good feedback from users and I think that gives us an opportunity to add value there overtime as well,” said Pichai. The key words in this quote are “good feedback” and “add value,” two of the overarching core values behind Google as a company. If Google thinks users like recommendations regarding nearby restaurants and attractions, Maps could adopt a similar monetization strategy to Waze, its other navigation app. It’s possible Pichai’s comments could pertain to another advertising or monetization strategy, though it’s unlikely the company will opt to display intrusive banner ads in Maps at any point in the near future.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 29, 2017 5:52pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL Consulting The Crystal Ball To See How Apple May Reduce Its iPhone Dependence Skyworks Exceeds Expectations, Evolves Away From iPhone-Dependence Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Fed Will Grab Spotlight: Investing Action Plan (Investor's Business Daily) Related SSNLF Skyworks Exceeds Expectations, Evolves Away From iPhone-Dependence Qualcomm Downgraded Amid iPhone 8 Share Loss Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Samsung Electronic (OTC: SSNLF)'s famed rivalry in the smartphone arena continues. Though the former appeals to its audience with its feature-rich phones, which are aesthetically designed and are easy to use, the latter has strived all through to match its rival in every step. Maintaining Its Lead Despite Note 7 Debacle Samsung's forte is its cost appeal, as it creates several models, each catering to different demographics of society. In 2016 alone, Samsung rolled out 31 models of smartphones from its stable compared to Apple's three. Despite its flagship Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, which transitorily generated negative sentiment, Samsung still sold 311.4 million smartphone units of in 2016 compared to Apple's 215.4 million, giving Samsung a market share of 21.2 percent. Who knows what, if not for the Note 7 debacle, Samsung's numbers would have been? Benzinga looked at how Apple would have fared in terms of valuation if it had sold as many units of smartphones as Samsung did in 2016. The analysis was done based on the following assumptions: Unit shipment figures for 2016 from IDC's research. The ASP of iPhone was taken from the most recent quarter for which data was available (fiscal year first quarter or calendar year fourth quarter). Revenues of other product/service categories were taken from Apple's fiscal year Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2016 and fiscal year 2017 Q1. The corresponding quarterly numbers were summed up to get the calendar year 2016 figure. (This became essential because Apple's fiscal year ends in September and the shipment data available from IDC pertained to the calendar year 2016). iPhone Revenues 44% More With Samsung Shipment Numbers Assuming Apple sold 311.4 million units (Samsung's 2016 smartphone shipments) of iPhones instead of the 215.4 million it actually sold and applying an average selling price of $695 (the most recent quarterly statistics), the company would have generated annual revenues of $216.42 billion from the iPhone alone, roughly 44 percent more than it actually made. Reconciled Calendar Year 2016 Revenues From Other Product Categories iPad: $19.08 billion. Mac: $23.42 billion. Services: $25.46 billion. Other Products: $10.81 billion. Arriving At Valuation Apple's calendar year 2016 revenues using Samsung's smartphone units would have been $295.19 billion. Applying a price to sales ratio of 3.46, valuation would have been $1,021.36 as opposed to $753.72 billion currently. Under this hypothetical scenario, Apple would trade at $194.55 compared to its current market price of $144, suggesting 35 percent upside from current levels. Is Apple's think tank listening? A moot point, however, would be if Apple begins to focus on volume, and whether it can it do so without hurting margins and product quality.

This is a look at the reasons to buy the new MacBook Pro and why you should buy an old model or wait for the 2017 MacBook Pro. While there are definitely some reasons to hate the 2016 MacBook Pro design there are also plenty of reasons to buy it — and the latest macOS Sierra updates help with battery life and functionality. This new MacBook Pro includes a sleek new design, upgraded performance, better battery life, Touch ID, a new Touch Bar and a new Space Gray color option. Read: 2016 MacBook Pro 13 vs MacBook Pro 15 We’ll walk through five reasons to buy new MacBook Pro, three reasons to look for an older MacBook Pro deal from someone who is upgrading, and a reason to wait for a 2017 MacBook Pro. Here’s a list of reasons to buy the 2016 MacBook Pro: Buy for a Smaller Design & Touch Bar Buy for More Storage Buy for Fast Connectivity Options Buy for More Performance Buy for Touch ID & Apple Pay Buy a Refurb for a Better Macbook Pro Deal Why you should buy the new MacBook Pro and why you should buy an older model. Apple announced a new 13-inch MacBook Pro, a 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch ID and Touch Bar and a 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch ID and a TouchBar. The new models start at $1,499 and go up to $2,399 before upgrades and customizations. Now that the 2016 MacBook Pro reviews here and the MacBook with Touch Bar is in stores we take an updated look at why you should buy this new model and why you should skip it. Here is a walkthrough of the reasons to buy the new MacBook Pro and the reasons you should look at Windows PCs, buy a 2015 MacBook Pro or wait for the 2017 MacBook Pro. If you decide to buy the new model, here are the best 2016 MacBook Pro cases, covers and skins. Buy for a Smaller Design & Touch Bar   1 / 10 One of the biggest reasons to buy the 2016 MacBook Pro is the new design. The new MacBook Pro is thinner, lighter and smaller than the one it replaces.  Apple shaves half a pound of each of the models, shrinks the overall; size by 20 to 23% and makes them thinner without cutting battery life, performance or the screen size.  The new models include a Touch Bar above the display on the $1,799 and up models. This allows you to touch the small display to control applications and system functions.  When you use Apple applications and soon other applications, the Touch Bar will change so you can use it to quickly access what you want. We know you can use it for Emoji, for app functions, for quick replies and much more.  In addition to the Touch Bar, you also get a new Force Touch trackpad that is twice as big as the trackpad on the 2015 MacBook Pro.    1 / 10 25 Responses 08/03/2016 Still Waiting... Reply Reason 6 of 8: “The best case scenario is that the 2016 MacBook Pro release date is in early June.” Really? This article is dated August 2. Doesn’t anyone review this stuff?? 08/03/2016 Paul Reply Starting to Wonder if Apple will still be in the PC business to much longer? 08/04/2016 Sergey Reply Too bad there is not a single decent(performance, battery, weight, case/assemble quality, screen, ssd only, no stupid parts like dvd) alternative to macbook pro, else I’d have bought one already :| There are close catch like XPS 15 but this is still far off by some parameters(ssd size – no 1tb option) 10/17/2016 Jeff Diamond Reply Sergey, the cool thing about the Dell XPS 15″ is that both the DRAM and SSD are user upgradeable. You can, if you wish, buy the low end version and upgrade it to a 4 TB Samsung SSD and 32Gb DRAM! I’ve already priced that out, and the price is about the same as the high end Macbook Pro. And the Dell is a YEAR OLD! 12/24/2016 M. Connell Reply If you dare to compare a Dell against an Apple. You don’t need an Apple. Stick with your Windblows PC ! 10/27/2016 Conrad Reply razer blade stealth? 08/28/2016 shishir Reply the new mac will not have a AMD or Nvidia graphics it will have the same intel graphics which sucks .. who is going to even buy it 10/10/2016 futunet Reply Meh. Apple is destroying functionality on the altar of minimalism. I mean seriously, no standard USB ports? Sorry, but I don’t want a bunch of adapters. No Magsafe power port? No port for Apple Cinema displays? Sorry Apple, but you’re doing what you did in the 90’s. You’re not listening to users and you’re making stupid choices by committee. Further proof that Apple without Jobs is a mediocre company. 10/19/2016 Bradley Gibson Reply The TB3/USB3.1/DisplayPort ports ARE standard USB ports. They are Type-C USB 3.1. In addition to 10Gbps USB data transfer, they also allow delivery of up to 100W of power, so one can be used to charge the laptop’s battery. Worst case is you’ll need a few new USB cables to go from type C to your device (instead of type A). You already need cables to go from type A to your device, so you won’t be any worse off than you are now. 10/19/2016 Roman Matysek Reply I have purchased the best MBP 2015 model with 600USD discount this summer. Even official Czech dealer was thinking new Macbooks Pro are comming out. The price is already high again. 10/29/2016 John Marchant Reply Old technology, to keep calling the Macbook a Pro is misleading. Its expensive, 6th and not 7th Gen CPU, still only 16 GB graphics and more expensive. Sorry Apple but people looking for a Pro laptop want power and performance not smaller and lighter. Its not like it is smaller or lighter. Dell XPS 15 is certainly better bang for your buck. Yet again Apple does not convince me to move from PC to Mac laptop. Another missed opportunity, but im sure the fans boys will love its looks and shell out whatever price Apple puts on it. 10/30/2016 Fahru syuhada Reply So I have a question about how do we use the basic function keys if it’s already replaced by the Touch Bar? 10/30/2016 Mike X Reply The new Macbook Pro, get less for more… 11/02/2016 Anonymous Badger Reply On the 13in Non touch bar model there is a 2.0GHz i5. The 2015 model, which costs hundreds of dollars less, has a 2.7GHz i5. Such a downgrade. 11/02/2016 SShould Reply This articles is really poorly conceived and just seems like a marketing extension of Apple’s Website. You provide no real reasons to purchase the Macbook Pro , Why visit your site. 11/02/2016 walter carroll Reply Apple has slashed the price of MacBook Pro 2015 to $430 and $270 respectively? Really? Where can I get a MacBook for $430? 11/02/2016 John Marchant Reply I wish they had because i would rather buy a 2015 model than an arm and a leg for a 2016 model. 11/04/2016 don't buy macbook pro Reply don’t buy macbook pro dos’t have DDR4 RAM , all new laptop with DDR4 11/07/2016 VexiaArt Reply U must see this joke https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=789994411141328&id=115098615297581&_rdr 11/07/2016 sussko Reply would you like to buy a macbook pro 2015 or 2016 if it will be your first macbook ever and your current laptop is over 10 years old? 11/19/2016 tealynn Reply This site isn’t mobile friendly. The words run off the side of the page and the next button doesn’t take me to the next page :( -iPhone7plus 11/21/2016 A Good Person Reply LOOK AT THE DATE PEOPLE 03/16/2017 bigbluetaxi Reply Did you actually use the MBP before writing the article or are you just rehashing marketing material? Anyway, looks like the general consensus is in: The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar sucks donkey d#ck, it belongs on a lower end model. Battery life sucks, usability with the Touch Bar sucks, not having MagSafe is a PITA. We’ll be waiting for the MBP to release in 15″ without the TouchBar. Otherwise will be buying a 2015 model when the time comes. 03/23/2017 Rihanna Reply Bitch better have my moneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyy 04/29/2017 Nick Reply Definitely 32GB ram is an improvement 64GB is par to competition(IBM) 128 means PRO. Let’s get four core I7 in the 13″. If i have the option to choose 2TB and 4TB for HD I do not care if it is soldered on the motherboard. Make them smaller, smaller bezel and the display closer to the hinges a true 13 and 15 inch. Make the screen fold around like a 2-1. Give us touch screen. The price is already excellent and very competitive for equal purchases but a 20% reduction is better. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Investors Take Over 365 Data Centers, What’s Next? – The market continues to consolidate, and the new owners are likely to be on the look-out for more roll-up opportunities in “edge” markets. IBM Launches Four Cloud Data Centers in US – Cloud has been one of the few bright spots in the company’s overall picture of declining revenue in recent years as it struggles to adjust to the new world where enterprises are not signing nearly as many big data center hardware and services contracts as they used to, opting instead for cloud services by the likes of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Going Green in Silicon Valley is Expensive, but Not for Everyone – At least one data center provider in Silicon Valley has managed to make buying renewable energy for its campus there easier for itself. And it pulled it off by taking advantage of a window of opportunity that opened only briefly in 2010 and has since been shut. Cloud Giants Disagree on the Future of Corporate Data Centers – We heard two very different perspectives on the future of on-premise enterprise data centers from top executives on this week’s earnings calls by two of the world’s largest cloud providers.

The evolving compendium of the English language has garnered headlines recently with its social media swipes at the Trump administration. And now, the dictionary is trolling Apple fans by using them as an example of the term "sheeple." According to Merriam-Webster: Damn, shots fired. Knowing the ways in which Apple fanboys-and-girls just repeat each other's talking points, this won't go over well. Obviously, Webster's dictionary is living in the past, a time when headphone jacks existed and USB ports were a must-have on a laptop. Advertisement Advertisement All kidding aside, I have to say that I switched to PC late last year after being an Apple fanboy for years and I've regretted the decision. Macs are still more convenient and more secure than Windows-based desktops. The gap has gotten smaller but a Mac still just works in a way that PCs don't. What do you PC people have to say to that?! Oh. Sponsored If the decision to throw a trolling example into the definition was Merriam-Webster's attempt at grabbing attention it seems to have worked. But with Alex Jones getting a lot of press lately, the dictionary's PR team seems to have missed out on a perfect opportunity.

More options: Share, Mark as favorite Friday afternoon links View related content: Carpe Diem 1. Graphic of the Day (above) was inspired by a graphic that appeared today in the online version of the Wall Street Journal article “Uber Interviews Heavyweights for a Crucial Job: Handling Travis Kalanick” (graphics didn’t appear in the print edition). The WSJ graphic compared sales revenue during the seventh full calendar year of operations for Uber ($6.5 billion in 2016), Google ($6.1 billion in 2005), Facebook ($3.7 billion in 2011) and Amazon ($3.1 billion in 2001). Those figures aren’t adjusted for inflation, so based on a suggestion from Morganovich, the graphic above shows inflation-adjusted data for the four companies featured by the WSJ, along with some additions: Microsoft, Walmart, Netflix, Home Depot and Apple. Adjusted now for inflation, Uber’s revenues in its seventh year are more than $1 billion lower than Google’s. Main Point: In today’s highly globalized and digitized economy, it’s much easier to grow rapidly from a small base now than it ever was before, and Uber is the most recent and best example of that phenomena. Uber’s revenues in its seventh year of operation in 2016 of $6.5 billion are more than 46 times greater than Walmart’s sales in its seventh year of $141 million (in 2016 dollars). Of course, Walmart was operating brick-and-mortar stores in only four states in its seventh year in 1969, and Uber is a digital-based mobile app transportation company operating now in almost 600 cities worldwide. Just another perspective on how much and how fast things have changed in recent years….. and another example of why it’s such an exciting time to be alive…. HTs: Olivier Ballou for graphical assistance and Morganovich for the idea. 2. Venn Diagram of the Day (above). To help make American businesses more competitive, grow the economy, and create jobs, does President Trump think it’s best to raise or lower taxes on businesses? He seems to feel strongly both ways….. (Remember that “tariffs” and just another word for “taxes” on imported inputs for American businesses.) Related: The WSJ editorial board asks a great question today: “Does Trump know that Mexican tariffs on U.S. goods are close to zero?” Probably not, because the protectionist-in-chief has referred to Nafta as “the worst trade deal in the history of the world,” and keeps threatening to scrap Nafta or renegotiate it to get a “better deal.” But as the WSJ points out “it isn’t clear there’s much better to get. Mexican tariffs on imports of U.S. agricultural products, and most other goods, are nearly zero.” =================================== 3. The Two Most Misunderstood and Misused Economic Terms? In my opinion, it has to be the terms: a) “trade deficit” and b) “trade imbalance,” because those two terms are almost always used to imply incorrectly something negative about the US economy, when in fact there really are no trade “deficits” or “imbalances” once we account for all international transactions for goods, services and financial assets (see chart above). Formula: Current Account + Capital Account = 0 = Balance of Payments. Therefore, whenever you hear somebody talk about the trade deficit or a trade imbalance, it’s almost guaranteed that you’ll hear nothing about the foreign investment inflow that offsets any current account deficit, or the fact that international trade always balances. Part of the problem is that the term “deficit” automatically implies something negative and “surplus” implies something positive, when in fact those terms should be neutral and should not automatically carry any positive or negative connotation. ====================================== 4. San Diego Restaurant Recession? The chart above displays six-month percent changes in: a) San Diego’s restaurant jobs and b) non-restaurant payrolls in San Diego from 2006 to March 2017. While non-food jobs in the San Diego MSA are increasing at a steady rate of about 1% (semi-annually) and 2% annually, restaurant job growth has tanked and fell by 3.5% over the most recent six-month period through March 2017. In terms of jobs, restaurant employment in the San Diego area has fallen by a stunning 4,700 jobs since last September, at a rate of almost 200 job losses per week. During the same period, employment outside the food industry increased by more than 12,000 jobs in San Diego. San Diego’s minimum wage increased last July to $10.50 an hour and then again to $11.50 on January 1 of this year, which might explain at least part of the significant drop in restaurant jobs. Caveat: Employment data from the BLS are only available for the entire Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) of San Diego, and data for just the city are not available. The city minimum wage is now $1 an hour higher than the state minimum wage of $10.50, which just increased on January 1 by 50 cents, and would be in effect outside the city limits. However, a recent San Diego Union-Tribune is reporting that “San Diego’s new minimum wage already may be killing jobs,” here’s a slice: Evidence has emerged of an economic dark side to San Diego’s decision last year to vault over the state minimum wage — it may have already destroyed thousands of jobs for low-wage workers even as higher pay helps tens of thousands of others. Consider the restaurant industry, for example, which economists study because it relies on low-wage workers, yet generally faces no foreign or out-of-state competition. Amid an abrupt slowdown in growth, nearly 4,000 food-service jobs may have been cut or not created throughout San Diego County from the beginning of 2016 through February of this year, according to an analysis of federal payroll data by Lynn Reaser, chief economist of the Fermanian Business & Economic Institute at Point Loma Nazarene University. “This was at a time when both overall economies performed similarly well,” Reaser said. “If job growth in the restaurant sector had just kept pace with the state’s performance … the industry could have created 5,200 jobs instead of the 1,300 that took place.” Last month growth turned negative, as the sector actually lost jobs. Note: The article quoted above was published before employment data were released for March, which reflected San Diego MSA restaurant job losses of another 900 in March, following losses of 1,300 in February, 400 in January, 500 in December, 1,200 in November and 400 in October — that’s a stunning loss of nearly 5,000 restaurant jobs in just six months, so there’s got to be something going on in San Diego. If it’s not the two recent minimum wage increases, what else could be responsible for the city’s “restaurant recession”? ==================================== 5. From a Waitress in Maine to the Do-Gooders and Anointed Ones: “I am a restaurant server, and I don’t need anyone to save me” is the title of her op-ed in the Bangor Daily News about Maine’s new minimum wage law passed last November that will increase the state minimum wage rise to $12 an hour by 2020 and eliminate the tip credit by 2024 (limiting servers’ hourly wage to the state minimum). Here’s a slice: You don’t know me, but I choose to be a server because serving works for me. I love what I do and how much income and flexibility it provides my family. You don’t know that I started working in restaurants at age 15, and 26 years later, I’m still happily employed as a server — by choice. You don’t know that, at 18, I was a single mom and serving provided me the income and flexibility to continue school, work, and raise my daughter. Serving also provided me the income to reach my personal goal of getting off state assistance by the time my daughter turned six. You don’t know that restaurant staff, owners and customers create a family atmosphere. That when my nine-year-old makes the baseball play-offs, and he has a last-minute game, I get my shift switched so I won’t miss his game nor the money. You don’t know that I am able to keep my four-year-old home to avoid high-cost day cares nor that I contribute significantly to my family because of the schedule serving provides. You don’t know these things about me because no one asked. No one asked why I work as a server or what it means to my family. No one asked about the real conditions I work in or how the owner treats me. No one asked, but there are certainly plenty of people telling me what the restaurant industry is like. I am not stuck. I do not need saving. I am not sexually harassed; my boss would never allow that. Restaurant owners are not greedy monsters putting us in unsafe work environments. I make an excellent living at a job I love. I do not make a “subminimum wage.” “Subminimum wage” is for disabled workers who are not able to perform the full duty of a job. By law, as a tipped worker, I am guaranteed to make at least minimum wage. I choose this job because I make much more than that. 6. Cartoon of the Day (above), another great one from the great one himself — Michael Ramirez. ===================================== 7. Economic Outlook Rankings for 2017 are displayed above, from the 10th annual study “Rich States, Poor States” by Art Laffer, Stephen Moore and Jonathan Williams. The “Economic Outlooks” are forecasts based on a state’s current standing in 15 state policy variables including top personal and corporate income tax rates, property and sales tax burdens, debt service as a share of tax revenue, public employees per 10,000, workers’ compensation costs, etc. When the states are ranked, an interesting pattern emerges: the top 14 states with the best economic outlooks this year are all right-to-work states, and the bottom 17 states with the worst economic outlook are all forced-union states. Although there are certainly other factors besides whether a state has right-to-work laws, it’s often been the case that empirical evidence finds that right-to-work states outperform compulsory union states for important economic variables like growth in employment and employee compensation, so the rankings in the table above are not too surprising. ============================================ 8. Energy Charts of the Day (above). The top chart displays oil production in America’s most prolific oil region – the Permian Basin in West Texas – which hasn’t slowed down at all despite the big drop in oil prices from above $100 per barrel as recently as July 2014 to around $50 for the last few years. Based on EIA estimates through next month, the increase in daily output in the Permian Basin over the most recent six month period of more than 260,000 barrels since last November will be the largest six-month increase in Texas history. The increases in Permian Basin oil output have contributed to bringing US oil output up to a 20-month high last week of 9.27 million barrels per day, see the middle chart above. US oil output has increased in each of the last ten weeks — the last period of ten consecutive increases in oil production was back in 2012. And the bottom chart shows how the increases in US oil production have brought petroleum imports down to 23.8% of the total petroleum supplied to the US market in 2017 through March. That’s the lowest share of imported petroleum in almost half a century going all the way back to 1970. Carpe oleum. =========================================== 9. Markets in Everything. Recharge (“luxury hotels unlocked“) is an app that lets users book luxury hotels for 66 cents per minute and just launched in New York City. Interesting idea and the service is not being offered for the reason you’re probably thinking right now…. 10. Interesting Fact of the Day. A stunning number — around 25% of US households — won’t have a traditional TV subscription by the end of 2017 as newer streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video grow in popularity. Expect the “cord cutting” to continue…. Bonus: Video of the Day from Prager U (below). American Indians are the poorest of all of America’s ethnic groups. Why? After all, the government has granted them massive reservations and created entire agencies to look after them. Well, maybe it’s that stifling government control that impoverishes Indians explains Naomi Schaefer Riley in the video below (“American Indians Are Still Getting a Raw Deal“), based on her book “The New Trail of Tears: How Washington Is Destroying American Indians.” Assorted links Discussion: (27 comments) Barry Bones April 28th, 2017 Governments have to raise a certain amount of coin for their activities be they welfare, education or even the military. The money has to come from somewhere. Trump is lowering taxes overall as well as shifting some of the tax base from personal / company tax to tariffs. He’s doing a good job; just look at GDP stats and the soaring share market. But only complainers here. Always complaining, but never really articulating, “well how would you pay for all of the government activities” (and don’t just say ‘scrap welfare’ because it isn’t practically feasible). Credit where it’s due, Captain Trump has done a great job. Woot Woot !! Reply Share Mark Perry April 28th, 2017 A good job by looking at GDP stats? You’re kidding I guess….. Reply Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Mark, I like the fact that you comment regularly on your own blog. I also like the quality of your blog. You provide a lot of good information. Reply Share morganovich April 29th, 2017 barry- in terms of a place to raise revenue (and i would argue that we already have WAY too much government revenue and should be looking for ways to cut it and cut the absurd spending levels) a tariff is one of the absolute worst one can choose. it inflicts a deadweight loss on consumers 100% of the time, and quite literally breaks the mechanism by which we are all made better off: greater access to trade driving an increase in the overall production and consumption possibility frontiers through comparative advantage. for any given level of spending, tariffs are probably the worst way to fund it and, worse still, will never be able to raise any real revenue. they simply cannot. they destroy the thing they tax too rapidly. GDP just collapsed. did you not see the q1 data? it was the lowest number in 3 years. if 0.7% growth is “soaring” i’d hate to see “tepid”. you are using a straw man argument from a false premise. government spending is what is out of control. revenues are at record levels. there are 100 ways to drop government spending. raise the social security age. pare back medicare and medicaid. cut military spending in half. all this is highly possible and is going to HAVE to happen. entitlements in particular are an actuarial bomb. no tax rate will be able to pay for them. we have what, $80tn of unfunded liabilities? never. gonna. happen. it cannot be paid for so it must be cut. imposing tariffs will, over 10 years, actually reduce overall tax revenues. you get lower growth because the economy is less efficient so you are taking a piece of a smaller future pie from all manner of tax. it’s the equivalent of filling your shoes with cement before you run a race. worse, economic illiterates like you are falling for it. repeating the same nonsense over and over will not make it true. Reply Share Jon Murphy April 29th, 2017 just look at GDP stats and the soaring share market. GDP growth in the 1st quarter was 0.7%. Consumer spending was at the lowest level since the depths of the recession. Reply Share Jon Murphy April 29th, 2017 Governments have to raise a certain amount of coin for their activities be they welfare, education or even the military. The money has to come from somewhere. Trump’s (and your) rhetoric indicate that this is not the reason for the tariffs. Reply Share Jon Murphy April 29th, 2017 Here’s the thing, Barry. Presumably you’re a smart guy (at least, according to you), which makes me wonder why you’re laying down the “tariffs as revenue” smokescreen. It’s clearly a misdirection. The hypocrisy of Trump is not that he wants to use tariffs. It’s that he argues that both high taxes are causing American businesses to be uncompetitive in the global market and that taxing American businesses at higher rates will “make America great again” and strengthen American businesses. This never was, and never will be, a revenue argument. It’s a straight-up contradiction. Now, obviously since I am not on the Trump Train, and since I never ran a business, I must be dumber than you and Trump. So, if the contradiction is obvious to me, it must be blindingly obvious to you and Trump. Which makes me wonder why you trotted out the revenue argument? Do you think me a fool? Reply Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Barry, “well how would you pay for all of the government activities” That is not why you and Trump said you wanted tariffs. Why would you change your reasoning now? BTW, it is silly to lower one tax while raising another to pay for government expenses. “Credit where it’s due, Captain Trump has done a great job.” What has he done? Be specific. The President does not control the stock market or the economy. “Woot Woot !!” I’m glad that you have chosen to update your word choice from the 15th century. Perhaps you ought to update your economics from 15th century mercantilism. Reply Share Walt Greenway April 29th, 2017 “The President does not control the stock market or the economy. “ The long-term performance of the stock market is driven primarily by company earnings, but there’s no doubt the President can cause large daily or short-term swings in the market by saying or doing the right or wrong things. Reply Share Paul April 28th, 2017 2. Reagan, who is quoted here often, cut income taxes early on and then in the next several years raised them in multiple ways, eliminated loopholes, and slapped tariffs on Japanese motorcycles. 7. Economic Outlook Rankings…notice the top 10 are all red states. The bottom ten deep blue. Reply Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Paul, Reagan made mistakes and sometimes pursued politically correct, though economically wrong, policies. He was much better than either Jimmy Carter or Walter Mondale though. This is not a red team vs. blue team issue. The issue is always between the political class and their political cronies vs. those of us who have to pay for their follies. Reply Share Paul April 29th, 2017 Greg, Yes, Reagan, like Trump, was much better than the alternative. And IMHO, Trump is better than Reagan (so far) on some issues. Reply Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Nah. Reagan compromised his principles occasionally to get votes for other priorities like destroying the Soviet Union. Trump is just playing politically correct games to pander to political cronies and his own ego. Trump isn’t even in the ballpark when it comes to Reagan. Reply Share Paul April 29th, 2017 Greg, So the tariffs Reagan slapped on Japanese crotch rockets helped him win the cold war? Come on, man. I guess we’ll have to disagree here. I see Trump proposing to gut the budgets at big gray buildings staffed with liberals like EPA, HUD, HHS, and actually eliminating 62 worthless agencies and programs, and think libertarians might take a shine to him, or at least praise his efforts on issues where they claim to agree. Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Paul, I see that you do not understand the legislative process. You tell the representatives where Harleys are made that you will impose a tariff if they vote for something the President wants even though it is against democratic party ideology. “proposing” That is a key word. I support Trump where he is right and oppose him where he is wrong. Don’t tell me what he intends to do. Wait until he has done it. I am still waiting on the repeal of Obamacare. Share Paul April 29th, 2017 Greg, You tell the representatives where Harleys are made that you will impose a tariff if they vote for something the President wants even though it is against democratic party ideology. Yeah, that’s not how it went down though: “President Reagan today defended his decision to order a tenfold increase in tariffs for heavyweight motorcycles, insisting that it was not a breach of his free-trade policy but only a temporary protection to help American manufacturers to readjust to Japanese competitors.” http://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/11/business/reagan-defends-motorcycle-tariff-steel-quotas.html And here is the great free-trader taking credit for Harley’s comeback: “In a speech to the workers at the end of his visit, the President said: ”Now, there are those in Congress who say our trade policies have not worked, but you, here at Harley-Davidson, are living proof that our laws are working.” And here’s Mises with a long list of Reagan’s protectionist measures that make Trump look like Adam Smith: https://mises.org/library/ronald-reagan-protectionist I support Trump where he is right and oppose him where he is wrong. Well,that’s a start. So do I. Don’t tell me what he intends to do. Wait until he has done it. I am still waiting on the repeal of Obamacare. What was that you said about understanding the legislative process? Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Paul, Reagan made mistakes. He compromised his principles at times to get the votes necessary for other priorities. Trump is not doing that. This is not a red team vs blue team issue. The issue is always politicians and their political cronies vs those of us who have to pay for their follies. Reply Share Greg April 29th, 2017 Wow! There is a significant time delay from making a comment and it getting posted. Reply Share Walt Greenway April 29th, 2017 I can’t figure out where some of my comments go sometimes, but hitting refresh often makes one show up. Reply Share AARGH63 April 29th, 2017 re: Uber Jon Shirley, where are you now. Reply Share Seattle Sam April 29th, 2017 Minimum wage laws and union shop laws both have the same objective — to protect higher skilled workers from having to compete with lower-skilled workers. What is particularly galling is that both are done in the name of helping the very people that are locked out of employment they would otherwise bid for. The politicians who enact these laws see personal advantage in this scheme because the number of people who are priced out of work is much smaller than those who benefit from it. Reply Share John Warren April 29th, 2017 “taxes” is just another word for “tariffs” on domestic production Reply Share MidwestMan April 29th, 2017 Re: Restaurant jobs in San Diego. Wouldn’t other businesses besides restaurants be affected by an increase in minimum wages? Would be interesting to see, say, retail jobs. Reply Share Mark Perry April 29th, 2017 Growth in retail jobs in SD (MSA) has slowed to about 0% in the last year, not the same steep decline as food jobs, but lower growth than average for payrolls in SD. Reply Share Jon Murphy April 29th, 2017 It would be most obvious in restaurant. Approximately 55-60% of jobs in food services are low-skilled. It’s around 33% for retail. Reply Share Vic Volpe April 30th, 2017 #3 — https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=dxJK Difference between GDP and GNP — GDP is what Americans (not foreigners) produce in the U.S.; GNP is what Americans produce within the U.S. and overseas in foreign countries (U.S. companies and American investors earning on their foreign investments). Note: The two lines almost overlap up until the mid-2000s (under Bush) and continue under Obama, where they diverge from the earlier trendline by about 40%. Why? Reply Share Benjamin Cole April 30th, 2017 #5 Seems to me both the right-wing and the left-wing want to the oxygen out of the air—when the “other side” wants to speak. I have praised Liberty University for their election-year invite to socialist Bernie Sanders, who went and spoke and was received cordially. That is the model. But I see no Marxist professors on George Mason University staff (Googled it) and if a Marxist was ever invited to speak, it does not show up on Google. Full snowflake jackets come in red and blue. Should not an economics department have the full range of thought? I happen to be a free-marketeer, so much so I oppose property zoning of any kind. That said, Dr. Perry might want to tip his hat to this excellent study: https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/Ikeda-Land-Use-Regulation.pdf Reply Share Leave a comment: Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Inside OzHarvest Market: The Grocery Store Where You Set Your Own Price Everything Coming To Netflix, Stan, Amazon And Foxtel This May Your Favourite Music App Has Higher Quality Audio Than You Think David Nield Apr 30, 2017, 6:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple music deezer google play music music spotify streaming music tidal Share Chances are you've signed up to at least one streaming service — but are you making the most of the best-quality music on offer? A quick audit of your apps can boost both streaming and downloaded bit-rates, so you're always assured of the highest fidelity audio flowing through your pricy headphones to your eardrums. Which means you hear more of the music and a little less of the noise that can accompany lower quality music files. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Just about every streaming music service out there now enables you to set music quality through the associated apps, though there may be some restrictions if you're not a paying customer. Bear in mind that higher-quality music means more data, so double-check your carrier plan if you're streaming on the go, or cache your favourite playlists over Wi-Fi before you leave the house. Spotify Image: Screenshot As far as the options available in the mobile apps go, Spotify says "Normal" is equivalent to approximately 96kbps, "High" to 160kbps, and "Extreme" to 320kbps. Alternatively you can select the "Automatic" option and have Spotify decide for you based on the strength of your network connection. Once you've decided how high the fidelity of your music should be, go inside Spotify's mobile apps, tap Your Library, then the settings cog icon — on iOS you need to tap Streaming Quality as well, and on Android the option is on the first screen under Music Quality. On the desktop clients, tap the downward arrow near your account name (top right), then Settings, then toggle High quality streaming to On. Google Play Music Image: Screenshot There's no desktop client to worry about for Google Play Music and no quality setting in the web player either, but these options have just been added to the mobile apps. Tap the menu button (top left), then Settings, then either Quality on mobile network, Quality on Wi-Fi network, or Download quality. Three or four options are available in each case, but Google hasn't revealed what bitrate these settings correspond to, and is pretty cagey about revealing the supported bitrates across its service as a whole (although it does appear to match Spotify's 320kbps). Apple Music Image: Screenshot If you've signed up for the Apple Music streaming service, then there's one toggle switch for enabling high-quality streaming over cellular networks, but no such option for downloads, which presumably are always high quality. From iOS Settings, tap Music then Mobile Data; from the Apple Music app on Android, tap the menu button (top left), then Settings, then look under Playback. You won't find any quality adjustment settings in iTunes for macOS or Windows, but Apple has confirmed its tracks stream at 256kbps AAC (a lower bitrate than Spotify, but a less lossy codec). Deezer Image: Screenshot In Deezer's mobile apps, to adjust streaming and download quality over cellular networks and Wi-Fi, tap My Music, then Settings, Audio settings and Custom (or choose one of the preset configurations). The same options can be found in the clients for Windows and macOS (go to Settings then Audio settings). Deezer doesn't give exact details of what the "Basic", "Normal", and "High Quality (HQ)" settings refer to, but presumably that HQ option matches up with the top tier 320kpbs quality. You can go higher too, but you need to shell out for a Sonos system and Deezer Elite. Tidal Image: Tidal Tidal's headline feature is the 1411kbps FLAC top-end streaming quality it offers, but you don't have to go all the way up to this if you're looking to save on some data charges or cut back on bandwidth use. On both the desktop clients and the mobile apps, you can adjust the sound quality for streaming music and downloaded tracks via the Settings option on the menu — look under the Streaming heading. On mobile there's also the option to have Tidal adjust the music quality based on your connection speed. Originally published on Gizmodo Australia.

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UV5iQt ALSO READ Qualcomm hits back at Apple's lawsuit, blames iPhone maker of false remarks Qualcomm's Apple bills may pile up Apple rumoured to launch 'red' iPhone 7 and 7s next year Apple releases red iPhones, cuts prices on lower-end iPads Apple sued over 'error 53' iPhone shutdowns Apple cut off billions of dollars in payments to Qualcomm, turning a contract dispute into what one analyst called an “all-out war” that forced the chip supplier to slash forecasts given only days ago. The world’s largest publicly traded technology company and one of the main suppliers of components to the iPhone, its most important product, have traded accusations of lying, making threats and trying to create an illegal monopoly. The fight involves billions of dollars of technology licensing revenue that, if permanently cut off or reduced, would damage Qualcomm’s main source of profit and help bolster Apple’s margins. Apple told Qualcomm it will stop paying licensing revenue to contract manufacturers of the iPhone, the mechanism by which it’s paid the chipmaker since the best-selling smartphone debuted in 2007, the San Diego, California-based company said in a statement. Qualcomm removed any assumption it will get those fees from its forecast for the current period. Apple doesn’t have a direct license with Qualcomm, unlike other phone makers. “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,” Apple said in a statement. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court.  As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own.” Qualcomm said revenue in its fiscal third quarter ending June will be $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion, down from last week’s prediction of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. It’s also short of the $5.78 billion average of analyst estimates. Earnings per share will range between 52 cents and 62 cents, compared with the earlier forecast of 67 cents to 92 cents. Minus certain items, profit per share will be 75 cents to 85 cents. For Qualcomm, Apple’s move is a further infringement on its legal agreements with the contract makers of the iPhone, who also make devices for other companies. Those agreements predate Apple’s entry into the phone market and are still legally enforceable. “While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade.” He said Apple’s interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to other parties is wrongful and part of the Cupertino, California-based company’s global attack on Qualcomm. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein, said Qualcomm’s largest customer has declared “all-out war,” leaving a dark cloud over earnings and its stock price. “Even if one believed this was a worst case scenario, we struggle to see a resolution anytime soon as the parties entrench,” Rasgon wrote in a note to investors Friday. Qualcomm managed expectations around the dispute poorly, he added.    Bloomberg Read More On Apple | Qualcomm | Iphone | Ipads | International | Companies PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Cover from Natural Calamities.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

By: Reuters | Published:April 29, 2017 11:11 pm Qualcomm Inc slashed its current-quarter profit and revenue forecasts on Friday, amid an escalating legal battle between the chipmaker and Apple Inc. Apple said it had decided to withhold royalty payments to its contract manufacturers until the dispute is resolved in court. The payments made by Apple to its contract manufacturers are, in turn, owed by the contractors to Qualcomm in royalties, according to the chipmaker’s licensing business model. The iPhone maker sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, is a major supplier to Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s revenue in its latest fiscal year. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court,” an Apple spokesman said on Friday. Apple also noted it had been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but said Qualcomm had refused to negotiate “fair terms”. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade,” Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, said in a statement. Qualcomm said it will not receive royalties from Apple’s contract manufacturers for sales during the quarter ended March 31, and that its forecast for the third fiscal quarter now excludes that revenue. “Even if one believed this was a worst case scenario (for Qualcomm), we struggle to see a resolution anytime soon as the parties entrench,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “We suspect this is going to continue to get uglier,” he added. Qualcomm now expects revenue of $4.8 billion-$5.6 billion for its third fiscal quarter, down from the $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion it had previously expected. The company lowered its forecast for current-quarter adjusted profit to 75-85 cents per share, from 90 cents-$1.15 per share. “(Apple’s) contract manufacturers may make some form of partial payment, but initial indications are that any payment would likely be insignificant,” Qualcomm said. Through Thursday, Qualcomm’s shares had fallen 17 percent since Apple’s lawsuit. The stock — the worst performer this year on the Philadelphia semiconductor index — was down 0.7 percent at $52.86 in midday trading.

It was the most downloaded movie from Apple in 2014, and kids everywhere are still singing the movie’s anthem, “Let It Go.” Heck, it’s now probably stuck in your own head right now, even if you’ve never seen the film. So why has the 2013 movie stuck around for so long for the under-5 set? Experts say it is not just because you can find images of the movie’s sisters on everything. Elsa and Anna are on dresses, on scooters and even on jelly beans. The news that a long-awaited sequel is finally coming in November 2019 was met with cheers (and a few groans) across the Internet. To understand the psychology behind “Frozen” Mania, in 2015, CNN reached out to psychologists who are sisters themselves: Yalda Uhls is regional director for Common Sense Media. Maryam Kia-Keating is an associate professor of clinical psychology at University of California, Santa Barbara. Here is our edited conversation. CNN: Princess movies have been around since the beginning of time, but this has really resonated. What has made this one so unique? Yalda Uhls: One of the things that really struck me, and I think struck little children, is that there is a really strong intergenerational, family-themed message here. Despite the sisters Anna and Elsa being separated for so long, the story is ultimately about the bond between the two of them. When you’re little, that is your zone; that’s your group; they define your world. Highlighting that and making it feel important — your sister, your brother, your mom and dad — is something little kids can really identify with. Maryam Kia-Keating: Kids can really understand the idea of their sister wanting to play with them, and sometimes not, but still having a strong family bond. Ultimately, it’s about the love between the sisters. That’s a message that many little children understand. There are also good lessons about overcoming struggles and facing life challenges. But, what’s interesting about preschoolers, in particular, is there’s this loyalty and unrelenting interest to watch this movie over and over again. Part of it is because it was so well done, but there are some themes that younger kids can really identify with. My 4-year-old daughter told me that she also liked that it didn’t have a witch. I wouldn’t have thought that until she said it, but it made me more thoughtful about all the other movies — great movies — that have scary witches and themes in them. This was something that little kids under 5 aren’t going to have nightmares about. CNN: Why is not having a witch important to a preschooler? Kia-Keating: When you’re an adult, you’ve heard a lot of these stories, like “Snow White” or “Cinderella,” and you forget the power they can have. It’s helpful to have a child’s point of view on this. Kids are living in this world where the line between what’s real and what’s not really is blurry, and because they have such vivid imaginations, witches and monsters can feel very real. As adults, we may see these villains or monsters as a way to tell a story or a lesson, but when children are in the moment of being scared, they are caught up in the fear and not in finding the larger lesson. Uhls: I used to work in the film industry, and as adults, we’re told that we need conflict to drive drama. Take Grimm’s Fairy Tales; there are always dire stakes. Or movies like “Bambi” and “The Lion King,” where the mother or father die. These are serious issues and themes, and sometimes little kids aren’t ready to process and understand these ideas. CNN: What about the characters seem so easy for kids to empathize with? Uhls: Preschooler imaginations are really strong, and so they respond really well to stories with magical realism. In “Frozen,” Princess Elsa has these powers to control ice and snow — and that really captures kids’ imaginations. When you’re small, you don’t feel powerful. Everyone is always dictating what you can and cannot do. Having a character they can empathize with that has these powers can make them feel more empowered, as well. Kia-Keating: That magical piece is exciting and is one of the things that really sets this movie apart from others. Another aspect that kids see themselves in Elsa and Anna is the impulsiveness. Parents are constantly trying to teach their little ones how to self-regulate their emotions, how to behave, how to sit down. Elsa is constantly trying to tame or control her emotions — and while this is something that is salient to everyone throughout their lifetimes, this is something preschoolers deal with all the time. CNN: The song “Let It Go”: It’s everywhere, and kids can’t stop singing it. What is it about this anthem? Kia-Keating: My 4-year-old came home and learned the song before we had even seen the movie. One of the lines she and all her friends connected to was “Be the good girl that you always have to be.” And when they sing it, they wag their fingers like they do in the movie. I think it looks a lot like something they see and hear from parents — be a good girl or boy, don’t do this or that — so part of it is copying what they frequently hear. But when I asked my daughter what she thought the song was about, she said it was about “Elsa being happy and free, and nobody bothering her.” That’s a message that everyone wants: to be happy and free.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

X Willie Mullins secures trainers’ title after epic battle with Gordon Elliott Bapaume’s Grade One success under Ruby Walsh put Mullins over the line about 16 hours ago Updated: about 6 hours ago Brian O'Connor at Punchestown Ruby Walsh with trainer Willie Mullins following victory in the AES Champion Four Year Old Hurdle aboard Bapaume. Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA Wire         A Grade One success for Apple’s Jade at Punchestown on Saturday meant Gordon Elliott went down guns blazing but a momentous National Hunt season concluded with Willie Mullins crowned Ireland’s champion trainer. Despite that it was still a bittersweet afternoon for Mullins as his son Patrick came up agonisingly short of Jamie Codd in the amateur jockeys championship. A 20-1 success on Open Eagle in the big handicap hurdle continued Mullins Jnr’s run of success and brought him to within one winner of Codd. But in the very final race of the season both riders were out of the money and Codd secured his first amateur title by deposing Mullins 41-40. Ruby Walsh on board Bapaume clears the last to win the AES Champion Four Year Old Hurdle at Punchestown. Photograph: Lorraine O’Sullivan/Inpho Earlier Bapaume provided Mullins Snr with his own top-flight success on the day and after overhauling his great rival on prizemoney just the day before the man who has dominated racing for a decade eventually won out by €199,455 on the back of winning €937,075 over the week at Punchestown. It was a 10th trainers’ title in a row for Mullins and an 11th in all, but the 60-year-old conceded none have been so hard-fought as this. “I’m delighted to have won. I didn’t think it was possible to be quite honest but everything came together in the end,” he said before paying tribute Elliott. “Gordon has been magnificent the whole year and he’s been a gentleman about the whole thing.” In the context of losing 60 horses over a training fees dispute with champion owner Michael O’Leary, and star names such as Faugheen and Annie Power confined to the sidelines, it was also a notably stressful campaign for Mullins. “It’s been a funny season. It hasn’t been very enjoyable and I’m glad it’s over,” he admitted. That Elliott spent much of the season in front, amid predictions that the 39-year-old challenger heralded a changing of the guard, meant both men’s reluctance to talk-up their struggle couldn’t prevent much of this season’s narrative being hung on the ups and downs of their struggle. Having spent much of the winter proclaiming he had “no chance” of deposing Mullins, Elliott’s failure to secure a first title at the death left him admitting on Saturday he was “heartbroken” at the loss. But he was also quick to point out how his 193 individual winners in Ireland this season equalled Mullins’s record tally in 2013. “Coming here today, of course I wanted to win the thing but I thought if we got 193 winners, and equalled Willie on that, I’d be delighted,” he said. That winner tally beat his rival’s haul of 180 but with the trainers’ title judged on prizemoney the final decisive figure was Mullins’s haul of €4,580,200. It was Friday’s hat-trick, all of them ridden by his son Patrick, which put at least one of Mullins’s hands on the championship. However, the man of the moment conceded: “Going into the lead for the first time this year was a bonus. I was just delighted for Patrick. We haven’t changed anything this season. We do what we normally do. Gordon is a great competitor and improving every year. So now we’ll have to up our game!” The relentless focus on the trainers’ championship meant the jockeys’ titles got shoved to the shadows in comparison but Ruby Walsh was crowned champion for the 12th time with a total of 131 winners which equalled his best ever tally. And Rachel Blackmore’s 32 winners meant she is the first woman to land the conditional jockeys’ title. Blackmore later took a heavy fall from Pique Sous in the big handicap hurdle and was taken to hospital for precautionary X-rays. Walsh had endured an atypically frustrating Punchestown up to Bapaume landing the AES Champion Four Year Old Hurdle but hit the Grade One mark on the 2-1 favourite. “I’m delighted I was some use to Willie Mullins this week!” joked the legendary rider. “He’s only a handy little horse but he’s delivered on a very, very important day.” Apple’s Jade had earlier followed the script with an impressive victory in the Mares’ Champion Hurdle. “She’s very good and that was a great performance. I doubt she’ll jump fences and the mares’ hurdle or the stayers’ are possible targets for her,” Elliott said. “That’s three Grade One this week. It’s been very good and we’ve had a great season.” Elliott wound up the festival with five winners in all, four behind Mullins’s nine. Robbie Power was the festival’s top rider with six winners. The final day crowd was the biggest of the week at 34,270 and it brought the overall attendance for the week to 122,557, up over 8,000 on last year.

(AAPL) Will Not Release iPhone 8 This Year At least one report suggests Apple may disappoint its fans By ValueWalk  |  Apr 29, 2017, 8:34 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Remains Near Record High As Analysts Gear Up For Earnings Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Not Release iPhone 8 This Year Why is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Stock So Expensive? (BRK.A, BRK.B) Recent Posts: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Not Release iPhone 8 This Year The 3 Biggest Hardware Problems with Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN) Echo Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Remains Near Record High As Analysts Gear Up For Earnings View All Posts As anticipation grows for the release of the iPhone 8, a new bombshell suggests that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fans could end up being very disappointed. The tenth anniversary device has largely being expected to offer significant improvements over previous releases in the series. But now sources close to the Apple supply chain suggest that there may not be an iPhone 8 after all. No iPhone 8? Reports from sources within the critical Foxconn corporation suggest that Apple will only place orders for the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. these two updated versions of the existing iPhone 7 were expected to launch alongside a brand new iPhone 8, complete with considerable new bells and whistles. The source close to Foxconn suggests that the packaging materials for the new iPhone will begin arriving in the last week of June, meaning that at least the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus can be released in September. Once these materials arrive at Apple headquarters, reports should provide further indication of the potential iPhone releases. Despite the reports, the majority of Apple observers still believe that the company will do something outstanding in order to mark the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range. This has been particularly anticipated considering that recent iPhone releases have been considered somewhat conservative. There is a clear market need for Apple to produce an outstanding device in 2017, and this would seem to pave the way for an iPhone 8 to accompany the two incremental iPhone 7S updates. Leaked Images of iPhone 8 Emerge In accordance with this probability, some leaked images of the purported iPhone 8 have also emerged this week. Tipster Benjamin Geskin shared the photographs of what is believed to be a dummy version of the iPhone 8, which also emanated from the supplier Foxconn. If this leak turns out to be accurate then the iPhone 8 will deliver several features that have been expected for some time. Most notably, the concept images depict an iPhone 8 unit without a Home button. It has been suggested by many sources that Apple will indeed do away with this traditional aspect of the iPhone when the iPhone 8 is released. Samsung has, of course, ditched the Home button for the Galaxy S8, and the Galaxy Note 8 is expected to follow suit later this year. The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade Ridding the iPhone 8 of the Home button will enable the display to extend to the outer limits of the body of the device. This is another design parameter that is becoming fashionable in 2017, with the Galaxy S8 characterised by its wraparound screen. LG has also released a handset with seriously slimmed down bezels. This would enable Apple to produce an iPhone 8 with a much larger display, while retaining the physical size of the iPhone 7. Elsewhere, it is suggested that the dual-camera setup that was included in the iPhone range for the first time in the iPhone 7 generation will be retained and upgraded, but with an interesting design innovation. Geskin suggests that the camera will be rotated 90-degrees in order for vertical stacking to be utilized. While the reasons for this may not be immediately apparent, there is an obvious motivation for Apple. Augmented Reality is Tipped It is suggested that this will enable advanced augmented reality features to be included within the camera, something that the CEO Tim Cook has spoken glowingly on in the recent past. Cook suggests that Apple is very much committed to augmented reality, and it seems unlikely that the CEO of the company would have let this cat out of the bag if it was not to be imminently reflected in the Apple product range. Thus, the iPhone 8 could benefit from augmented reality technology, and it will be interesting to see precisely what the consumer electronics giant comes up with. Other physical aspects of the device notable from the leaked images are the placement of the volume controls and mute switch on the left hand-side of the alleged iPhone 8, while a sleep / wake control is placed on the right.

(AAPL) Earnings Should Answer Apple earnings won't move AAPL stock based on numbers, but the answers to a few key questions might By Vince Martin, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 29, 2017, 10:09 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for $10 or Less General Electric Company (GE) Stock Has Lost Investors’ Trust Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Going to Burn Amid Flex 2 Explosion Report Recent Posts: 5 Questions Apple Inc. (AAPL) Earnings Should Answer Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Has More Upside to come Why the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Rally Isn’t Finished View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will release its second-quarter results on Tuesday. But unlike past reports, Apple earnings won’t be the center of attention — nor is it likely that the numbers alone will move AAPL stock. Source: Shutterstock Two different investment banks — JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and UBS Group AG (USA) (NYSE:UBS) — already have predicted Apple earnings and guidance could miss expectations. And yet both firms remain bullish on Apple stock. The logic behind the divergence is clear, and the market as a whole should take a similar view in valuing AAPL stock after Apple earnings. Apple’s new iPhone is on the way — and investors already are looking forward. The Q2 report isn’t going to be about Apple earnings — it’s going to be about the Apple earnings conference call. Apple stock holders have a lot of questions to ask — and it will be up to AAPL CEO Tim Cook to give the right answers. When’s That New iPhone Coming Out? The most anticipated question is whether Apple will give more detail on the next iPhone. Apple already is gaining market share ahead of the release later this year — but AAPL investors want more. It’s possible that announcements here — or the lack thereof — could move Apple stock. It’s starting to look as if supplier delays may push back the new iPhone’s release date. Samsung is reportedly struggling to supply OLED panels for the device, and contract manufacturers are behind schedule. A delay would push the release of the as-yet-unnamed new model toward Christmas – and that could unnerve investors in AAPL stock, at least in the short term. Is AAPL In the M&A Market? An analyst report in early April spurred rumors of an acquisition by Apple of Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS). And while such a combination seems unlikely, it is clear that Apple at the least is considering a buyout of a size much larger than it has traditionally executed. Cook hinted at M&A on the Q1 conference call, saying “we are always looking at acquisitions…and we look for companies of all sizes, and there’s not a size that we would not do based on just the size of it.” Given the rumors of late, investors surely will be reading into any further comments to get a better read on Apple’s M&A ambitions. How’s the Services Business Doing? The one fundamental metric that may move Apple stock is its services revenue. Apple sales excluding the iPhone have been bizarrely consistent over the past five years, and the company simply hasn’t been able to drive any non-iPhone growth. The iPod faded, and was replaced by the iPad. It too has faded, offsetting growth in Apple Music and other initiatives. Cook has laid out a target to double services revenue – which might require some of the aforementioned M&A. And at some point, Apple needs real growth beyond the iPhone to increase the multiple of Apple earnings assigned to AAPL stock. As a result, investors will be watching that metric closely. But there too, there will be questions about strategy. Is Apple really planning to roll out Apple Cash? Where is the self-driving car initiative headed? And is that ~$50 billion target still viable?

By Jake Swearingen Share Facebook iconShare Twitter iconTweet LinkedIn iconShare Google Plus iconShare Email iconEmail Comment iconComment Print icon Print Siri was probably the last smartphone feature that convinced me to buy a new phone, even though the one I was using was working fine. In late 2011, when Siri was introduced, I had just accepted a job in Los Angeles, and was psyching myself up at the prospect of spending a lot of time in my car. The idea of having this little, helpful friend in my car that I could talk to — get directions, send texts, check traffic — while I kept my eyes on the road was tremendously appealing. Early commercials were enticing enough that around the same time that I bought a used Honda Civic, I grabbed an iPhone 4s. In reality, of course, Siri didn’t really work like that. Text messages that went beyond a few words were usually garbled. Apple Maps was a mess and didn’t have the actual real-time traffic information you need to navigate Los Angeles, so I ended up just typing wherever I was going into Waze, regardless. Its knowledge base was thin; its understanding shallow. Connectivity was important: Sometimes, it seemed like Siri couldn’t connect to Apple’s main servers, rendering Siri apologetic and useless. I soon grew tired of Siri screwing up, and stopped using it, except occasionally to place a phone call while driving. Things in the past five years should have gotten better, and in a lot of ways they have. Voice assistants on phones began to take off about the same time neural networks started being used, and voice recognition on Siri and its rivals — Google Assistant chief among them — is markedly better than it was just a few years ago. Bixby, a new voice-activated phone assistant rolled out by Samsung with its Galaxy S8, will also soon be able to accept voice commands (voice recognition is currently unavailable, and it’s not clear when it will be). In a demo shown off to a small group of reporters, a Samsung employee rattled off somewhat complex operations in natural language that Bixby will ostensibly be able to follow, e.g., “Send all my pictures from Barcelona to my mother.” Of course, the demos for these things are always impressive — people are always working out complex dinner plans on the fly, or filtering all their photos from a cool vacation. In the real world, Siri and Google Assistant work very well for certain things — setting timers, sending short text messages, asking simple questions — and are terrible at others. Plus, there’s the social aspect of all of this. Perhaps in ten years, we’ll have ascended to Spike Jonze’s Her-esque levels of acceptance, where guys with very high-waisted wool pants can wander around talking to their phones in peace. But right now, using Siri or Google Assistant in public, and making sure it understands me, requires that I use a certain tone — semi-stilted and not quite natural — that just makes me feel like a weirdo. And I don’t think I’m the only one. This isn’t a new problem; tech reviewers, and consumers, have been noting how awkward it is to use Siri and its peers for the last five years. What’s odd now is that there is a popular gadget that no one seems to mind talking to. I have an Amazon Echo that gets daily use in our house that I am quite fond of. It’s guilty of all the things I was just kvetching about. It doesn’t always understand what I’m trying to say; I have to talk to it in a weird voice, almost like I’m talking to a dog or a small child; and in many ways, it’s severely limited in what it can do compared to Siri or my Google Assistant. But I talk to the Echo a lot more, and it’s not just because I don’t feel like a weirdo. It’s because it’s actually in a place to be useful. We need something that can set timers for cooking; play music or the radio while we’re making breakfast or dinner; and order items off Amazon while I’m thinking about the fact that we don’t have any more Mrs. Meyers dish soap, instead of just hoping I remember later that day. I’m not alone in this. Asking around, I found even generally tech-friendly people were in the same boat: They didn’t really use Siri or Google Assistant, except maybe to set a timer or alarm, and only in the privacy of their own homes. The one person I could find who said they used Siri a lot, a content strategist in Chicago, said it was mainly at home. When I asked him if he used Siri in public, he IMed back: “Sometimes, but it certainly feels weird. Especially if it fails to get the request right the first time. There’s something weird about repeating yourself to a voice assistant versus a human who can’t hear you over noise.” So, then, a working theory on why I (and a lot of other people) don’t really want to talk to Siri or any other AI on our phones, but plenty of people have happily adapted to Alexa or a Google Home. There’s a social cost in the form of feeling like a dorkus malorkus when you use your phone’s voice assistant in public, and right now, those assistants can’t do enough useful things reliably and consistently to make it worth paying that cost. And because our phones offer another way to do those useful things without speaking — check train times, look up a recipe, caption and share a photo on Instagram — there may never be any inflection point in the future where we start talking to our phones as a primary or even secondary way to do most tasks. Alexa and Google Home may fall short on competency at times, but they both open up another way to do useful things that wasn’t really available before and don’t incur any social cost. The smartphone suddenly gave you the digital world in your pocket, available at the tap of a finger. The AI home speaker suddenly opened the possibility of talking to your home in a way that felt both futuristic and familiar. But maybe we’re content with just sticking to tapping away on our phones in public, and only speaking to our gadgets in private.

Here are salaries of CEOs of 5 top tech companies Google' Chief Executive Officer, the Indian-born Sundar Pichai, received a compensation of about $200 million in 2016. By: FE Online | Updated: April 29, 2017 8:25 PM In 2016, Sundar Pichai received a salary of 0,000, which is a little less in comparison to the 2,500 he had received in 2015. (Reuters) Google’ Chief Executive Officer, the Indian-born Sundar Pichai, received a compensation of about $200 million in 2016. The amount is twice of what he had received in 2015. This compensation was granted to Pichai as a token of the successful product launches under his leadership at Google. His salary, however, had seen a slight drop last year. In 2016, he had received a salary of $650,000, which is a little less in comparison to the $652,500 he had received in 2015. Although, the long time employee of arguably the most popular tech company in the world, Pichai received a stock award of $198.7 million in 2016, which is the double of what he had received in 2015- $99.8 million. According to CNN, the high-value compensation was attributed by Gooogle to the numerous successful product launches under Pichai’s leadership Here are the salaries of 5 of the top tech CEOs in the world: Satya Nadella (Microsoft) Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (Reuters) Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, who also happens to be Indian born, received a package of $18 million in 2016. Although Nadella saw the compensation go down by 3.3% to $17.7 million in the latest fiscal year, that ended on June 30. Tim Cook (Apple) According to IE, Tim Cook is reported to have received a salary of about $8 million in 2016. Cook had joined Apple in 1998 as senior vice president of the company and then served a the Executive Vice President of worldwide sales and operations, before taking over as the 7th Chief Executive Officer of Apple. Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) Mark Zuckerberg (Reuters) According to IE, Mark Zuckerberg is the 5th richest person on the globe. Since he is the founder and the owner of the company, he voluntarily takes a salary of $1 million per year. Zuckerberg’s journey to invent Facebook has been well documented. Zuckerberg had started Facebook on February 4, 2004, from Harvard University with his friends, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. Facebook’s tendency to be viral was noticed when the social media website reached 1 million years by 2012. Jack Dorsey (Twitter) Jack Dorsey (Reuters) Dorsey replaced Dick Costolo to become the new CEO of Twitter in 2015. Although he does not take any salary from the company, as Twitter had been struggling when he had joined, he receives personal and residential security costs of about $68, 506. Elon Musk (Tesla) Elon Musk (Reuters)   Musk’s salary is about $40,000, making him the among the lowest paid tech CEOs in the world. Elon Musk is the 80th richest person in the world. According to Forbes magazine, Musk was also one of the 21 most powerful people in the world. While we can gasp in awe of the salaries these men draw for their services, it must be remembered that they help in the invention of new technologies that make our lives easier, May it be Facebook or Twitter helping in the growth and reach to news to the common folk or Elon Musk’s Tesla making groundbreaking advancement in space technologies, or Google coming up with new smartphones and headsets and a voice controlled smart speaker, they all make our lives much easier and take us forward in the field of scientific development.

It now competes with other budget tablets including the company’s own iPad mini 4, their former low-price option. Potential buyers may want to know if this new 2017 iPad offers enough reasons to upgrade from their present iPad or switch from another company’s tablet. We’ll let readers know in our review of the new low-cost iPad. Apple and other retailers sell the iPad in two storage sizes, 32GB for $329 and 128GB for $429. That gets the buyer a Wi-Fi only model. Add Cellular for an extra $130 making them $459 for 32GB and $559 for 128GB. You can also add Apple Care for $99, which delivers premium support and an extra year to the warranty life. Apple sells the new 2017 iPad in three colors, Space Gray, Silver and Gold.   2017 iPad: Hardware Design The hardware design of the new 9.7-inch 2017 iPad looks almost exactly like the rest of the iPads Apple sells or sold earlier. It’s got the same rounded corners, brushed aluminum edges that bring the front glass display together with the aluminum back and the same rounded edges. Along the top right we get the power button and on the top right we find the volume up and down buttons. Apple didn’t remove the 3.5mm stereo headphone/mic combo port like they did on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. It’s still there on the top edge on the left. The left edge doesn’t show us much, but Apple placed their magnets there to connect to the Apple Smart Cover and other covers. The bottom edge of the new 2017 iPad has the speakers and a Lightning port between them. Why doesn’t Apple change their iPad design more drastically from model to model? First, why mess with something that works? People like the thin slab of glass and metal design because it works well, Apple makes them to last and it helps users view content and attach accessories in a useful way. 2017 iPad: Performance and Battery Life The new 2017 iPad comes it at only $329 and it’s budget price shows somewhat. Pressing the home button to unlock takes a second or two longer than my iPad Pro or iPhone 7 Plus. Apps usually launch instantly, but after a little use, the iPad does launch them noticeably slower. However, it’s not enough that the average user will mind. In fact, if I wasn’t looking for a speed difference while launching apps and unlocking my iPad next to my other iOS devices, then I might not have noticed. The graphics chip and CPU built into the new 2017 iPad run slower than the iPad Pro and iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The A10 Fusion chip in the iPhone 7 bests the 2017 iPad’s A9 as does the M10 over the M9 for graphics processing. In real world, that means the new iPad’s not the top choice for gaming and design, but it will still play casual games and in my experience works well for most common tasks. The battery of the new 2017 iPad compares favorably to the other iPads. Apple promises 9-10 hours depending on what you’re doing. That’s pretty accurate in real-world experience. Despite the low price, the new iPad isn’t a slouch in terms of power and battery life. Most users will enjoy using it, but the power user might want the iPad Pro instead. 2017 iPad: Camera Apple put an 8MP camera on the back of the new 2017 iPad and it enjoys many of the same features seen in iPhone cameras. You can use it to take Live Photos, panorama photos, HDR images, burst mode, timer mode photos and videos. It shoots 1080P video at 30fps, 120fps Slo-mo video and time-lapse video with image stabilization. The FaceTime Camera on the new 2017 iPad takes decent shots and excels at FaceTime video chat. On the front, there’s a 1.2MP FaceTime HD camera that’s capable of Life Photos, 720P video and burst mode as well. Strangely, the front facing camera has a better aperture of f/2.2 compared to f/2.4 for the back camera. Aperture gives the user better low-light photos and narrower depth of field which blurs out the background. Live Photos are fun. I created the above animated GIF of a Live Photo using the iOS app LivePix ($1.99). The camera doesn’t give users the Portrait mode we enjoy in the iPhone 7 camera. In spite of that, the camera app on the iPad works a lot like the iPhone camera app. You can switch from the front to back easily. This slideshow requires JavaScript. On the left, you’ll see the digital zoom control. Digital zoom isn’t recommended since it blows up the size of the pixels instead of moving the lens like a traditional DSLR or Point-and-shoot photo camera zoom lens. You’ll get softer focus like the photo in the gallery above. The gallery above has two images, one with zoom and one using normal zoom without digital zoom. On the right side of the Camera app screen (seen above), we see the controls to turn on or off features like Live Photos, HDR or the Timer. They’re on the top right above the shutter release button. Immediately above the shutter release below these buttons, you’ll find the toggle to switch from the front to back camera. This HDR version of the photo shows color in the sky. Below the shutter button, there’s another button that opens the Photo gallery. View your photos and edit them. Next, you get the camera mode options starting with Time-lapse, Slo-mo, Video, Photo, Square (takes a square photo instead of a wide or tall shot) and Pano (stitches together multiple shots to make a very wide-angle shot. This normal shot without HDR shows how the sky gets blown out without the HDR setting turned on. The HDR setting does a great job of adding color where it would normally show none. The two sample shots above of my house show one with plenty of color in the blue sky while the non-HDR shot shows just white because it’s blown out because the sky is too bright. A sample panorama shot taken on the new 2017 iPad. Notice how the above sample of the Pano shot didn’t get the exposure right on the last section of the scene at the right side of the shot. Below you’ll see what the Camera app looks like while taking a Pano shot. A screenshot of the Pano setting in the new 2017 iPad Camera app. A few years ago people would die for a camera this good on their phone or tablet. Today, it’s clearly a step down from the great cameras we get on phones like the iPhone. The new Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 come with incredible cameras, too. The iPad camera is great for snap shots and scanning things like documents, photos, the white board in a class or meeting room and receipts. You can take nice photos in regular light. Find a few samples below. This slideshow requires JavaScript. 2017 iPad: Display and Sound Apple put their beautiful 9.7-inch Retina display in the new iPad with a resolution of 2048 x 1536, or 264 pixels per inch. It’s a color accurate display that also looks great while reading text, editing photos and watching movies or TV shows. We get a bright display with good color. Apple skimped on sound in the new 2017 iPad. The stereo speakers flank the Lightning connector along the bottom edge of the iPad. They’re muddled and weak. You can use them to listen to audio books, podcasts and other spoken word content. They’re fine for a quick YouTube or Facebook video, but you’ll want a pair of earbuds or the Apple AirPods if you plan to listen to music or watch movies and want great sound. 2017 iPad: Software The latest version of iOS looks just like the earlier versions. In other words, the design of the operating system desperately needs an update. iOS 10 feels old and out of date. The grid of icons matches the smaller screen iPhone, which makes no sense. Why not narrow the distance between icon rows and columns so users can fit more icons on the screen instead of the 5 x 4 grid in landscape mode? Even the iPhone 7 Plus fits six icons across in landscape mode, but that’s because it has a wider aspect ratio. Also, static icons are boring. Why not let users place live widgets on the home screen? The force touch available on the iPhone helps, but we don’t get that on the iPad. We still have to pull down from the top of the screen to show the notification area and use widgets in iOS. There’s also the Control Center, which the user drags up from the bottom to show. The only customization we get comes from adding app widgets to the notification area and some settings for when the user can use the Control Center. In case people think I’m only complaining because iOS doesn’t act more like Android, realize that I’m a iPad user since 1.0. I’ve owned many Android tablets, but none of them satisfied me like the iPad. 2017 iPad: Bottom Line The new 2017 iPad didn’t get a big overhaul because it seems Apple set a brand new goal: to lower the price so that this iPad would appeal to schools. Google dominates the education market with their affordable and simple Chromebooks mostly due to price and simplicity. When you consider the price reduction, the new 2017 iPad makes for a great tablet for schools and others. Even though the $329 2017 iPad comes with a couple of compromises, it’s still the best budget tablet in the 10-inch range. The iPad Pro wins the prize for high-end tablets, but none of the other comparably-priced tablets come close to it for the following reasons. First, it has the best hardware design and quality. It’s a beautiful tablet with a great screen, performance and nice battery life. Second, iOS 10 is still a simple and easy to learn operating system. Sure, Apple needs to add some features that we enjoy on Android and even Windows Phone like active tiles or icons on the home screen and better customization. However, Apple kept iOS the same for all these years because it’s simple to use. People can pick up an iPad and become productive without a lot of education or training. Finally, the screen look great. Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S3 delivers better color, but not better text display. It’s not worse than the iPad, but it’s not better. The iPad starts at a lower price than the S3, too. If you’re looking for a new tablet, then you should give the iPad a lot of consideration. Don’t replace your iPad Air with one. If you have an iPad older than that, you will want to look into upgrading. It doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil or Smart Cover, both designed only for the iPad Pro. However, you can find a wealth of great accessories to use with the 2017 iPad thanks to iPad line’s popularity.   Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The old Gotham matters a lot to me, a Brooklyn-born New Yorker who witnessed Bedford-Stuyvesant’s Ocean Hill section decline so badly in the 1950s that my family fled to Long Island. I returned to Brooklyn and Manhattan in time for the boroughs’ abandonment to crime and physical collapse in the 1970s-early ’90s. And I’ll be forever haunted by 9/11, which seemed to leave downtown, if not the entire city, for dead. Yet here we are, a city that has never been so much in demand. In my 67-year lifetime, the five boroughs have never been so full: Our population is soaring toward 9 million; most parts of town bustle with energy and investment; and crime has fallen to historic lows. I marvel over the blossoming. I can walk down the Hull Street block where I grew up without fearing for my life — which wasn’t the case 25 years ago when it was strewn with empty lots and menace lurked behind every parked car. Now, an enthralling new book makes clear that I’m not alone in my home-town infatuation. “Magnetic City: A Walking Companion to New York” (Spiegel & Grau) by New York magazine architecture critic Justin Davidson lends nuance, texture and historical perspective to my impression that New York City has never been so appealing or life-affirming as it is today. That truth is somehow, infuriatingly, lost on many native-born New Yorkers of every political stripe — from Mayor de Blasio (who didn’t protest when one of his inauguration speakers described the city as a “plantation”) to President Trump (who’s threatening to cut off our federal aid). It’s fashionable to snark that the Big Apple, behind the veneer of gleaming towers and artsy espresso stands, is rotten to the core. Davidson isn’t out to rebut anyone but instead presents the city’s current condition in the context of its history and unceasing cycles of upheaval and renewal. His book focuses mainly on eight areas that illustrate, in different ways, New York’s extraordinary capacity to regenerate after decades of irrelevance, crisis or catastrophe: the Financial District, the Seaport and the Brooklyn waterfront, the World Trade Center, West Chelsea and the High Line, 42nd Street, the Upper West Side, upper Manhattan’s Sugar Hill and the South Bronx. “No neighborhood in New York has changed identities so profoundly” as West Chelsea and the High Line, Davidson writes. After dutifully evoking the passage of freight trains along 11th Avenue and then the elevated trestle, he takes us on a thrill ride through the area’s multiple lives, many of them sordid — such as the 1980s merger of the Meatpacking District with the rough-trade gay-flesh market. Today, of course, it’s a thriving crossroads of art, architecture and affluence that isn’t to everyone’s taste. But in New York, nothing is forever — “the High Line may be almost done, but its story is far from over, because the city that changes around it is a story that never folds.” It’s fashionable to snark that the Big Apple, behind the veneer of gleaming towers and artsy espresso stands, is rotten to the core. Urbanologists and sociologists by the score insisted that 9/11 would spell the end of downtown and perhaps the whole city. Ha! The Financial District that once closed up at 5 p.m. is home today to more than 60,000 who fill the streets 24-7. But Davidson reminds us that overcoming catastrophe was nothing new to Wall Street’s environs. The horrific fire of 1835 was as devastating to the city of its time as the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, he writes. Downtown has always “been shaped by crisis and rebirth: the Depression, the fiscal crisis of 1975, the 9/11 attacks, the financial meltdown of 2008, Hurricane Sandy. Each time, the city has retooled.” Along the way, small victories helped offset the blows until longer-term solutions could be found. Who knew that the collapse of shipping in the 1950s allowed “a coterie of virtually indigent artists” including Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly and James Rosenquist, to establish a creative colony on Coenties Slip, to make “new art out of fragments and memories of a New York that was constantly slipping away?” Looking at 42nd Street — long “an artery or sordid drear” that was “pounded by hookers, con men, addicts and pickpockets” — Davidson muses, “Is there any human activity that architecture can’t elevate?” Masterpieces such as Grand Central Terminal, the New York Public Library, the Chrysler Building — even the brightly-lit drama of seedy Times Square — proclaimed “the city’s nimbleness, its ability to navigate the chaotic present” without utterly relinquishing its past. Davidson’s lifelong home neighborhood, the arts-and-culture driven Upper West Side, has morphed in desirable and undesirable ways from boom to bust to boom. Older Jewish residents are still haunted by the Holocaust; newer arrivals by memories of the late-20th century, when it was one of the city’s most dangerous places to live. While the Upper West Side’s physical appearance hasn’t changed too much, its energy and economic patterns have. It’s much more expensive than it ever was yet still home base — even after an “influx of bankers” — to “the foot soldiers of New York’s creative economy” including editors, choreographers and percussionists. Change is more often than not for the best, even when it grows out of tragedy. Davidson breaks up the chapters on neighborhoods with “Interlude” essays on topics like the city’s skyline, apartments and streets. Writing on the new skyscrapers that dwarf the Empire State Building, Davidson singles out the blue-tinted One57 for ridicule, claiming it resembles “Darth Vader dressed up for a charity ball.” But then he refreshingly, albeit grudgingly, admits that the Rafael Viñoly-designed 432 Park Avenue — a 1,400-foot-tall, concrete-clad condo tower that dominates “the city’s silhouette as forcefully as a campanile looms over an Italian hill town” and is regarded by many as an atrocity — “grew on me as it grew.” It did the same for me. Yes, some consequences of change have been “disastrous,” the book reminds us. The city’s resources and pleasures are unevenly available to its myriad constituencies. Remorseless, often cruel change is the city’s destiny. But change is more often than not for the best, even when it grows out of tragedy. Davidson reminds us that predictions of New York’s doom have been around since the days of Dutch rule. Many creative geniuses deplored the changes they witnessed in their own time. The great novelist Henry James returned in 1904 after living in Europe for 20 years. He hated most of what he saw — especially skyscrapers, monstrosities of no value “save the commercial at any cost” and a blight on a gentler skyline previously dominated by Trinity Church. “James was eloquently, spectacularly wrong,” Davidson chuckles. We all have our loves and hates. I’ll forgive Davidson’s embrace of bike lanes for his ecstatic portrait of our aging, glorious “megalopolis” that “convinces the world that it is young again . . . a place of myth and magic and possibility.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under bill de blasio ,  brooklyn ,  chelsea ,  donald trump ,  financial district ,  new york city ,  the high line Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next People are freaking out about this emoji building Read Next People are freaking out about this emoji building Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 39,582 MIT grad fell to his death trying to pull a stunt 18,715 Brian Williams called out for 'patronizing' Rachel Maddow 9,415 Britain Growing Body Parts 8,847 ESPN firings have led to ugly media fights Real Estate News OneRepublic’s Ryan Tedder Picks Up $8.25M West Hollywood Manse Home Owned by the Last Man on the Moon Lands on Market in Houston Learnin’ to Buy?

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple iPhone 8 to feature Qi wireless charging tech Apple iPhone 8 to feature Qi wireless charging tech By Bindu Nair - Apr 29, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet The iPhone 8 has gotten leaked in the form of a schematic drawing yet again, this time sourced from Weibo and bearing Chinese symbols. It’s a more fleshed-out version of the blueprint which emerged online recently, labeling various parts for clarity. As per 9to5Mac, the alleged iPhone 8‘s components include 4 antenna gaps, a duo front camera, light and proximity sensors, a battery, a power button, a Taptic Engine, the motherboard (in yellow), dual speakers, a SIM tray, volume buttons, dual rear cameras, a flash unit, a mute switch, a Lightning port, and Qi wireless charging coils right at the center (in green). This mysterious circular portion has been widely discussed over the past few days, with many saying that it has something to do with wireless charging. The photo above confirms this assessment. If accurate, it also serves to crush hopes that Apple was going to use long-range wireless charging tech for its anniversary iPhone. Also See: First photos of Apple’s self-driving car surface Apple already uses a variant of Qi’s inductive charging tech for the Apple Watch, so it makes sense for the feature to make its way to the iPhone 8. A prior report had hinted that the brand was going to sell separate accessories for wireless charging, a common practice among Android manufacturers like Samsung. In related iPhone 8 news, frequent tipster KK Sneak Leaks has posted a photo of what is supposed to be the iPhone 8’s housing. The clear case further verifies rumors about the handset’s vertical dual snappers, twin speakers, an elongated power button, and no rear Touch ID.

People are still hailing Samsung’s device as one that breaks through barriers, thanks to its superior display, gorgeous design, and decent specs. However, will it be able to maintain this praise in the light of a future iPhone 8 release? We’re going to take a look at some reasons why, Apple’s 10th-anniversary device, may tip the scales. iPhone 8 Vs. Galaxy S8 There’s no doubt that the Galaxy S8 and the larger S8 Plus are right now the King’s of smartphone design and features. However, Apple, it is expected, will not rest on in laurels this year. No, with 2017 being the 10th-anniversarry of the 1st iPhone launch, it is widely rumored, that the Cupertino-based company will launch something exciting. The problem, however, is, Apple likes to keep its handset information close to its chest. So, there is absolutely no official confirmed information to go on. Although, what rumors we have seen, and supposed insider information, from those close to Apple or its manufacturing partners. Has led us to believe, the iPhone 8 will be a formidable smartphone. One that will have a similar design to that of the Galaxy S8 with minimal bezels, and ultra-high definition display. As for its launch date, at the earliest that will be in September, or if you believe the rumors, October or November. Which mean, Apple has a fair amount of time get it right and deliver an iPhone 8 that can beat the S8. The following are the areas, in which we think, according to those rumors and insiders leaks the iPhone 8 will win. Image Source: Thiago M Duarte / Ran Avni / ConceptsiPhone / YouTube video (screenshot) Augmented Reality While Samsung and others focus on virtual reality headset compatibility, rumors suggest Apple will focus on Augmented reality. Apparently, this will help set it apart from VR smartphones, and enable it to focus on those who loved the experience that Pokemon Go brought. This approach could be the best alternative to VR for those who want a less intrusive gaming experience. Instead of strapping a headset to their faces, instead, they would use the iPhone 8 to overlay AR onto real-world objects. The problem here for Apple, however, is that right now AR is compatible with most if not all smartphones. No, particular headset specific app is required, and the tech pretty much the same across platforms too. So, what it will have to do to make this win for the iPhone 8. Is offer something different with AR, something that will/can’t be copied across to the Galaxy S8. Fingerprint Sensor The fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy S8 is a capable piece of technology; however, it was first billed to be on/in the display. As for the reasons why it isn’t, that’s down to Samsung‘s inability to solve technical issues. As such, it had to be placed on the rear of the handset, but, one huge negative of this is where it’s placed. And that is right next to the camera lens, which, unfortunately, means, users will always be smudging that lens with their finger. As for Apple’s approach, rumors are suggesting, it with its partners, has solved the on/in screen issues. Meaning that it could appear onscreen in the iPhone 8, via a new function area. As the first-of-its-kind, this function area will contain Touch ID along with buttons which react to what’s on screen. Wireless Charging Is Foxconn testing and manufacturing wireless charging modules for the iPhone 8? Late last year, the Nikkei Asian Review reported that the company was indeed doing so. The aim is to produce a technology that could charge the iPhone 8 without it being placed on a mat. If accurate, this would mean, unlike Samsung which uses inductive technology in the Galaxy S8. The 10th-anniversary iPhone would be the world leader if this tech is ultimately adopted. Battery Life While Samsung has had its problems with battery technology, it has incorporated what seems like a stable device into the Galaxy S8. This year the company chose not to leave final testing to partners; instead, it undertook a new, radical approach to testing. Which means while the S8’s may have batteries with lower capacities than expected. Overall, they are superior due to better software management, and as such, last as long, if not longer. As for the iPhone 8, it’s rumored that Apple wants to build upon the excellent battery performance of the iPhone 7 Plus. As such, it apparently, it working towards producing its very first handset, that could push beyond 12-hours usage. Camera Unfortunately, for Galaxy S8 owners, the camera’s included in this year’s devices are little more than we saw last year. In fact, even last years dual-senor setup on the back of the 7 Plus beats it. Meaning that the iPhone 8 will surely best the S8 camera via both megapixels and optical image stabilization on the second lens. This would mean the iPhone 8 camera would produce better quality photos and video. Plus its zoom quality would be far superior. However, it’s thought low-light capabilities will be the real gain.

Close Tesla electric car battery life, Toyota fuel-cell fervor, new diesels still dirty, coal-free England: The Week in Reverse John Voelcker Apr 29, 2017 Follow John Add to circle 2017 Tesla Model SEnlarge Photo Why did readers post 1,000 comments when we asked whether Toyota's fuel-cell cars were foresighted or foolish? What good news did we get this week for Tesla Model S electric-car owners? This is our look back at the Week In Reverse—right here at Green Car Reports—for the week ending on Friday, April 28, 2017. Friday, we wrote about a study of the latest, cleanest European diesel cars sold under new, tougher emission standards. But in real-world use, it turns out those latest new diesels can still be really dirty. We also looked at an enduring alternative-fuel myth. You know how the Ford Model T was designed to run on all sorts of liquid fuels, including kerosene? It's not true at all, as it turns out. On Thursday, we covered what's known so far about Tesla Model S battery life and how well the electric car's packs hold their capacity over time. The news was relatively encouraging, and it generated lots of discussion among readers. Nissan EVgo I-95 Charge ARCEnlarge Photo Wednesday provided Tesla news too: the Silicon Valley electric-car maker plans to double its number of Supercharger outlets globally, in the preparations for the launch of its less expensive, higher-volume Model 3 electric sedan. The same day, we also covered new information uncovered on Apple's self-driving car software efforts, which may not take the form of a car at all—but which inevitably lead to a question: how does Apple plan to play with carmakers? On Tuesday, we described new efforts by BMW, Nissan, and EVgo to boost public charging infrastructure for electric cars. They include a fast-charging corridor between Boston and Washington, D.C. EPA head and climate-science denier Scott Pruitt apparently won't challenge the agency's endangerment finding that allows the agency to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions—because it's based on science, and so he'd lose in court. Monday, we kicked off the week with a piece that looked at whether Toyota's fuel-cell fervor is foolish or far-sighted. So far, it's received 1,000 comments and generated a great deal of discussion. We also covered a momentous day for England: April 21 was the first day since 1882 in which the country didn't burn a single piece of coal to generate electricity. Given coal's core role in the industrial revolution, that's progress. 2018 Subaru Crosstrek, 2017 Geneva auto showEnlarge Photo Over the weekend, we previewed the 2018 Subaru Crosstrek, a small crossover utility from the company that offers many of the AWD vehicles with the highest gas mileage sold in the U.S. And on Saturday, April 22, we celebrated Earth Day by re-running a piece that asked when cars with tailpipes will be viewed as morally wrong. Much discussion ensued. Finally, good news for Tesla buyers: while values of used Nissan Leafs and other low-range electric cars have plummeted, the prices of used Tesla Model S electric luxury cars have held their own. Those were our main stories this week; we'll see you again next week. Until then, this has been the Green Car Reports Week in Reverse update. ________________________________________________ Follow GreenCarReports on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Windows 10 Tip: Cerebro is a great Apple Spotlight alternative for Windows 10 1 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Apr 29, 2017 at 13:00 GMT18 hours ago Apple’s Spotlight is a great feature on Mac OS and iOS. It lets you easily search for things on your computer, as well as the web. Windows 10’s Search that’s built into Cortana is also pretty good when it comes to search, but it isn’t flawless and sometimes the search results aren’t really accurate. Meet Cerebro, a new app for Windows 10, and other older versions of Windows that brings an Apple Spotlight-like experience to Windows. I’ve been using the tool for the past few days and it really is awesome. Once you download and install the tool, all you need to do is hit Ctrl + Spacebar and it will open up. From there, you can search for anything you want — so for instance, if you want to open Spotify, you can simply search for the app and hit enter to open it up. Searching for applications on Cerebro isn’t its best feature because it currently can’t find Windows Store apps which might be annoying if you heavily depend on the modern Windows Store apps. But what makes Cerebro so great is the fact that you can install plugins to expand its functionality. At the moment, there are nearly 60 plugins for Cerebro and almost all of them are pretty awesome. Ther’s a plugin that lets you search for questions on Stackoverflow and get the answers right on the Cerebro window, for instance. And if you’re a GIF-lover, there’s a plugin that lets you search for GIFs on Giphy directly from Cerebro. There’s a lot of other plugins for Cerebro, including one to see the weather for a particular city, one for IMDB, Twitter, and even Reddit. Cerebro isn’t perfect by any means, the experience is a bit rough and the plugins sometimes don’t work properly. But Cerebro is still in its early stages of development, and if you want to help make it better, you can do so via GitHub as it’s an open source project. You can get Cerebro here for Windows 10.  Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker. Please add us to your whitelist to enable the website to function properly.

Xconomy Xperience EXOME National Regions Channels Events Top Entrepreneurs’ Advice → Veering Off Topic With Adelphic Co-founder Jennifer Lum Jeff Engel April 28th, 2017 @JeffEngelXcon @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Boston —  Next up in my ongoing series of offbeat chats with local tech execs and investors is Jennifer Lum. Lum is a leader in Boston’s mobile advertising sector, having co-founded or held a key position in three such startups—m-Qube (acquired by VeriSign), Quattro Wireless (bought by Apple), and Adelphic (recently purchased by Time subsidiary Viant). She has also invested in companies such as Crashlytics, Placester, and CarePort Health. Lum left Adelphic earlier this year, shortly after its acquisition. I recently sat down with her to find out what’s next. She’s working on a new startup called Forge.AI, but she says she’s not ready to share details. (It has something to do with artificial intelligence, of course.) Our conversation dove into the recent controversy over programmatic advertising, what’s next for adtech, and the social contract between consumers and advertisers. I also learned that she loves tennis and hates idle time—although she would try to enjoy herself a little if she ever got stranded on a tropical island. Without further ado, here are the highlights of our chat: Xconomy: I’m assuming you’ve had a little more free time since you left Adelphic. Have you done anything fun with it? Did you take a vacation? Jennifer Lum: I haven’t had as much time to do as much as I would’ve liked. I’ve been able to spend some time with my family. My family is in Toronto. I’ve been able to spend time reconnecting with friends and colleagues, which is nice. I’ve also been able to spend some time just on general wellness, things that you don’t get to pay attention to when you’re heads down in a startup. X: Like what? JL: Exercising. [Laughs.] Focusing on being healthy in general. Eating healthier. The stuff that matters but often gets deprioritized when you need to focus on your company. X: Is that the problem with the startup culture or startup mentality, or is there not much you can do about that? JL: I do think that entrepreneurs in general naturally prioritize their company—which is their baby—first, and almost everything else in their life falls to the side. I do think it’s an issue that entrepreneurs and investors need to be mindful of to ensure that they can help their founders maintain some sort of balance. But on the other hand, I think you’d be hard-pressed to convince an entrepreneur to not give their all, to put everything into their company. X: What’s your take on this recent controversy over programmatic advertising, and brands and advertisers wanting to avoid having their ads appear next to controversial or extremist content on Google, Facebook, and other sites? JL: It certainly is an issue. Brands care a lot about, obviously, their image, but also the types of content and topics that their brands are associated with. For them to learn that their ads have appeared adjacent to content that they may not be interested in or look unfavorably upon, that is an issue. So, how do you prevent that? How do you solve for that? The truth is it takes work. There are a few things. I think one is if you are an advertiser and you are knowingly placing ads on a platform or on a site that has a great deal of user-generated content, you should know that inherently there may be risks around the types of content that your ads will appear next to. And maybe you need to make a deliberate choice as to whether or not that is the right answer for your brand. But I think something that is also within your control, in determining where to place ads—whether you decide to take it upon yourself, or you place that responsibility with your partners or your adtech vendors, who place ads on your behalf—there is a tried and true method, in digital at least, which is known as whitelisting or blacklisting. What that means is you have these manually defined lists where if it’s a whitelist, you are writing down the sites and apps that you feel comfortable having your ads placed [on]. And then on the other hand, on the blacklist are another list of sites and apps, which I absolutely do not want my ads placed on. And it takes work to both build and maintain those lists because content can change so frequently on longer-tail sites and apps. But I think it’s a really important component of building your marketing and advertising plans to have those in place and have those enforced. X: Where do you see mobile advertising headed next? What are some of the big trends to watch over the next five or 10 years? JL: I think mobile will continue to be a core element of marketing and advertising plans, for a few reasons. One, consumers’ mobile devices are the primary device for content consumption. It is a device that’s with them throughout the waking day, and therefore, it offers the best opportunity to learn about consumer behavior and preferences. The obvious thing is if the mobile device is the primary device in which a consumer is browsing through content all day long, it obviously means that that is the best possible channel to reach a consumer through advertising because that’s where their attention is. But an additional benefit is that all of the data that’s being generated through those interactions paints a very interesting and comprehensive picture about consumers. What is the content they’re consuming? What are their location patterns, whether it be commuting or the retail stores that they frequent, time of day patterns, brand preferences, etc.? All of those learnings are also captured on mobile. So, what I think will change over the next few years is that there will be new ways and new channels to capture consumer time and attention. If you look at [augmented reality] and [virtual reality] and some of these emerging technologies, where there will be increasing amounts of content created for these platforms; audio and voice services, which can also be facilitated off the phone, but also from things like [Amazon’s] Alexa in the home and Google Home, and in the car, they’re increasingly using voice-activated services. These new forms of human interaction are coming into play, but I would say mobile will still sit at the core of it because mobile is what’s going to help inform those experiences. The mobile device is also the key that can activate some of those experiences. Your mobile device can sort of be the beacon to say, aha, La Colombe, Jeff is now here. And as a consequence, [that] may activate content and services, and some of them may be ad-supported. [Editor’s note: La Colombe is the Boston coffee shop where the interview with Lum took place.] X: Do you think we’re going to see more pushback from consumers about how their data are tracked by companies? JL: I do. I think that there is a rising level of awareness on behalf of consumers as to the data that they’re generating and how it’s being used. And I think that there’s also an increasing sense of responsibility and accountability that the advertising ecosystem is acknowledging in that they need to make consumers aware of how and when they are using their data. X: Is the trust still there, or has that been lost? … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Jeff Engel is a senior editor at Xconomy.

According to the latest data revealed by IDC on Top Five Smartphone Vendors Worldwide, Samsung shipped closed to 80 million devices in the first quarter of 2017, up from 77.5 million in the previous quarter, accounting for nearly 23 per cent of the market share. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy S8 makes the iPhone 7 look out of fashion Second to Samsung is the Cupertino giant Apple that sold about 51.6 million smartphones, about 26.7 million less than what it sold in the previous quarter. Though compared to Q1 2016 shipments, Apple hasn't lost much of the market share, but it is declining slowly and steadily. Worldwide, smartphone shipments grew 4.3% in 1Q17, which was slightly higher than IDC's previous forecast of 3.6% growth. The data from IDC claims that a total of 347.4 million smartphones were sold in the first quarter of 2017 worldwide. Though the market had been deemed sluggish, consumers continue to show demand for smartphones, flagships in particular. A successful second flagship came in the form of Galaxy S7 last year and ran huge discounts in Q1 2017. Samsung also altered the course for its mid-range smartphones by offering top-end features. IDC claims the J-Series and A-Series "drove significant volumes in both emerging and developed markets".   The third and fourth slots are taken by Chinese smartphone makers Huawei and Oppo that registered significant growth. The shipment grew by 6 million for both the companies, raising their market share by 1.4 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively, compared to last year's Q1 shipments. Though Huawei wasn't able to work its magic in the US market with its MATE 9 smartphone, its Honor brand and the Y series remained the more affordable options to the costlier Samsung and Apple devices and hence a growth driver for the period. Also Read: Is iPhone SE the best phone to buy under Rs 20,000? Vivo's market share also increased by 4 per cent since 2016 Q1, while it has been growing steadily throughout last year. Though Oppo has expanded to Middle-east, African and other Asian market, India and Indonesia has been the major the growth driver for Vivo. Despite most companies working on flaghip products, mid-range premium-style smartphone has remained a focus in this quarter as well. We saw the launch of new Galaxy A-series, Apple resuscitating the iPhone SE sales with huge discounts and new storage variants, and Chinese companies concentrating majorly on mid-segment offerings and throwing in a dash of high spec-ed selfie cameras. Mid-range has easily become the next parking for flagships and most companies have realized that.

Brian Barrett Security Date of Publication: 04.29.17. 04.29.17 Time of Publication: 8:00 am. 8:00 am Security News This Week: Yeah, About That Carrier Steaming Toward North Korea The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.U.S. Navy/Getty Images It was a week full of revelations in the security world. A New York Times Uber story revealed that the company got in trouble with Apple over “fingerprinting” iPhones even after users deleted the app. It’s a common enough practice, but Uber took it a few steps too far. And speaking of common practices, here’s how to check which services have access to your Gmail and Facebook accounts—you might be surprised at how many do. We took a look also at an app vulnerability that leaves tens of millions of Android devices exposed, along with a new Amazon product that could know more about you than you think. Also, it only takes about $22 of gear now to unlock and start a car. Crime might not pay, but it sure comes cheap. Elsewhere we profiled a group of college friends who happen to be hackers, and a missile defense system that happens to be contentious for China. And the Internet of Things still isn’t secure, but Cloudflare has a plan to make it a little better. And there’s more. Each Saturday we round up the news stories that we didn’t break or cover in depth but that still deserve your attention. As always, click on the headlines to read the full story in each link posted. And stay safe out there. The Navy Deployment That Wasn’t Remember way back a few weeks ago, when the US announced that it was sending the USS Carl Vinson steaming toward North Korea as a show of strength? And then a week later, when the US announced that whoops, sorry, actually the Vinson had been heading the opposite direction? That was something! Especially now that Navy Times has filled in the timeline between that first announcement and its confusing, corrective follow-up. As you might imagine, it’s a tale full of miscommunication—and a few missed opportunities to explain what was really going on. Hopefully everyone learned a lesson before a similar misstep sparks a serious incident. A Phishing Scam Reportedly Soaked Google and Facebook For $100 Million According to a report from Fortune, a Lithuanian man in 2013 tricked Google and Facebook into sending him over $100 million of the course of two years, by digitally impersonating Quanta Computer, a Taiwanese supplier for both. The companies have apparently recouped their money, but it’s a useful reminder that on the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog, or a cybercriminal with a whole lot of time on his hands. Hipchat Vulnerability Should Remind You to Check Your Logs Popular work messaging app Hipchat disclosed this week that a “security incident” may have let hackers access user names, email addresses, and hashed passwords. Fortunately, Hipchat says it uses bcrypt with a random salt for its hashing, which is about as good a protection as you could expect, but still, change those passwords. Potentially more troublingly, depending on how loose you are with gossip and smack talk, Hipchat says in .05 percent of instances, messages and content in rooms may have been accessed as well. Which mostly sounds like a dodged bullet, but just remember the next time you Hipchat or Slack or anything, really, that one day some hacker is going to set all the logs free, and it’s going to be mortifying. Google Chrome Will Warn You About Insecure Sites in More Places Now Several months ago, the Google Chrome security team announced that it would take on one of the web’s major security challenges. When people went to HTTP sites, rather than encrypted HTTPS connections, it would give a prominent visual cue that the site was not secure. Starting in October, Chrome will take its warnings a step further, adding them to all HTTP pages visited in incognito mode, as well as any HTTP page that asks you to enter any kind of data. (Currently, the warning shows up on HTTP pages that ask for your password or credit card number.) It’s all part of a broader push by Google to make the web safer—and one of the less controversial methods. Related Video Science Worried About Your Privacy Now?

Formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, Foxconn operates large manufacturing facilities in China, which is a base for its assembly of Apple's iPhones. The Taiwan-based company has been eyeing US investments for some time. President Donald Trump has made several announcements since his election in November about US investments by both foreign and domestic manufacturers, building on his campaign focus on preserving and creating American jobs. It was unclear if Gou had met personally with Trump, who had already departed the White House for a trip to Atlanta by the time the Foxconn chairman emerged and spoke with reporters outside. "We are planning a number of investments in America,” Gou said. "This project will include both capital-intensive and skilled labor-intensive and high-tech investment." Gou said in January that Foxconn was mulling setting up a display-making plant in the United States with an investment that would exceed $7 billion. When asked how much money he plans to invest, Gou said he wanted that to be a White House announcement. "We're still not final yet," he said. "I think we will share with you in the summer, maybe a few weeks." Asked if he had met with Trump, Gou said: "I don't want to say yes or no. After we select the location, the White House will make an announcement." Gou also visited the White House on Thursday, along with senior company executives including Vice Chairman Tai Jeng-wu, who is also chief of Japan's Sharp Corp, in which Foxconn holds a two-thirds stake. Trump has urged Foxconn and other companies to create US jobs, wooing them in some cases and pressuring them in others. In December, Trump met with billionaire Masayoshi Son, the head of Japan's SoftBank Group Corp , who said he planned $50 billion in investments in the United States. Trump demanded that United Technologies Corp reverse a decision to shift Carrier air conditioner production to Mexico from Indiana or face import duties. Carrier agreed to retain jobs in Indiana and received state tax breaks. Trump also pressured Ford Motor Co to cancel a new small-car plant in Mexico. The automaker abandoned that plant but said the decision stemmed from declining sales of small Ford Focus models in the United States. Foxconn said in a statement after Gou spoke: "We can confirm that we are engaged in discussions with officials at various levels of government regarding our ongoing plans to significantly increase our investments in the United States." Foxconn is also looking to acquire Toshiba Corp's chip business. People familiar with the deal have told Reuters it is considered a US security risk due to ties with China, where Foxconn employs about 1 million people. Gou declined to comment when asked about Trump's statement to Reuters on Thursday that he would not take another telephone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 30, 2017 8:35 am LG G6 comes with a 18:9 display ratio, which the company says is the first in any smartphone. LG is reportedly working on a smaller display-size variant of its G6 smartphone, though name the device has not been revealed. According to a report in TechnoBuffalo, the new LG G6 option will features a 5.4-inch display with 80 per cent screen-to-body ratio. Smaller sized LG G6 will come with the same 18:9 screen-to-body ratio that we saw on the original G6. For LG, a smaller option for G6 makes sense given its key competitors like Apple and Samsung offer more than one screen-size variants for their flagship smartphones. iPhone 7, Apple’s last year flagship comes in 4.7-inch display while iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen. Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ sport 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch display respectively. LG G6 is priced at Rs 51,990 in India. The company is touting G6’s 5.7-inch QHD+ ‘Full Vision’ display as one of the highlights of the smartphone. LG G6 is offers more viewing space in a compact form factor thanks to the near ‘Bezel-less’ display. LG G6 comes with a 18:9 display ratio, which the company says is the first in any smartphone. LG G6 features a metal and glass design. It comes with 13MP+13MP dual rear camera setup with 125 and 71 degree field of view respectively. The front-facing camera is 5MP with f/2.2 aperture and 100-degree field of view. LG G6 gets IP68 rating, which means the smartphone is water and dust resistance. LG G6 is powered by a Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, microSD card support, Hi-Fi DAC and a fingerprint scanner. LG G6 is backed by a 3,300mAh battery with support for Quick Charge 3.0. For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Tags: LG No Comments.

Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Apple To Debut Amazon Echo Rival Smart Speaker With Siri And AirPlay At WWDC Posted: Apr 29 2017, 5:01am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Apple   Mac Pro Apple’s Siri Speaker Said to Follow Mac Pro Style   Apple’s new echo-like smart speaker has a Siri and AirPlay facility and it will be presented at the WWDC 2017. Apple is currently busy tinkering with a novel Siri-based domestic gadget that consists of a speaker. Its design and features have been leaked on Twitter recently by a tech enthusiast. Don't Miss: Find Rare Products in Stock Online with The Tracker Apple is putting the final touches on on the Amazon Echo and Google Home competitor. This will gain commercial recognition as a Siri and AirPlay contraption. It also has Beats technology to some extent in its makeup. This device will run a type of iOS software.  The device was codenamed B238, according to MacRumors. It has a Mac Pro concave top. Also intrinsic controls exist on this gizmo of sorts. The leaked design shows this device to look like a fat person in its rotundity and cylindrical features. It will probably be showcased at the WWDC 2017 in the summer months. However, the plans could undergo a radical change at the drop of a hat. The device is currently being tested on an extensive basis.   Apple is currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device.— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run an variant iOS— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 More from @SonnyDickson on Apple's Alexa competitor. - Concave top with the controls, fat with the speaker mesh portion covering it all. 1/2— Jen Ryall (@jennijenni) April 28, 2017   There is both a bigger and a smaller version of the device that will be available when the time is right. Apple likes to keep things under wraps yet this leakage has upset its plans.  This device would probably control electrical appliances, door locks, ceiling lights and even curtains via Siri voice command facility. There is also facial recognition technology in the mix somewhere. A built-in camera sees to it that only the right person gets to operate it. This device will make lives even more smoother and easier in the developed countries. It is revolutionary in its nature and will allow for the home environment to be made magical in its quality. At just a simple command, anything could happen in the domestic sphere. Housewives who want some relief from work and tired husbands who return late at night to their homes will simply love this arrangement.  This story may contain affiliate links.

In fact, many established tech companies have been ramping up their distributions, as the accompanying table shows.

In a letter made public on Friday, Apple suggested a series of changes to the draft policy that is under development and said it looks forward to working with California and others "so that rapid technology development may be realized while ensuring the safety of the traveling public." Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet Inc, Ford Motor Co, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], Toyota Motor Corp, Tesla Motors Inc  and others also filed comments suggesting changes. California said on Tuesday it would review comments before deciding whether to make changes to the policy that aims to allow companies to test vehicles without traditional steering wheels and controls or human back-up drivers. The state is at the forefront of a crowded race to develop self-driving vehicles and the proposed changes from automakers and technology companies help provide insight into current efforts. In its letter, Apple said California should revise how companies report self-driving system "disengagements." California currently requires companies to report how many times the self-driving system was deactivated and control handed back to humans because of a system failure or a situation tied to traffic, weather or road conditions that required human intervention for safety reasons. But Apple wants those rules to extend to humans stepping in to prevent even minor traffic violations. Apple contends the reporting rules as written leave too much wiggle room for car makers and "caused public confusion and misunderstanding," wrote Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity. Apple also asked regulators to revisit language around the definition of an autonomous vehicle to clarify that permits are required in advanced systems even when a safety driver is present. The exact wording around when permits are needed became a sticking point between Uber and state officials last year when the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered Uber to cease its self-driving tests in San Francisco. Apple also said the state's rules for development vehicles used only in testing could "restrict both the design and equipment that can be used in test vehicles." A late entrant to the self-driving race, Apple secured a permit earlier this month to test autonomous vehicles in California. Although it has never openly acknowledged it is looking into building a car, Apple has recruited dozens of auto experts. The company declined to comment on Friday. 'STIFLE INNOVATION' Tesla said California should not bar testing of autonomous vehicles that are 10,000 pounds (4,535 kg) or more, a move that Apple also joined. Tesla said such a move could "stifle innovation," and bar a company from testing a heavy autonomous vehicle that might be used to haul parts on private property rather than on public roads, pushing developers in this sector out of the state. Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, in 2016 announced plans for new electric vehicles, including a commercial truck called the Tesla Semi and a public transport bus. The electric vehicle pioneer said earlier this month it plans to unveil a commercial truck in September. Tesla also said California should not prohibit the sale of non-self-driving vehicles previously used for autonomous vehicle testing. Tesla said that under the proposal, if it loads a vehicle with autonomous testing software and then replaces it with conventional production software it could be barred from selling the vehicle. Uber said California should allow paying members of the public to ride in autonomous vehicles with drivers, saying: "There is no reason to deny those riders an opportunity to travel in an autonomous test vehicle and provide honest feedback." Lyft Inc, a ride-hailing service rival of Uber, asked the state to remove a requirement that it notify local authorities of autonomous vehicle testing. Waymo asked California to remove its liability proposal. On Tuesday, General Motors Co had said the state's proposed liability rules could make automakers liable regardless of fault for any crash. GM also said that automakers should be allowed to reuse autonomous vehicles and parts after testing or if the vehicle is scrapped. Volkswagen AG  and Daimler AGsubmitted joint comments seeking changes to the extent of data required to be retained in crashes involving self-driving cars. A number of automakers have said they plan to begin deploying self-driving vehicles, some in commercial fleets, by 2020-21.

Apple said it had decided to withhold royalty payments to its contract manufacturers until the dispute is resolved in court. The payments made by Apple to its contract manufacturers are, in turn, owed by the contractors to Qualcomm in royalties, according to the chipmaker’s licensing business model. The iPhone maker sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, is a major supplier to Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s revenue in its latest fiscal year. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court,” an Apple spokesman said on Friday. Apple also noted it had been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but said Qualcomm had refused to negotiate “fair terms”. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade,” Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, said in a statement. Qualcomm said it will not receive royalties from Apple’s contract manufacturers for sales during the quarter ended March 31, and that its forecast for the third fiscal quarter now excludes that revenue. “Even if one believed this was a worst case scenario (for Qualcomm), we struggle to see a resolution anytime soon as the parties entrench,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “We suspect this is going to continue to get uglier,” he added. Qualcomm now expects revenue of $4.8 billion-$5.6 billion for its third fiscal quarter, down from the $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion it had previously expected. The company lowered its forecast for current-quarter adjusted profit to 75-85 cents per share, from 90 cents-$1.15 per share. “(Apple’s) contract manufacturers may make some form of partial payment, but initial indications are that any payment would likely be insignificant,” Qualcomm said. Through Thursday, Qualcomm’s shares had fallen 17 percent since Apple’s lawsuit. The stock — the worst performer this year on the Philadelphia semiconductor index — was down 0.7 percent at $52.86 in midday trading. tags Qualcomm Apple Qualcomm Apple news chipmakers more from tech Over 29 million smartphones shipped to India in the first quarter of 2017: Report Apr 29, 2017 12:18 IST Fitbit to the rescue?

According to market research firm IDC, the South Korean tech giant sold about 7.9 million smartphones during the January-March period to account for a market share of 22.8 per cent. Its US arch rival Apple came in second with a 14.9 per cent share. The latest figure marks a turnaround from the October-December period of 2016, when Apple stood as the top player. Stung by the suspension of the Galaxy Note 7 phablet, Samsung still managed to take up 18.5 per cent of the market in the fourth quarter of last year. The company stopped the production of the smartphone following reports of the devices catching fire while charging. Also, Huawei Technologies, Oppo and Vivo followed Apple and Samsung in the top five, with a combined market share of 22.4 per cent in the first quarter this year, up from 18.7 per cent tallied a year earlier. Huawei led the pack with a 9.8 per cent market share during the same period, nearly posting a double digit market share, the data showed. Oppo followed with a 7.4 per cent market share and Vivo with 5.4 per cent, according to the data. Pre-orders for its new flagship Galaxy S8 and S8+ devices have reached 80,000 units within a week of the launch in India and are expected to hit 150,000 units by the end of this month.
