File Photo Apple has sought relaxations for consumables for smartphone manufacturing and service or repair for 15 years. New Delhi, Mar 26:   The government is working on certain options to accommodate demands related to tax and duty concessions sought by iPhone maker Apple for setting up a manufacturing unit in India. Although the Finance Ministry has prima facie rejected the demands of the US-based technology major, senior executives of the company met an inter-ministerial group recently to deliberate upon the issue. The group discussed at length the demands of the company, sources said, adding that the government is trying to find ways through which certain support measures could be extended to the American firm. Sources also said the company is asking for concessions as it wants to bring in its supply chain or component makers to the country as Apple cannot source inputs locally. The company also wants duty exemptions on the products to be bought from special economic zones (SEZs). At present, goods exported from SEZs do not attract any duty but import duties are levied if items produced in special economic zones are sold in the domestic market. There is a possibility that this demand could be met by the government as several domestic companies are also demanding for the same. On the other hand, certain duty concessions being sought by Apple are very difficult to meet as India is gradually becoming a manufacturing hub of smartphones. A strong supply chain is being established in the country despite any sop or concession offered to any player. Also, no domestic or foreign manufacturer has sought any concession from the government so far. There is dilemma that if the government extends support to Apple, it may weaken this strong supply chain. “So the government has to make a balance,” sources added. Apple has also sought relaxations for consumables for smartphone manufacturing and service or repair for 15 years. In January, Apple had indicated to the government that it is ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones in India, but wants fiscal concessions, including customs duty waiver on import of components. The company sells its products through Apple-owned retail stores in countries like China, Germany, the US, the UK and France, among others. It has no wholly-owned store in India and sells its products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro.

Apple hasn’t confirmed an iOS 10.3 release date for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch but it’s getting close. Real close. Apple’s pushed rapid fire iOS 10.3 beta updates, a sign the upgrade is making substantial progress behind the scenes. The release of iOS 10.3 beta 7 came less than a week after the company released an iOS 10.3 beta 6 for developers and those in its free Beta Software Program. And thanks to new product announcements, we now know the iOS 10.3 update should be out sometime before the end of April. Apple’s new Clips app is scheduled for release next month and iOS 10.3 will be required to use it on the iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. We still don’t have an official iOS 10.3 release date to share but we do have some tips that could help you on the road to its release. iOS 10.3 Release Time The iOS 10.3 update is shaping up to be an exciting release. Its packed with new features, performance enhancements, and tweaks. While you might be tempted to check your phone every 15 minutes for the update, that’s not how Apple iOS releases work. It’s difficult to predict the exact iOS 10.3 release date but it’s very easy to predict the iOS 10.3 release time. Here are a few things to keep in mind as we close in on the iOS 10.3 release date: Apple never releases iOS updates on the weekend so there’s no need to check for iOS 10.3 on Saturday or Sunday. iOS updates almost always arrive between 9AM and 10AM Pacific. General rule of thumb is to check around 10AM Pacific. While some of you will want to download the iOS 10.3 update the second it arrives, many others will want to wait. Skip the iOS 10.3 Beta We’re now on iOS 10.3 beta 7 which means we’re really close to the official release. With an iOS 10.3 release imminent, most people should avoid the iOS 10.3 beta and wait for the official release. The potential headaches aren’t worth it at this point. Prepare Your iPhone, iPad or iPod With an iOS 10.3 release date likely just days away, now is the perfect time to start preparing for the update’s release. Here are a few pre-installation tips to keep in your back pocket as we approach the arrival of iOS 10.3: Use this time to cleanup your device. Get rid of files (apps, music, etc), anything you no longer use. Cleaning up your device could improve your device’s performance. Start backing up your data. If you don’t know where to start, you’ll want to research iCloud backups, iTunes backups, and the differences between the two. This is especially important due to the arrival of AFPS. If you want to download iOS 10.3 right when it comes out, make sure your device has at least a 50% charge (or you’re near a charger) around 10AM Pacific. Get your login information handy. Make sure you have the device’s passcode, Apple ID, and your important logins ready on release day. The update might log you out of various apps and services. Dig into feedback from iOS 10.3 beta testers. You might learn about a potential problem or benefit to your version of iOS 10.3. A little prep work will help you avoid major problems during the iOS 10.3 installation process. It’ll also help you avoid headaches once you get the new update on board your phone or tablet. Learn About iOS 10.3 Make sure you know what you’re getting into before you download the iOS 10.3 update on your phone. This goes deeper than just perusing the change log Apple will include with the update. You’ll want to dig deeper, especially if you own an older device. iOS 10.3 isn’t officially out for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch but thanks to the iOS 10.3 beta for developers and the general public, we know what to expect. A new iCloud storage breakdown in iOS 10.3 shows you exactly how your using your space. We’ve put together a broad guide to the iOS 10.3 update. We’ve also put together some in-depth analysis of the iOS 10.3 update’s most exciting features. We’ve also detailed some of iOS 10.3’s small but important features. You’ll also want to get familiar with the new Clips application that’s set to arrive in April. Again, you’ll need to download iOS 10.3 in order to use the Clips app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. If you haven’t been following the iOS 10.3 beta, now would be a good time to dig in. We don’t expect the update to change much between now and the official release date and we don’t expect the beta to be too much different from the official version of iOS 10.3. Download iTunes 12.6 Now would be a good time to download the latest version of iTunes. Apple recently released iTunes 12.6. The update delivers some bug fixes and performance improvements and it also delivers an exciting feature that requires iOS 10.3 to work on iPhone and iPad. iTunes 12.6 marks the debut of a “Rent once, watch anywhere” that allows you to watch iTunes rentals across all of your devices provided they’re running iOS 10.3 or tvOS 10.2. If you rent movies from iTunes you’ll probably want to download the latest version. You’ll also probably want to download the iOS 10.3 update as soon as it arrives. Report iOS 10.3 Problems If you choose to install iOS 10.3 on release day there’s a chance you’ll run into an issue during or after the installation process finishes up. If you do run into an iOS 10.3 problem on your phone, there’s no need to panic. Sometimes it can take a couple of days for an update to settle in. If you notice weird battery life on release day, give it a day or two to even out. If problems persist after two days with iOS 10.3, or if the issues are serious, you’ll want to take action. There are tons of resources out there but our list of fixes for common iOS 10 problems is a great place to start. If you don’t consider yourself an expert, you’ll want to bookmark those fixes so you’re ready to tackle problems as soon as they popup. If you can’t fix your problem and/or you want to help the community, you’ll want to report iOS 10.3 problems as you see them. There are a few places to do that. You can relay your problem to Apple Support on Twitter and/or get in contact with Apple Support via the company’s website. We also recommend reporting your problem on Apple’s Discussion forums to alert Apple and other users to your issue. You Can Test iOS 10.3 Remember, if you don’t want to deal with the iOS 10.3 beta, you can take the official version of iOS 10.3 for a test drive provided you’re already on iOS 10.2.1. For a short time, Apple will allow you to drop back down to iOS 10.2.1. You won’t be able to downgrade to anything older than iOS 10.2.1 and it will only be open for a short period of time, probably a couple of weeks tops. Most of you will choose to remain on iOS 10.3 but others might benefit from dropping down to the older version of iOS 10. If you aren’t familiar with the iOS downgrade process, now is the time. How to Get Off iOS 10.3 Beta If you chose to try the iOS 10.3 beta and you don’t want to get thrown onto the next iOS 10 beta (iOS 10.3.1? iOS 10.4?), you’ll want to unenroll from the iOS 10.3 beta once the final version is released. Here’s how to do that. Go to Settings > General > Profiles and then tap the iOS Beta Software Profile that appears on your device. Enter your passcode, if there is on associated with the device, and tap Delete Profile. You will no longer receive beta software. Go into your Settings or iTunes and download iOS 10.3. If you’ve been running an iOS 10.3 and the watchOS beta on your Apple Watch, you’ll need to take a few more steps before, on, or after the iOS 10.3 release date. Here’s how to get the watchOS beta off your device, Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. Tap the My Watch tab. Go to General > Profiles. Tap the beta profile you want to remove. Enter a passcode if needed and then tap Delete Profile. If you want to use beta software again you’ll need to install the correct beta profile. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.3 update brings over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 One Response 03/25/2017 James Burton Reply Hi I’m impressed with the amber alert system in the future is there going to be FBI warrants support Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Apple says it took care of CIA spyware… Apple says it took care of CIA spyware vulnerabilities years ago By Bill Roberson — March 24, 2017 12:34 PM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why are we not totally reassured? Following revelations that the CIA developed snooping tools for Apple Mac computers and iPhone, Cupertino has responded by saying the exploits are outdated and were dealt with years ago. In a statement to Tech Crunch, Apple said they wanted to assure users their devices are safe and secure and that the malware detailed by Wikileaks would only work on the iPhone 3G, so if you still are using one, might be time for an upgrade? Yeah… Apple also said they had no “special deal” with Wikileaks and were treating their findings as they would any bug report. As for what the CIA has cooked up since the era of the iPhone 3G, who knows. Oh yeah, that thing Twitter, which always seems to be on the brink of financial collapse, rummaged around in their junk drawer recently and suddenly remembered they owned TweetDeck, and thought, “hey, maybe we could make some money with this thing.” On Thursday, numerous users posted clues that Twitter may use Tweetdeck as a foundation for a paid Twitter service with premium features such as advanced publishing features, no ads and more. So how much? $20 a month has been floated, but so has $5 a month, a figure that doesn’t cut into our beer budget as much. Twitter acquired Tweetdeck way back in 2011 for 40 million, and it looks like it could return soon – for a fee. Time keeps on slipping into the future… Everyone wants to live forever, or, at least, for a while longer than nature currently allows, and new research shows that after a while, your blood gets old while you… also get old. So if you could make your blood young again, might that help slow down the aging process. Looks like it might. Researchers in Germany say “young blood” that’s been genetically modified appears to have health benefits and may reverse some aging processes. It’s part of Stem cell research and while the investigation is ongoing, the signs are promising. Check out our the full story at the link and stop trying to figure out how to be a sexy vampire. We’ve got more news on our Facebook page and YouTube channel, and be sure to tune in to this week’s DT podcasts: Close to the Metal (computers and such) on Tuesday, Trends with Benefits (general tech shenanigans)  on Thursdays, and Between the Streams (movie and TV topics) every Friday.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Drool over these photos of Apple’s new ruby… Drool over these photos of Apple’s new ruby iPhone 7 (RED) By Kyle Wiggers and Julian Chokkattu — March 24, 2017 1:36 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Apple has long contributed to the fight against HIV/AIDS, and the new iPhone (Red) is a continuation of that trend. Move over, jet black. Red is the iPhone’s hot new color. In partnership with nonprofit Product (RED), Apple added a brand-new, bright ruby red iPhone to its roster: The iPhone (RED). Like the company’s (RED) iPod Nano, (RED) Beats headphones, and (RED) Smart Battery cases, the launch is intended to promote ongoing efforts by Product (RED) to combat HIV and AIDS, which remains one of the globe’s worst health problems. More than 35 million people have died of the virus, and 37 million are infected each year, according to Product (RED). More: Apple iPhone 7 review As with Apple’s other Product (RED)-branded devices, a portion of every iPhone (RED) sale will be donated to The Global Fund, a charitable organization that finances HIV/AIDS grants to roughly half a dozen countries in sub-Saharan Africa. “This is the biggest day in our 10-year partnership, (RED) CEO Deb Dugan told Mashable. “[We’ve] seen from the time we’ve begun with Apple that more than 18 million people have effective treatment. Having Apple make this very big statement, it takes our breath away.” Our first look at the red hot iPhone The iPhone (RED) is officially available in Apple Stores, so we stopped by to see what the fuss is all about. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends What’s clear is Apple needs to make more iPhone colors — the iPhone (RED) is drop-dead gorgeous. The matte, ruby red finish on the back attracts the eye, but hardly any fingerprints. The Product (RED) logo sits below the iPhone, and the antennas around the phone blend in more so it looks a little sleeker than the other colors. Apart from that, you should expect the same build quality and style of the iPhone 7. The only downside is that Apple did not make the front red like the back. Instead, you get a white front along with a silver accented home button. The iPhone (RED) is another notch in Apple’s belt in its fight against HIV and AIDS. The iPhone maker has made a tradition of marking World AIDS Day with a campaign to donate to Product (RED), and in 2012, it teamed up with Starbucks to offer a special iTunes eBasket that saw 5 percent of proceeds donated to The Global Fund. Availbility and pricing The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Special Edition (RED) is now available online and in stores. The design is the only difference between the Product (RED) phones and the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus devices  — functionally speaking, they’re the same. More: Apple iPhone 7 Plus review Here’s how the pricing breaks down: iPhone 7 128 GB:  $750 iPhone 7 256 GB: $850 iPhone 7 Plus 128 GB: $870 iPhone 7 Plus 256 GB: $970 Apple said the percentage of each sale that goes to Product (RED) varies by channel, but historically, the iPhone maker has been one of the charity’s biggest contributors. It has donated $130 million to the cause thus far — an amount that’s more than many countries have contributed, according to Dugan. Apple will try to inform potential buyers about Product (RED)’s mission through posters, pamphlets, and other promotional materials. Controversy in China There was some initial blowback to the iPhone (RED) in China — about how the announcement and product page on Apple’s Chinese site are completely devoid of Product (RED) branding. The limited-edition model is slated to land in more than 40 countries in April, and while China is one of them, it appears that Apple made the change to avoid pushback over what is a murky, taboo subject in the country. The omission is even more strange considering Apple China pledged its support to Product (RED) late last year, as pointed out by Engadget China’s editor-in-chief, Richard Lai, on Twitter. The company’s Taiwan site retained the branding, which indicates there’s more than a language problem at work here. Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed to MacRumors that the company “will donate to the Global Fund on every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus [sold] in every country in the world.” Apparently, even though the name has been scrubbed, sales of the limited-edition iPhone in China will continue to benefit the charity. This article was originally published on 03-21-2017. Updated on 03-24-2017 by Julian Chokkattu: Added hands-on images of the iPhone (RED).

By India Ashok March 26, 2017 06:14 BST Apple Inc's CEO Tim Cook (3rd L) reacts next to China Mobile Ltd's Chairman Xi Guohua (3rd R) at an event celebrating the launch of Apple's iPhone on China Mobile's network at a China Mobile shop in Beijing on 17, January, 2014REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Apple has reportedly just landed a major victory in a patent dispute case that prevented the firm from selling iPhones in China. However, a Chinese court reportedly found in favour of Apple, effectively overturning a ban on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sales. In May 2016, a Beijing patent regulator had ordered Apple's Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to halt its iPhone sales, after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint alleging that Apple had infringed on the patent design for its mobile phone 100c, Reuters reported. Both Apple and Zoomflight took the ban to court. On Friday (24 March), The Beijing Intellectual Property Court overturned the ban, finding that neither Apple nor Zoomflight violated Shenzhen Baili's design patent for 100c phones. The court also ruled that the patent regulator had failed to follow proper procedures in ordering the iPhone sales ban, given that there was not enough proof to back up Shenzhen Baili's claim that the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. In a related ruling, however, the same court denied Apple's request to strip Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones, according to a report by the Xinhua news agency. Apple reportedly first made a request to China's Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office, but the board rejected the tech firm's request. It was then that Apple took the matter to court. Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly considering starting manufacturing iPhone 6 and 6S models in India.

The Redmi 4A sports a 5-inch 720x1280 pixels display, and powered by a 1.4GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM. Along with the Redmi 4A India launch, the company teased that the launch of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 and Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime in the country is imminent. Xiaomi Redmi 4A customers on Idea will get 1GB data per day, with a RS. 343 recharge, and after the launch, the phone went on sale on Thursday. Xiaomi said that the first sale of the phone sold 250,000 units in four minutes, on Amazon India and Mi.com. Xiaomi Redmi 4A Review   That's just one of the news highlights from this week though - keep reading to know what else has been happening. Xiaomi Announces Second Manufacturing Unit in India, Boosts Production Capacity As predicted, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus red variants have been launched by Apple, officially called the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED. These red coloured iPhones have been launched in India as well, with prices same as other iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models of the same capacity. Apple Unveils New 9.7-Inch iPad, Cheapest Full-Sized iPad Yet Apple has also doubled the storage capacities on the two iPhone SE variants - from 16GB and 64GB, to 32GB and 128GB respectively while retaining their price tags in the US, with prices starting at Rs. 27,200 (MRP).  iPhone 7 RED, iPhone SE, iPad Lineup India Prices Revealed  Apart from that, on Thursday we saw the launch of the Oppo F3 Plus (Review), which has a dual-selfie camera. The phone was launched at an event in New Delhi, but it will go on sale from April 1. Preorders have begun however, and will continue until March 31. The highlight of the Oppo F3 Plus is its dual-selfie camera, which has one 16-megapixel and one 8-megapixel sensor. Users can choose which lens they want to use, and, the smartphone comes with a Smart Facial Recognition feature that Oppo says automatically suggests which lens is ideal. Oppo F3 Plus Review   Google meanwhile launched the newest version of Android, as a developer preview. Android O Developer Preview 1 has been released for developers and device makers and brings in a lot of new features, such as background limits, notification channels, standard autofill APIs, picture-in-picture video, adaptive icons, as well as support for multi-display. Top New Android O Features While not all Android O features have been revealed with the developer preview, this does give us an idea at what Google is focussing at with the next major build of its mobile OS. For one, it's bringing tighter control over battery usage, and notification channels would give developers more control over the type of notification content. Adaptive icons can display various shapes, and animate interactions with icons. Other changes include improved keyboard navigation, and picture-in-picture mode.   On the international front, there was one development that many were not expecting. At the start of the week, the US issued a ban on certain electronic items in the cabin on flights from the Middle East. A day later a similar ban was issued by the UK, which came into effect from Saturday. No US carriers are affected, but the ban hits passengers on approximately 50 flights per day from the busiest hubs in the Arab world and the three Gulf carriers that recently emerged as giants: Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways.  Laptops, Tablets on Aeroplanes: What's the Threat? Reaction from the affected airports' host governments was generally low-key, and Emirates turned the situation into a light-hearted ad extolling the strengths of its in-flight entertainment, entitled: "Who needs a laptop?" But one government, Turkey, denounced the order and demanded that it be rescinded or scaled back. Laptop Ban: Emirates Offers Complimentary Electronics Handling Facility  There were also a number of smartphone launches through the week. The Intex Aqua 4G Mini has been made available in black and red colour variants. The budget smartphone comes with VoLTE support and is priced at Rs. 4,199. It packs a 5-megapixel rear camera, a 1.3Ghz quad-core processor, 512MB of RAM, and a 1450mAh battery. After launching the Vdeo 3 and Vdeo 4 smartphones in India, Micromax has further expanded the Vdeo series to launch the Micromax Spark Vdeo smartphone. Like other phones in the Vdeo series, this comes with Google Duo preloaded, and is priced at Rs. 4,499.   We also saw the launch of the Zen Admire Swadesh, with support for 22 Indian languages, 4G VoLTE support, priced at Rs. 4,990, and the Karbonn Aura Sleek 4G, which launched at Rs. 5,290. Aside from these, we also saw a couple of [mid-range launches from Lava - the Lava Z10 and the Lava Z25, priced at Rs. 11,500 and Rs. 18,000, respectively. The LG Stylus 3 rounds this out priced at Rs. 18,500, with an HD display, 16GB storage, a 1.5GHz processor and 3GB of RAM. Lava Z25 vs Lava Z10: All You Need to Know  In China, the Nubia M2, Nubia M2 Lite, and Nubia N2 smartphones were launched. The M2 and M2 Lite, which have been priced starting at CNY 2,699 (roughly Rs. 27,000) and CNY 1,799 (roughly Rs. 18,000) respectively will be available soon, while the Nubia N2, which has been priced at CNY 1,999 (roughly Rs. 19,000), will be available from April 8. And in Taiwan, Panasonic has now launched the Eluga Pure. The budget device is only available in Taiwan for now, and is priced at TWD 4,990 (roughly Rs. 10,700). Samsung Galaxy S8 Release Date, Specifications, Price, and More: What the Rumours Say   Apart from the launches, there was also a leak about the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. The two phones are set to launch in under a week, and a new leaked teaser hints at features such as iris scanning, and also a look at the retail box. Meanwhile, Samsung Pay has been officially launched in India - you can now save your credit and debit cards to select Samsung phones, and use them to pay at any card terminal, not just updated NFC terminals. India may soon issue chip-enabled passports with high security features, as the government has given approval for procurement of electronic contactless inlays for manufacturing of e-passports. However, this week also included news of a major data leak from the government. A simple Google search revealed a lot of personal data, including peoples' full names, parents names, birthdates, bank account numbers and IFSC codes. These were some of the most noteworthy developments that took place this week. Tell us what you think about all this via the comments.

The new Nokia and BlackBerry phones shown at Mobile World Congress rely heavily on nostalgia and are aimed at niche markets; will that be enough to pull customers away from Apple, Samsung and the other big makers? PUBLISHED : Sunday, 26 March, 2017, 8:32am UPDATED : Sunday, 26 March, 2017, 8:32am Comments:   Ben Sin ben.sin@scmp.com Share PrintEmail Related topics Nokia Smartphones BlackBerry Related Articles Lifestyle Promise of 5G future dominates Mobile World Congress in Barcelona 4 Mar 2017 Tech New Nokia 6 unlikely to be a hit in China 12 Jan 2017 Apps & Gaming Nokia invests in women’s menstrual cycle tracking app 30 Nov 2016 It’s hard to imagine now, with the Apple iPhone and the array of Samsung models around the globe, that there once was a time when Nokia and BlackBerry were kings of the mobile phone industry. Finnish company Nokia made some of the first mobile phones in the 1980s, helped these devices become household items in the early 2000s, and by 2007, had a whopping 41 per cent of the mobile handset market. Meanwhile, BlackBerry, the brainchild of Canadian company Research in Motion, dominated the enterprise market, becoming a status symbol among working professionals. At its peak in 2009, it made an annual profit of US$2 billion and had a 20 per cent market share. We all know what happened next. Neither company took the iPhone, with its iOS platform, seriously when it was introduced in 2007, and within five years their kingdoms had fallen to the iPhone and phones using Google’s Android. The indestructible Nokia 3310 is back, complete with Snake, retro styling and epic battery life By the time Nokia and BlackBerry stopped making phones, in 2014 and 2016 respectively (the former was first sold to Microsoft and later passed to Finnish start-up HMD Global, while BlackBerry became the property of Chinese company TCL), the brands had been irrelevant for so long, no one but the most hardcore of mobile geeks cared – and even that was out of pure nostalgia. And so, when new BlackBerry and Nokia handsets were announced at this year’s Mobile World Congress, neither fans of the brands nor the media were sure what to expect. After all, both brands crashed and burned badly due to their repeated inability to understand mobile trends in the early 2010s, and the industry has only become more competitive since then, so can they make a real splash? Not at the highest level, no. No one can objectively say the five new handsets (four Nokias and one from BlackBerry) introduced at the Mobile World Congress are going to do much damage to Samsung and Apple phone sales – not with their modest specs and solid but unspectacular hardware – but all five phones do have specific features that cater to niche audiences. Plus, nostalgia is a powerful emotion, and both brands are designed to conjure up plenty of that among fans. BlackBerry’s KEYOne, for example, is a clear continuation of the once mighty portable work machines, a mostly black aluminium device with a physical keyboard attached to a modest 4.5-inch 1080P display. The problem is that few consumers today are clamouring for a physical keyboard, and the KEYone also runs on an underpowered Snapdragon 625 processor – a far cry from the Snapdragon 835 that will feature in Samsung’s Galaxy S8. TCL’s chief executive officer, Nicolas Zibell, says in defence: “We must stop thinking of the smartphone user experience as being driven by chipset power alone. In the same way that automobile makers select a certain engine to be optimised for an overall experience in a vehicle, the processor in a smartphone must be taken into context with the overall design and user value proposition.” HMD Global, meanwhile, introduced three new Nokia-branded devices running pure stock Android (which is usually only available on Google’s own line of phones, since brands such as Samsung and Huawei put their own software on top of Android), and a fourth device that drew most of the attention: an “updated” version of the iconic Nokia 3310. “Nokia has much brand equity and emotional resonance,” says Pekka Rantala, a former Nokia executive and now HMD Global’s chief mobile marketing officer, pointing out that the Nokia was likely the first mobile phone for many consumers. The market demands more than just a one-size-fits-all solution Nicolas Zibell He says the response to the 3310 has been “tremendous”. No one is denying the retro gadget is fun to look at and play with, but the device – true to its original roots – can only make phone calls, send SMS messages and play the mobile game “Snake”. You can’t go on Facebook and you can’t send e-mails. That doesn’t sound like a phone that many will actually want to use in a real-world situation. Rantala, of course, spins it like this: “The new 3310 is a great weekend phone for those who want to detox from social media.” At least the new Nokia smartphones get the software (stock Android) right. Rantala says HMD Global’s goal going forward is to release “well crafted” smartphones that work closely with Google to provide the most up-to-date software, security updates, and Google services. “We will work closely with Google to align our phones with their vision,” he says, “because Google services are the best services.” But here’s the thing: HMD Global is also aiming at the Chinese market – the Nokia 6, the new release with the best specs, was actually introduced in China before the Mobile World Congress – where Google services are banned. So how is HMD Global going to market Nokia phones as devices with the best Google apps when none of them can get over the Great Firewall? “I don’t have an answer for your question,” Rantala says. “But I believe that our partnership with Google opens up the opportunity to perhaps work things out with China.” Nokia’s comeback phone in China gets a collective yawn from buyers That’s a pipe dream. Chinese consumers are likely to stick with cheap local brands like Xiaomi, or “premium” phones from Huawei or Apple, rather than pay mid-tier prices for a Nokia or BlackBerry. A more realistic scenario for both brands is to appeal to the niche and emerging markets. According to research firm IDC, a disproportionate number of people in Indonesia are still using the long-abandoned BBM (BlackBerry Messenger) service, a fact Zibell is keen to explore. “The market demands more than just a one-size-fits-all solution,” he says. Why a BlackBerry needs a keyboard - head of China’s TCL talks up new smartphone at CES 2017 tech show Another senior BlackBerry executive concedes the brand doesn’t have lofty goals for now. Speaking to TechCrunch at the Mobile World Congress, BlackBerry’s mobile division general manager Bruce Walpole said if even one in eight consumers pick up the new BlackBerry, the company would be satisfied. Perhaps having the backing of a billion-dollar Chinese conglomerate (TCL owns another phone brand, Alcatel, and also makes smart televisions) takes a lot of pressure off the brand. HMD Global, however, doesn’t have that luxury. The company is small compared with other phone makers, and put together by a group of Finns. To them, the success of the Nokia brand isn’t just about making money or even restoring Nokia’s legacy, it’s about bringing pride back to the country. “Nokia was once the pride and joy of Finland,” Rantala says. “We want to bring the brand back to show the world why Finland was once the mobile capital of the world.” The early response to the classic Nokia 3310 has been strong (less so for the other models).

Last May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple's Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office's ban to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili's design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua. In a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones. Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board's decision. It is unclear if Apple will appeal.

The most recent patent appears to err on the more conventional side of design, proffering a contraption that combines a phone or tablet with a notebook "shell". Filed in late September of last year, the patent only recently made its way into the public record. While reminiscent of ASUS' Padfone, Apple's patent describes a somewhat different device. Essentially, it's a notebook chassis that can accept either a phone, which becomes a high-tech trackpad, or a tablet that acts as a touchscreen. The patent explains the gizmo thusly: An electronic accessory device, comprising: an operational component that provides an output to a user; a housing carrying the operational component, the housing having a recess; and a control interface coupled to the operational component and configured to receive a control signal from an electronic host device when the electronic host device is positioned within the recess and coupled to the control interface, wherein the electronic accessory device is inoperable without the electronic host device being coupled to the control interface. In case anyone is confused by how exactly said gadgets would be attached to the chassis (described as an "electronic accessory device"), here's a helpful diagram. Image: Apple / USPTO The completed computer is called a "cooperative electronic assembly" and would, in essence, act like a notebook, with the phone or tablet providing the processing grunt. However, the patent also allows for the chassis to house its own "extended functionality": In various embodiments, the electronic accessory device can be considered a "thin" device, in that it extends the functionality of another device but is inoperable by itself as a stand-alone device. As such, the accessory device can have little or no independent processing resources in the form of a CPU or similar comprehensive processor. The accessory device, however, can provide auxiliary processing resources, such a graphical processing unit, or GPU, or other processing resources that can support the functions of the portable computing device. Whether or not Apple actually puts the patent to use is up for debate, but if it was looking for a way to more tightly integrate its portable gadget and computer businesses, this is certainly one way to go about it.

Homepage Sign in / Sign up Frederic JacobsBlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Security Researcher Sep 24, 2015 Why I’m not enabling Bitcode Thoughts on application binaries packaging and software distribution At Apple’s annual WWDC developer event, the compiler infrastructure team unveiled “Bitcode” and recommended iOS developers to opt-in , even requiring it for Apple Watch applications. The Problem with fat archives Multi-architecture iOS (and OS X) executables are packaged in fat archives. The fat format (not to same as the filesystem) is quite simple: the application binaries contain headers describing the scope of the instructions for a given infrastructure. Fat headers of a binary can be looked up by running: otool -f binaryName In the following screenshot, we can see that Signal Private Messenger is compiled for the two following architectures: - armv7: ARM has CPU type 12, armv7 is CPU subtype 9. (The armv7-specific instructions start at offset 16384 and go on for the next 5306144 bytes.) - arm64: CPU type 16777228, the ARM 64-bit CPU type. 64-bit instructions start at offset 5324800 and have length of 6457600 bytes. Screenshot from running the ‘otool’ command Note: The FAT_MAGIC value `0xCAFEBABE` indicates what kind of archive it is. Different flags are defined for big/little-endian & 32/64 bit configurations. macho.h from Apple’s Open Source page As we can see, adding architectures come at a significant storage cost. Apple has regularly updated the underlying ARM processor architectures of their series A SoCs. iOS Support Matrix. Each color represents a different processor architecture. Source It is fairly common for Apple to continue delivering operating system updates for devices that are more than four years old. For instance, the iPhone 4S, released in 2011, still gets an iOS 9 update. iOS developers also build their apps to be able to run on multiple older versions of iOS and therefore have to support sometimes even more architectures. In addition, Apple has started releasing multiple iPhone models per year powered by different architectures. iPhones are not the only devices running these apps: the same binaries can be executed on iPads too. And since recently, iPhone app bundles are shipping with WatchOS binaries too. All of this results in application binaries becoming substantially larger as time goes by. Applications are built for all architectures, but only one is required on a specific device. So, why not just distribute the binary for the device’s architecture? Apple introduced exactly that with App Thinning. App Thinning Slicing is the process of creating and delivering variants of the app bundle for different target devices. A variant contains only the executable architecture and resources that are needed for the target device. You continue to develop and upload full versions of your app to iTunes Connect. Source: App Thinning — Apple Developer Documentation Slicing looks great. It not only strips away unused executable architectures, but also deals away with resources that won’t be used based on your screen resolution or size, such as images and icons. Great! Binary size growth is no more an issue, but what about new architectures? What stripped architecture should Apple serve them? That’s where Bitcode comes in. Bitcode Bitcode isn’t actually anything new. It’s been around in the LLVM project for some time now. Let’s review the compilation process. The most popular design for a traditional static compiler (like most C compilers) is the three phase design whose major components are the front end, the optimizer and the back end. The front end parses source code, checking it for errors, and builds a language-specific Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the input code. The AST is optionally converted to a new representation for optimization, and the optimizer and back end are run on the code. The optimizer is responsible for doing a broad variety of transformations to try to improve the code’s running time, such as eliminating redundant computations, and is usually more or less independent of language and target. The back end (also known as the code generator) then maps the code onto the target instruction set. In addition to making correct code, it is responsible for generating goodcode that takes advantage of unusual features of the supported architecture. Common parts of a compiler back end include instruction selection, register allocation, and instruction scheduling. LLVM three stages compilation The most important win of this classical design comes when a compiler decides to support multiple source languages or target architectures. If the compiler uses a common code representation in its optimizer, then a front end can be written for any language that can compile to it, and a back end can be written for any target that can compile from it. Source: LLVM’s Chris Lattner Intro to LLVM The front-end produces LLVM “bytecode” (LLVM Intermediate Representation) for a virtual machine, that is later optimized and mapped to native instruction sets. Bitcode is simply a bitstream of LLVM IR. With iOS 9, Apple wants developers to upload LLVM Bitcode to iTunes Connect (the App Store’s backend). Apple would then optimize the LLVM IR and generate the binaries for each platform. In practice, the LLVM Bitcode is compressed and packed into the Mach-O binary that is uploaded to iTunes. If you’re curious about how Bitcode is packed into application binaries when uploaded to the App Store, I suggest you the following article: Bitcode Demystified Few months ago Apple announced a 'new feature', called 'Bitcode'. In this article I'll try to answer the questions like…lowlevelbits.org Is LLVM-IR really platform independent? Even though the three stages compilation infrastructure appeared to be designed to be platform independent. It appears to be very different in practice. In a lengthy write-up in 2011 on the LLVM-dev mailing list, (ex-)Apple engineer Dan Gohman argued about why IR would be “a poor system for building a Platform, any system where LLVM IR would be a format in which programs are stored or transmitted for subsequent use on multiple underlying architectures”. However, there are several ways in which LLVM IR differs from actual platforms, both high-level VMs like Java or .NET and actual low-level ISAs like x86 or ARM. First, the boundaries of what capabilities LLVM provides are nebulous. LLVM IR contains:  * Explicitly Target-specific features. These aren't secret;    x86_fp80's reason for being is pretty clear.  * Target-specific ABI code. In order to interoperate with native    C ABIs, LLVM requires front-ends to emit target-specific IR.    Pretty much everyone around here has run into this.  * Implicitly Target-specific features. The most obvious examples of    these are all the different Linkage kinds. These are all basically    just gateways to features in real linkers, and real linkers vary    quite a lot. LLVM has its own IR-level Linker, but it doesn't    do all the stuff that native linkers do.  * Target-specific limitations in seemingly portable features.    How big can the alignment be on an alloca? Or a GlobalVariable?    What's the widest supported integer type? LLVM's various backends    all have different answers to questions like these. Even ignoring the fact that the quality of the backends in the LLVM source tree varies widely, the question of "What can LLVM IR do?" has numerous backend-specific facets. This can be problematic for producers as well as consumers. Second, and more fundamentally, LLVM IR is a fundamentally vague language. It has:  * Undefined Behavior. LLVM is, at its heart, a C compiler, and    Undefined Behavior is one of its cornerstones.    High-level VMs typically raise predictable exceptions when they    encounter program errors. Physical machines typically document    their behavior very extensively. LLVM is fundamentally different    from both: it presents a bunch of rules to follow and then offers    no description of what happens if you break them.    LLVM's optimizers are built on the assumption that the rules    are never broken, so when rules do get broken, the code just    goes off the rails and runs into whatever happens to be in    the way. Sometimes it crashes loudly. Sometimes it silently    corrupts data and keeps running.    There are some tools that can help locate violations of the    rules. Valgrind is a very useful tool. But they can't find    everything. There are even some kinds of undefined behavior that    I've never heard anyone even propose a method of detection for.  * Intentional vagueness. There is a strong preference for defining    LLVM IR semantics intuitively rather than formally. This is quite    practical; formalizing a language is a lot of work, it reduces    future flexibility, and it tends to draw attention to troublesome    edge cases which could otherwise be largely ignored.    I've done work to try to formalize parts of LLVM IR, and the    results have been largely fruitless. I got bogged down in    edge cases that no one is interested in fixing.  * Floating-point arithmetic is not always consistent. Some backends    don't fully implement IEEE-754 arithmetic rules even without    -ffast-math and friends, to get better performance. If you're familiar with "write once, debug everywhere" in Java, consider the situation in LLVM IR, which is fundamentally opposed to even trying to provide that level of consistency. And if you allow the optimizer to do subtarget-specific optimizations, you increase the chances that some bit of undefined behavior or vagueness will be exposed. Third, LLVM is a low level system that doesn't represent high-level abstractions natively. It forces them to be chopped up into lots of small low-level instructions.  * It makes LLVM's Interpreter really slow. The amount of work    performed by each instruction is relatively small, so the interpreter    has to execute a relatively large number of instructions to do simple    tasks, such as virtual method calls. Languages built for interpretation    do more with fewer instructions, and have lower per-instruction    overhead.  * Similarly, it makes really-fast JITing hard. LLVM is fast compared    to some other static C compilers, but it's not fast compared to    real JIT compilers. Compiling one LLVM IR level instruction at a    time can be relatively simple, ignoring the weird stuff, but this    approach generates comically bad code. Fixing this requires    recognizing patterns in groups of instructions, and then emitting    code for the patterns. This works, but it's more involved.  * Lowering high-level language features into low-level code locks    in implementation details. This is less severe in native code,    because a compiled blob is limited to a single hardware platform    as well. But a platform which advertizes architecture independence    which still has all the ABI lock-in of HLL implementation details    presents a much more frightening backwards compatibility specter.  * Apple has some LLVM IR transformations for Objective-C, however    the transformations have to reverse-engineer the high-level semantics    out of the lowered code, which is awkward. Further, they're    reasoning about high-level semantics in a way that isn't guaranteed    to be safe by LLVM IR rules alone. It works for the kinds of code    clang generates for Objective C, but it wouldn't necessarily be    correct if run on code produced by other front-ends. LLVM IR    isn't capable of representing the necessary semantics for this    unless we start embedding Objective C into it. Chris Lattner, primary author of the LLVM project and now director of the developer tools at Apple responded: I agree with almost all of the points you make, but not your conclusion. Many of the issues that you point out as problems are actually “features” that a VM like Java doesn’t provide. For example, Java doesn’t have uninitialized variables on the stack, and LLVM does. LLVM is capable of expressing the implicit zero initialization of variables that is implicit in Java, it just leaves the choice to the frontend. Many of the other issues that you raise are true, but irrelevant when compared to other VMs. For example, LLVM allows a frontend to produce code that is ABI compatible with native C ABIs. It does this by requiring the frontend to know a lot about the native C ABI. Java doesn’t permit this at all, and so LLVM having “this feature” seems like a feature over-and-above what high-level VMs provide. Similiarly, the “conditionally” supported features like large and obscurely sized integers simply don’t exist in these VMs. […] It isn’t LLVM’s fault that people want LLVM to magically solve all of C’s portability problems. It’s clear that nobody claims that LLVM IR is actually portable. Once the LLVM-IR has been generated from a specific front-end, you can’t just plug another backend and hope that your application will just work. This exchange being from 2011, has anything changed since? I compiled a simple App with Bitcode to see. You can find the AppDelegate.m and the associated LLVM-IR in the following Gist. Unsurprisingly, the IR is highly dependent on a specific target (casts, word sizes …). Bitcode will enable support for better microarchitecture support but gets nowhere close to target independence. Applications compiled for the armv7 target could still run on armv7s devices but additional optimisations make applications faster if they contain a armv7s slice. The advantage that Bitcode provides on top of app thinning is negligible in my opinion since it will only provide a slight speed up until the developer uploads a new build with the optimized slice. Security Implications Now that we know what Bitcode actually does, let’s review the security implications. Compiler Optimizations Correctness Compiler optimizations correctness is nothing new and of course it also applies to programs not distributed with Bitcode. But usually, the developer of the application has complete control on what types of optimizations will be performed and on what files these should be applied. Bitcode doesn’t provide any fine-grained control over this. Apple does not provide any documentation or sample configuration of what optimizations are applied on the LLVM-IR. It acts like a black-box, and you can’t reproduce the output locally as far as I know. Compiler optimizations correctness has been studied for a long time. A recent paper by Vijay D’Silva, Mathias Payer and Dawn Song presented at LangSec 2015, analyses optimizations from a security perspective. Here are a few examples of what could go wrong: information leaks through persistent state. A compiler optimization that manipulates security critical code may cause information about a secure computation to persist in memory thereby introducing a persistent state violation. Examples: Dead Store Elimination, Function Call Inlining, Code Motion elimination of security-relevant code due to undefined behavior The term undefined behavior refers to situation in which the behavior of a program is not specified. Language specifications deliberately underspecify the semantics of some operations for various reasons such as to allow working around hardware restrictions or to create optimization opportunities. Examples of undefined behavior in C are using an uninitialized variable, dividing by zero, or operations that trigger overflows. introduction of side channels A side channel leaks information about the state of the system. Side channel attacks allow an attacker external to the system to observe the internal state of a computation without direct access to the internal state. We say that a side channel violation occurs if optimized code is susceptible to a side channel attack but the source code is not. Examples: Common Subexpression Elimination, Strength Reduction, Peephole Optimizations All of these bugs are bad. With cryptographic implementations in mind, all of these represent important vulnerabilities. From key leakage to timing attacks via fault attacks, a lot of things can go wrong. No Inline Assembly It is quite frequent for performance or security sensitive applications to include inline assembly. Cryptographic implementations are often written directly in assembly to prevent any unwanted compiler optimizations and be able to optimize operations tailored to the algorithm’s requirements. With Bitcode, developers can’t use inline assembly anymore. It not only affects cryptographic applications, VLC media player uses inline assembly to speed up some graphical operations. Compiler trust In his 1984 Turing Award Lecture “Reflections on trusting trust”, Ken Thompson describes how compilers can be used to inject trojans. Extract from Ken Thompson’s Turing Award Lecture An interesting example of the inherent trust issue in compilers has been doing rounds recently with the detection of XcodeGhost, a modified version of Xcode that reportedly infected millions of users. It is already difficult to trust compilers. LLVM being open-source and reviewable makes it easier to trust than a blackbox. But that doesn’t entirely solve the problem since you will need a compiler binary to compile your compiler. The centralization of the building and signing process is what worries me: an adversary could find a vulnerability in the LLVM backend to obtain remote code execution on Apple’s Bitcode compilation infrastructure to inject a compiler trojan that would affect every single app on the App Store that was submitted with Bitcode. Potential for backdoor injection Compromising Apple’s infrastructure isn’t the only way to backdoor iOS apps in that setting. Since Apple is going to centralize the process of building application binaries, it will become really appealing to governments desiring to get “lawful” access to application content, circumventing any kind of encryption, no matter how strong it is. An article published today by the Washington Post explains how the Obama administration working group has been working on compelling phone manufacturers or App Store services to provide a way to insert a backdoor on the device. The second approach would exploit companies’ automatic software updates. Under a court order, the company could insert spyware onto targeted customers’ phones or tablets — essentially hacking the device. Adding backdoors to Bitcode applications becomes easier than ever. Apple has your application’s IR (easier to decompile than binary) with all the associated symbols and will recompile your app. This is not a new capability. Of course, you can ‘easily’ do it on current binaries too. But the issue is that Apple will compile your code, and you don’t get to see the resulting binary. Verifiability There is currently no easy way of verifying (save with a jailbroken iPhone) that an application on the App Store is the one you uploaded as a developer. And I’m not even talking about reproducible builds, which consist of reproducing the same binary from a given source code. The biggest pain point up to now for verifiable and reproducible builds was FairPlay, Apple’s DRM applied to applications. App Store binaries are encrypted (with a key that even the app’s developer doesn’t have). Hence, they have to be decrypted before being able to analyze with binary analysis tools such as Hopper, IDA … FairPlay encryption already made it really difficult for developers to make sure that Apple distributes the build you think they are distributing. But at least, with jailbroken iPhone, I’m currently able to get some idea of what the binary I’m distributing looks like and compare it to the one I submitted to Apple. With Bitcode builds, this becomes significantly harder. Since I can’t reproduce a target binary since I don’t know what optimizations Apple is performing on my binaries, I can’t ‘diff’ them to find possibly altered parts. I have to analyze the entire binary to figure out that nothing nasty is going on. It became so bad that some developers weren’t even able to symbolicate the crash logs of their own applications since binaries were built on the server and Apple was failing to provide the symbolication files (dSYM). Conclusions App thinning solves the binary size problem that I understand needed to be solved. The potential performance improvements during a short time period on new microarchitectures isn’t outbalancing all of the issues I cited in this post. It might be a different deal for you, but I strongly think it’s unwise for any developer who cares about security.

At the time, Apple CEO Tim Cook predictably referred to the new devices as the best handsets the company has ever created, and said that they had a "gorgeous new design". Today, the company is adding to its range with a striking new red option for the two handsets, paired with a white front on each device. The new color is the latest device to emerge from Apple's long-standing partnership with the (RED) alliance that raises funds to help combat the spread and effects of HIV/AIDS in Africa. Cook said today: Since we began working with (RED) 10 years ago, our customers have made a significant impact in fighting the spread of AIDS through the purchase of our products, from the original iPod nano (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition all the way to today’s lineup of Beats products and accessories for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. The introduction of this special edition iPhone in a gorgeous red finish is our biggest (PRODUCT)RED offering to date in celebration of our partnership with (RED), and we can’t wait to get it into customers’ hands. Apple is the largest donor to (RED)'s Global Fund, having contributed over $130 million through sales of its products, according to (RED) CEO Deborah Dugan. The new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition will be available with either 128GB or 256GB of storage, with prices starting from $749 USD. The new models are technically identical to the versions that it unveiled last year, and which remain on sale alongside the new (RED) editions. Both models will be available from March 24, and will begin shipping by the end of March to customers in the US and over 40 other markets, with other countries to follow in April. Other (PRODUCT)RED items in Apple's range include iPods, along with Beats Solo 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, the Beats Pill+ Portable Speaker, the iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case, and various accessories for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.

Republic Records estimates Drake’s latest project to have around 600 million streams worldwide. Drake’s More Life has already surpassed his previous album, Views, in the first week of its release. Apple Music told The Verge that Drake’s Views got around 250 million streams in its first week in 2016. 2 shows left.???? A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 25, 2017 at 3:15pm PDT Ed Sheeran still holds the title for the biggest first week for any album on a single service with his release of Divide, which streamed 375 million times on Spotify in its first week. Drake’s More Life did set a record for Apple. The playlist had 89.9 million streams in its first 24 hours on Apple’s streaming service, which is over 33 million streams ahead of Divide. A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 20, 2017 at 8:15pm PDT The Apple Music Team dedicated the success of More Life to the power of Beats 1 and OVO Sound Radio. Drake has shown his loyalty to Apple Music since the app launched in 2015. The rapper launched a series of exclusive songs and albums though Apple Music and on OVO Sound Radio. Drake’s co-manager, Oliver El-Khatib, hosts the More Life debut on the most recent episode, which airs on Beats 1. ???? A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 18, 2017 at 6:57pm PDT Larry Jackson, the head of Apple Music’s content, recalled how successful Drake’s releases of “Hotline Bling” and “Back To Back” were when they debuted on OVO Sound Radio in July of 2015. “It’s the biggest radio station in the world. There’s no way you’re going to find another station that has as many concurrent listeners and audience-wise as Beats 1.” The head of Beats 1, Zane Lowe, commented that Drake doesn’t rush his work and that has helped him to chill out a bit. “I mean what he’s taught me just in terms of the parameters of broadcasting is remarkable. I remember when we were first waiting for those shows to come in [OVO Sound Radio] and they’d come in 20 minutes late, and I’d be freaking out because we’d run over our start time. Now the show comes in an hour late and we’re all just like cool.” Lowe continued to say that Drake totally knew “what he’s doing” and that he definitely knew his audience. “The best thing that anyone — including myself — can do is get out of the way.” Drake is probably one of the most notable names in the music industry right now, and Lowe said the rapper is defining the era. @therealdennisg A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 20, 2017 at 7:41am PDT “If you’re going to have an era or moment where you can look back and say that the experience got better, or the music sounded better, or we shifted gears into new technology and made it work, it has to be spearheaded by the artist, always. “If you look back at any great era, it’s always one or two artists that got it, and embraced it and took it and made it their own, and that’s how they owned that era. Drake has done that, and his camp have done that, and that’s why it’s such an exciting time.” Apple Music has been successful due to the fact that they are able to capitalize on the app’s ability to debut albums live across the globe. However, More Life was actually not an Apple Music exclusive. “We didn’t have Drake’s album exclusive, but it was fantastic what worked out. “Whoever has a great idea we like to follow it and execute it. [Drake] had the idea, we kind of just built and supported around him.” MORE A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 19, 2017 at 10:53pm PDT The executives at Apple Music told The Verge that their key to success has been working with artists like Drake to ensure that the company stays ahead of the game. “These [streaming] services cannot be utilities, it’s not enough. They have to be — they almost have to make music a verb — it has to just move. And that’s what we’re trying to do.” Are you surprised that Drake’s new playlist More Life broke Apple Music’s most-streamed-in-a-24-hour-period record, despite the fact that the music release was not Apple exclusive?

It was fined heavily for avoiding taxes in China, and had to pay $318 million in a similar case in Italy. In fact, self-proclaimed 'fanboi' and British performer Stephen Fry criticized Apple heavily for the company's tax dodging as well. Now, the Cupertino giant has come under fire for diverting taxes in New Zealand. Local news publication New Zealand Herald reports that Apple sold products worth $4.2 billion NZD in the country, but failed to pay any taxes at all. It is important to note that since the operation in New Zealand is run from Australia, the company paid $37 million in income taxes to the Australian government instead. The report claims that this arrangement regarding taxes has been agreed on since at least 2007. It is worth considering that Apple is not legally obligated to pay any taxes to the authorities in New Zealand, and that many other local exporters exercise the same practice as well. However, the company has still come under fire from some political parties, as well as the public who have criticized it for not paying its share of taxes. As the New Zealand Herald estimates, had Apple reported the "same healthy profit margin in New Zealand as it did for its operations globally", it would have been liable to pay a sizeable $356 million NZD. An Apple representative responded to the backlash, saying that: Apple aims to be a force for good, and we're proud of the contributions we've made in New Zealand over the past decade, because our products and services are created, designed, and engineered in the US, that's where the vast majority of our tax is paid. While the public and political parties in New Zealand are furious over the fact that Apple has paid absolutely no tax in the country, the company has not yet been legally approached to revise the arrangement.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

But rather than find herself the target of one of the president’s sharply worded tweets, the combative Dane, who last year slapped a 13 billion-euro ($14 billion) tax order on Apple Inc., is more likely to find herself in an antitrust twilight zone because Trump, who’s vowed to put America first, has yet to appoint top-level competition officials. Margrethe Vestager Photographer: Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg Vestager told reporters last week she’s still in the dark about how many officials at the U.S. Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission she’d see during her short U.S. trip. Such meetings are a usual part of a careful co-operation between the U.S. and the EU as officials try to align deadlines for merger reviews and coordinate global cartel raids. Her visit comes months after she disregarded calls from the then President Barack Obama’s U.S. Treasury to avoid slapping Apple for its tax arrangements. While the EU and the U.S. antitrust authorities have often worked closely together, including to oppose a $28 billion oil-services merger last year, they’ve also clashed in the past on whether deals should be cleared or blocked. Nicolas Veron, a researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Europe is up against a potentially “destructive U.S. administration that’s willing to question very long standing positions of the U.S. government.” European regulators like Vestager must proceed with "extreme caution" in how to handle their opposite numbers in the U.S. Brussels ‘Hellhole’ The new U.S. administration has also undermined aspects of the trans-Atlantic relationship, with Trump having questioned the U.S. commitment to NATO, predicted other countries would follow the U.K. out of the bloc and even called Europe’s de facto capital, Brussels, a hellhole. Vestager also faces a White House that’s pledged to tear down regulations in a bid to promote more business activity. The former Danish economy minister will speak to almost 3,000 lawyers and officials at the American Bar Association, a key event in the antitrust world. She’s scheduled to speak at the event’s March 31  roundtable alongside the U.S. Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for antitrust, a position that hasn’t yet been filled. “It’s so early days that if they are confirmed by the time I get there it’s too early for us to meet,” she said on Wednesday. Her office said Friday that no meetings had yet been confirmed for her. Trump’s Pick The Justice Department’s antitrust division and the FTC, which share antitrust jurisdiction in the U.S., are both being run by temporary leaders until Trump names permanent replacements. Makan Delrahim, a former Justice Department lawyer now at the White House, is Trump’s pick to run the antitrust division, according to people familiar with the matter. Delrahim’s nomination requires Senate approval before he can step into the job. Antitrust, a policy spearheaded by the U.S. to rein in 19th century railroad and banking monopolies, is championed enthusiastically by the Brussels-based European Commission. Vestager said she works to keep markets open and to foster competition, basing her decisions on evidence and the law. This could see some conflict with a U.S. administration that is determined to favor American business over foreigners. “There are embers that are there that are glowing,” said Bill Kovacic, a professor at Georgetown Law and a former FTC Commissioner, of the EU-U.S. antitrust relationship. “There’s an unhappy recent track record of playing with fire in that area.” ‘Very Hostile’ The U.S. Treasury’s paper on the EU’s Apple case, sent by the previous administration, was “a very hostile memo. It was not so politely saying ‘you don’t know what you’re talking about, you can’t even do your own job properly,”’ he said. Aside from Apple, Vestager is spearheading a number of probes into American companies, including three at an advanced stage for Google, two for Qualcomm Inc. and one for Mastercard Inc. She’s weighing a complaint from airlines over aftermarket contracts from Boeing Co. and Airbus SE and investigating possible cartels between global banks over financial benchmarks, including in foreign exchange markets. U.S. Companies The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up The EU’s controversial investigations into tax rulings granted by European companies have overwhelmingly hit U.S. companies, with back-tax orders already issued to Apple and Starbucks Corp., with probes into Amazon.com Inc. and McDonald’s underway. EU officials argue that these tax structures are mostly used by multinationals, many of which are American, and that they are also probing two European firms. Still, Vestager seems to have avoided harsh enforcement for U.S. companies in recent months. She’s focused on fining European and Asian airlines, car-part manufacturers and car battery recyclers. The one American target under investigation that she’s moved on has been Amazon, which is working on a settlement that would allow it avoid fines. She approved a mega-merger between U.S. agricultural chemical giants Dow Chemical Co. and DuPont Co. on Monday after wresting tough concessions to overcome EU concerns that the deal could have harmed innovation. The EU had "very close contact with the case team of the Department of Justice all along to compare notes on this case," she said. Vestager insists that she’s neutral and that she doesn’t see “that the flag or the nationality of the company plays a role,” she told Bloomberg TV earlier this month. Even if the U.S. doesn’t take issue with EU antitrust enforcement, a cooling of what was once a close relationship might hold back regulators’ work. EU merger officials work closely and even rely on U.S. counterparts to examine how companies work and build cases on how a deal might be harmful. The EU’s handful of people working the Halliburton Co.-Baker Hughes Inc. merger probe was outnumbered by nearly two dozen U.S. officials. EU regulators "very much appreciate the concrete cooperation we have on a case-by-case basis" with the U.S. and "work very closely with U.S. teams on mergers," Vestager said in the interview. "That working relationship is very precious to us." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

BEIJING: A Chinese court has ruled in favor of Apple in design patent disputes between the Cupertino, California company and a domestic phone-maker, overturning a ban on selling iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones in China, Xinhua news agency reported. Last May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple’s Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office’s ban to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili’s design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua. In a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones. Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board’s decision. It is unclear if Apple will appeal.

On Thursday, the streaming music service mostly known as a place to hear podcasts and remixes from unknown DJs confirmed that it had taken $US70 ($92) million in debt funding — basically a loan from various investors — in order to stay in business. It's never a good sign when venture-backed companies have to raise money from debt financing groups, because it indicates that traditional investors don't have much hope for the company. This appears to be the case for SoundCloud, as TechCrunch reports that the debt funding was raised because the company couldn't close a $US100 ($131) million round of funding. Back in February, when SoundCloud released its 2015 financial information, we found out that the company had lost $US55 ($72) million for the year and was at the risk of running out of cash. Yet, while having an extra $US70 ($92) million is certainly helpful, it's probably not going to be enough to save SoundCloud from the fate of Rdio, Grooveshark, MOG and other failed music streaming services. In fact, looking at the landscape, streaming services in general are kind of screwed. The payment model for streaming music services makes it very difficult for companies to actually make money. In addition to infrastructure costs, payroll and marketing, music licensing fees paid to the labels mean that the profit margin for subscription streaming is often negative. Profitability, even for the biggest players, is still largely a pipe dream. As a result, it's a game where only services with a lot of funding and a lot of users (Spotify), or a lot of backing by a parent company and a lot of users (Apple Music), are relatively safe. At least for now. But who is the most screwed? Who is just sort of screwed? Who has the best shot at surviving? Here is a ranking of streaming music companies, ranked from most to least screwed. Most screwed 1. PonoMusic PonoMusic technically isn't a streaming service, but we included it on the list because it's just so very stuffed. You may recall that Neil Young's terrible Pono Player had an accompanying online store from which Pono owners could buy high resolution music. Hilariously, that store didn't even get Young's May 2016 single (it was a Tidal exclusive), which was a very bad sign for the future of both the service and player. In July, the company announced that the PonoMusic store would be going "offline" as it switched to a new source for its content. But more than eight months later, the store is still offline. In fact, Pono hasn't tweeted since January and the music player doesn't appear to be for sale on its website. If PonoMusic ever makes an actual comeback, we will be shocked. 2. SoundCloud Poor SoundCloud. The service has raised an enormous amount of money — $US320 ($420) million since 2009, according to Crunchbase — and the product is good. It's also known as a launching ground for indie artists before they make it big (Chance the Rapper, Lorde are famous alums) and it's been platform to which aspiring DJs could upload their tracks. But the reality is that SoundCloud can't compete against its bigger, better-funded rivals. The fact that it couldn't close a funding round and had to raise debt instead speaks volumes. Moreover, SoundCloud Go, its premium product, hasn't exactly pulled in paying users — in fact, the company had to launch a dumbed-down, cheaper version last month. Here's a bet: Within 12 months, Spotify or Google is going to buy SoundCloud. 3. Tidal Tidal has basically been a disaster since Jay-Z relaunched it back in 2015. In just two years, the company has gone through multiple CEOs, faced lawsuits from customers and employees and was reportedly late with payments to some of its indie labels. Even Jay-Z feels like he was ripped off! Tidal might last a bit longer, but eventually, Jay-Z will probably get tired of investing money in a service no one cares about and give up the ghost. 4. Napster/Rhapsody You didn't misread that. Napster — or at least its brand name — is still around. Of course, the only thing that remains of the original peer-to-peer music app is the logo — everything else is actually just Rhapsody, one of the very first streaming music services. (The two merged back in 2011.) In many ways, the Spotifys and Apple Musics of the world owe a huge debt to Rhapsody/Napster. Rhapsody was the first subscription service that licensed streaming music from all of the major label groups. But being early isn't always a good thing, and the company has struggled over the years. As of 2015, it had just 3.5 million paying subscribers. We're more and more amazed that Napster/Rhapsody is still alive with every year that passes. 5. Pandora Pandora is in a heap of trouble — take note of its depressing financial results and recent layoffs — but unlike most of the other stand-alone music services, it's also a public company. More importantly, Pandora has users. Pandora's free product has about 81 million monthly active users, which makes it one of the most popular services around. The problem, however, is that those users aren't making the company any money. It's pinning a lot of its hopes to its new Pandora Premium service, but early reviews say that it has nothing to offer over Spotify or Apple Music. If its stock plummets far enough, Pandora could be a great takeover target. Medium screwed 6. Deezer Deezer isn't very popular in the US, but the service has more than six million users across the globe. The company planned a French IPO back in 2015, but ended up cancelling it, citing "market conditions" — that's code for "Pandora is tanking and we're afraid our share price will be bad" — but still managed to raise another $US109 ($143) million in January 2016. It's hard to say what the future of Deezer is, but the company hasn't made any layoffs, so that's an OK sign. 7. Groove Music Microsoft's music service isn't exactly a focal point for the company. (In fact, we forgot it existed until we started writing this story.) And that's why it's medium-level screwed. On the one hand, Groove Music has Microsoft's very pliant coffers to keep it up and running. On the other hand, if Microsoft decides it's bored of doing its own streaming service (as Sony did back in 2015), it could wind up nuking the service. 8. iTunes Music Store Technically, iTunes isn't a streaming service, but its importance in the digital music space earns it a place on this list. For nearly a decade, iTunes was the most popular place to buy digital music. But times are changing. In January, Nielsen reported that in 2016, music streaming overtook digital music downloads for the first time. That means that iTunes's revenues are declining, and that's bad for the traditional iTunes Music Store. The good news is that Apple has an alternative for iTunes waiting in the wings: Apple Music. Last May, music industry analyst Mark Mulligan predicted that Apple Music revenue would overtake iTunes Music Store revenue by 2020, at which point Apple might consider turning off the old download store. Within a few years, the iTunes Music store will probably be stuffed, but for now, it's still the most popular way to buy music. Least screwed 9. Google Play Music Google Play Music isn't as popular as the other major streaming players, but the fact that it's backed by Google gives it a good shot at survival. Google Play Music is actually a few things: It's part iTunes (you can buy songs); part iTunes Match (you can upload songs you downloaded elsewhere for access anywhere); and part Apple Music. As a bonus, anyone who subscribes to Google Play Music also gets a YouTube Red subscription, and vice versa. For $US10 ($13) a month, that's a lot of streaming music and ad-free YouTube content. 10. iHeartRadio iHeartRadio is run by iHeartMedia (the company formerly known as Clear Channel Communications), and thus has a huge tie-in with most of the nation's largest radio stations. iHeartRadio might not have cachet of Spotify, but with 100 million registered users in the US, it has a lot of ears. Moreover, because its owner is the biggest player in the terrestrial radio business, it doesn't have the same financial issues as Slacker or Pandora. iHeartRadio might not be cool, but it's also not screwed. 11. Spotify Make no mistake: Spotify has some very real business problems. For one, it can't make money, though some investors insist it might find profitability this year. For another, musicians and labels don't all love the service. And the longer it delays its IPO, the more money it owes some of its investors. None of that is great. But the reality is that Spotify is far and away the biggest streaming service globally — both paid and free — on the planet, with more than 50 million paying users. Moreover, even though labels and artists often decry how much Spotify pays them, only the biggest artists can actually afford to not be on the service. Post-IPO, Spotify could be screwed, but for now, it's the definition of too big to fail. 12. Apple Music Let's be honest: Apple Music will probably never outpace Spotify in number of subscribers. Spotify had at least a four-year head start, and it has a free product that can get people hooked. But that doesn't matter. In less than two years, Apple Music has managed to attract more than 20 million paying subscribers, something no company on this list (save Spotify) can even fathom reaching. Plus, Apple Music is backed by the richest corporation in the world. And as stated above, in the future, Apple Music will likely be the iTunes Music Store's replacement. As revenue for the iTunes Music Store declines, Apple is going to do everything in its power to make Apple Music make up the difference. Ones we've already lost Rdio: Rdio was acquired by Pandora in 2015 and was the basis for the new Pandora Premium. A lot of us really loved Rdio, but in the end, its death was entirely predictable. Grooveshark: Who knew a business model built entirely on intellectual property theft wouldn't work? (Not even OG Napster was as brazen as Grooveshark.) The service, which was awesome for music fans — if not great for musicians — was wonderful, but it was sued out of existence back in 2015. Beats Music: Beats Music launched in January 2014, and as music services go, it was pretty rad. Then Apple bought Beats in May of 2014 for $US3 ($4) billion. It ended up using the underpinnings of Beats Music for Apple Music, which was launched in 2015. MOG: Beats Music might be Apple Music's precursor, but Beats Musics' precursor was MOG. For a brief moment, it looked like MOG could make a name for itself (it was available in the US before Spotify and offered a similar service), but it couldn't compete and was sold to Beats for just $US12 ($16) million in 2012. Songza: Songza was never that popular, but its curated playlists made it a favourite for many music lovers. Google acquired the service in 2014 and shut it down at the beginning of 2016. Fortunately, most of Songza's best features are now integrated into Google Play Music. Last.fm (for streaming): Last.fm used to be a great way to stream music, but its owner, CBS, shut down that feature in 2014. The scrobbling service — the Last.fm term for making a record of every song a person listens to — still exists. Milk Music: Samsung tried to enter the streaming music space in 2014 with the bizarrely named Milk Music. But the service curdled and ultimately shut down in September 2016. GhostTunes: Country superstar Garth Brooks famously hates digital music, including iTunes. Still, even Brooks had to recognise that even the most ardent Chris Gaines fans are annoyed by CDs. In 2014, Brooks launched GhostTunes, his own shitty version of iTunes. Amazingly, the service managed to exist until Amazon bought it (and the digital rights to Brooks' catalogue) in October 2016. Sony Music Unlimited: Sony used to have its own subscription streaming service. Sony Music Unlimited launched in the US in early 2011, just a few months before Spotify's stateside debut, but never managed to gain a lot of users. Sony conceded defeat in early 2015, ditching its own program for a Spotify-backed service. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments MartyH @martyh Mar 26, 2017, 11:58am Oh great. I love SoundCloud and have subscriptions to Tidal and Pandora. One of the best things about streaming is when there is a social element. When people are discussing the music and making comments. I also have a subscription to Google Play Music, but there's none of that there. Pandora is, step by step, shutting away its social/comments section and SoundCloud put it in a dark corner long ago. The buzz around the services has been removed. The place for that now is YouTube, with all its faults. It seems that they don't recognise the aspects that draw people in, like a physical crowd of people around something interesting. Added to that the cardboard sound quality (they actually remove the treble from the music to save bandwidth - I turn up the treble in the equaliser but it's only a partial fix) and the appeal fades for these services. The large music library is all that's left.

I was surprised however that guvera isn't in the list. This one was closed in the US and Australia in 2016 (despite being an Australian company). They have decided to focus on emerging markets such as India & Indonesia. iHeartRadio is also gaining popularity here and locally it is backed by ARN (Australian Radio Network) & Fairfax. That one is relatively safe as commercial terrestrial radio realises it's future is in apps. Fortunately they have also been smart enough to make an unmetering deal with one of our biggest carriers, instantly taking away the deterrent of data use from using online radio. Reply 2 lee @lee Mar 26, 2017, 1:06pm So if I'm reading this right, traditional online music stores like iTunes are in peril because of streaming music services, and streaming services are in peril because they can't make money? Reply 2 ad_mechx_pwa @ad_mechx_pwa Mar 26, 2017, 3:26pm the problem is that everyone knows what happens without these services... people just download it. Music piracy has been slashed in the last 10 years because of these services. Something will likely have to change with streaming services to keep going. Probably a price hike. Reply 0 jjcoolaus @jjcoolaus Mar 27, 2017, 8:46am I doubt that will happen as Google, Spotify and Apple battle it out. Apple & Google in particular want to keep their users in their own ecosystem, as what you listen to provides so much in the way of analytics about you as a person, once advertisers harness that information making profits won't be much of a drama. Reply 0 robb @robb Mar 26, 2017, 3:47pm I think it was more: - traditional online music stores like iTunes are in peril because of streaming music services - and all but the major/profitable streaming services are in peril because they can't make money Reply 0 lee @lee Mar 26, 2017, 3:58pm But none of the music streaming services seem to be profitable? I suspect what will happen is people will be lured to streaming services because of the affordable pricing and vast catalogue, causing the traditional purchase of music to become unpopular and eventually unviable. Over time, the price of streaming music services will rise to the point where people are wondering why they're renting their music rather than buying. Reply 2 soldant @soldant Mar 26, 2017, 9:12pm Exactly. Paying $12 a month for all the music you like, versus people buying single tracks at $2.49 or whatever... that's a big difference in terms of average spend per person per track (depending on how often someone buys music). It's great for discouraging piracy, but if you're a mega label with manufactured pop stars chasing green, that's a big cut to your income. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Mar 27, 2017, 9:31am Streaming services pay on the same principle that radio stations do. The sad thing is the reason radio stations never cut into song purchases was because they weren't on-demand. The whole arrangement relied on the fact that radio was inconvenient. Now there are much more convenient 'radio stations', it's becoming clear that in most cases people don't actually want to 'own' songs, they just want to be able to listen to them when they feel like it. There's still a market for buying albums and people who do it, it's just smaller now that people aren't forced into it to have the convenience of song choice. Reply 0 chrisco1 @chrisco1 Mar 27, 2017, 10:08am I see streaming as advertisement for the artist. That way they get off their arse and go on tour and make money from their live shows.. Long gone are the days you can release an album and sit back in your mansion watching the money roll in, you'll have to keep working for it like the rest of us ;). Reply 0 MotorMouth @motormouth Mar 27, 2017, 3:42pm Sorry to burst your bubble, but that doesn't work for 90% or more artists. My band, for example, will be playing at a big festival in Germany in June. We'll be paid 800 euros for the opportunity, which is pretty decent money, except we've already spent more than four grand on airfares, van hire and accommodation. We've played that festival before so we know we'll be lucky if we sell $50 worth of merchandise, so we've made the decision not to bring any this time and save on unaccompanied baggage. We spent four months trying to organise other shows around the festival with zero luck, despite the fact that our current album was No. 1 on the German Alternative Charts for two weeks last year and it and our singles spent more than three months in total in the charts. Touring works for the likes of Justin Bieber and Adele but for most of us, it's something we do because we love it and we're prepared to lose thousands of dollars for the privilege. Reply 0 djbear @djbear Mar 27, 2017, 5:59pm You have to admit though, without streaming people would just pirate your products. Streaming service all but wiped out music piracy.

For the approx five months between when I started using it and it being shut down in February last year, I really liked it, the best app I've used yet for making suggestions for music I hadn't heard but would like. I've tried Spotify and Apple Music but with YouTube Red to sweeten the deal, I'm now using Google Play. Reply 0 neiln @neiln Mar 27, 2017, 2:44pm No mention of Guvera. Not surprising really. Some things are best forgotten. But MixRadio was awesome. Reply 0 delta @delta Mar 28, 2017, 2:28pm All these streaming services above will be dwarfed when Facebook launches their streaming service which is reportedly in the planning stages, they already have 1.9bn monthly active users, so God help all of them including Spotify. I personally prefer to own my music from itunes, don't want to rely on a streaming service keeping it's doors open to access my music. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Search Reviews iPhone Android How To Reviews iPhone How To Auto About Best Best Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone 7 Cases Best Budget Apps Things Apple Watch Can Do Best Alexa Skills Android Galaxy S7 Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Cases Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Deals Best Galaxy S7 Battery Cases Best Galaxy S7 Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Cases Deals Best Android Smartphones Under $200 [2017] Best Cheap Android Smartphones [2017] iPhone vs Android: 14 Reasons iPhone is Better Josh Smith01/27/2017 We’ll explain 15 reasons the iPhone is better than Android with a 2017 iPhone vs Android comparison that includes the newest iPhones and Android devices as well as Android 7.0 and iOS 10. The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus may not deliver super screen resolutions, but they hit the right notes for many buyers and with iOS 10 there are even more reasons the iPhone is better than Android for many users. iPhone competition includes the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, One Plus 3, the LG V20 and other phones that deliver a bigger challenge for Apple — but there are still places where the iPhone is clearly better than Android and iOS 10 is better than Android Nougat. Many of these could change with the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 later this year, but for now – iPhone has an edge. You need to learn what the iPhone does better and how Apple delivers a better experience than Android to see if an iPhone is the best smartphone for you in 2017. Here are 15 reasons the iPhone is better than Android phones in 2017. Use our list of reasons the iPhone is better than Android to figure out which new smartphone you should buy this year. Read our iPhone 7 review to learn what sets this phone apart from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. You can buy the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus at a discount with the best iPhone 7 Black Friday deals. Read: Siri Tips & Tricks Even if you think you know which phone is best, you might be surprised to learn about all the reasons the iPhone is better than Android. iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking Most of the popular apps are on both platforms, but many top games and apps still come to iPhone first. We’re seeing more apps come to both Android and iPhone at the same time, but there are still way more iPhone only apps that we see than Android only. When apps are available on iPhone and Android we still often see a better design on the iPhone version than on Android. This is something that still rings true in 2017. For example, we still see some new Snapchat features and Spotify features come to iPhone before Android. iPhone owners are enjoying Super Mario Run, but the Super Mario Run Android app is still on the way. Read: Best iPhone Apps Apps are an area where the gap is closing, but the differences still exist and are noticeable. We also see Apple take better care of the App Store. Recently they purged 47,300 apps from the app store that were simply bad or abandoned. Fast iPhone Updates for All iPhone owners enjoy quick and regular iOS updates for the iPhone no matter what carrier they use. Faster updates are available for all iPhone owners. Android updates take months to arrive on all the devices. After an Android device is 18 months old, you may need to wait for a new Android smartphone to get the latest software. Apple delivers iPhone updates to devices that are three years old. Apple offers iPhone 4s iOS 9 support. It is unheard of to see support for an Android phone that old. iOS 10 is available for the iPhone 5. When you look at Android devices support ends much faster. Google promises at least two years for Nexus devices, which means Nexus 6 support ends this fall and the Nexus 6P in September 2017. Google may push farther out, but it is not a guarantee. Other Android device manufacturers don’t typically match the longevity of iOS updates. On top of the added update support, Apple does not allow carriers to hold up the updates. As soon as the update is available from Apple it is available on every carrier. If you really want Android Nougat, you may need to simply buy a new Android phone. Works Great with All Your Devices If you own an iPhone, iPad and Mac your information flows smoothly from one device to the other. You can quickly sync photos to all of your devices, answer a phone call on your iPad or Mac and send text messages from your other devices. There is also support for Handoff that allows you to start a task on your iPhone and continue on your iPad or Mac. The iPhone works great with the iPad and Mac. Overall the connectivity between these devices is something Android doesn’t yet match without relying on a collection of third-party applications and services to hodgepodge together a similar feature. Sharing a file from your iPhone to your Mac is also faster and easier thanks to AirDrop. This built-in service sends the file wirelessly directly to the Mac, even when there is no other WiFi around. Continue to Next Page. 1 2 3 4 280 Responses 05/27/2015 Dave Reply Your article is good but the major and best reason to buy an iPhone over anything else is because it’s an APPLE. You simply can’t go wrong. I own an iPhone 5, iPad Mini 3, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Apple TV. I would not even consider anything else, especially something from that “G…” company which I abhor. I won’t even use their search engine. Same goes for anything from that software manufacturer that, well, just call it “MS). Try calling any other manufacturer for support and see if you can understand what they are saying. I suppose I am bias toward Apple but after nearly 30 years of dealing with computers of all sorts I guess my opinion is warranted. 07/17/2015 gabe Reply why people like iphones? I never understood why anyone would like to give control to another company of what you do with their device. why force u to follow MEDIA SHARING and digital rights media? you cannot torrent on iPhone, nor transfer music and videos without ITunes or a paid online service in iOS. I hate that Samsung s6 tried copying apple iPhone. no microsd slot and integrated battery. CMOn! 04/06/2016 Sai Reply You ever used apple ? 07/05/2016 greentoe Reply http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 02/27/2017 david Reply yea 03/04/2017 Evie Reply It is simply the portability. I have watch ,I go to the gym. I have apple computer and I can receive my phone calls there and iMessages. It crashes less often than microsoft does. I can contact apple support, whenever I want. The other time ,the bluetooth in my iPhone did not work, I contacted tech support midnight and they were available. We could not fix the problem. They called me the next day and told me to go to the nearest store and pick up a brand new phone. One more thing, my iPhone was out of warranty for 165 days. They told me they cared about customer satisfaction. When I called microsoft in order to talk to me they wanted $250. Now, compare 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply You’re literally so idiotic that you can’t spell the full name of a company. Only Apple, cuz you’re an I sheep. You can go very wrong. If people were smart these days, they would understand that iPhones are unequivocally not the right choice for them. You wouldn’t recommend anything else, because it is too limited and unintelligent to use anything else. Stop trying to influence other people to buy garbage phones and devices 05/12/2016 Nancy Reply Why are u being a hypocrite calling someone idiotic for not knowing how to spell the company name right when some of ur sentences don’t even make sense. Apple doesn’t have any competition be used it is the best phone to get. 07/13/2016 Rona Reply First of all, don’t criticize someone for calling someone else idiotic when you can’t even use proper spelling or grammar. Second, Apple is all marketing. There is nothing special about it. Android offers phones that have expandable memory (and guess who doesn’t?) and better high-speed data services. iPhones die extremely quickly, you can’t use iTunes on any other devices, whereas Android platforms are available on all devices, the picture quality on an iPhone is pathetic compared to Androids, and Apple products are majorly behind in technology. The latest update for an iPhone came out two years ago for an Android. Apple has a set array of things it can do, and you can’t customize or change that. But if you want a high-end technology phone, choose an Android. It does so much more and you can customize and change its features. I have had both an iPhone and an Android phone. 09/14/2016 Abhishek well,mam i am an android user and i would like to say that iphones are the best because when you buy an android first it will give you good performance but after one month it will start hanging and work slow and that is same with every android devices.and their are so many android malware which also affect performance. Iphones are the best, secure and stable. 09/15/2016 Me Stay butthurt, loser ; ) 12/04/2016 jgames “nothing special about it” fastest phone ever 3d touch very good camera looks very nice “nothing special about it” why do we need expandable memory on iOS? gime a few reasons for that. “better high-speed data” give me your source for all this information. iphones die extremely quickly? how? do you even have an iphone? iphones have much better standby and screen on time with heavy usage than android. you cant use itunes on other devices, yes, but ios wants to keep it ios exclusive because their services are one of the major selling points for them. android platforms are available everywhere, but google software is usually preferred to ios software. pathetic picture quality? wut? iphone pictures wont lose quality when you zoom in and support much more colors than any old android camera. android cameras are very nice as well, though. “apple are behind in technology” a lot of people say this but it’s actually quite the opposite. 3d touch was very innovative, its like a ‘right click’ for your phone. the latest iphone update did not come out 2 years ago. you seem like you have no idea what you’re talking about and just spouting nonsense. apple can do a lot of things without customization, but what customization do we really need? people always saying android is more customizable but never give examples, and when they do its “homescreen.” moving home screen icons around is a pretty useless feature tbh android isnt more high end tech than iphone and i dont see how much more it does. you havent even explained how it can in your comment. so please use common sense before spouting nonsense 02/27/2017 Gage iPhones are by far the better phone. I’ve had android phones for most of my life but i bought an iPhone 6 about a year ago and now I have the 7 and I can’t imagine going back. Android is slow, every button you push there’s a lag before it actually opens the app or whatever you pushed. Also, every android I’ve ever had has had terrible battery life, it never lasts the full day but my iPhone almost always does. And my last point, android automatically installs like 10-20 on your phone that you cannot delete no matter how hard you try. Apple has 3-5. Yes, android has a port for SD cards, but what good is that if a large amount of your memory is made up of apps you don’t want. You’re entitled to your opinion but I advise that you get yourself an iPhone 7 and keep an open mind. I’m fairly certain you realize how much better it is 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Not very nice. Also, Apple is just as good as Android, theres aspects that one company has over the other, and vice versa, so the best thing to do is just to test out both and find your favorite and use it because Android and Apple’s problems and advantages weigh out each other so it really just matters which one you like the most so just use the one u like and stop arguing. 08/19/2016 Zane Reis Reply I prefer Android because of the coustomization it has to offer. I prefer to be able to change change almost every aspect about my phone and making it the way “I” like it, not the way Apple likes it. I like the coustomization while others find it chaotic, confusing, and would rather it be (in their eyes) simpler. 05/26/2016 Billy Reply Says the one who has Zombie Knight as their username. 07/18/2016 Nate Pauley Reply That’s an interesting rather stupid mindset to have and it makes me reflect on the time I had those same views. It took me 6 years as an android user to eventually realise how inferior it is to iOS. Android is plagued with fragmentation, so much that not even customisation can save it. There should be a term that describes blindsided android followers, if there is one then I’d like to know it. iOS is solid, stable, secure and much more better looking than android – Apple pays exquisite attention to the finer details and they will continuously improve on the irritating nooks and crannies so many people mention in the comments. The best part is APPLE USERS CAN ACTUALLY BE A PART of the firmware updates and have assurance in a better OS experience overtime. I’ve had my S6 for a year and I’ve only managed to have one firmware update that took 7 months to deliver. I can only give credit to android for the premium android devices such as my S6, until then the physicality of a device alone cannot make me shift in the near future. I want a solid experience, not a hollow one. 08/02/2016 Adarsh Reply Hi, Your comparison of iphone with S7 is not right because in case of iphone both hardware and software are developed by Apple and in case of S7 developer of hardware is Samsung and developer of software is Google. I use Nexus 5 phone, hardware and software both developed by Google and manufactured by LG and ipad Air2 by Apple. Both devices update periodically whenever updates are released and I am happy with both. 09/15/2016 Me Reply LOL stay laughably buthurt/beyond tasteless loser Fandroid X ) 03/02/2017 xxLoser123xx Reply Wow you know how to use a Thesaurus. 03/06/2017 Sally Fallis Reply Wow! I AM impressed! You know about the Thesaurus!! I didn’t think anyone under 50 ever heard of it anymore! 12/17/2015 Noah Reply This comment, as well as this article are laughable at best. Coming from a person who owns all major Apple products but frequently bounces back and forth in the smartphone department, I don’t see how any of these actually make the iPhone “better” than android. I would say the only point that is valid is the support Apple has from app developers. It’s pretty easy to see that apps on the iPhone can be “prettier” than apps on android with the extra animations, and quick gestures. However even that is relative, since iOS gives you security and “pretty animations” but gives of freedom and functionality in the process. I still can’t tell you which phone is better, as that all is personal preference and I really don’t care which phone is “better”. I just want a phone that does what I want it to do without too many hiccups (which is why I’ll never buy another Samsung device). For now, I’d say in terms of productivity, the iPhone is great if you are a person who needs iMessage, FaceTime, and the Apple ecosystem to feel comfortable doing work. While I believe most android phones will get work DONE. With the amount of third party apps available to you on the play store, multi window, Google now on tap, and other gestures. I have always felt an android is phone is more a workhorse while the iPhone is king of simplicity. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Congrats, you just wasted about 5-15 minutes of your time typing out this article because its not going to convince anyone. Just stick to the one you like best and live life. 05/25/2016 Blake Kersey Reply And what makes you think he gives a f$&# what you think?? 05/30/2016 hello Reply Unless you’re a billionaire you cannot stick to the pone that you wanto 07/30/2016 Avalanche Tsunami Reply Dude, he also has a “Android vs iPhone: 15 Reasons Android is Better” article too. So, he’s not being biased. http://www.gottabemobile.com/2016/05/26/android-vs-iphone-2016-android-better/ 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Just because he has another article doesn’t mean this one’s biased 01/30/2017 Selenia Thank you for that. This article and many commenters made me want to vomit thinking he was so biased and the sheep just followed along. I can give numerous reasons Android is a better OS, but that is not the point. However, some Android devices suck. Most of the detractors comments are true of stock Samsung devices. Samsung may be the most popular, but far from the best. They make pretty good hardware, but the software begs for rooting and custom ROMS. I am typing from a Nexus 6P, which is pure Android. Google does good with monthly updates, too. But I am using Pure Nexus, the best reason for owning a Nexus/Pixel device, with ElementalX kernel for out of this world stability, smoothness, flexibility, and battery life. Unless I use hotspot(tunneled over VPN), I only have to charge every 2 days under pretty heavy use. PN is actually updated more than Google’s stock and usually delivers security updates within a day of release, which is faster than Google often rolls it out to most users. 01/06/2016 Leo Keys Reply Why would someone else go with a product by Google, NVidia (I will come back to them), or Microsoft; over that “A…” Company (Repeat)? The reason people would use nVidia over the AMD (god I hate AMD’s Products) GPU’s found in Mac products? They want a more powerful GPU. Apple says that their “PC’s” are better and use top-notch products. Why don’t they use the GeForce GTX 980m in the MacBook Pro? Why don’t they use Quadro cards over FirePro cards? Because Apple doesn’t know anything about Graphics. As for iMac’s I have no clue why some use an i5. Apple products thermal throttle a lot. Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs. It is also much more free to do what ever you want. But, because your an iSheep, you can’t process facts that favor the other side of the grass. Guess your life must be happy, getting råpēd by Apple, every year and paying thousands on eye candy. Why use Google or Bing over Yahoo? Yahoo sucks, that’s why. Face the fact that Yahoo and other search engines are inferior to Google. Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls (Starbucks and that stuff). 01/06/2016 Pedro Coimbra Reply Now you have to bring the Nvidia/ATI war? What, the iphone/android isn’t enough for you? Dude AMD cards are equally powerful, no matter how much you “hate them”. Why Apple chose AMD? Maybe prices, power consumption, price/performance ratio, easier to adapt to their hardware, who knows? But a company such as Apple (you can write the complete name, it won’t bite you) so adept at optimization doesn’t make these decisions lightly, they HAVE a reason, one that you *don’t know*, but that’s irrelevant. About the i5, a reason for the apparent lower specs must be because of how streamlined and optimized the OS is, instead of being made to work with zillions of combinations of brands, boards, peripherals. So what you want in hardware to cope with the software, was made achieved with the fat-free software. «Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs», well I guess any system is secure with the right Antivirus programs, isn’t it? but never 100%. How about a system that doesn’t need antivirus, just a little inteligence from it’s user? Android safe… yes, keep dreaming, it’s not as the net isn’t filled with cases of security holes and breaches of android. If you reply to my I advise you right now to not bringing ATI/Nvidia stupid nerdish arguments or sheep mentality, about mobile platforms and geekinesses like that, because I simply don’t have the patience. P.s: «Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls» ….

Very sad….. 10/06/2016 Alon Reply Amazing, almost all whats written in the article is wrong. More apps with faster updates??? How can it be if 85 percent of the market is Android, and it much more easier to write an app to Android? It’s not making any sense and wrong. Also other things like sharing things and integration compared to Apple products only. Almost every line in this article is not right. 12/12/2016 Cjros Reply LOL, thank you for making me 100℅ sure that Android is way better than newest IOS. Your arguments are so poor and naive :). The only thing youve got right is the SD expansion, but it is not any issue at all :). Thank you, my hero :) 12/15/2016 Debapriyo Reply You are so dangerously biased towards Apple that some of your words make so sense and are outright stupid. I have no problems with you choosing an apple product but lol. You don’t use Google search engine? Then you are missing out. Their search engine is still the best and most reliable and miles ahead of other search engine options. Google Maps way better than Apple Maps. Every tiny feature Apple introduces in the new version of IOS, Google had it in android 2 years back. I myself love some Apple products and appreciate the high standards of quality they incorporate in their products but please don’t even compare Apple with Google. Apple just makes iphones, macbook and some fancy toys. Google makes much much more and is the spearhead of IT innovation today. Be a fanboy but don’t be an idiot. 03/22/2017 ComputerGeek Reply you’re weird 06/23/2015 Chris H Reply Some of these reasons for being better than Android phones are oxymoronic. An extended warranty and readily available Apple Stores suggest that the iPhone is prone to bugs and damage. I will stick with my G3 because I know if I drop it it won’t shatter and I won’t have to give more money to Apple either for a case and/or a screen fix. There is a reason there aren’t Android stores out there. Because their phones don’t nearly have as many issues in my opinion. Consider Chevrolet and Honda. The Honda will last and is just as nice if not nicer than the Chevy, which will not last nearly as long and will force loyal customers to buy yet another Chevy. 07/27/2016 eiendiaies your_ufo Reply I would love to hear your comment now about your G3. Android stores are not because android companies dont give a f.ck about costumers, they just improve SPECS SPECS AND SPECS but where is NO improving quality. Why for example iphone 12 megapixel camera can beat sony xperia 23 megapixel camera, why iphone 1500 mah battery last longer than lg 3000mah, why fingerprint on iphone works much better than samsungs? And whats a practical difference between 640p vs 2k smartphone screen? Damn the real sheeps dont understand what apple cares about costumers and they stay at same screen resolutions because they just dont need to improve screens, android companies just keep adding numbers on specs. But where is quality improvment? You say iphone works better because of lower resolution screens, but than why androids keep improving resolutions but forget about older android users? I am ex samsung and LG user, rubbish costumer services, if android die than i must wait couple weeks for replacment, if somethin happen with iphone i know where is apple store and dealing with them in same day. Price stays high for iphone for a real reason. Iphone is not about SPECS, its about quality in every aspect. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply The issue with iPhones that I hated was that the only way you could fix any glitch that would inevitably crop up is by factory resetting the phone each and every time. It’s such an annoying and time consuming process having to set everything back up again. When I made the switch to Android I was really impressed by how stable and self contained it was. Whenever there was a glitch it was limited to that particular app and you could simply reinstall it and it’d be fixed. I’ve never encountered any systemwide issues such as the iPhone misc storage bug that would happen to me all the time with the 6s. Apple does a great job hiding all of its glitches by simply not providing any prompts. Apps just disappear when they crash. It’s terrible. I know a lot of people with the misc storage bug to this day and don’t know it. They just think they’re out of space all the time because they need a new phone.. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply I lol’d at how much superior the author thought the lightning cable was because it was reversible. You have a fifty fifty chance at it if you do it blindly but most cables have a dimple on top to make sure you get it even time. It’s the most versatile cable, it’s simple, affordable and it just works.

Some of these were acceptable reasons, but most were not. My wife is using an iPhone 6, and I have the Galaxy S6 edge. We both agree that my phone is far superior in terms of speed and screen resolution, but her camera, even being spec-deficient to my Android, seems as good as, or even better somehow. I like your point on the updates all rolling out at once, but almost every other “point” you made about iPhone being better boils down to one thing: lots of your friends have iPhones. That’s it. That’s the selling point, and the basis of this article. “iPhone apps look better.” – That’s completely relative. Lots of apps do look better, but they generally are paid apps that are free in the Play Store. “Works for all your devices” – So what? I thought this was a phone article. Android works with all your crap too. “No Carrier bundled apps” – I dont know how that’s a selling point, but okay, you win. Bloatware is an issue on android. “Sharing to other iPhones”/”Better resell” – Your friends all have them, so you should too. Then you can sell them to other friends who have older ones and make more money. Ridiculous. Yeah, you get a few more bucks for them, so that means you should have an inferior phone? Who buys a phone because of resale value? Preposterous. “Lightning cable is miles better” – My S6 charges from nothing to 40% in 10 minutes. iPhone can’t do that. I understand that the cable may be good, but “miles better” is a stretch. “Apple Stores” – So? I don’t even understand how this is a point in your article. Go to best buy, it’s the same crap. “Touch ID”/”Headphone controls” – Those both work flawlessly on a good number of high end android devices as well. “iMessage, Facetime, blah blah” / “Share apps easily” – All your friends have these, so you should too, or they’ll laugh at you. “Siri works better than Google Now” – Google Now isn’t Siri. That shouldn’t be a comparison. It’s not trying to be Siri. It’s a voice search, and that’s it. Siri works, but it doesnt work “better” than anything else, because there’s nothing to compare it to. If you like having Siri, good. “Notifications are better” – No, they’re not. Android’s notifications work exactly the same. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying iPhone isn’t better, I’m just saying you haven’t proven that it is here in the slightest. Both OS’s are very well made, and the playing field is far more level than any avid IOS or Android user wants to admit. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply Excellent comment. I totally agree with you. 08/07/2015 Sam Reply DONT throw away your s6 edge… get an iphone but if you can use them interchangeably 07/15/2016 quenchybro Reply lol hi sam 10/09/2015 Palbo Reply I disagree. Bloatware is not really a problem on Android; any respectable company will only install commonly used and necessary apps like the Play Store and Gmail. If you are buying a phone that will leave your wallet intact (and still deliver better specs in every single measurable way than an iPhone 6, such as the lenovo k3 note) from a less known company which may allow bloatware, you can easily root the phone and uninstall it. I do agree with your other points, though! 05/27/2016 ZENCKPRI Reply Phinfankid you are completely right. I agree with everything you said. You are probably the only logical person who has commented so far. Also the iPhones storage is just a scam to keep people paying and buying more storage. Unfortunately the Samsung Galaxy s6 also removed the microsd slot, but luckily Samsung got it sh*t together with the Samsung s7, which in my opinion is the best phone. 07/12/2016 10beasts Reply You really explained the situation very well! Loved it. 07/09/2015 D Reply This article compares Apples to apples. Your references to Android are focused towards Samsung (you know the company that makes the screen, processor, RAM, and ROM in most Apple devices). Compared to a more vanilla Android experience, Apple blows. My $200 Zenfone 2 is better than any fruity phone at a third of the cost. With Apple, you pay more for less, but get a pointless logo. 07/10/2015 Scott Reply What about Apples different charger cords? Droids micro USB cords work with any other Android device. In fact, pretty much all phones but apple use it. They want you to need to buy new chargers more often. Apples are streamlined fads also, just like every product they’ve ever released. Yeah, cause being “cool” means getting the same more expensive products all the other rich kids got. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply I had both and I don’t agree with this article. I prefer Android phones over Iphones. I think Apple have better computers, but not better cell phones. 03/06/2016 Firas Bajjar Reply Keep dreaming…. 03/06/2016 Firas Reply Keep dreaming….Apple has better computers you serious? You can do a lot of stuff on Windows pcs while Mac struggles to do one stuff….At least it’s stable and easy to use through…But seriously it’s overpriced shit…You can get almost awesome gaming laptops for the price of a MacBook Air. In fact, iPhone is better than android….Because the mobile era is another thing, it’s called mobile for a reason. It should be easy to use and quick. That’s why Apple wins at this point…Come on get real men you wanna play GTA V on your mobile? No for sure. Apps are even better (which surprises me why it isn’t the same for a Mac vs Windows) iPhone’s are faster than most android phones….But if you compare it to stock original android phones, the iPhone still beats them but not as much as other android phones. Because unfourtantely Google didn’t know how to configure Linux properly but i bet you if it does…The iOS faster than android is a history….Linux is ultra-powerful and that’s why most of the world super computers use it…Because you can tweak it the way you like and you will get an extremely faster performance than Windows and Mac. But Google couldn’t handle it I guess….Even the Java language is much faster in terms of processing but I’m still surpsised why iOS apps are still faster….It’s just another replica of Nokia’s fault with Symbian (Nokia never built a stable Eco system for it until it’s near to death period, which led the CEO to get rid of Symbian because it takes years to built an eco system) 05/19/2016 PABLO Reply Right off the bat i can tell you are a little kid who just bought a samsung and is butt hurt you made the wrong choice, “struggles to do one stuff” he also pays great attention in class shown by how grammatically correct this is (as i was writing this I found this… “The iOS faster than android is a history” WHO TEACHES THIS KID I NEED TO COMPLAIN)! 08/04/2015 Robin Reply Poorly written article bringing in irrelevant points and downright false information. Take your “works great with all your devices” section for an example. I use an android phone and an apple computer, and the two devices are 100% compatible with no need for a “third-party application” or service. Completely untrue information in this section. Also I have texts and all the regular online messaging apps I use from both devices well synced. All data, photos, contacts, music, etc from my phone are stored in a cloud service and attainable through my mac computer and my (android) phone. Also your first section “iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking” contradicts itself. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply My iPhones have NEVER worked great with my PC laptop. NEVER. And the people in the store aren’t much help either. I’ve wasted hours in there. So I don’t know who the person who wrote this article talked to, but my experience has been awful with compatibility between iPhone and PC. In fact, it’s the main reason I’ll never buy another iPhone. 08/10/2015 Malin Saming Reply Really? Here are 10 reasons you have apples for brains: Android is free, Google drive storage is FREE. 15 gig of files, unlimited photos! Androids voice recognition is WAY better, try a comparison, Siri is like a nagging wife who can’t get it right. Android phones have wireless charging! Android phones built in payment that works everywhere. Not at 3% of stores like Apple payment. Android phone MULTITASK, thats right you can run a dozen apps at the same time while talking. Android phones have sizable widgets, so you have live streaming info on your home screen. Android phones are available in endless formats, not like the communist way “everyone has the same”. Android phones PLAY ALL FILES, iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple. Android phones have rapid charging, 10 min = 4 hours of use. Android phones are available with 2 days of battery. I could go on and on but your Apple brain will not listen anyways. You probably have a really nice typewriter that you show off the lack of it needing toner or electricity. There is a reason Android is about 82% of the market and Apple has fallen from 33 to about 12%… In fact the remaining iphone users I know all run Google everything on their iphone anyways, why not get the best hardware too. I look at everything I can and see things for how they are, then I buy the best I can find, if you do the same you will love your new Galaxy S6 8^ ) 12/13/2015 Pedro Coimbra Reply I tried, but stop reading after the «iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple.» Just this BS of a sentence already has 2 lies in it.

Honestly, these are more like 15 reasons why an iPhone user should switch to android as soon as possible. Most testify to the fact that Apple product users are chained together under the apple tree, sustaining themselves on apples only. On top of that they are forced to watch android user eat happily from all the trees in the garden, even apples trees, even inventing fruits of their own. 01/25/2016 Real mofo Reply Your clearly insane 09/03/2015 Lodosa Reply Ja wybrałbym androida: http://logoff.pl/ios/wybralbym-androida-a-nie-ponownie-iphone/ 09/03/2015 GoToHell Reply One of the worst article I ever read. And childish comparison . 09/16/2015 Srikanth Reply I can say something here because I own and use both iPhone 6 Plus and a Samusng Galaxy S6 edge equally everyday. So I think I am in a position to give a fair judgement …or at least decide what works better for me. I have changed over from iPhone as my default device to S6 edge and back to iPhone few times. But I find myself using iPhone 6 Plus more often than S6 Edge…because of these reasons 1. Smartphone is smart because of quality apps. I always found iOS apps looking neater, working smoother and more consistent compared to Android Apps. Just to quote an example…Adobe acrobat reader which i made default app to open PDF files….is not able to open files since last two days all of a sudden and reporting error. Everything is updated but still doesn’t work somehow. But works fine with iOS. 2. Screen of iPhone is marginally inferior to my S6 edge which is stunning. But I don’t hold them near my nose and try noticing pixels. From a practical point of view iPhone screen is absolutely fine. 3. In spite of inferior hardware specs on paper, I can’t deny iPhone user interface is more fluid and smooth. Thats what makes the experience more pleasant for me. 4. iPhone 6s is already launched…I am not upgrading. But know what? Last night iOS9 update was available to my phone. I have already updated to same. Isn’t that amazing? I can’t help comparing my Galaxy note 4, my near stock android Motorola droid turbo.. etc..which haven’t received even 5.1.1 Lollipop when Android Marshmallow is about to be launched in a month. Sad. This alone is enough for me to stick to iPhone as my default device. 5. I havent noticed parallels for some Apps in Android (Drafts, Soulver etc). Which I learnt to use often and liked. I am a fan of some automation apps like Tasker on android which doesnt have an iOS equivalent. But as of now my use of same is less. 6. I guess iOS is bit more secure compared to android against virus attacks and hacking. it IS something important to me in this era of mobile banking and when we keep so much data on Google drive and One Note etc. and hey…Google has made most of its apps available to iOS. I agree my S6 edge is superior in Camera department and pictures look very good. Also usage of widgets is better in android. But after using both OS since last 3-4 years, I am sticking with iPhone as my default and S6 edge for miscellany and photos. This is what works for me. I know others have other reasons to stick to any one OS. I have best of both worlds now but can’t help saying one is better than other at present. 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Updates are an invalid point, because the newest version of iOS isn’t as good as a 2 three year old version of Android 12/02/2015 Srikantha Krishna Reply I don’t agree with you there. Updates are important. They optimise the software, remove bugs and important to plug security issues. Of course Google releases them but only nexus customers get it. Other manufacturers don’t release it in time. Tell me now how many handsets are going to get Marshmallow and when???? 04/25/2016 Sally Fallis Reply So which is less complicated for the over-50 me who is good with words but not pictures? I had to ask a young person what all those little dots and waves, etc., meant on my Ipod Touch. I really miss words, but I realize I am alone in that. Is a Samsung any easier to navigate for (duhhh…) me? 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply If you are over 50 you should definitely stick with Apple 1. it is extremely easy to use 2. you can do many tasks without even doing anything, but simply telling your phone to wake you up at 5am, or to remind you to take your pills when you get home 3. you can change the text size and icon size to accommodate your eye-sight 4. you can ask any teenager to help you organize the icons into more intuitive way Microsoft Windows phones are rich on words, but while it would satisfy your need for everything being written – the phone will be difficult to use, and will still contain many icons. So, go with Apple, even an older 16GB model, will still be fully supported, and will work perfectly well, do not get 64GB version, you wont need all that memory. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply but apple is expensive 08/25/2016 ermm Reply with android it is much easier to use… you can tell your phone to set and alarm….you can change the text size 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Android is an absurd ecosystem, the UI is very hard to even remember, iOS is better due to the simplicity of the UI. OP was right about iPhones being easy, I use one because android is hard to use. Maybe you should get an iPhone, it’s 5x faster than every android phone in the world and you’ll get a good one on eBay for like $200! Why do you think Google is better on iOS than on android. lel, Android is a joke OS and should be defunct! 10/15/2015 Andras Reply I´ve been an iPhone user for 2 years, recently I bought an Android phone to verify if really Android is superior… After 2 months of testing it, I sell the Android and bought an iPhone 6… This do not prove that iPhone is better, but for my needs, iPhone is totally superior… Android is good, everything is cheap but is not an stable OS… Yes you can have all personalize, but for what? I´m not a teenager anymore so whats the point to have all personalized and change it every week? By the way the output of the sound of the iPhone is really more superior than the output of any Android phone With an iPhone (in music business) is way better you can control lights, console really simple with iPhone and all tech for music is much more easy to sync and to handled on an iPhone… Music business in a MAC is much much easier I love iPhone and I would not change it anymore Like I said I´m not saying iPhone is better for everyone but for my needs yes it is 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Wow! You’re actually dumber than every other I sheep here. IPhone has good sound? Better than any Android? Hahahahahahaha! Have you even seen an HTC One phone? Best speakers and any phone! Ever. IPhone speaker is tinny garbage. The S6 even has the same placement, but sounds much better. Seriously, Google HTC One m8 or m9. Cm8 literally got the top phone of 2014, and everyone mention how good the speakers work. I also got first place cuz it was vastly superior to any iPhone. Better software, better design, better screen, etc 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply And please specify what Android phone it was. Otherwise I’ll assume you’re lying because there are so many and you can’t name one. Or you got a cheaper old one. Android high end phones are very stable. Look it up. They’re way more stable than iOS 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Signed, someone who has never used Viper4Android. Seriously, I can’t stomach the sound output of very many phones without it. Only a few Androids that have nice customized audio processing(like the LG V20) and no iPhones or Windows phones. Many of the rest of Androids can use this superior sound mod. I have a Nexus 6P with Pure Nexus and ElementalX kernel, which has nice front firing speakers, better than iPhones. V4A gives audio processing to match.

I carried the Z10 now carry the Passport with BB10. I only have it because my company prefers BB’s security. But as far as fuctionality, it’s like working with bear skins and stone knives compared to iPhone or Android. The lack of apps and limited integration with other devices is stifling. That’s why I carry a separate personal phone. It’s also why BB is abandoning BB10 and switching to an Android platform. So are you going to cast off your somewhat acceptable friends who carry BlackBerry when their platform becomes Android? They better run out and get an iPhone when that happens so they can still be honored to be deemed worthy of your friendship. 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply 1. Android they switch to is FULLY custom and has all google services BLOCKED 2. This is the reason why companies are abandoning BlackBerry due to high maintenance costs and instead make private applications for iPhones which you can only download using a special code, a secure application within a secure platform, cheaper to maintain, more convenient for an employee to use. I completely agree with Bob, Androids are for 12 year olds and vagrants, the paper specs of Androids (factually and historically) are not an indicator of how they perform. And the fact that you think that you are smarter than a mass of hard working high ranking professionals, and that you need to show them all how “individual” you are by always “personalizing” your phone – just shows you are a fool and have nothing to do but to play with yourself on your phone like a kid, I bet you are one of those people who thinks wearing a watch is stupid and unmanly because you have a clock on your phone. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply ur insulting me cos im twelve so dont try piggy 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply You guys keep proving how Apple markets to ignorant people with a credit card. Reason many companies don’t use Android is because of the differences in OS customization from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer. That can be a nightmare for testing in house apps. Nothing to do with security. My company uses Android tablets, but all the same kind. Only point you are right about is specs don’t reflect performance. Nexus/Pixel devices have good specs, not the best, but just try finding a faster Android or iPhone, for that matter. Why?

LOSER! 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply This article is so immature and stupid. Seriously, apps look better? You couldn’t even come up with a better reason?? I can literally break this article point by point. I would just like to say one thing though as a rebuttal, A NEXUS too receives the ota updates. An iPhone 64gb on contract costs almost the same as a carrier free nexus. I am a galaxy s7 user and the screen quality is maybe 2 generations over the iphone. As for the notifications, I prefer android’s iteration way more than apples. And about the cables, except the s7, all flagships use USB type c Samsung compensates with wireless charging. The battery life on a nexus or an s7 edge is way superior than the iPhone. And hangout video quality is as good as facetious. Also I like the fact that you don’t need to get out of hangouts to make a video call. In iphone you can usee iMessage but then to make a video call you need to get out and go to facetime. I get to play with manual controls on my camera which iphone doesn’t permit. I can literally go all day long about this. Just one actual good point about iphone you could have mentioned instead of the trash is that it has a stronger graphic processor that but by a small margin. 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply One more thing. You mentioned sharing. Do you feel ashamed that you cannot share media via Bluetooth?? The most basic mode of sharing? Talking about airdrop please use wifi direct once. Or nfc sharing. 03/28/2016 Stanata Reply Basically what this article is saying is: “use iPhone instead of Android – it’s more easy to use if you’re an idiot!”… lol There isn’t even one reason of those in the article that is 100% true… and almost all of them are complete crap! I mean come on – even monkey can plug MicroUSB and it is “a must” standard in Europa for instance anyway. Let alone that the future is in the wireless charging… And who today is NOT using Viber or WhatsApp? Who needs another messenger? I can continue, but don’t see point in that – the articles like this is obviously paid one. But sooner or later it will be clear at the end – the open environment will always be above the close one, because it is more close to the people! Cheers! 03/29/2016 Dark Penguin Reply I’m not sure I get why the headphones are supposed to be a distinctive selling point. My GS5 came with headphones that offer the same control options.

Anyway I started to use this and found out in dismay that I have to have all products to live . Windows used to crash if I connect my iPhone…….it does not like it.

Then the account with and once you are inside the prisoners you are under arrest until proven innocent. Luckily the Sony Z1 appeared and decided to get one.

It’s a Huawei, nice BIG screen I guess they call a Phablet. My younger son has an iPhone 6 plus. I decided to try an iPhone 5s just to see what it’s like. I have 30 days to check it out. So far, the ONLY thing see is the slow motion camera that’s cool and maybe some cuter emogies …I think they’re called. Otherwise….. I’m so far not impressed. My Huawei Android is 16g the iPhone 5s is 16g. The Huawei was I think $200 and the 5s $160 with its VERY tiny screen. My son has a 6 plus and 64g and that would cost me $650 or maybe it’s $650 for the6 plus 16g. Anyway…. Lots MORE MONEY. I guess if you have a lot of music… It’s better but I just have Lots of pictures. I like my sd card for these. I don’t know all the techy stuff and I don’t do Twitter or FaceTime or sharing pics except Facebook and text. I thought maybe some apps would be cooler but so far… I’m not impressed with the iPhone at all. Just my opinion. 04/12/2016 D Dawg Reply smoke weed everyday 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply wtf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 04/19/2016 J Corn Reply I knew this article was a joke when his very first reason is “Snapchat looks prettier on iPhone”. And you’re listing reasons why apple is different, not better. 04/21/2016 Anujay Singh Reply Apple optimises the iPhone’s hardware and software. The iOS Is custom built for and iPhone but the android softwares are not built for any particular device or hardware so optimisation is nog as good as in an Apple device. It not about specs the camera which shas more megapixels cannot alone deliver better pictures , a processor with more cores and greater clock speed can not alone give better performence until it utilises the most of it. So as Apple builds it products to its own requirements and deliver better products than android phones. An iPhone has better quality of internals as well as the body and feels premium than its competitors so that’s why an iPhone is an iPhone. 04/26/2016 De'Zsa Smith Reply Currently on my iPhone 6s+, sobbing as I type this. I’ve just got through longingly browsing Google’s Playstore, seeing all the recent updates of my favorite apps and hidden gems that the Apple Store just cannot compete with. Android has some seriously dedicated developers, and I’ve always admired them and even began looking into Android app development. That is… Until I switched over to iPhone several months ago after being a dedicated Android user. I will always be Team Android, hands down. I had a rooted Nexus 5, which means I’m all about customizability, design, testing, flexibility, and freedom. Then I decided I wanted to try something new—FaceTime, great camera, updated social apps like snapchat…you know, the basics. Biggest. Mistake. Ever. Switching over to Apple feels like I’m using a flip phone. Now I’m trying to decide if I should just switch back, or keep this iPhone as a means of communication (don’t know if I’m willing to give up FaceTime with family and friends) and have an Android for all the things I miss. 04/27/2016 weez Reply I just giggle at these articles. Ok Iphone kids, my phone has a webhost, tftp server, a windows deploy share with every iteration of windows going back to w2000, an SMB client, FTP client and host, Tftp server, wi-fi signal scanner, packet sniffer(nmap), a high frequency oscilloscope, a bluetooth HID remote that controls anything bluetooth, a linux/android debugger, point of sale and inventory tracking software(apple has it too but not complete on the phone), and at will I can change my MAC and spoof other phone’s IDs. My phone is a half decade old S2. So I guess if you plan on propping up a desk buy an Iphone, for everyone else that has work to do either grab a toolkit full of different things or just grab your android phone. 04/28/2016 Ken McDowell (@morpheusxp) Reply I don’t understand why it is all Android users say that iPhone users are sheep and that they use an iPhone because everyone else uses an iPhone. The iPhone has less than 20% market share world wide. That means less than 1 in 5 smartphone users have an iPhone. It seems to me going with the herd is more of an Android thing than an iOS thing. Just saying… 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply I think it is more because a lot of iPhone users seem cultic. I honestly think iPhone is a high quality product. But I really like high end Androids as well. However, I know people who use only Apple products and make little comments here and there about how inferior ALL Androids are. In that way I think they are like sheep because they have bought into this notion that their are no good Androids and they are operating on a higher plan than non-iPhone users. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Agreed. Probably because in the beginning people lined up outside of stores to get the latest and greatest iphone. It’s great hardware, but I can’t get used to a single button. Plus iphones seem to have a higher resale value. I don’t know. I do like how apple updates their devices in a timely manner and no bloatware, etc. I think Android is getting there, but unless it’s a nexus, updates are all over the place. I want the screen of a Samsung, build of an HTC with the battery life of my droid turbo, a headphone jack at the bottom of the phone instead of the top and I would be in heaven. Plus everyone I know say is that a Galaxy? So people in my area associate anything android as a Galaxy. Great marketing by Sammy, but perception becomes reality sometimes. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Meant to say plane, not plan. ☺ 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Yup, it is about the Apple cult and the attitude that you are unwashed and not worthy if you use an Android. The attitude you must be broke, homeless, etc. My Android costs as much as a lower range current iPhone and can do way more. Here in the US, they have much greater market share, unfortunately. 04/28/2016 Joe Reply iphone has nothing on android. They have a good camera but that is about it. isheep all butthurt because android is taking over the world. 04/30/2016 qwertypop13 Reply So far all my favourite android apps were not available on ios, plus a lot of apps are a minimum of 10 cent cheaper on gpl than on apple app store. I also find it totally ridiculous that iphones need to be jailbroken to undergo any form of customization. Plus who wants fast updates at the expense of severe bugs, them slowing down stuff even more and getting a crappy operating system that hasnt changed since 5 years. Iphones are for people that only use their phones to txt and make calls. ps. I have a $20 alcatel phone and wouldnt ever trade it for an iphone. Buy what you like, but the points on this website are the worst I have ever seen. As far as I know you cant even use iphones to transfer files other than audio and photos to and from macs/pc’s. Apple phones are overpriced by like $500 dollars just because they have a flashy logo which they stole from the beatles. 05/05/2016 anthony Reply I love my android devices. Have I had problems. Yes. More than my wife’s iphone? Definitely. But I tinker with it a lot more than her iphone. I transfer files back and forth from a computer a lot easier with my device. Yes using third party apps but it’s still easier. I have all my music in google play, but use itunes (whole family uses ipods) so I just sync up that to google music and playlists as well. Each device has it’s pros and cons. I have used a rooted tablet to get pure android (didn’t like it) and have an ipad 2 which I love. It’s about choice and I like that we have it. Two points I agree with the author about: Timely updates and bloatware. HTC is bucking the trend to stay afloat by addressing this. Wireless charging is not worth it yet. I much prefer quick charging and new devices starting to roll out with usb-c. 05/07/2016 C Reply The article and ensuing comments are a joke. This is what The internet has come to now days. Let me be clear, I have years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux. I have every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you. Now that we have established my far superior ability to actually comment here goes. First of all, the people on this blog and on others like it simply cannot help the fact that more people love iphone than android, period. So they make nasty little comments because they are frustrated that in reality they couldnt influence people in high school and they aren’t able to now. Second the android users who get angry at Apple users simply appear to only be mad because they don’t have an iphone them selves. Guys! Really! Let me be clear I have Windows and android and iOS. Iphone for the nomal every day user is PERFECT! Let them be! The android is perfect for more shady people who want to be power users an anarchists or some how feel like they are breaking the law or the rules. That is how android feels and that’s the base line of the os. I currently have an android because I can be one of those more shady people who like to go against the grain. But I don’t like android. Who the he’ll wants to root a phone? Who wants to spend hours on doing something? Not I! It takes me 10 minutes to jail break an Apple as and BAM I’m a super users with a linux based system and am sitting with a very powerful device! They all being said I have an android bc of expandable memory, an IR blaster, and a few other small features. When Apple steps up the game with these I will switch to Apple. Here is one reason why. What is a smart device? It is an item created to make your life as a human eaiser. Apple does that by leaps and bounds! The phone thinks of you like a loyal old dog and wants to do nothing more than serve your every whim. I can tell you the iphone holds up better, know why? Ever had to fix your mom or dads PC? And you think to your self wth are they doing with this thing. We never hear that issue out of iphone. So really is a beast just for that reason alone simply bc the general population can break them by doing stupid stuff. Now on to adress some other stupid comments for people who pretend they are SO smart. Windows is better than a Mac ios! Hum WRONG! Know why? Windows is a dos based crap system with a gui created for the average consumer to use a device. It’s not a damn computer it’s a pretty device to help you numb skulls use paint and word or get on the internet. What is my point now!! Oh yet MAC IOS is FAR superior at least for anyone who actually knows how to use Linux which by the way was and still is the base os on which all other smart software was and still is created. So you pretty little Windows fanboy users, please get a grip because until you stop drooling over your poster size photo of Bill gates and actually learn Linux you know nothing about computing. The really dumb person who commented about Honda’s vs Chevys! Hahaha seriously though? You also probably know nothing right? Honda and GM use the exact same part manufactures which in turn makes both cars CRAP! Research before you comment. Go get what ever phone you want and fanboys of each need to get a grip! 05/29/2016 C Reply Just to clarify a few things for the “people who pretend they re SO smart” Windows has been detached from DOS since windows 2000, It maintains compatibility by running an DOS virtual machine on the NT Kernel. Not all systems are based on Linux, Linux is based on Unix, Mac OS (and IOS) is largely based on BSD which is a variant of UNIX, The Windows Micro-kernel is also partly based on UNIX. For someone who has “years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux.” and “every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you” you are spreading a lot of misinformation. I personally own all apple products, but have and still use the other platforms, They all have their advantages and downfalls. And although I use a Mac, Ipad and Iphone predominantly I still have moments of frustration when I miss windows, android and linux for one reason or another. 05/29/2016 CC Reply Not the same “C” as above btw 05/18/2016 Nikhil Bansal Reply Great Information.

Also, how can you say apple doesn’t come with bloatware? Have you tried removing the stocks app recently? What about file sharing, have you never heard of Android Beam? Or the fact almost every flagship has a fingerprint scanner now? This is the most poorly written, one sided piece of crap I’ve seen in a long time. How do you even have a job? P.s. I own a Nexus 6p for private use and iPhone 6s Plus for work and they’re pretty much equal in every way except for the Nexus having a better screen, free apps, faster charging and longer battery life. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply +1 lol 06/03/2016 alpharidley9098 Reply This article made me laugh pretty hard. I just love the reasons they give for the phone being better. Now 1 thing that is always MORE important than ALL of these is the actual phone. Also, those apps that come with the phone, it depends on what you are getting… Also, you do know apple is making a switch to MicroUSB right? Humph. Seems like just in this 1 paragraph I have already made better points than this article. Anyways, phone-wise, androids are almost always more powerful than an apple phone because of the fact that iPhones are never equip with a good core or a good amount of RAM. They slow down quite quickly and seem obsolete after a few months. Yes. Months. I have had my Moto G3 for awhile and it is still ultra fast and has no technical issues. 06/03/2016 Jens Lipponer Reply problem with iphones is that u need itunes etc.. and too many permissions.

It seems obvious to me. At least Android screens don’t break when you drop the phone on carpet like iPhone’s do. There’s Applecare because the iPhones break like a window hit by a baseball because the whole phone is either thin aluminum or covered in glass (which is a hazard if the glass shards cut you and potentially make you bleed out). The aluminum iPhone’s are currently being made of bend in your pocket! They’ll need some high quality flexible glass and easily bent straight CPU (without anything on the inside being destroyed). By the way, for the vibration thing on Android you don’t have to input password or anything just click the power button and hold down the turn down volume button for a second or two and that’s it. 06/10/2016 Shaggy C Reply So your reasoning is half “It’s popular” and most the other half is comparing apple features to the bad features of a multitude of android phones?

It could be called Android or robot or Apple or peaches or dog poo. All I care about is having a good phone that can do the most. Phones are expensive. I’m not buying a brand name. I’m looking to buy something that has everything it could possibly have if I’m going to spend that kind of money. You’re “reasons” show good things about IPhone, but are not “reasons” as to why it’s better. IPhones are good phones. People like IPhones because it’s a trend. It’s popular. That’s it. IPhones are not even close to androids. Be truthful. Androids are mini-computers. Literally. IPhone is not. You can do 100 more things with Android that you cannot do with IPhone. The That is the truth. And Apple products are a lot more expensive. Why would anyone pay more for a phone that gives you less? It boggles my mind. Android has variety. There are many, many phones, companies, styles to choose from. They even offer cheaper options that get the job done. They have an SD card slot. Why would anyone dish out $100’s more for more storage? That SD card is yours forever. For future phones or other devices. You can plug your phone into your computer and save(on the phone or SD card) anything (music, photo’s, video’s, contacts) and it’s yours. Without having to go through ITunes or anything else. Apple doesn’t own my stuff. I own it. And I can customize anything I own. There are IPhone stores for these little nick knacks. Transferring files, contacts, etc. It’s like going to a car dealership. One side has a variety of great cars. The other side has one car that is the most expensive. You see that all the other cars have a ton of features, options, colors to choose from, engines, horse power, cylinders, 2-door, 4-door, SUV’s etc. You ask “what’s so great about this lonely more expensive car tht only comes in one model and doesn’t have these other options?” The saleman replies with “Because it’s popular”. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply Yes, this! I agree 100%. 07/04/2016 Emanuel Reply No some of these staments are wrong android has a mode that will change you load out to make it simpler and look like apple cameras so much better its not even comparable iphones are rhe same every year android is some thing different like the edge and note you clearly didnt do your research i use to love iphone and thought it was the best and galaxy/android suchs but when i swiched ill never go back to an apple phone 07/05/2016 greentoe Reply http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 07/05/2016 Sam Smith Reply I just smell a whole lot of fanboying and bias. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply I’m astonished at some of the reasons listed why iPhone is supposedly better. I have two iPhones now, a 5 and a 6, that I can’t get my photos off of onto my PC laptop. I’ve gone into the Crapple store more than three times and still haven’t gotten them off. My idea of HELL is the Crapple store! I hate that place. There’s hardly room to stand and then you end up being sat at a table waiting with a bunch of other frustrated people waiting for a tech to help you. Of course this is after you make an appointment, or in my case last time, two appointments. I don’t see that as a plus at all because not only is going there a royal pain in the ass, but then they don’t even offer much help after several hours. My iPhone does not recognize as a drive when I plug it into my PC. It used to, and then stopped. I don’t want to have to use iTunes to transfer photos or music. I want to just plug it in and have it be a drive and copy whatever files I like back and forth. It does not work; and I’ve spent, literally, hours trying to get it to function that way. I also have a pretty complex DSLR camera and yet it is still easy as can be to transfer the photos from the memory card onto the computer. So why can’t a supposedly user-friendly phone just do the same thing? I seriously hate my iPhone 6 so much I wanted to shoot it, except I discovered it’s worth a good bit of money still so I’ll sell it on ebay. 07/09/2016 Joey Reply A lot of childish responses from android fans here. I gave the nexus 6p and try for 2 months after my old iPhone broke. Hardware was great, but I found on this android phone the app integration and interoperability to be no where near as good as an iPhone. Apple is just better when it comes to form and function. Buy an android if you want to tweak it forever and play in a sandbox, buy and iPhone if you need a productive phone. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply Your comment may not be childish but it is not correct. Comparable Android phones have far better form and function. Take the iPhone 6s plus verses a Note 5 or s7 Edge. The Apple is bigger and heavier yet packs has a smaller or same sized screen as the Samsung’s’ yet has far less features. Both these phones are far more productive, can multi-task properly, be fully customized and allow widgets on lock and home screens for speed, convenience and ease of use. The Note even includes a stylus or pencil. Great compact design, fully featured and greater functionality (Android) vs Heavy outdated bloated hardware with mid-range specs and limited functionality (IOS). Not to forget the limited compatibility of iPhones and lack of choice! 07/10/2016 Chris Reply There are facts, then there are opinions. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply This article is a disgrace, misleading at best. Most of the reasons are just not true or highly debatable. 07/12/2016 Benito Paul Reply congratulation all of u commented on weather iphone or android’s is the best In my point of view it may be any phone that is android or iphone. If we had a phone that should meet our requirements.Requirements means each and every people has different requirements in case of security,memory capacity and so and so. Hence apple or iphone buy any thing because all are vanity, “vanity of vanities” 07/14/2016 aileen Reply I’m someone who switched from android to ios but this article is utter bullshit. Yes, I love my iPhone and i’m so glad I switched by my samsung galaxy 4 was nothing but shit lately but these arguments in the article are dumb as hell. Lightning is better than micro usb? excuse me, what? my iphone takes ages to charge (iphone 6) whereas my s4 charged within an hour. i don’t see how that makes micro usb bad. but well my iphone battery lasts over a day and my old phone could have never. sharing location isn’t hard on android since almost everyone uses whatsapp bc imessage doesn’t exist on android and whatsapp has a location sharing option so that argument was dumb. yes, apps do look prettier on ios but i don’t see how only that would be a reason to switch?? this article clearly comes from someone who has only owned apple devices and doesn’t even know what they’re talking about, if you really want to prove a point you need to ask someone who has used BOTH of the things you’re trying to compare otverwise you’re just gonna embarass yourself. just saying. 07/20/2016 KappaPride Reply Why are you guys even arguing about this? 07/24/2016 George Reply The major advantage iOS has over Android is that Apple designs the phone and software. Whereas for Android (open source) other manufacturers have to play with it to get it to work and sometimes it’s not fluid. Take the Nexus phones for example…they just work like the iphones. No bloatware..nothing (like the iphone). Majority of my friends have iPhones and sometimes I wish I did too because of MMS (iMessage). I used both and I hate that i have to use itune for everything but it is what it is I guess. 07/24/2016 Landry Reply I’m 8 years experimented developer for iOs devices and I say that Apple releases so frequent updates because iOs is just a stone age OS to fool iOs users that Apple works seriously behind their products. It must run to compete Android OS. 07/27/2016 Aza Reply Best to have both. I have an Se and G4 best of both worlds 07/30/2016 Bob Reply So many things piss me off in this article but specifically stood out Notifications I have no idea with this author is saying he obviously hasn’t seen an android phone, they are exactly the same. Lightning vs. Micro-USB Micro-USB usually charges everything from headphones, to power banks, and of course cell phones. And multiple times to insert it is an absurd comment, after about a week you’ll probably memorize which way it goes, and how do you insert it incorrectly more than once. And USB type-C is just starting to come to the mainstream that’s why it’s not on everything. Storage Why do people even buy the 128 GB version, not to get apps but to download media like pictures, videos, music, etc. I agree with the statement about how sd cards are treated but there’s a much more simple solution, buy a larger storage option. Sharing purchased content Sign into the play store with the account that originally bought the content, install it, then sign out. Problem solved, and if anyone says “it’s more convenient” think about how often you might actually purchase something that costs actual money, I’ll bet it’s probably less than once a week. And it doesn’t take long to sign in and then back out 08/14/2016 Adso Rossi Reply I love iPhones. They always have nice designs and I like the simple interface. I have been itching to get an SE with its smaller dimensions (I like small phones). Money is not a problem to me but as much as I really want one I will stick with my Android device. Why? Cause the compatibility of iPhones to Windows pcs are real bad or none. You’d say “get a Mac” but I can’t: too many programs I need that unfortunately are only Windows-available. If this one single point of compatibility would be addressed, the iPhone becoming as compatible as Androids, I would get that iPhone SE in a heartbeat! 08/21/2016 nathanlittles plays minecraft Reply Who the hell needs iPhone I can name 100 reasons why Android is better but I’ll just name 20 1. Freedom 2. Apk 3. More sizes 4. More colours 5. Waterproof phones 6. Big and small tablets instead of the HUGE iPad 7. Clear cache option 8. For apps and also all the app store apps 9. No need for jailbreak but if you root you’re device will have no restrictions :D 10. Notification swipe 11. Google now 12. Google maps instead of the crappy apple maps 13. Multiple users feature 14. SD card storage So you don’t run out of storage easily like on the 16 gig iPhones (128GB or even 256GB) 15. Pattern unlock 16. There’s everything on Google play store even GPS spoofers to do the Pokémon go spoof in like 2 seconds 17. Unknown sources option 18. No need for an apple I’d all you need is a Google account which is way easier to set up and use 19. Get apps that are not out in your country easier (Pokémon go) 20. Android sounds better then apple 08/22/2016 Jim Reply This article made me so angry I must go punch a kitten. It’s an interesting psychological phenomenon, our emotional ties to brand loyalty. It’s as if the device we choose to use says something about who we are as people, and there is some ancient war of two types of people being waged through our genetics. Apple users are like Yankee fans, Android users are the goth kid outsiders. And the war rages on. 08/30/2016 Deleau Clément Reply Hi. Please kill yourself. Thanks 09/05/2016 Krishna Chandran Reply The guy who wrote this sounds to be a one eyes man to me….. He is fond of his iphone and may have seen some android phones, but never used any. Then he decides to write an article called iPhone vs Android and iPhone wins!!!! Good job 09/10/2016 John Ivay Reply Some of these are true but Oh God some are just so, so wrong. Like, the notifications. Android is wayyy better. You clear all at once or swipe. It combines like notifications that you can separate. It allows to interact with the notification and app without opening it and its just, way simpler and cleaner. 09/10/2016 Nigel Nderi Reply Let me settle this. Choose an iPhone if you are incompetent or are ok with a company controlling you’re phone completely. Choose an Android if you want to be able to enjoy the latest technologies and can competently manage it’s abilities without whining that it takes more than half a brain cell to use. 09/11/2016 Josh Mcduff Reply Just read all the comments and wow it’s all he said she said. I’ve had my Nexus 6p which btw one poster said it’s Google made nope huewei or whatever. Point is not the same, for about a year now and I’m now getting the iPhone 7. Are the specs pretty damn similar? Yes alot of the same features? Yes update often? Yes Nexus gets all the Android ones first like Apple. Price? Actually the 7 is less than the Nexus by about 150.00 CAD sooo that defeats the argument about price… Just saying. I love my Nexus but I’m open to changing. Ice bounced back and forth alot between Android and iOS can I say one is superior to the other? Absolutely not it all comes down to does it do what I want it to and can I afford it. 09/12/2016 Lee Reply All good and well people love free stuff but free stuff comes with a price of selling your info to the uncontrollable thirst party. iPhone also offer easy printing option than android you have to download something that will ask you to upgrade by paying just to use your printer no way! Also iPhone helps stop third party apps that try to use your phone making phone calls example if you are searching for nearest restaurant Google will show the call number to the same restaurant but when you try to call instead of calling direct the parasite apps like whatsaapp, text… And more they pop up asking you to use them making a call while they can’t function without your service they bug you each time taking away the time you spend trying to make a call. If you’re in a hurry and these app try to suggest you use it think how buggy this is. The same applies to text messages. 09/15/2016 Jada Reply Have u really owned an android? There are many many more possibilities and helpful apps that came with my galaxy s7 edge and i love it alot! So many more features and charging is so much faster and the battery life is amazing 09/15/2016 Ryan Reply You are a stupid retard Apple isn’t better than android. Apple has had to recall their product so many times because people died from the battery exploding. And with Apple every 3rd phone they stop making updates for it. Android always has updates for their products. Plus Apple owes the government 37 billion dollars Android doesn’t. The iPhone 7 that is coming out is a total ripoff. They copied Samsung. Apple has never made a crack resistance screen and a waterproof phone. Samsung is simply better. 09/17/2016 Rob Doyle Reply I completely am for people having their own opinion, that being said I disagree with the title of this article. That being said without any bias coming into play here, some of the points that the author was trying to make aren’t true or aren’t completely true. 1. “Works with all your devices”… The real title should be works better with all of your APPLE devices. The examples in the article are all apple examples. The author obviously has no experience with android or windows. 2. “Faster Updates”…. Compared to what android device? You can’t just say that Iphones get updates faster and compare that to all android phones. The way that this section was written made it sounds like the day an update is release for Android, nine of there phones get it immediately like the iPhones… this just isn’t true. If you have a nexus you get updates as they are released (just like and iPhone) There is a bunch of other examples that just show the author has no experience with android devices, I’m just going to keep this short. People will choose what they think is best for them. My issue is with the author, not the opinion. All the argument were completely based on opinion and not facts. People are going to read this and take it all as fact, instead of doing research and finding the right device for them. 09/18/2016 Jonathan Masters Reply I have both an iPhone 5 and a Galaxy S7. While there are some advantages to the iPhone, there are several reasons why I just can’t make a permanent switch. First, no home screen widgets (like my calendar and agenda). Sure, you can add something like that to the notifications screen, but that involve swiping, as opposed to right on the home screen. Second, it’s so difficult — even annoying — trying to organize files on the iPhone. On an Android, it operates exactly like a computer should (and our phones really are computers these days), with folders, subfolders, etc., so you can just copy the files to where you want them for later use. You can’t do that on an iPhone, where all of your files go to some mysterious and deep “collection” on the phone. If Apple were to add those two features, then I’d happily switch away from Android. 09/21/2016 de Coulon Thierry Reply I wanted to try an iPhone, so I got an old one. I could simply not install anything because everything on the AppStore has moved to iOS > 7. I could not bring a single file to the phone. All it would do is sync with iTunes on my Mac, but there is nothing to sync because I don’t use this Mac for everyday life. The iPhone I got did not have any smart way to save battery. The iPhone I got could not play any of my music because a) I could not upload it and b) I could not install anything that would play ogg files. The iPhone I got was heavier, thicker and less good looking than my current Sony. So OK it was an old iPhone, but 90% of what I say would be true for the latest iPhone, and at what price! If you live in the Apple world, then an iPhone is probably the logical choice. I live in the Linux world and now I know I’ll never take another look at an iPhone. 09/24/2016 Jim Washko Reply Worldwide stats – Android users 82% vs IOS users 18% There’s not enough votes to even tilt the scale towards IOS being better. Being as the story indicates Android phones are only good for 2 years that makes them more expensive. How can IOS users explain why 82% of the market would rather pay more for less?, if that were in fact true. Iphone offers less control, poor resoluion, no expandable memory and not all phones can share the same apps. Android offers all of it as well as compatible with Windows whcih is currently at 80% of the market share. This is like comparing the Yugo to Prius. Sure the Yugo is cheaper at first, but after a year of so, not so much. Iphone resale is more, but that will drop due to fewer and fewer users as they get tired of the box of crayons with only black and white as an option. when they can get the box of 64 and a sharpener 09/24/2016 Capi Reply Is this all a big joke? You keep saying “iPhone is better than Android” about ten times in the article, like a mantra we have to learn and assimilate, Am I the only one who noticed this? I have and iPad, and iMac and I used iPhone (4, 4s and 5) I am familiar with both iOS and OSX but actually I have an Android and installed Windows 10 on my iMac. OSX is a good system if you like simple and easy interfaces, I don’t really have any problem with it, is a really good system once you learn to do things that are diferent with Windows, like formating drives with Disk Utility. (And if we forget how difficult could be for some people to use drive formats like NTFS in a Mac) But iOS, thats another story, Apple manufactures iPhone and developes a OS which works perfectly with that device, which, supposedly, makes it safer. There ends all iOS and iPhone REAL advantages. There are a lot of reason to say Android is better than Android, but the main reason is that you can freely add and delete files from it. I connect my Android to my computer, I press “Windows key” + “E” and immediately I see all my drives and my Android device there, and I can drag or delete files from it. But when I connect an iPhone I have sync up files with iTunes. Why the hell people think synchronization is good? For example, I spent one week adding all my music from CDs to my iTunes library, then I synced my iPhone and… voilá, my music was there. Then my computer died, and my music adquired during years with my money was completely lost, just because I didn’t buy it to Apple. But hey, music was still on my iphone, but NO, I need a third party program, which costs money or could be a malware, just to upload my songs again to a new computer. (Of course I have all my CDs, but thats a week lost) Im simply asking you to do like me if you can, just try everything, because if I read this article (iPhone is better, iPhone is better, iPhone is better…) I have the feeling that not everyone, but many people conform with iPhone. Just for popularity, for Apple fanaticism, or just because a website is telling you to buy it with superliminal advertising. 09/26/2016 wgallagher142 Reply I actually find that android apps have become much prettier and definitely more modern than iPhone apps at this point.

I plug the phone to any pc or laptop with Windows and I can access and modify the memory and sd card just like you do with an USB flash drive. 2) probably my favourite Android feat: if I don’t like a new update for an App I just download the previous version (you can get the whole updates hystory as .apk files of virtually every single app found in Google Play on the web) and there I have my dear older version that works so much better for me.

I have been a heavy android user till date until yesterday when I bought iPhone 7 plus. I own an iPad since two years. I am happy with my iPad which I use mainly for games and some handwriting. Yes I was annoyed from android. I owned s3. It had, due to some reason, a built in issue which I only realized after warranty finished. My faulty s3 obliged me to hate Samsung and android. Then I bought note 4. It solved all my problems I faced on s3. But still there were some things I did not feel good about. Now after purchasing iPhone 7plus 128 GB I understand the power of google. The three apps Google search, google maps and google drive are enough reason to close down iPhone factory from the face of earth. 10/10/2016 BM Reply Thinking to upgrade from s5. Thought for iPhone 7. But it can not do even 5 % work compared to android. My andrioid mobile automatically silents itself when I enter meetings or office. Automatic meeting mode when meeting is scheduled (only beeps) I can give my mobile to anyone to see coz I have app specific fingerprint. Only sensitive apps are protected. All other is open. These are not possible with apple except jailbreak. These are just samples. I can write journal what android can do. Speed is not important with a Ibrick which can not do anything smart. I’m not a fan of apple or Samsung. I want my work to be done and my pocket secretary to work according to my requirements. 10/10/2016 Charles Alden Reply 15 reasons why Android is better. Reason number one, you have an actual file system. Anyone who has dealt with iOS horrendous file management paradigm appreciates the ease as at which files are accessible in Android. You simply click on Open, navigate to where your files are stored, select, done. There is also never any reason to use the Share function except when sharing data with the internet. Number 2, multitasking, iOS’s multitasking absolutely sucks, especially when you compare it to Android. Example, I can stream a film to my TV wirelessly, while compiling an application via a remote terminal, while downloading a 40GB file directly to my NAS drive which is mounted as a local folder, while I convert a media file to .mp4, while I play N64, 007 Goldfinger using a replica N64 USB game controller. I’m able to select my own default apps, so when I download a file and click open, the app that I normally use for that extension opens up automatically. I have a global search function, which is one of the worst things about iOS, how do you find files. That was rhetoric, you can’t, it’s basically hunt and peck. I can customize voice commands, this is perhaps one of the coolest things about about Android. I have around 250 custom voice commands, mostly for searching files. Such as, “show me all file [file extension] created on [date]. Even photos, show me all photos from [city] on [particular date/month, years], even for a particular person , “show me all photos for [name] on [particular date/month, year]” External display support, when am connect my phone to a monitor not only is the resolution fully supported but so is the aspect ratio. Mouse support, while connected to a monitor I can use a mouse and a keyboard. Even when not connected to a phone, having access to a mouse is an absolute must when using a tablet as a laptop. USB peripheral support, so besides mouse support, my phone supports a TB external HD, HP All-In-One printer in which the scanner even works, USB replica game controllers in which a have one for the N64, SNES, Sega and PlayStation. Better overall specs, I have a 2K AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, USB C, SD Card reader, HDMI out support, etc. I can use a custom desktop LDPI, I changed my LDPI to 380 which is the LDPI that activates tablet mode, which means all of my apps are a lot more powerful than the normal phone UI ones. I can customize my entire system to what I want it to be, give it personality, iOS users have been using the same system UI for the last 9 years. There is absolutely nothing I can’t customize. Inner app communication is a lot better, since iOS has a Walled off prison, or so called Walled Garden, apps communicate via API’s, which is the root of everything wrong within iOS. Anyway as stated above, I don’t have to use some half assed sharing function which creates a copy of the file your sharing every time you use it to open up my files within multiple apps, I simply click on Open. I can even open up the same file within multiple apps at the same time. I never, ever have to create more than one file, I just use the original file, always. I can use Linux under a Chroot, meaning I have a full Debian server running under my phone. Why would you want this, well first of all I have CLI applications like; Python, Perl, PHP, MySQL, Apache, etc. I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed like; Dia, Inkscape, Gimp, BlueFish, etc. I can use my phone as a desktop computer, this one might sound weird but not only is it possible, it works incredibly well. Especially when my phone has 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm 821. Like I said above I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed in which a bring them up using a xterminal, when I’m at work I have access to about a hundred different Windows applications via a Citrix client which works fantastically. All of my applications including the ndroid ones are opened up in individual windows, so none of that dual app view non-sense. In which in iOS less than 0.5% out of a million plus apps actually support. I have access to widgets, they might not interest you but they are extremely handy. I can use wireless chargers. I can use custom ROMs, even completely different OS’s like Ubuntu Touch, SailFish, etc. I will never, ever not be able to run the latest version of Android. When a manufacturer stops updating their phone, no problem, I just install a custom ROM and they work fantastically. My phone is a computer, a real powerhouse, a real smartphone. Every time I use an iPhone I absolutely hate the experience. I mean even to type a post like this I would have to use a text editor as I would be afraid to loose all of my work as anytime you switch to another app, Safari just resets. It has happened to me numerous times, it’s why sites have started saving drafts, not for the Android users but iOS users. Though what bothers me the most is the lack of multitasking, yes, sure, there are a few apps that can run in the background but they are far and few and none of them are the ones that I need or want to use. Than there is the file system or I should say lack of, dealing with files IOS is simply a complete nightmare. Anytime someone at the office who uses an iPhone gets sassy with me about having an Android phone I simply ask them to show me their user directory, what, you can’t mount it, why not, your phone is so great. Not only do I have my remote server directly mounted as a local directory on my phone but my workstation and all of my cloud services as well, all accessible within any app installed. Again, my phone is also my desktop computer and why not, it’s not only powerful enough but more than capable. I couldn’t believe how horrible the external display support was on my iPad Pro, which I recently replaced with a Lenovo YogaBook, best decision I ever made. Talk about a complete makeover on how I work, I’m actually productive now. I can create detailed reports, all in the background and automatically, I have access to a scripting language, automation, multi-user support with OpenID to access my firms internal network, a real Office suite, MS Office for iOS was a complete joke, there isn’t even a import feature, scripting language, nope, database support, nope, by the way, I have the Android version. Which opens up every app under their own window, iOS’s dual app support on the iPad Pro was a joke, hardly anything supports it and that drag and drop feature, only apps designed by the same developer can use it, so MS Word to MS Excel yes, MS Word to Apple photos, no, useless. Yes, my post is huge, but this authors best 15 reasons why the iPhone is a joke. Almost everything listed I have on either my Yoga Book or new Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus or don’t need it as it’s a waste. In fact 90% of the so called new features in iOS 10 are useless. I held on to my iPad Pro thinking iOS 10 would be a game changer, not only was it not, but there wasn’t a single feature that improved my experience. Apple keeps skipping over every feature that we actually want, need. If your happy with multitasking, file management, the fact that you can’t select your own default apps, lack of customizations, horrible external display support, lack of USB C, limited NFC, horrible USB peripheral support, especially mouse support. Horrible inner app communication including the Sharing function in which took Apple 8 years to even release that crap, ugh, the list just goes on and on and …………. 10/11/2016 Gigi Reply This is one of the most biased articles I have ever read on complementing Apple. I am an adult, I don’t need Apple to limit what I can do with my phone and what I can share and who I can share with. I have used Iphone before and it surely not my cup of tea. 10/12/2016 Emma squire Reply Okay Listen what I think is that you have written an article telling the blank truth of your mind. But you see I have an iPhone 6s,iPod 5,MacBook air, MacBook Pro, Samsung TV with built in smart tv, Samsung galaxy tablet pro and I don’t mind Samsung to be truthful.

I was suckered in buying 2 android devices the samsung galaxy s3 and the nexus 4. I gave it a try because my friends raved about android. They are smart people who generally have great advice and knowledge on technology. So I said I’ll give it a shot because they have good judgement. However I found out that their judgement were out of biased hatred toward apple. Android devices: 1. on paper they have more ram, sometimes quicker cpu clock speed, higher resolution etc. however real life performance tests apple out scores android devices, just check geek bench and speed tests. As for higher resolution our eyes dont even detect the larger resolutions. 2. I found out the hard way, downloaded apps that just didnt work for my device. Google needs to improve this I dont know if they are better now but man they need to detect the hardware your using and tell you ahead of time before you download and install an app that its compatible with your device! 3. customizations my butt!! Its a great idea so called if all your launchers actually look good! haha I tried all these loaders for my s3 and they were all ugly. Just go with apple, its like saying would you hire great designers for your house and you would just let them have their way in designing the house for you or would you want to design it yourself? doesnt make sense look at xiaomi great example they just copy everything apple does and it looks great. Dont hire cheap designers to design the way your phone looks and works. 4. OS – android’s solution to everything is “oh just download this app to make it work or oh just kill this task or reduce brightness or this or that” why?! If I’m paying 1k for a phone why does it not just work? Why must I non stop have to tweak things on my phone to get save battery or make things work? For instance for whatsapp there was no function built into the app that when I want to send a larger video than that of the given limit on a video it just rejects it. On iOS whatsapp gives you a little function that u can just cut the video into segments and send them in separate messages? This sounds like it can be something that is on the app level. I dont know but as for end user experience its just not convenient you need to download another app that will cut videos in segments for you this is retarded. 5. battery life just sucks on android – and my friend is all like well it works for me…well that’s because he had to buy a new battery that was double the size and totally threw out the idea of having a sleek thin phone. Theres on and on the list goes android and samsung devices are not superior devices. The features samsung lovers speak of are just gimmicks. Keyboards, widgets, notifications honestly who cares? Especially when widgets just take down performance on your phone? I just dont see any benefits on android especially the argument went something like this: “oh android phones are cheaper for superior hardware” Like I said hardware maybe superior on PAPER but in real life benchmarks iphones outshine samsung and htc and other top tier android devices. By the way prices are not cheaper anymore so android fanboys have no actual argument. Like I said I tried android and they are not superior phones both hardware and software. Aesthetically Android phones are ugly. You now pay a premium price on sub premium products, and they explode. lol 10/20/2016 Jamezz_ Reply Sure. A Samsung or LG’s phone software is ugly. But stock android?! Android 6.0 stock? It’s an extraordinary interface with origami-style apps. The geometry with the shadows and vibrant colors is beautiful. The app drawer is simple, and you can put the apps you use on your home screen. Android’s advantage is software. iSheep are just too autistic to use it. 10/16/2016 Cmi Reply I have both! I have an iPhone for work and I have an Android for my personal use, in my opinion the phone is shit and could not compare to the Android in any area,i f it were up to me I would NEVER own an iPhone. Anybody who argues this point has never used them side by side. No comparison.anybody who stands in line for the new iPhone is absolutely getting the shaft and not even getting the best product , it’s laughable! 10/18/2016 George Brite Reply Great article. Over the years I’ve had both. Even a couple of Macs. I use PC’s now because I like being able to work on them and build my own. For the average user the I Phone is a better choice. They are simple and work well. Here’s the big negatives for me: The hardware and software are proprietary. In fact the phones are sealed. You can’t install an extended battery. No SD slot. No root access. Comparable Android phones cost a lot less. The Android phones natively work with Google Apps. We use our phones in the business. If I were a casual user it wouldn’t matter if it were a Trac Phone or an I Phone. We use the Google phones and Motorola phones. They run pure Android without all the carrier bloatware. I like to say Apple invented the smartphone, but Google perfected it. It’s like the choice between a toaster oven and a microwave or a full commercial kitchen. Most people will get along fine with the toaster and microwave. They don’t need a commercial kitchen. But, what if you could get the full commercial kitchen for the same price as the toaster and microwave? Everyone has an opinion about which is better. But trust me when I say this isn’t a choice between chocolate and vanilla. There are very distinct differences between the Android and Apple phones. 10/21/2016 ZinicHD Reply Wtf, apps never ever releases on iOS first. It always releases on android first. Also app updates releases on android first, so that’s kind of bullshit what you are saying. The only thing iOS beats android in is security and stability. Also you can get virus scanners on android, so that thing doesn’t matter. And one thing more, who ever uses FaceTime or iMessage, when we have messenger, Skype ect… And that point when you said that iOS stock apps was the stupidest crap I have ever heard. First of all it was a shit point, what are you gonna need the looks for? Second is that not everyone thinks it look better, so keep that mind. I am a iOS user and I am so disappointed that you can’t even customize the most of the things. I have to admit that the design of iOS is pretty nice, but you get quick tired of it. That’s why I jailbreaked my device to get the ability to customize it more professionally. But I don’t compare a android device and a jailbroken device, because jailbreaking is not something that comes with Apple. iOS is also very expensive compared to android devices. And checking storage on android is way more organized than iOS, so I don’t know where you get that idea that checking storage on iOS is better. 10/22/2016 Bent Vanwijnsberghe Reply the lightning port part is bs i have an iphone (looking for a new phone android) and there are around me on my desk already 3 micro usb and 1 lightning port witch costs around 40 bucks for a new one 10/25/2016 Selenia Reply Terrible article by an obvious fanboy. You are listing many things, like lack of carrier or manufacturer bloatware, reversible charging plug, seamless sharing, etc and saying they are exclusive to Apple. Try Googling USB-C, the current standard on any higher range Android, some still cheaper than an iDevice. Try a Nexus, or as of this year, Pixel phone. No bloat, Android as Google intended it. That would be a more fair comparison as those are at least close in the chain to Google, like an iPhone is to Apple. That is, instead of being made by some company who may not even care how it represents Android, build quality, and other important things, instead of pure profit(not say all non Nexus/Pixel phones are bad by any means, but some do give Android a bad name with poor specs and modified/outdated versions of Android). Seamless sharing? Ever hear of WiFi Direct, Bluetooth, or NFC? NFC is the simplest. Just hit share and tap. All but the cheapest Androids have that these days. Anyways, I am convinced you have never used a decent Android, ever. Certainly not one from Google themselves. I will leave you to tend to your iFlock. 10/30/2016 MzJens Reply For android, I think google products like nexus & pixel are much better than samsung. However, I noticed a lot of crappy apps available on google play that doesn’t work. Some apps require root access which only advance users should do. Android interface is not as intuitive as iOS. Some android apps hang. I’ve never had ios apps hang on me 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Reply “You have to try multiple attempts before putting the charger in at the right angle” 1. If you do it in a lit environment you will get it in first try because the micro USB shape is easy to see 2. If you are in the dark: And have an official Samsung charger – there will be a “bumps letting you know which way to put it and the only thing that can go wrong is you missing the port, which is possible on iPhone too. And have any old micro USB – there are two, normal, ways to insert it horizontally upside down and horizontally the correct way both 180 degree angles so please don’t exaggerate it. Finally Samsung cares about you that’s why they use micro USB. This may seem weird but basically to legally make a lightning USB cable you need a licence from Apple and Apple only have their own unique charger to earn more profit, that’s why apple chargers are always more expensive, because they are sold by Apple or the retailer needs to make his money back from the licence fare. P.S. Samsung devices come with a 1 year warranty for free and because it’s Samsung you can get cheaper insurance than their one (yes they have one) P.P.S. Sharing has always been easier on android to anything because you could share with a variety of options such as Bluetooth, NFC, messaging app, other third party apps, S share (Samsung own “air drop” that came out in Android version 4.1.3 BI7 – before Ios 7 Also the settings icon is useful, it’s like apple not making the send button on messages 3d touch to send so you don’t accidently press it, sure sometimes you send half written messages but it is more convenient and normal to have it to a single normal touch. And there is a difference between apps looking better and having more features on Apple which are usually hardware based, I just brought this up because no matter who you ask if you compare a Samsung phone with its equivalent iPhone generation, Samsung phones ALWAYS have better displays and MOSTLY have better cameras. Samsung phones are also very comfortable, for example I am writing this on a Samsung galaxy s7 edge There is a setting that allows the micro sd card to be added as side by side storage Finally Samsung has always had earphone controls so either I read it wrong that you said these are things we will miss very much or you are really confused 11/12/2016 Tetsuokenpachi Reply Each and every single of these are false. Android is actually better in every single of these areas. From the first to the last one. Worse yet, many of these points are actually some of the very reasons why idevices absolutely suck. 11/16/2016 Billy Sastard Reply apple is crap, these idiots make their products so expensive, but android is cheaper and has alot of awesome features.android is also WAY more customisable, with out necessarily rooting your device.And if you do, you can do almost anything from installing apps to changing your software. 11/16/2016 Calculadora Gestacional Reply I think both of them are just great! 11/16/2016 Caleb Reply The update can still download on older Apple products, because I have a IPad 2 that came out in 2011 and it still receives all of the latest updates. It is running IOS 10 right now. 11/16/2016 saurabh Reply Been an exclusive apple lover for 7 years now. But just bought an edge 7. Was amazed to see how much progress android has made and makes my iphone look so limited. I am aware that android tends to slow down over time but that is yet to happen to me. For now the openness of android is amazing as it is giving me a computer like experience while iOS still strictly behaves like a mobile device only. Classic hurt points being in iphone /iOS being No expandable memory No dual sim version (i travel internationally and need this frequently) Unable to use lastpass like apps the same way as in android (and keychain is BS, BTW) Simple things like themes unavailable Very less system wide control Very limited customisation I can go on but i think unless my expensive edge can give me same performance as now for ATLEAST 2 years, i’ll eat my words back But, the 15 points mentioned here are almost all very unconvincing. 11/17/2016 Philip Reply Apple are just simple phones no really fancy stuff I have had two Android phone I love their features but not their battery life which is crappie I have had two Apple iPods and two iPhone they were the 4 32 GB & 5s 64 GB now on Android your apps get updated every 3 months on Apple sometimes twice a week IOS updates are twice month at least I bought my iPhone 5s 64 GB which started with iOS 7 in 2014 now it got iOS 10.1.1 it seems the IOS are getting worse not better it freezes crashes most apps lot of the app you can’t even post two year let alone one day old photo I can get on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with 3 year old photos on it and post photos off it to any app only reason I like the small iPhones I can collect lot photos that way I can post to my apps like now I got over 106K photos on my 5s 64 GB which you can’t do with big phones only problems I got with iPhones are updates on apps and IOS’S like this month iOS 10.2 supposedly be coming out it seems the new IOS’s don’t really fixing any problems you get on your iPhone it just give you different problems while you still have the same old problems you also got figure Apple iPhones are about 3 years behind Android phones on new ideals 11/18/2016 Nick Reply Apple!?

From the moment you boot up ios, there are restrictions to what you can do with your phone. Can you flash IOS9 to iphone4s? Guess what, my old galaxy s2 is already running marshmallow like a charm and i think both of them were released in the same year. and i am in the process of flashing Latest nougat 7.1 cyanogenmod version on my s6 edge. You are writing about malware crap which is misleading. New android versions since lollipop allow users to modify app permissions but i think you are so caught up in app constrained ecosystem, you didn’t noticed. IOS isn’t secure anymore as we thought it was. Su vulnerability has already been fixed and there is no more stagefright bug in android. And you obviously have no idea about the difference between android based phones and android phones. Most of the Phones from samsung, htc, sony etc run Custom Android based OS, They are actually custom build port of android, not real android phones, so obviously there will be some issues too if you try to port IOS on samsung. A high end smartphone can go head to head with iphone in each and every aspect. My s6 edge is not even a tad slower than iphone 6, in fact, it performs even better. The slowdown overtime can be experience on low end smartphone. Obviously the one writing this comment has no idea about fstrim. Stop posting such nonsense crap in order to get traffic to your website. 11/25/2016 ashford Reply I have never once had a problem with android phones, but decided to switch it up as IPhones are the ‘in thing’ It was okay for a few months, but soon started having plenty of issues with speed, memory and doing basic things. I decided to upgrade it to the 7, which turned out to be just as bad. For the price, they should be giving people something amazing, not mediocrity! P.S. How much did they apple pay you for such a bad article. 12/03/2016 Brandon McLean Reply You didn’t mention how Apple has a much smaller battery, late software updates, unneeded restrictions, is insanely overpriced, and most of all, Apples processor specs come in at a fraction of what Androids of the same price have, AKA 1.6 GHZ (Apple iPhones) vs 2.4 GHZ (ASUS, Galaxy S7, OnePlus all running Android), 2 GB of RAM (Apple) vs 4 GB of RAM (Android). Android is by far the superior technology. Your only argument is that Android uses Google’s superior sharing system, rather than their own like Apple does. 12/14/2016 Keith Llewellyn Reply For me, it’s all about security, and Apple has the best. Also, if you buy an iPhone you get updates and support for a couple of years more than Google provides for it’s own Nexus or Pixel phones. Two years worth of updates for the OS and Three years for security updates FROM THE DATE OF FIRST INTRODUCTION is totally inadequate. It means that you have to buy a new google phone from the date it is first available in order to really benefit from the updates. 12/27/2016 Apple Marketing Machine Reply Let’s compare the “core” features of a new iphone to a 2 year old android phone: iphone 7 plus – Released 2016, September Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Released 2014, October iphone 7 plus – 1080 x 1920 pixels (~401 ppi pixel density) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 1440 x 2560 pixels (~518 ppi pixel density) iphone 7 plus – Quad-core 2.23 GHz Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Quad-core 2.7 GHz iphone 7 plus – 12 MP camera Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 16 MP camera iphone 7 plus – Non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Removable Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery okay…you can have your “better looking apps”. 12/28/2016 MACKabiVIPer42 Reply Yes Android phones are better everything wise but iPhone battery is better last as long as up to 3 to 4 years Samsung last up to 6 months I know had S3 and HTC 1 still got S3 3rd battery it’s just iPod on second iPhone first one was iPhone 4 32 GB lasted 4 years got iPhone 5s 64 GB it’s over 2 yrs old but don’t use for taking photos just for collecting photos which small iPhone can collect up too 100K photos like my iPhone 5s I’m not SELFIE PERSON where I got take photo of my self in every window mirror and bathroom I love stealing other people photos like Anime ladies in bikinis to post on my other apps even Animals if they are cute enough yes Apple do make there apps crappie and there IOS’s also which crashes and freezes a lot then half time you can’t post photos or articles from your e-mail too the apps but I take Apple for small phone over android big phone 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply More pixels require more energy and chip performance.

This list is pure “i don’t like it so that means android is bad” and “its apple so whatever it does it’s genius”. if you’ve ever ACTUALLY went from crapple to android (unlike 99% of the comments here that say they have but in reality… well) you would notice a LOT of improvements over crapple. 1: The price to quality ratio is MUCH better that apple’s. 2: More customisation options. Unless you count changing your phone cover as “customizing”. 3: It’s not apple, so it’s better (see what i did there? I did the shit apple fanboy’s do) 4: No dumb “inovations”. 5: Simplifying things and making something that takes 3 seconds isn’t better, Sony, Samsung etc focus on more important things to improve. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Well you sound like Forest Gump in his movie when he said that his friend opened Apple company for selling fruits….

I have a android galaxy tab 3 and the iPod 6 generation and if I was to choose which is better it’s definitely Apples product and I never would get an android again. When I got my android new at Walmart it couldn’t even get the latest version, it was completely unbelievable. After I had it for 3 months it slowed down on me and its battery life is horrible. Now when I bought this IPod new I’ve had it for a double the time now and it works like new and best of all it can get the latest version. The quality of Apple is way better. In my opinion the iPhone is the best visual quality I’ve seen yet. Ive done some decent gaming on them and if you want something to save your progress then forget android, because not all the game link to your google play account so if you reset it the ones that don’t link are gone. Unlike apple I haven’t had any issues with it. I’ve lost decent money and progress on android because of it. Yes Apple does come out with the newest technology a bit latter then android but you can see it it a good way or a bad. The bad way would be that their slow, the good way you can see it as if their watching googles failing parts and their making it better. 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply Also I can see you all are fighting over this topic which is pretty stupid. To be honest you can’t necessarily compare them. Everyone is different so everyone is going to want something different. If we all wanted android or we all wanted Apple we would become robots. If you wanted to find a phone to get then get into inside detail to see what your looking for. If you wanted fun texting and want to be more secure then go straight for apple because they got the best for that but if you wanted fun lock screens or be able to put micro SD cards and changeable batteries then go for android but let me remind you that anyone can take the SD card out and take your information. Hope this helps. 01/04/2017 LOREN FOK Reply people will buy iphone just because thats what everyone else has they dont even know what they are buying.

Most of the alleged superiorities are interoperabilty between iPhones (iMessage, Airdrop) or between iPhone and other Apple devices (Handoff) – if you are a PC owner, or have a large number of friends or fellow users on Android, these advantages are insignificant at best. I will concede that updates and lack of carrier bloatware are significant pluses, the author is doing an extreme disservice to new users by basically promoting an iPhone prejudice. 01/31/2017 Matt Perkins Reply iPhones win over Android smartphones for these 5 critical reasons. Security, Privacy, Stability, Performance and Usability. iOS gets far less malware than Android, it has far less critical vulnerabilities than Android. Vulnerabilities are patched quicker in iOS. iOS crashes and freezes less than Android, Apple doesn’t harvest data to sell like Google does (Google has even started collecting identifiable data since they released their new voice assistant). iOS is a faster OS than Android is while Android smartphones slow down faster than the iPhone does. And of course iOS offers the better out of box experience. Not to mention you can never make Android as secure as iOS, only close to as secure. Part of the reason is even if you tweak your Android settings to be similar to iOS, the official Google Play Store gets far more malware than the AppStore and Cydia combined. So only way to even remotely match it is not download apps or games. My other favorite part of iOS over Android is the fact you can use true adblockers in iOS, not just adblock browsers without the need to root or jailbreak. Google will never allow you to block ads in Chrome or block all ads third party ads without rooting. And as you knowing rooting and jailbreaking merely lowers the security of the OS. That’s another thing Jailbroken iOS is more secure than untouched Android as long as you stick to the default repos in Cydia. 02/01/2017 Shaun Anderson Reply Android Download from unknown sources like a regular computer Download files from browser Plug in and transfer anything to and from computer.

I’ve had every version of the iPhone. I’ve never had an Android phone update properly. My 3 year old plays on my old 2nd gen iPhone that has the latest IOS on it. . .. android can’t do that. with the exception of a Verizon flip phone, every single Android phone I’ve ever had got a virus, crashed and I had to reset to factory settings at least 2 times per phone. I have never, ever ever got a virus on ANY Apple product, and never had to put any software or app to keep it running correctly. As far as customization? Who cares. If you’re so busy and have so much time to waste trying to impress everyone with crazy fonts and wild customization, the iPhone is way to sleek, sophisticated and user -friendly for you. Software dictates hardware. The IOS blows Android OS away. And, any (anyone who’s actually worked on both will agree) Apple product gets sometimes twice the speed out of less RAM and processing than ANY other OS (Windows or Android). Give me stability anytime. so your phone has an expandable memory? What good is it when it won’t run half the time.

It’s really kind of a shame for Android – I don’t get why they don’t just match the exact app. 3) Lightning is neat but I found MicroUSB more useful, since it’s used for more devices, i.e. I have a MicroUSB running from my desk to my PC to charge my wireless mouse, and then I would also use it to charge my phone sometimes. 4) Yes I do miss customization heaven with Android, but this iPhone runs like total butter. Android runs WELL but this thing is so zippy and responsive – you wouldn’t believe it until you spent time with one. 5) ALSO customization isn’t as cut-off as it used to be with iOS. Some apps can latch onto some functions in the phone, kinda like installing an extension for your desktop browser. It’s something. Really I just bought an iPhone to “try something new” and I’m really liking it. 02/28/2017 Toby Reply Just do a Quick google search iphone is less reliable than Android, theres your Answer in the studies. End of debate… 03/01/2017 Viking Sheep Reply These comparisons are so lame… Eg: Country X is much better than the rest of the world, because the rest of the world have varying standards, while Country X has only 1 level of corruption. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply First: great respect to Steve Jobs who dedicated his life to Apple iPhone invention and to make communication better more joyful between people. Also to feel the power and beauty of technology in your hand. How I wished that Isaac Newton or Ainstein or Nikola Tessa or… would see what we have today… Second: iPhone is far more serious for people who want job to be done as fast and simpler way without delays. Android phones are for kids who like customizations and pretty colors and to look like iron man or similar… Third: iPhone is made of better materials. And looks for business high class. Android phones are copying iPhone’s look especially Samsung. Fourth: iPhone technology, the software and hardware gives you exactly what you need. No more no less. Android technologies gives you extra things which are seldom used and are simply extra using more battery and device performance. Fifth: iPhone has a specific style in design. Keeping updating same style to better one making it each time better and better. Sixth: Applications on iPhone are much better with much less defects than Android. At the end, I had various Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Htc and iPhone phones. I choose iPhone. Now I have iPhone 6s+ black limited edition with golden Apple. It’s very nice piece of equipment. at the bottom line, Apollo 11 travelled to the moon using Fortan on its 360 kb computer. Today we are talking of gigs bytes. So I respect both iPhone and Android technologies for their great effort and progress. Competition shall exist to make difference and better.

It’s highly secure and make people addicted to it with it’s cool features. 03/22/2017 Me Reply You can sync on Android (and Windows Phone) too with a Google account (or Microsoft account in WP’s case).

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Apple goes back to basics with new… Apple goes back to basics with new ‘iPad,’ iPhone 7 gets new (RED) treatment By Bill Roberson — March 21, 2017 12:31 PM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: I’ll take the iPad. You know, THE iPAD… While you were asleep, Apple quietly reshuffled their iPad and iPhone lineup. The iPad Air 2 is gone, replaced by a new 9.7-inch model known simply as “the iPad.” The new iPad features a high-resolution retina screen and the speedy A9 processor, along with a base price of just $329 for the basic 32gb model with wi-fi only. Cellular data service and more memory up the price, of course. In the iPhone lineup, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus get the Product (RED) treatment, with proceeds going to the global fight against AIDS. There are also Product (RED) options for the Beats Pill speakers and Beats Solo 3 headphones among other bits, like cases and such. And the surprising popular retro iPhone SE gets two memory options, with 32gb and 128gb variations joining the original 64 gig offering. Hit the link here for more information on the latest from Apple. Shoot it, Clip it, share it More Apple news, this time in the Apps department. Cupertino will soon debut an app called “Clips” that is designed for quick, on-the-go editing of videos destined for social media. Some cool features: you can dictate captions while you’re recording your video. Apple’s built-in voice recognition system will then type out the words for you. You also have background music options that self-adjust to the length of your video. If you’re thinking that Clips looks a bit Snapchatish, it does, but that’s the idea of course. Clips hits the App store in April. Ride every mountain… If you’ve ever stared at the vertical slopes on the side of a tall mountain and thought, “hmmm… I wonder how fast I could go on my mountain bike if I just dropped in from the top?” Well, we’d like you to meet daredevil Eric Barone. Barone, sporting a very spiffy helmet and slippery red body suit, just broke the speed record for maximum velocity on a mountain bike by riding his highly customized cycle down the side of a mountain in the French Alps. And who’s record did he break? Well, his own, of course. Barone hit an astounding 141 miles per hour in what was essentially a free-fall down the mountain with the barest of traction, breaking his old mark of 138 miles per hour from  2015. Barone is no stranger to pulling off dangerous stunts. He’s a stuntman who’s worked with Stalone and Van Damme, but he’s also been setting bicycle speed records since the 1990s. During a record attempt in 2002, Barone crashed, breaking ribs and suffering numerous other injuries. I’m sure this isn’t the last we’ve heard from the man known as the Red Baron. Way to go, Eric. Go here for the full story and video.
Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Security Mel Image Source: Shutterstock Apple says CIA’s arsenal of iPhone and Mac exploits is outdated Yoni Heisler @edibleapple March 24th, 2017 at 6:50 AM Share Tweet Yesterday morning, Wikileaks released a treasure trove of documents detailing the arsenal of software tools the CIA uses to hack into targeted iPhones and Macs. While most of the reported exploits require physical access to a particular device, the document dump naturally generated no shortage of fear-inducing headlines about the state of security of various Apple products. In an effort to address and alleviate such concerns, Apple late last night issued statement to TechCrunch assuring both Mac and iPhone users that all of the CIA exploits recently brought to light by Wikileaks are old and outdated. In fact, Apple notes that a handful of the newly disclosed exploits were patched nearly seven years ago. Don't Miss: First big Galaxy Note 8 leak comes with Galaxy S8 one week away Apple’s statement on the matter reads as follows: We have preliminarily assessed the Wikileaks disclosures from this morning. Based on our initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released. Additionally, our preliminary assessment shows the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. We have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information. We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain. We are tireless defenders of our users’ security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users. The tidbit about not negotiating with Wikileaks is worth highlighting as it comes hot on the heels of a report claiming that Wikileaks was withholding access to the technical details of the CIA’s hacking tools unless tech companies like Apple and Google agreed to “sign off on a series of conditions.” In any event, you can bet good money that the CIA’s collection of iPhone and Mac hacking tools is far more sophisticated today than it was a few years back. And while Apple has undoubtedly improved iOS security by leaps and bounds over the last few years, the fact remains that no piece of software is ever 100% bulletproof. Just this past summer, for example, security researchers discovered an extremely advanced piece of iOS spyware capable of remotely spying on a targeted device’s phone calls, texts, emails, location and more. Dubbed Pegasus and developed by an Israeli security company called the NSO Group, the software prompted Apple to quickly roll out a software patch for the handful of zero-day exploits Pegasus relied upon.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Business Transformational attributes of Steve Jobs Published March 26, 2017March 26, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata Jnr. Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata Jnr. The power of vision and the commitment to follow through with achieving such a vision absolutely does make a difference and one man did prove this to the world. He lived an extra-ordinary life that brought such tremendous disruption that directly or indirectly led to the dislocation of two giant phone companies, namely Blackberry and Nokia. It also contributed to making the windows operating system irrelevant. The great man was Steve Jobs. The great and extraordinary achievements by Steve Jobs when he was alive were humongous. This is more so evident that, even after almost six years of his demise, his name still resonates the world over, especially in the world of technology. It is interesting to note that Steve Jobs still features prominently in online discussions, and as Google trends shows, he is more famous than Bill Gates, the Founder of Microsoft, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple Incorporated, makers of iPhone, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk. Studying and following in the footsteps of the ingenuity of people such as Steve Jobs in our quest for improvement and progress within the technology ecosystem will, most certainly lead to more ingenuity as well as become a source of inspiration to potential innovators in Nigeria. How well do you know Steve Jobs? You may have memorized one of his numerous quotes or perhaps hear people talk about him. An icon like Steve Jobs is not one whom you can just quote one of his witty sayings without having an interest in knowing him. You need to know more about Jobs as he was one of the most influential persons that traversed this world, especially the ever evolving world of technology. The genius called Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011 at the age of 56 after unsuccessfully battling with pancreatic cancer. He was the Co-Founder and CEO of Apple Incorporated, the makers of the popular iPhone, which is a brand that commands a large patronage and following across the world. After Jobs resigned from his role as CEO of the company, he handed the mantle of leadership over to Tim Cook, the present Chief Executive Officer of Apple Incorporated. Cook was a very close companion of Jobs before his demise as they had been friends for quite a long time. To tell you how close they were, Cook offered a portion of his liver to Jobs before he finally succumbed to the cold hands of death. Tim Cook was the obvious choice to replace Jobs as he was highly competent to take over the mantle of leadership and since he assumed office, the growth of Apple has been very tremendous, following in the footsteps of Jobs. It is worthy to note that since Tim Cook took over as CEO, the value of Apple has grown from $50bn to more than $600bn. Paying Attention to Details As if they learned that from Jobs, Apple does not joke with details. Steve Jobs would always tell his employees, “I’m going to run a class and teach everyone here how to use Keynote the way I do so that you can do this. Because it matters, every detail matters.” By inculcating attention to detail in your business, will prove significant when the company begins to gain ground in the long run. Employees across businesses should be focusing on getting it right all day, every day. All CEOs will agree with me on this subject and I can positively state that there is much value attached to employees who pay attention to details. Interestingly, paying attention to details is one of my greatest strengths. A Culture of Innovation I am optimistic that Nigerians too are becoming innovative over the years because a growing number of young Nigerian entrepreneurs that are creating innovative businesses, and more importantly, are not waiting for government connections to create this change. Jobs did things differently and was confident enough to invent, innovate and change the world. He was described by an American president as one of the greatest American innovators that  were brave enough to think differently. It is obvious that he altered our perception today about the world. He showcased this by building one of the most successful companies in the world today. “He exemplified the spirit of American ingenuity,” Barack Obama noted in his tribute to Jobs. By harnessing his talent for storytelling, Jobs brought joy to millions of children and grownups alike the world over. Jobs was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last. Because he did, he transformed our lives, redefined entire industries, and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history: he changed the way each of us sees the world. Thinking Differently Before your invention takes place, you must have thought differently. Therefore, the two works interchangeably. Successful entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs understand this better than most. Your mind set affects what you believe is possible, and that will dictate what actions you take in your life and business. Your thoughts will either help or hurt your business. The way you think is one of your most valuable assets as an entrepreneur. Did Job think differently? Of course, he did. I do not want to bore you with many of his inventions. “He thought differently,” said Manatt Digital Media CEO, Peter Csathy. Conclusion Here should be your take-away from this piece: Start thinking differently Pay attention to details Be innovative Start solving problems. Have a good succession plan, just as Jobs handed over to Tim Cook. One guy I will surely write about in the future is Elon Musk, the brain behind Tesla, the innovation that does bring very good news to oil producing economies. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The Cupertino-based company also released a red iPhone 7. Mac Rumors has the news. “The new 9.7-inch iPad is equipped with a faster Apple A9 chip and brighter Retina display compared to the iPad Air 2, which has been discontinued. It is also somewhat thicker and heavier than the iPad Air 2 since it lacks a fully laminated display with anti-reflective coating in order to keep costs down.” The article adds that the iPad’s specs are identical to the iPad Air 2. It has a 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution screen, an 8MP rear camera, and two speakers. The update to the 9.7 iPad Pro didn’t happen this week as expected. The new 9.7-inch iPad starts off at a very reasonable $329 for a 32GB model. Apple also put a special edition red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus on sale. One can purchase the red iPhone 7 for $749 (128 GB storage) or $869 (256GB). The red iPhone 7 Plus will cost $849 (128GB) or $969 (256GB). Those who are thinking of getting the updated iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus may want to wait another six months for the iPhone 8 series, which is said to be a huge upgrade on the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. However, it’s still up in the air if the iPhone 8 will have a curved screen. Will the iPhone 8 have curved screen like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge? [Image by Richard Drew/Getty Images] Recently, MacRumors reported that the iPhone 8 may not have the curved OLED screen that it was rumored to have. However, Apple Insider reported that Apple’s next smartphone may indeed have a curved OLED screen, but it won’t be curved as much as some had hoped. For others, this is okay since they don’t like looking at curved videos or photos. There are also some who think that a curved screen takes away important real estate space on a smartphone. Those who are planning on getting an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus in September may have a difficult time. As the Irish Examiner points out, the iPhone 8 will only be available in limited quantities when it hits stores in September. A recently conducted research report from a Barclays analysts predicts that a majority of the stock will be released later in the fourth quarter of 2017. Many people think Apple releases a limited quantity of a new product in order to create hype. When the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were released in 2014, there were also limited quantities, especially when it came to the 6 Plus. Soon, there were news reports of people camping out at different Apple Stores each night in hopes of getting their desired phone. Apple certainly took advantage of the hype. The AirPods are still hard to find. [Image by Daryl Deino] Speaking of hard to get, Apple’s AirPods are still almost impossible to find. If you try and buy the AirPods at Apple’s site, you will notice that most stores say they won’t have them in stock until May 15. However, stock has been trickling in to some stores during the week, even if a particular store doesn’t indicate stock of the AirPods on the website. The best thing to do is to go to an Apple Store location right when they open in the morning. Some people on Twitter are reporting actually seeing stock at an Apple Store.

Haha — MJ Naval (@THEmj_naval) March 23, 2017 It’s obvious that Apple didn’t predict what a big hit the AirPods would become. Not only have Apple’s buds earned excellent reviews from critics and consumers, but the Cupertino-based company is still having a hard time keeping up with demand three months after their release. While Apple’s stock may have declined in 2016, 2017 is a different story. The success of the AirPods and the hype for the iPhone 8 has put Apple back on top.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Apple Disputes Hacker Group's Claim of Massive iCloud Breach By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: MARCH 23 2017 Contrary to a hacker group's claims, Apple said none of its systems, including iCloud and Apple ID, have been breached recently. However, the company said it is keeping an eye open for potential problems and recommends that users employ security measures such as strong passwords and two-factor authentication. According to a report Tuesday in Motherboard, a group calling itself the "Turkish Crime Family" claimed it could remotely access hundreds of millions of Apple accounts and could use that access to wipe users' devices. The hacker(s) said they would do so on April 7 unless Apple paid a ransom of $75,000 to $100,000. In another Apple-related development, the news leak organization WikiLeaks today posted new documents from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that purport to show how the agency can infect Apple products to gain persistent access to Mac computers, iPhones, and other devices. The new disclosure is the second WikiLeaks release of classified "Vault 7" information from the CIA. Apple: 'No Breaches of Any Systems' "There have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems including iCloud and Apple ID," a company spokesperson told us today via email. "The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services." Writing in Motherboard earlier this week, Joseph Cox said the self-identified "Turkish Crime Family" had provided his publication with screenshots purportedly showing the hackers' email conversations with members of Apple's security team. One of the email conversations appeared to show Apple employees asking the hackers to remove a YouTube video showing how they were able to access one woman's iCloud account. "This is a weird story, and I'm skeptical of some of the details," cybersecurity expert Bruce Schneier noted this morning on his blog. "Presumably Apple has decided that it's smarter to spend the money on secure backups and other security measures than to pay the ransom. But we'll see how this unfolds." U.K.-based security analyst Graham Cluley echoed that skepticism, but added he hoped the reports called attention to the importance of Apple users employing strong security precautions. "What we don't know is whether the email exchanges between the hackers and Apple are real or faked, and -- indeed -- whether the so-called 'Turkish Crime Gang' really has access to a large number of Apple users' credentials," Cluley wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. "Other than the video of the elderly woman's iCloud account being broken into, there has been no evidence shared with the media to suggest that the hackers' claims of having gained access to a large database of Apple usernames and passwords are legitimate." CIA 'Infecting iPhone Supply Chain' Earlier today, WikiLeaks posted new information on its Web site that it said shows several CIA projects can gain persistent access to Apple devices via malware. Documents published alongside the WikiLeaks news release referenced projects with names such as "Sonic Screwdriver," "DarkSeaSkies," and "Triton." The WikiLeaks documents are the second set of "Vault 7" files to be published by the organization since earlier this month. The first cache of more than 8,700 documents, published March 7, revealed details about CIA efforts to hack vehicle controls, smart appliances, phones, and computers. One of the new documents released today is what WikiLeaks said is a manual for an iPhone-targeting CIA tool called NightSkies 1.2. "Noteworthy is that NightSkies had reached 1.2 by 2008, and is expressly designed to be physically installed onto factory fresh iPhones, i.e., the CIA has been infecting the iPhone supply chain of its targets since at least 2008," the WikiLeaks news release stated. "While CIA assets are sometimes used to physically infect systems in the custody of a target it is likely that many CIA physical access attacks have infected the targeted organization's supply chain including by interdicting mail orders and other shipments (opening, infecting, and resending) leaving the United States or otherwise."

Apple: New iPad Line, Red iPhone 7 Next Article > WikiLeaks: CIA Hacked Apple Devices in Ways Users Can't Fix By Anick Jesdanun PUBLISHED: MARCH 24 2017 New documents from WikiLeaks point to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple's iPhones and Mac computers using techniques that users couldn't disable by resetting their devices. Security experts say the exploits are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. They say that many of the tricks are older -- the iPhone hack involves the 3G model from 2008, for instance. The techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. "The most notable part of this latest WikiLeaks release is that it shows the CIA doing exactly what we pay them to -- exploit specific targets with limited attacks to support our national interests," said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security research firm Securosis. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance "targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans." The agency declined further comment Thursday. Document Dump The leaks Thursday come about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. The latest disclosures are much more focused and consist of just 12 documents, all involving Apple products. The documents describe techniques for rewriting devices' firmware in ways that would maintain a hacker's access even if a user resets a phone or computer to factory settings. Doing so wipes out all apps and the operating system and installs a clean version; it is an extreme measure sometimes used to deal with technical problems, but is also the sort of step that someone suspicious of surveillance might take when getting a brand new phone. A December 2008 document describes "NightSkies," a tool apparently designed to target the iPhone 3G; the document claims it can retrieve files such as contact lists and call logs and execute other commands. WikiLeaks suggested in a press release that the "CIA has been infecting the iPhone supply chain of its targets since at least 2008." However, the document describes only how to install the malware on a "factory fresh" version of the 3G -- specifically, the iPhone 3G running the 2.1 version of Apple's operating system, both of which are now nine years old. Caveats Galore But infecting all phones somewhere in the manufacturing process would be extremely difficult, said Mogull, especially given multiple layers of inspections conducted by Apple and its contractors. At most, he said, the CIA might have shipped a rogue phone individually to a target. And while it's possible that the CIA developed similar techniques for later iPhone models, Mogull said iPhones from the past few years have much greater security, including digital security certificates that cannot be overwritten. A flag would be raised during the setup process if certificates do not match. Johannes Ullrich, director of the Internet Storm Center at the SANS Institute, said NightSkies might not even be a current project given that the document was last updated in 2008, while the leaks appear to have come in 2016. Other documents released describe similar exploits for Mac computers. One hides in the firmware of Apple's Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter and requires someone to plug in that adapter to install the malware. Another targets a specific Mac model, the MacBook Air with the Leopard version of the Mac OS system -- current at the time, but now seven generations old. Ullrich said the Mac exploits all appear old. He added that some of the Thunderbolt issues have been fixed to make the hack more difficult to pull off. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

A government official from the state of Karnataka said that Taiwanese firm Wistron will begin manufacturing all three handset models at a plant in the capital of Bangalore, starting with the iPhone 6 and 6s in the next four to six weeks and subsequently the SE in the coming three months. Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT That should help bring down the cost of Apple devices in India, where the Cupertino-based company’s devices have historically commanded a high price, partly due to import taxes. When the iPhone 7 launched in India, it cost roughly 40 percent more than it did in the US, at a price of $903 versus $649. According to CMR analyst Faisal Kawoosa, manufacturing locally could see iPhone prices drop by as much as $100. It’s interesting to note that the iPhone 6 is reportedly going to be manufactured here, as the device is nearly three years old at this point. It’s even been removed from Apple’s India site to make way for the more recent 6s and 7 models. Plus, the company is expected to unveil the iPhone 8 this September with a 5.8-inch OLED screen. The inclusion of the cheaper SE – which was launched last March at $399 – is understandable, as it just got a storage bump to a minimum of 32GB at the same starting price and is a good entry-level offering for an emerging market like India. With lower prices, Apple might just have a chance at competing with the likes of Samsung and Lenovo, which currently hold 25 percent and 9 percent of India’s smartphone market share.

By Los Angeles Times Mar 21, 2017 at 3:43 pm | Print View Apple Inc. announced a new, cheaper iPad and RED versions of its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Tuesday. All three products will be available to order online and in stores beginning Friday, it said. Apple’s new iPad boasts a 9.7-inch Retina display, a more powerful (A9) computer chip and a 10-hour battery life. The starting price for a 32-gigabyte model with Wi-Fi is $329, down from $399. An option with cellular service is available for $459. The new iPad may be part of the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant’s gambit to resurrect tablet sales. At 22 percent market share, Apple still is the largest player in the tablet game, according to International Data Corp. However, the tablet market has been shrinking, with shipments declining 15.6 percent in 2016 from 2015. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT) RED special edition, with a bright red matte finish, mark 10 years of Apple’s partnership with (RED), a branding campaign that works to raise money and awareness about HIV and AIDS. “The introduction of this special edition iPhone in a gorgeous red finish is our biggest (PRODUCT) RED offering to date,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a news release. “We can’t wait to get it into customers’ hands.” Brands partner to create (RED) products and pledge a percentage of sales revenue directly to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a public-private financing body that supports prevention, treatment and care of these diseases in more than 100 countries. The Global Fund spends 100 percent of revenue from (RED) products on HIV-AIDS programs. The red iPhones are a special edition of Apple’s existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The regular iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch screen; its lowest-priced option has 32 gigabytes of memory and costs $649. The lowest-priced red version has 128 gigabytes and costs $749.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « A Report Ranking Leading Tech Companies on Digital Rights & Privacy Ranked Google #1 while Punishing Apple at #7 | Main | Nokia Seeks International Judicial Assistance to Obtain Documents & Deposition Testimony from Samsung in their Case against Apple » March 25, 2017 A Grieving Family Lashes out at Apple over Denial of Access to their Son's iPad that Contained Wishes for his Funeral   A new report published by the Daily Mail is yet another heartbreaking story – and one that could even anger some. The report is titled "Grieving family slam Apple for refusing to unlock their dead son's iPad so they could read his funeral wishes after he died from bone cancer."   The report states that a "heartbroken family were unable to give their dead son a fitting send-off because Apple refused to unlock the iPad containing his funeral wishes.   Liam Wright, 18, who died of bone cancer in December, had noted his last wishes on the tablet because he couldn't bear to talk about it in person with his family.   But his relatives, of Brotton, North Yorkshire, were forced to have the service without knowing what he wanted - because Apple reportedly would not unlock the device after a software update.   The family asked Liam for the code to his tablet but he was too ill to respond, which is why they contacted the media firm.   Apple did not help and - when asked a second time - refused to unlock it unless the family sent them a death certificate and solicitor's letter which cost them £120, Ms Lamb claimed.   She claimed Apple then told them they had not sent the relevant information and now want a court order costing them £360." You could read more about the story here.   Damn I hate to read heartbreaking stories like this. Yes of course the family should have urged their son to give someone his password "just in case" he couldn't at a later date. He was 18 not 8 and should have known better. Yet on the flip side, the family did their best under the circumstances to send Apple a legal death certificate so that they could gain access to their son's iPad in a timely manner but Apple deemed it to be insufficient.   Where on Apple's website do they clearly lay out the rules for grieving families to follow to gain access to data on an iDevice? Shouldn't Apple provide clear step-by-step instructions on their Legal site for families to follow? And if a family sends them a death certificate, shouldn't Apple show the family some leniency for trying to do the right thing? Couldn't Apple have gotten the ball rolling in saving the data as they waited to receive the right damn paperwork?   Of course you can argue cases like this both ways until you're blue in the face and Apple will never spell out their position. Is it because they fear that the FBI or other government agency would use those clear cut instructions for families against them in some way? Who knows. But no matter how you look at it, everyone loses here. I'm sure Apple has lost more customers if not everyone in the family who hears their story and the family loses for knowing what was on their son's mind, a goodbye letter and more is lost forever.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

clock menu more-arrow Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Exclusive: How Drake and Apple Music broke streaming records with More Life by Micah Singleton@MicahSingleton Mar 25, 2017, 5:05pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Drake’s latest project More Life was streamed 300 million times worldwide in its first week on Apple Music, Republic Records tells The Verge, surpassing the 250 million streams the label said Views, an Apple Music exclusive, did in its first week last year. The biggest first week for any album on a single service is Ed Sheeran’s Divide, which was streamed 375 million times on Spotify. The label also says early calculations for More Life have it at around 600 million streams worldwide, which would be a record for an album. In the US, More Life was streamed 384.8 million times on all services in its first week, setting a new record — previously held by Views — and earning the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart with 505,000 units. After setting a record with 89.9 million streams in its first 24 hours on Apple’s streaming service — over 33 million streams ahead of Sheeran’s Divide in its first 24 hours on Spotify, which has around 80 million more users — it’s clear Drake and his favorite music service have cracked the streaming formula. So how did Apple manage to break a record with an album that's also available on Spotify, with only 20 million users compared to Spotify’s 100 million? The answer, according to the Apple Music team, is the power of Beats 1 and OVO Sound Radio. For Drake, Beats 1 has essentially replaced SoundCloud, the platform he once dominated and released singles through — a move that Apple Music’s head of content Larry Jackson and Apple VP of apps and content Robert Kondrk said was a risk for Drake at the time. “We weren’t a proven hit, we weren’t a proven entity at all, whatsoever,” says Jackson. SoundCloud just got a shoutout from Chance the Rapper at the Grammys, but the service has been having a rough time since Drake left, with Recode reporting it recently had to raise a $70 million debt round just to stay afloat. “Drake and Oliver and Future [The Prince] were the first to do this with us.” Drake has been tied at the hip with Apple Music since it launched in 2015, releasing a series of exclusive songs and albums through the service and on OVO Sound Radio, with his co-manager Oliver El-Khatib serving as the usual host. And More Life debuted on the most recent episode. “What we saw on Drake’s radio show were TV numbers,” says Jimmy Iovine. The episode set the record for the most listened to Beats 1 show to date. “It’s the biggest radio station in the world. There’s no way you’re going to find another station that has as many concurrent listeners and audience-wise as Beats 1, period,” Jackson said. (Apple declined to offer specific listener numbers for Beats 1.) “If you rewind back to July of 2015, and those records that rolled out like ‘Back to Back,’ — ‘Hotline Bling’ debuted on OVO Sound Radio first, ‘Charged Up’ debuted there first — all these records debuted in a space that was really still new and nascent, and [Drake] made it his own. You can glance over it, but we created this idea that was really great for him, and he took advantage of it,” Jackson said. “Drake and Oliver and [Drake’s other co-manager] Future [The Prince] were the first to do this with us.” “He knows what he’s doing, and he knows his audience. And he knows it’s going to work when it’s ready.” We learned so much from just building what Drake needed,” Iovine added. “He had the idea, we kind of just built and supported around him, and we’ve learned a lot from that, and the entire industry has learned a lot from that.” Zane Lowe, the head of Beats 1, noted that Drake doesn’t rush his work, and that has helped him mellow out. “I mean what he’s taught me just in terms of the parameters of broadcasting is remarkable. I remember when we were first waiting for those shows to come in [OVO Sound Radio] and they’d come in 20 minutes late, and I’d be freaking out because we’d run over our start time. Now the show comes in an hour late and we’re all just like cool.” Lowe continued, “He knows what he’s doing, and he knows his audience. And he knows it’s going to work when it’s ready. The best thing that anyone — including myself — can do is get out of the way.” “As Jimmy would put it, we really do give them the keys and let them drive, and Drake has done that,” adds Kondrk. Now an audience which once went to SoundCloud to hear the latest Drake music heads to Beats 1 first. Kondrk describes the relationship between Apple Music and Beats 1 like an amusement park — once you’re inside the Apple Music app to listen to Beats 1, it’s only natural you’ll stay in it to stream the songs afterward. “The music is debuting through OVO Sound Radio first, no one really ever leaves the amusement park, and that’s why the numbers make sense,” Kondrk says. “It’s a new paradigm that we’ve really created here for someone like him to come in and be a genius and take full advantage of everything we have to offer.” Zane Lowe said that Drake has been able to create cultural moments when he live-streams an album on his show, something that other artists like Future have taken advantage of. “When I hear a record go out like [More Life], I’m transported into the same place that I hope millions of other people are, which is I’m listening to it at the same time and I’m following the reaction on social media, and I’m getting texts from my friends in different parts of the world,” says Lowe. “If you’re going to have an era or moment where you can look back and say that the experience got better, or the music sounded better, or we shifted gears into new technology and made it work, it has to be spearheaded by the artist, always,” Lowe says. “If you look back at any great era, it’s always one or two artists that got it, and embraced it and took it and made it their own, and that’s how they owned that era. Drake has done that, and his camp have done that, and that’s why it’s such an exciting time.” It’s undeniable that Apple Music has been able to capitalize on its ability to debut albums live across the globe, but an additional — and arguably bigger — part of Apple Music’s success with Drake and other artists has been the run of exclusives it has kept up over the past 18 months. Somewhat surprisingly, More Life wasn’t an Apple Music exclusive. “No one really ever leaves the amusement park.” “We didn’t have Drake’s album exclusive, but it was fantastic what worked out,” says Iovine. “We’re just about ideas. Whoever has a great idea we like to follow it and execute it. [Drake] had the idea, we kind of just built and supported around him.” Iovine also said that Apple Music can’t become just a “utility,” noting that the company had to stay nimble, and working with artists like Drake is a key to avoiding that distinction. “We’re always searching for ideas and new ways to do things. I use this word quite often but it’s so true. These [streaming] services cannot be utilities, it’s not enough. They have to be — they almost have to make music a verb — it has to just move. And that’s what we’re trying to do.” Iovine continued, “Two years ago, people would’ve thought we were crazy with what we were doing with Drake. And we are starting things with other people that in two years will look as interesting as this.” Entertainment With S-Town, the makers of Serial test the waters of binge-listening Entertainment Our best black filmmakers are finding fresh opportunities on TV Entertainment Edgar Wright’s Baby Driver pushes up its theatrical release to June View all stories in Culture Loading comments...

In May last year, the Beijing intellectual property bureau had ruled that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili with its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and would be barred from selling those models. Sales however were not suspended while Apple appealed against the administrative order. The Intellectual Property Court in Beijing last Friday ruled in favour of the California-based firm. The court "quashes the decision of the bureau" and "recognises that Apple... has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili", according to the verdict reported by the state judicial daily Renmin Fayuan Ribao. The intellectual property bureau, an administrative body of Beijing municipality, had ruled that the two Apple phones infringed a Baili design patent. It had accused the US firm of having "copied" the exterior design of Baili's 100C smartphone, which is characterised by a curved edge and rounded corners. But, the Beijing court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features that "completely change the effect of the entire product... and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers", finding Baili's claim was without legal basis. When it took on Apple in December 2014, Baili was a promising electronics firm, backed by Internet giant Baidu and eager to tap the telecoms boom. But since then, the company has collapsed, hit by public criticism of its products, seen as being of poor quality, and more so by China's ultra-competitive smartphone market which has seen many start-ups go under. Apple has already had intellectual property problems in China. In May last year, a maker of "iphone" branded leather goods won a lawsuit filed by Apple, as the court ruled Xintong Tiandi had registered the word as a trademark in 2007, while Apple smartphones did not officially go on sale in China until 2009.

Now, Chinese media outlet Caxin has sat down with Cook for a full interview, talking Apple’s goals in the country, its Didi investment, and more… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Cook explained that Apple isn’t just investing in China to access the markers, but rather focus on creating jobs and improving the lives of the people who live there. Cook’s comments come as Apple faces increased competition in the Chinese market from local brands like Huawei. “We’re not just someone who’s here to access the market,” Cook told Caixin. “We’ve created almost 5 million jobs in China. I’m not sure there are too many companies, domestic or foreign, who can say that. … There’s deep roots here. I think very highly of the country and the people in it. We’re here to stay.” Last year, Apple announced a $1 billion investment in Chinese Uber competitor Didi Chuxing, something that surprised many people and gave Apple a seat on the company’s board. In this interview, Cook touched more on the Didi investment, explaining that he was impressed by the leadership of the company more than anything: “We’ve never invested in a developer before, and yet we met Didi, and Didi was so impressive. One, we thought their management was so great, we thought their idea was great,” Cook said. “And we liked the holistic view, they were doing everything from taxi to the more-traditional private-car thing. There was a strategic alignment. They needed some funds to continue to grow. We really want them to be successful and be global.” Continuing his comments from over the weekend, Cook also touched more on globalization. Cook explained that he realizes globalization doesn’t help everyone out in its current state, but that it’s up to policy makers to address the discrepancies: “My view on globalization is that you can think of three groups of people. There’s a group of people that globalization has helped tremendously. There’s a group that globalization did not help. There’s a group of people that globalization hurt,” Cook said. “Globalization has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But I also recognize is that it did not help everyone.” The full interview can be read here.

The entire world is highly anticipating March 29th to come because that’s when Samsung will unveil its Galaxy S8 smartphone flagship. The mobile handset is expected to take the market by storm, especially since the internet is filled with rumors and speculations about it. In fact, many believe that loyal Apple fans are actually looking to move over to Samsung’s Android camp. This shouldn’t come as a shock to anyone but Apple is infamous for not paying attention to its customer feedback. This is why all Apple products are overpriced even though they don’t necessarily bring something innovative to the market. In addition, last’s year iPhone 7 didn’t sell that well because Apple decided to keep using the same iPhone 6S design and this caused many Apple fans to switch sides. The only problem that Apple fans have when they think about purchasing a Galaxy S smartphone is the difference in operating system. Obviously all iPhones run on iOS, while Samsung’s smartphones use Android OS. Fortunately, iPhone owners are allowed to transfer files such as text-messages, mails and even music to Android devices. How to Transfer Data from iOS to Android iPhone owners that are already using a Gmail account should be happy to know that they do not have to put in any effort. All that they have to do is to sign in with their account on the newly purchased Galaxy S8 and then enable “sync”. All that’s left now is to access Settings – Mail – Accounts and to toggle on the Calendar, Mail and Contacts. Now to full-on iOS users, they can transfer their important data through third party applications. Syncing up data is quite simple actually all that users have to do is download and install SmoothSync for Cloud Contacts and SmoothSync for Cloud Calendar. All that’s left now is to sign up with an iCloud account and enable syncing. When it comes to photos and videos, it’s even easier. iPhone owners can just install the “Google Photos” app and upload the files. Now download and install the app once again but on the designated Galaxy S8 smartphone.

The AR glasses, as you can imagine, will take a long time to arrive. In the near future however, Apple is planning to integrate augmented reality features to its iPhone models. Apple has apparently directed some members from the iPhone camera team to work on AR-related features for the next iPhones. While specific details haven’t been revealed yet, some examples of AR features on the iPhone could include the ability to take a picture and change the depth of the photo or specific objects in the photo, isolating an object such as a person’s head in an image, as well as placing effects and objects on a person. All of these features will rely on depth sensing technology, using algorithms from PrimeSense, an Israeli firm that Apple acquired in 2013. While AR may not be as popular as VR right now, it is expected to gain popularity in the coming years according to many analysts. According to Global Market Insights, the market for AR products is expected to touch $165 billion by 2024. In the future, analysts believe dedicated AR devices will replace the iPhone.

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT) RED Special Edition models are said to be in recognition of Apple’s 10-year partnership with (RED) to fight the spread of AIDS. “Since we began working with (RED) 10 years ago, our customers have made a significant impact in fighting the spread of AIDS through the purchase of our products, from the original iPod nano (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition all the way to today’s lineup of Beats products and accessories for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “The introduction of this special edition iPhone in a gorgeous red finish is our biggest (PRODUCT)RED offering to date in celebration of our partnership with (RED), and we can’t wait to get it into customers’ hands.” The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus PRODUCT (RED) models will be available only in 128GB and 256GB storage variants at the same price points as the other standard colors that the two smartphones are offered in. They will begin shipping to consumers by the end of this month in the United States, Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, UAE, and the UK. In other countries, the two models are expected to begin shipping in April.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile This photo of a caseless Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus will haunt your dreams Zach Epstein @zacharye March 22nd, 2017 at 1:57 PM Share Tweet Following Tuesday’s announcements, Apple has now introduced not one or two but three new colors to its flagship iPhone lineup for this generation. The most recent is a deep red that matches earlier special-edition Product Red devices. But before that, Apple added two fresh colors to its catalog when it first released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus back in September. The first was a matte black that replaces Apple’s space gray color with a stealth black color, and the second was a color unlike anything we’ve ever seen before. Dubbed “Jet Black,” the glossy, mirror finish instantly became the most desirable new iPhone color available, and it remains the most attractive option out there… with one big caveat. Apple’s Jet Black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are indeed absolutely gorgeous — until you actually start using them. Don't Miss: New leaks show how impressive Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design truly is Apple’s smooth and glossy Jet Black finish is indeed an industry first, but unfortunately the finish is nowhere near as durable as it is attractive. Jet Black iPhones are so prone to scratching that Apple had to include the following disclaimer on its website: The high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process. Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use. If you are concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iPhone. That’s a nice way to put it. Another way to put it is this: your phone is going to get scratched up as soon as you start using it. A case offers some protection for the Jet Black finish, of course, but then a new question presents itself. If you’re going to cover up your iPhone with a case, why get Jet Black to begin with? So, a number of people have decided to go caseless. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to work out very well.

(AFP) BEIJING: A Beijing court has overturned a ruling that Apple’s iPhone 6 violated a Chinese manufacturer’s patent, which saw the US tech giant ordered to cease selling the smartphone in China. In May last year the Beijing Intellectual Property Office (BJIPO) had ruled that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili with its iPhone6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and would be barred from selling those models. Sales, however, were not suspended while Apple appealed against the administrative order. The Intellectual Property Court (IPC) in Beijing on Friday ruled in favor of the California-based firm. The court quashed the decision of the BJIPO and “recognizes that Apple ... has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili,” according to the verdict reported by the state judicial daily Renmin Fayuan Ribao. The BJIPO, an administrative body of Beijing municipality, had ruled that the two Apple phones infringed a Baili design patent. It had accused the US firm of having “copied” the exterior design of Baili’s 100C smartphone, which is characterized by a curved edge and rounded corners. But the Beijing court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features that “completely change the effect of the entire product ... and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers,” finding Baili’s claim was without legal basis. When it took on Apple in December 2014, Baili was a promising electronics firm, backed by Internet giant Baidu and eager to tap the telecoms boom. But since then the company has collapsed, hit by public criticism of its products seen as poor quality and more so by China’s ultra-competitive smartphone market, which has seen many start-ups go under. Even Apple is under pressure. While China, along with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, remains its second-largest market after the US, the Cupertino-based company saw its turnover in this “Greater China” region fall 12 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Apple’s market share has plummeted in mainland China, falling behind local competitors such as telecoms giant Huawei, newcomers Oppo and Vivo, and “Internet of things” pioneer Xiaomi. Apple has already had intellectual property problems in China. In May 2016 a maker of “iPhone” branded leather goods won a lawsuit filed by Apple as the court ruled Xintong Tiandi had registered the word as a trademark in 2007, while Apple smartphones did not officially go on sale in China until 2009.

Don’t underestimate  the potential of Google Home here as well. The adoption of digital assistants is not expected to happen as easy as it sounds, because this is not a mass-market technology and aside from implementing it hotel operators will have to educate guests how to use it. Technology companies are using hotel rooms as showrooms for new services and devices that can also control so-called smart homes. Currently, Marriott International Inc. is testing devices from Amazon and Apple to determine which is best to let guests turn on lights, close drapes, control room temperature and change television channels via voice command. Last December, the first hotel company to install Alexa-powered Echo devices started with suites at its flagship must-see Wynn Las Vegas property. Amazon and Apple are competing for dominance in the nascent market, which promises to let consumers access and manage household systems such as heating, cooling, lighting and entertainment by speaking a request at home or using a smartphone from afar. Businesses from homebuilders and carmakers to hotel operators are adopting smart home technology for the average consumer. Read more: Why People Buy Smart Home Technology Hotel rooms are an ideal place for Amazon and Apple to showcase their devices and let guests see how they can be used to make their lives more convenient. It is the same as hotel rooms installing iPhone docking stations years ago so people could enjoy their own music in their rooms. A key question is whether the interaction will be personalized, allowing guests familiar with the devices to log into their own accounts, or instead use a standard set of skills relevant to a hotel stay, like getting news reports, checking weather forecasts or calling for an Uber — commands more appropriate for those unfamiliar with the technology. A digital assistant as Amazon Echo can be used to control lights, but the focus is on using Alexa as a personal concierge for ordering room service, or requesting towels or toothpaste from housekeeping.  Eventually, the digital assistants will be able to perform more concierge-like services and connect with a guest’s personal device to do things such as set an automatic wake-up temperature or have the drapes open at a certain time. Hotels are just one new avenue for Amazon to get its technology in front of more customers. Ford Motor Co. said in January that it plans to begin offering Alexa this summer in vehicles equipped with its Sync 3 infotainment system. An automotive version of the Echo assistant will let drivers order items on Amazon, listen to audio books, play music, check news, search for restaurants and get directions. Amazon also is working with BMW to integrate Alexa into its luxury cars. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has the Google Assistant, which powers its Home internet-connected speaker and Android phones, including its in-house Pixel handsets, and is collaborating with Hyundai Motor Co. on voice commands for its cars.

In order to make the device a reality, Winget had to transfer over the logic board and Touch ID button from another Jet Black device as the two components are linked together.

Maybe high school students but that's about it. Look at his style - it's awful. Just have a look at his apartment interior. It looks like shit. That gray ikea couch in the corner is garbage and the floor light in the opposite corner is something a student should have in their dorm room. His taste is bad. Also all the garbage he likes combining wood with electronic components like the keyboard has been done ad nauseam and it never works. Slapping wood all over headphones, keyboards, cameras, etc. is just done to fill the marketing void and rarely looks good or makes sense. He's acting as though he actually has creative talent because he took a black face and combined it with the red iPhone body... This isn't interesting and this guy is not original.

In fact, Apple ranked seventh in the top twelve in the 'Internet and Mobile' sector of the report. The report grades transparency, not just conduct and overall wasn't complementary of any of the twenty-two firms when it came to defending your freedom of speech and privacy.   On Thursday the Ranking Digital Rights launched its 2017 Corporate Accountability Index which ranks 22 of the world's most powerful telecommunications, internet and mobile companies that disclosed commitments and policies affecting user's freedom of expression and privacy.   The company noted that "People around the world increasingly rely on the internet and digitally networked devices in all aspects of their lives. But do we have a global information ecosystem in which future generations' rights can be respected? Unfortunately, the answer is 'no.'   Findings showed that companies did not disclose enough information about policies affecting users' rights—and as a result most of the world's internet users lack the information they need to make informed choices.   Project director Rebecca MacKinnon stated that "There is tremendous room for improvement by all companies.' despite positive steps by some companies since organization released its inaugural Index in 2015. Only two companies—Google and Microsoft—scored more than 60 percent on this year's Index, with the remaining evaluated receiving failing grades.   Findings showed that Apple's iOS, Google's Android, and Samsung's implementation of Android all offered poor disclosure of policies affecting users' freedom of expression and privacy. This is a particular concern given that most of the world's new internet users are coming online with smartphones.   The report further noted that "It is possible that both Apple and Samsung may have internal policies and practices aimed at protecting users' freedom of expression and privacy that they do not formally disclose to the public. However the Index only gives credit for policies that are publicly accessible and presented in a company's policy documents. We take this approach as a way to encourage companies to formalize their commitments into policy so that users can make informed decisions about the products and services they use.   Leading executives at Apple for instance have made numerous statements in the media about the company's commitments to privacy and security—and the consensus in the technical community is that Apple's products are the most secure on the market. However its commitments in this regard were not always clearly specified in the policy documents evaluated for this Index.   In respect to online stores, the report noted that "The Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Samsung Galaxy Apps store are chokepoints for freedom of expression. All three mobile ecosystems failed to sufficiently disclose policies affecting users' freedom of expression. While Google's Android disclosed more than its peers, no company provided enough information to enable app users and app developers to fully understand what kinds of content can be created and shared, what types of activities are prohibited, or the consequences for violating these rules."   For the record, 'Ranking Digital Rights' (RDR) is a non-profit research initiative working with an international network of partners to promote greater respect for freedom of expression and privacy rights among information communications technology companies. The study is in line with the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.   To learn more about the full Ranking Digital Rights report click here.   While our report focused on the main parts relating to Apple, the full report actually expands to cover 10 additional companies in the telecom sector that may interest some. For sure the study will be lacking in that space due to the ruling by the U.S. Senate this week that rolls back an FCC rule that required internet-service providers to obtain customers permission before selling their information to third parties.   Now for the Punch Line   Update: If you're scratching your head as to how Google is being praised as the leader in Digital Rights and privacy, there could be a clear reason for that.  A 2015 report by the U.K. tech site called 'The Register' claims that Eric Schmidt is behind the foundation writing the report.   According to The Register: " Just fancy that! A Washington think tank chaired by Eric Schmidt, Alphabet Inc’s executive chairman, has given Alphabet Inc. an award for "protecting your digital rights”.   Schmidt became executive chairman of the New America Foundation, which had built a strong reputation as a non-partisan and imaginative policy think tank, in 2008.   The following year, the foundation created an “Open Technology Initiative” and the think tank began to march in lockstep with Google’s own policy agenda.   This is called 'policy laundering' – the act of legitimizing a policy, or attempting to seize control of a debate, via third parties. Another useful description is 'carousel propaganda,' coined by blogger Frank Fisher, an analogue of 'carousel fraud.'    This week the foundation trumpeted the first results of its “Ranking Digital Rights” project. Coming up smelling of roses were Google, “the highest ranking internet company”, and Vodafone. The team made a gloomy conclusion: "Nearly half the companies in the Index scored less than 25 per cent, showing a serious deficit of respect for users’ freedom of expression and privacy."   Two years later and Eric Schmidt's "project" continues to provide Google with a resounding win over Apple on Privacy. When Apple's CEO published Apple's position on Privacy, hinting that Google sells your private information, Eric Schmidt basically called Cook a liar. Hiding behind an organization that just happens to give Google a glowing privacy ranking is as sleazy as it gets. I have no understanding how this is even legal.    When Apple's Steve Jobs invited Schmidt to sit on Apple's board, he sat through countless meetings about the iPhone before the iPhone was launched. Never once did he tell Jobs that he had to recuse himself because his company was developing a competing product (Android). Why Apple didn't sue Schmidt on this back then remains a mystery to this day. But Schmidt was sleazy then and the new study noted above shows that he'll go to any length to paint Google the opposite to what it really is. Schmidt fits  the classic definition of a wolf in sheep's clothing. Of course this is my opinion and you could make a judgement on this as you please.    As a second source for this story connecting 'Ranking Digital Rights' to the 'New America Foundation' behind this study is a 2016 report by the U.K.'s Guardian here. Wikipedia also links Schmidt to this foundation as well.   In the end, I'm sure that the findings of Ranking Digital Rights report will raise the ire in Apple fans.

That’s the question hacking collective Turkish Crime Family seems to be asking by blackmailing Apple to pay thousands of dollars or have millions of iCloud accounts wiped remotely. The story started a few days ago, when Motherboard reporter Joseph Cox wrote about the hackers, who claim to have access to over 600 million compromised Apple accounts. Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT The group is currently demanding a large ransom from Apple to prevent them wiping millions of iPhones clean on April 7. Accounts differ greatly on how many compromised accounts the hackers have access to, ranging from 300 million to 750 million, in their latest post on Pastebin – of which they claim 250 million are currently active accounts. Apple vehemently denies that their security was breached, a fact that the hackers confirm in the same message. Over past five years, the group claims to have been quietly hoarding accounts ending on @icloud.com, @me.com & mac.com, “due to those domains not having a popular demand in the cracking community.” In an email to TNW, a spokesperson for the group told us they decided to make and publicize this threat now “mainly to spread awareness for Karim Baratov & Kerem Albayrak which both are being detained for the Yahoo hack.” According to an article on PC World, “Karim Baratov, a Canadian national, was indicted last week for allegedly hacking into email accounts at various email providers at the request of two officers from the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB.” But whatever their motivation, the biggest loser in this story is Apple. Even if the hackers have access to only a fraction of the accounts they claim to have, it’s already a huge deal. And going on the sample the hackers sent to TNW, at least a fraction is legit. The hackers have presented the company with a Catch-22: either they pay up and risk public shaming – not to mention that doesn’t solve the real problem of Apple accounts being traded among people with nefarious goals. Or they don’t, and risk however large a number of accounts being wiped. The only other option that remains for Apple is a big one: asking everyone on a @icloud.com, @me.com or @mac.com to reset their password before April 7. All 800 million of them – or about four times the amount of users LinkedIn had to force password reset on after they discovered their breach. Since Apple doesn’t know exactly which accounts are compromised, that would seem the only option they have – aside from backing up all accounts and crossing their fingers, maybe. So what is Apple waiting for? In a statement they said the company was “actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved. “ Are they hoping to catch the people involved before they do actual damage, at the expense of compromised users’ safety? Risky. As long as Apple doesn’t take steps to compel all users to change their passwords, and keeps betting on law enforcement to catch the culprits before they start wiping accounts, the safest bet is to take matter in your own hands. Change your password now. Doing so isn’t giving in to ransom, it’s just good password hygiene – something Apple should encourage instead of suss.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Letters to the editor: 03-26-2017 Saturday Mar 25, 2017 at 10:39 AM Mar 27, 2017 at 11:32 AM Contributed Content ADA gone wild The Americans with Disabilities Act became law in 1990. Most of us know that the truck scales/inspection facilities located on our freeways are operated by the California Highway Patrol. Most are probably not aware that these facilities are owned and maintained by Caltrans. They showed up one day at the tiny scale on SR 91 in Orange county to modify the tiny restroom to make it handicap accessible. Never mind that it is not open to the public, it is located in the officer's work zone behind the counter and officer safety requires it to be off limits to the public. A port-a-potty is located outside for public use. Thousands of dollars were spent to remove a urinal and install the necessary equipment with the necessary dimensions, and to widen the door to the bathroom. As the workers left they asked the officer how she liked it. She said it was pretty, but officers were still the only ones who would use it and they didn't need it, and besides, the outside door leading into the building was too narrow for a wheelchair, so the whole project was a waste of time and money. They shrugged and left, because they had done all that they were told to do, and the other door was not their job. Another year passed and Caltrans showed up to replace the outdoor port-a potty with one that was handicap accessible. Over a period of about 10 years UC Berkeley built up a library of audio and video recordings of class lectures and put them online so the public could tune in and learn for free. They had over 40,000 hours of MOOCs (massive open online courses). A professor at another college complained to the National Association of the Deaf that the course she watched had no captions to accommodate her disability. DOJ investigators were brought in and found inadequate color contrasts (visual obstacle), graphs and charts with multiple colors (color blind obstacle), no captions, etc. UC Berkeley tallied up the cost to right all these wrongs, came up with a figure of $1 million and shut down the whole project on March 15, 2016. Now nobody gets to use this very beneficial free program. According to Walter Olson in his book "The Litigation Explosion," one deaf patient was awarded $400,000 because his rheumatologist failed to provide a sign language interpreter, and a police dispatcher won a settlement for discrimination after she was fired. Her disability was narcolepsy. What has happened to common sense? The ADA needs to be reined in before the insanity of elite stupidity swallows us all. Gabriel Portillo Hesperia Not much of a choice Your endorsement of Apple Valley Choice Energy (AVCE) calls it a clear choice ("The Choice seems clear in Apple Valley," Daily Press, March 12, 2017). This is only the case if you ignore several factors. Here are a couple that come to mind. There is no way to lower costs in any process by inserting a middleman who gets paid for doing nothing. That's exactly what will happen in Apple Valley, because the town is not creating any new electricity, not delivering the electricity, not maintaining the system, and not even doing the billing. Yet it will be collecting money for this. If this were actually a viable business model, everyone could do it and become filthy rich. Also, so-called clean energy is more expensive than electricity from fossil fuel sources. There is no way to replace inexpensive fossil-fuel-generated electricity with expensive "clean" energy and save money. Someone has to subsidize the difference. The town also implies that it will be buying electricity at a lower cost that Southern California Edison. Yeah, right. Finally, if the Town of Apple Valley is short-stopping money that used to go to Edison, that will lower Edison's income, and thus their profits. If they don't make their expected profits, won't they just go to the CPUC and get a rate increase to make up the difference? If so, ratepayers will be paying at least as much as before. So much for the promised savings. In typical Town Hall fashion, this is called a choice even though they automatically sign you up ... kinda like Obamacare. What seems clear is that if this were really a good thing, people would flock to it on their own. The only thing clear about this is that we're not getting all the facts. Greg Raven Apple Valley Party member or patriot The result of the recent Presidential election resulted in a huge number of "silent majority" eligible voters of both parties, union members, and minorities to vote for the Republican candidate. Results show that +/- 5,000,000 less Democrat voters voted for the Democrat candidate in 2016 than in 2012, indicating that they were not enthused with the candidate the Democrat Party leadership foisted on them. Very many of those 5,000,000 unenthused Democrat voters were not pleased with the actions of the Democrat Party candidate/leadership and do not support the post election "rent to riot" actions they seem to be encouraging, as well as their lack of support of even the most basic rules of law and order, rioting, murder, property damage and disregard of civil liberty now occurring every day across the land and ignoring what is best for the country. It is my sincere hope that many of these 5,000,000 registered Democrat voters will finally have had enough of the being "Democrat" because they "have always been" Democrat, and continue to abandon the party leadership that has taken their vote for granted, ignored their needs, and in reality has abandoned them. For too long the Democrat leadership (every Democrat elected Official) has voted unanimously in ways detrimental to Democrat citizens and detrimental to the wishes of the vast majority of all citizens of our great country. It's time for the "silent majority" of Democrats to be counted among the patriots who are supporting change in the way our government responds to our most cherished institutions, traditions, and our unique Constitution and Bill of Rights, that has given individual citizens liberty never known in governance before. Lee Bell Apple Valley Billionaire shows true colors Ralph Nader appeared on Amy Goodman’s show, "Democracy Now," last week to criticize the hypocrisy of President Trump’s budget cuts — no Meals on Wheels for grandma or Head Start for kids, but plenty of money for a national rocket defense shield system. The defense system is a Pentagon darling left over from the Reagan years. Remember Star Wars? It’s a boondoggle that never worked. As the Texas columnist Molly Ivins once said about it, it was like trying to shoot a bullet with a bullet. In 2006 the missile shield defense was tried again when rockets fired from Gaza into Israel brought on “Iron Shield,” using rockets to shoot at rockets. Raytheon and an Israeli corporation collaborated on a system that could not hit incoming rockets when fired either from the side or from down range. Another boondoggle. Yet President Trump has budgeted money to continue the Pentagon’s missile shield program. He is a hypocrite. Mr. Nader noted that the amount being budgeted every year for this boondoggle is equal to the EPA’s annual budget.

Still, there are always those looking to advance their own success and that is why Wall Street believes Apple could very well look into possibly buying Disney. While Disney is one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, there are a few others who can hold their on in their company. One of those companies is Apple who sports cash assets of more than $200 billion and investors are always curious as to what they may do with that excess money. Well, once again, the rumors of Apple looking into buying The Walt Disney Company are coming about and they seems stronger than ever. [Image by Disney] Business Insider states that the belief going around right now is that Apple is looking to buy Disney and RBC analyst Steven Cahill sees it as a possibility. “Bulls think it portends well for a swan song exit via a sale to a giant like AAPL.” As things currently stand, Disney has no less than two dozen huge projects in the works and those are spread across their theme parks and the world of entertainment. In just two short months, Pandora – The World of Avatar will open as a brand new land at Disney’s Animal Kingdom and the hype is at an all-time high. In 2019, Star Wars-themed lands will be opening at Disney’s Hollywood Studios in Walt Disney World and at Disneyland Park in California. Disney will also be opening Toy Story Land at Hollywood Studios in the coming years and add two new ships to its Disney Cruise Line fleet in 2021 and 2023. One of the biggest things that is making Disney so appealing to an investor such as Apple is content and they know that Disney does it well. In 2016 alone, Disney was responsible for half of the top 10 grossing films: Finding Dory Zootopia Star Wars: Rogue One The Jungle Book Captain America: Civil War – Highest grossing film of 2016 The live-action version of Beauty and the Beast has already earned more than $540 million worldwide in one week, according to Box Office Mojo. With many more live remakes of Disney animated classics, Pixar, new animated films, the Star Wars galaxy, and the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is no end to the huge amounts of money that the company will make in theater [Image by Marvel] Now, the idea of Apple buying Disney isn’t necessarily new as The Washington Post reported that the deal was “frighteningly obvious” to happen back in 2014. Of course, nothing has happened as of yet, but the rumors simply won’t go away about this merger or takeover, of sorts. While a deal of this immense size may not happen any year soon, it does seem to be one that keeps coming back around. It may not even happen while current Walt Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger is still in his position even though he did just extend his deal to stay in his current position until 2019, per Fortune. There are a number of things that would have to happen and take place in order for Apple to buy Disney, but it isn’t fundamentally out of the question. Liberty Media Chairman John Malone believes that global companies such as Apple and Disney would be a perfect fit if Disney could just get rid of the domestic-based ESPN. For years now, the idea of Apple actually buying Disney has been rumored and it is something that a lot of people say could never possibly happen. If that truly is the case, though, why do the rumors keep coming up every few months? As Disney continues to broaden its wide span with new additions to Walt Disney World and Disneyland, more Marvel movies, the sports world, and more, it seems only reasonable that a multi-hundred billion giant such as Apple would want to acquire them.

According to the report of the day, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on Shenzhen Baili's patent rights because of similarities to its 100C phone. Our report provided a side by side comparison as noted below to illustrate the absurdity of the claim. We followed up with another report later in June pointing out that the case against Apple was brought by an insolvent entity. Today, a report from China states that the original ruling has now been overturned.   The South China Morning Post reported today that the 'People's Court Daily' reported yesterday that "A Beijing court has overturned a ruling that Apple's iPhone 6 violated a Chinese manufacturer's patent which saw the US tech giant ordered to cease selling the smartphone in Beijing. The court 'quashes the decision of the bureau' and 'recognizes that Apple ... has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili.'"   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

In May last year the Beijing intellectual property bureau had ruled that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili with its iPhone6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and would be barred from selling those models. Sales however were not suspended while Apple appealed against the administrative order. The Intellectual Property Court in Beijing on Friday ruled in favour of the California-based firm. The court "quashes the decision of the bureau" and "recognises that Apple ... has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili", according to the verdict reported by the state judicial daily Renmin Fayuan Ribao. The intellectual property bureau, an administrative body of Beijing municipality, had ruled that the two Apple phones infringed a Baili design patent. It had accused the US firm of having "copied" the exterior design of Baili´s 100C smartphone, which is characterised by a curved edge and rounded corners. But the Beijing court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features that "completely change the effect of the entire product ... and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers," finding Baili´s claim was without legal basis. When it took on Apple in December 2014, Baili was a promising electronics firm, backed by internet giant Baidu and eager to tap the telecoms boom. But since then the company has collapsed, hit by public criticism of its products seen as poor quality and more so by China´s ultra-competitive smartphone market which has seen many start-ups go under. Even Apple is under pressure. While China, along with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, remains its second largest market after the US, the Cupertino-based company saw its turnover in this "Greater China" region fall 12 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Apple´s market share has plummeted in mainland China, falling behind local competitors such as telecoms giant Huawei, newcomers Oppo and Vivo, and "internet of things" pioneer Xiaomi. Apple has already had intellectual property problems in China. In May 2016 a maker of "iphone" branded leather goods won a lawsuit filed by Apple as the court ruled Xintong Tiandi had registered the word as a trademark in 2007, while Apple smartphones did not officially go on sale in China until 2009. 0 0 China court overturns ruling that said Apple violated patent was posted in Sci-Tech of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on March 25, 2017 and was last updated on March 25, 2017.

While the device looks pretty slick on the surface, many people have argued that Apple should have made the front of the device black, as opposed to white. We’ve already shared one concept image that imagines a (RED) iPhone with a black front, but now YouTuber Danny Winget has taken it a step further and actually transformed the device… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Winget posted a video today highlighting the process of turning the (RED) iPhone 7 into the red + black color combination. The process is rather extensive, but nevertheless it is possible. He explains in his video that it’s much more difficult than just swapping out the white front display with a black one. If you do this, you’ll either have a black front with a white Home button, or a black Home button but no Touch ID. This is because the Touch ID sensor is connected to the iPhone’s logic board as a security precaution and thus can’t be switched between devices. In order to get a completely black front with working Touch ID, Winget essentially had to transplant one iPhone into another. He took the logic board and front panel from a Jet Black iPhone 7 and moved it to the PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 7, thus giving him a red back and completely black front. Winget says the process was relatively difficult and time intensive, not to mention expensive. You also lose the water resistant seal around the display in the process. This is how you can put a black display on the new PRODUCT RED iPhone 7 or 7 plus with full functional Touch ID. You have to do some surgery to make that work but you can see it here. Nevertheless, the end result is a pretty sharp looking red iPhone with a black front. There are, however, some easier ways to get to this point. For instance, you can pick up a black skin on Amazon for relatively cheap, but you’d be stuck with a white home button. What do you think of this red and black iPhone 7 design? Is this what Apple should have included in the first place? Watch the video below and let us know down in the comments.

 Apple just won a big victory in China Ryan Woo Mar. 25, 2017, 12:36 PM 4,338 facebook linkedin twitter email print A man uses his phone to take pictures outside an Apple store in Beijing Thomson Reuters A Chinese court has ruled in favor of Apple in design patent disputes between the Cupertino, California company and a domestic phone-maker, overturning a ban on selling iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones in China, Xinhua news agency reported. Last May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple's Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office's ban to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili's design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua. In a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones. Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board's decision. It is unclear if Apple will appeal.

The launch will commemorate 10 years of partnership between Apple and Red, an organization dedicated to fighting the spread of AIDS. The new phones will be available to order starting March 24 and will begin shipping by the end of the month. Apple is offering the Product(Red) Special Edition iPhones in 128GB and 256GB sizes, starting at $749. A portion of the profits from the sales of these iPhones will go to The Global Fund, which finances HIV programs in areas like South Africa, Ghana, and Rwanda. Apple has previously released other gadgets and accessories under the Product(Red) line to benefit the cause, most recently including the Beats Solo3 wireless headphones, iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case, and Beats Pill+ portable speaker. In a press release, Apple CEO Tim Cook called this special edition iPhone the company's "biggest Product(Red) offering to date." Apple is also offering shoppers a more compelling deal on its iPhone SE, which will now come with twice as much storage. This means the entry level $399 model will include 32GB of storage instead of 16GB, which comes after Apple has been criticized in the past for selling iPhones with such a small amount of storage.

It’s been an action-packed week across the tech world, filled with exciting news, spicy rumors, and one or two surprises. But don’t worry if you’ve struggled to keep up with it all – 7 Days is here again to walk you through what’s been happening, and bring you up to speed. Our global tech odyssey begins this week with WikiLeaks, which contacted major tech companies including Apple, Microsoft and Google, offering to work with them in patching exploits used by the CIA, revealed in its recent 'Vault7' leaks. However, WikiLeaks attached certain conditions to its offer of cooperation - and since then, those companies have not responded favorably to the organization's requests. In an unsettling move, the US Senate voted to allow internet service providers to share and sell users' browsing histories without their explicit permission. Meanwhile, in Minnesota, a judge granted a warrant to a local police department requiring that Google provide the personal details of literally anyone, anywhere, who looked for a specific name using its search engine. Google apologized earlier this week after YouTube's 'Restricted Mode' - which is intended to filter out inappropriate content for certain users - began indiscriminately blocking videos from the LGBTQ+ community, without explanation. The company apologized, and later said that the feature "isn't working the way it should", promising to fix it. Over on the Google Play Store, a mystery has been brewing. WhatsApp recently received a flood of thousands of five-star reviews on the store - but they refer to the app as a "game", and describe how the reviewers "enjoyed the gameplay", which certainly raises some questions. Speaking of five-star reviews, Netflix is dropping its star-based ratings system in favor of a simpler thumbs-up/thumbs-down method for rating its shows and movies. Qualcomm announced its new 205 Processor Mobile Platform, a dual-core chipset that will bring 4G LTE to affordable feature phones. British telecommunications giant Vodafone is joining forces with Idea, one of India's top mobile operators, to form the country's largest carrier, with almost 400 million customers, and around 40% of the nation's mobile revenue. It also seems that Apple is preparing to start manufacturing iPhones in India. However, over in New Zealand, Apple has come under fire for having sold $4.2 billion (NZD) worth of products in the country since 2007, but paying no taxes there at all. Tuesday was a big day for Apple as it made a series of product announcements. It launched new (PRODUCT)RED special editions of its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, contributing to the fight against the spread and the effects of HIV/AIDS. Aside from the rather striking new lick of paint, though, they're technically identical to the 'standard' iPhone 7 models that it launched last year. It also doubled the storage of its iPhone SE range at no extra cost, finally eliminating the scourge of the 16GB iPhone from its line-up. And it brought an end to its 9.7-inch iPad Air range, replacing it with a much cheaper 9.7-inch tablet, simply branded "iPad", and starting at $329. It also ditched the iPad mini 2, and doubled the mini 4's storage. Huawei released an update for its Mate 9 handset to enable Amazon's digital voice assistant, Alexa, allowing users to control smart home devices and more. Sony unexpectedly announced the Xperia L1, with a 5.5-inch display and Android 7.0 Nougat. But even more expected was an announcement from VAIO, which of course used to be owned by Sony. A year after launching the Phone Biz with Windows 10 Mobile, VAIO announced the Phone A, with virtually identical (and now somewhat outdated) specs, and running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow (!!), which was originally released in December 2015. HMD Global said that its Nokia 3, 5 and 6 Android smartphones will be made available in the US, as part of plans for a simultaneous launch of its devices in 120 markets in Q2 2017, which it described as "ambitious". That is something of an understatement. Details of Samsung's new Galaxy S8 flagship continued to emerge in recent days: Performance benchmarks hint at fierce performance for Galaxy S8 Samsung announces Bixby, its new digital assistant, launching on the Galaxy S8 Screen resolution options Samsung's upcoming DeX desktop docking station for the S8 may include active cooling fans Samsung releases UNPACKED 2017 app ahead of launch event Galaxy S8 may be smaller than the Galaxy S7 edge The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on T-Mobile, and the LG V10 and G5 on AT&T, all received Google's latest security updates for Android this week. Google published its Android Security report for 2016, acknowledging that "there's still a lot of room for improvement" in how devices are updated, but insists that it's made good progress, and will continue to do so. Seven months after Android 7.0 was released, Nougat is now installed on just 2.8% of active Android devices. The Nougat update continues its long, slow rollout, making its way this week to: Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on Rogers and Telus in Canada HTC One M9 on T-Mobile in the US Nextbit Robin Google also released its second beta of Android 7.1.2 for supported devices. But the biggest news of the week on the Google front came as the company revealed details of the next major version of its ubiquitous operating system. On Tuesday, it announced Android O, which will include a wide range of new features and improvements. It also released its first Developer Preview for a handful of devices, and promised a wider beta program in May, ahead of Android O's general release in Q3. You can find out how to install the Developer Preview right now - but it's not recommended for inexperienced users. Also on Tuesday, Microsoft released its latest Insider Preview for the Windows 10 Creators Update, build 15063, to PCs and phones in the Fast ring. A couple of days later, it released the same build to the Slow ring. With the Creators Update due to be released next month, this week's leak of the SDK and Mobile Emulator for build 15063 appeared to confirm that it will be the final 'RTM' build for the new version of Windows 10. Microsoft also released two cumulative updates for the Windows 10 Anniversary Update - the current version of the OS: build 14393.969 on Monday; and 14393.970 on Thursday. In China, Microsoft said that its specialized government-approved version of Windows 10 "is now in a good position" to serve the country's public sector. But in India, there was bad news for Windows phone owners. With just one week's notice, Microsoft is ending its support for carrier billing there. Over in the US, Cricket Wireless briefly offered pre-owned models of the Microsoft Lumia 650 for just $0.99 (yes, that's 99 cents - not a typo) - but it's since removed that listing. Users with older versions of Windows and Windows Phone will no longer be able to access the Microsoft Translator app from next month. Some users will be able to download "new versions" of the app to continue using it - but these changes do not affect Windows 10 devices. It's becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of Microsoft's near-endless stream of deals on its Surface devices. In the US, it cut $100 off the entry-level Surface Pro 4 without the Surface Pen; and then a few days later, it reduced the price of another model by $200. Over in the UK, literally two minutes after ending one deal, it launched another one, offering up to 24% off select Surface Book and Pro 4 models. Earlier this week, there were five separate deals available on the Surface Pro 4 at the same time in the UK. Nonetheless, the Surface Pro 4 appears to be selling well. According to the latest AdDuplex report, it's the most popular device in Microsoft's range - but HP is the world's biggest Windows 10 PC maker. The US Army has ordered almost 10,000 rugged Windows 10 tablets, including Intel's latest Core processors, and a variety of security features. A company founded by a former Microsoft employee has started a crowdfunding campaign, aiming to launch an 8-inch Windows 10 ultra-mobile PC with an ARM-based Snapdragon 835 processor, 4G LTE, and an integrated keyboard. Priced at up to $750, the company behind the device hopes to launch the Windows 10 model in January 2018, a few months behind the cheaper Android model. Last year, Microsoft shipped the Windows 10 Anniversary Update with an incomplete Skype Preview app. Ahead of the Creators Update, and following months of additions and improvements to the app, the company dropped its 'Preview' tag in the latest version this week. Microsoft Edge was declared the least secure web browser after being hacked more than any of its rivals at the Pwn2Own 2017 hacking event. Google's Chrome browser emerged unscathed. Microsoft said that "security is a process, not a destination", and outlined various improvements in its browser to enhance its security. It also announced that it's bringing support for CSS Custom Properties to Edge in the Creators Update. For the second time in recent weeks, many users found themselves unable to sign in to services using their Microsoft account credentials on Tuesday; the issue affected services such as OneDrive, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, and more. Those login issues didn't exactly provide the ideal build-up to Microsoft's announcement that its Outlook.com Premium mail service is now available in six new markets. LineageOS emerged from the ashes of Cyanogen, offering a new alternative Android-based operating system. The OS has now reached over a million installations, and its development team celebrated by revealing new improvements and adding support for more devices. Cyanogen's Kirt McMaster revealed that Nintendo had approached the company to ask for its help in developing a custom version of Android for the console that it eventually released as the Switch this year. McMaster said he had "told them to stick it". Charming. Nintendo finally acknowledged issues affecting the connectivity of the Joy-Con controllers on its Switch console, following weeks of complaints. It described the problem as a "manufacturing variation", and is offering free repairs for affected controllers. By the way, if you're thinking of buying the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, be sure to check out our unboxing video and gallery. It's been quite a busy week for those on the Xbox Insider Program. On Tuesday, Microsoft released build 15063 - yep, the same number that's virtually certain to be the RTM build for the Creators Update - to the Alpha Ring, followed quickly by the Beta Ring, and Ring 3. A couple of days later, it rolled out build 15063.1003 to the Alpha Ring, before rapidly rolling it out to the Beta Ring and Ring 3 too. It's also released the first Alpha Ring Insider Preview of the Version 1704 update - which will come after the Creators Update. Many of the features in the new 1704 preview were outlined earlier in the week in an official announcement. Microsoft also announced the Wireless Controller Recon Tech Special Edition for the Xbox One and One S. Priced at $69.99, the company said that it's "inspired by military technology", and it's the first in a new 'Tech Series' of Wireless Controllers launching this year. The number of Xbox 360 games supported on the Xbox One through the Backward Compatibility feature rose to more than 350 when Microsoft added three more games on Tuesday, followed by a further three additions on Thursday, including Assassin's Creed Revelations. It was also confirmed this week that an Assassin's Creed TV show is officially in development. Photos purporting to show marketing material for Destiny 2 emerged this Thursday, apparently revealing the game's release date, and confirming an upcoming beta. The long wait for Mass Effect: Andromeda finally came to an end this week, as the game launched on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. Its release had been delayed by several months. But our journey ends this week with the world's most popular plumber, who finally made his way to the world's largest mobile platform. Six months after it was originally announced, and three months after its launch on iOS, Super Mario Run is now available on Android. Better late than never? Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. First up, check out our overview of some of the new features and improvements coming in the Windows 10 Creators Update. Shreyas Gandhe shared his review of the Oukitel U15S, an Android smartphone with 4GB RAM, and 32GB storage and a rather slim design. Impressed? Don't be - Shreyas described the device as "a combination of wrong choices". Timi Cantisano had a Flashback to the Nokia N95, ten years after its release. Times have certainly changed in the tech world since then, but the N95 was quite a remarkable device when it launched a decade ago. If you're feeling in a nostalgic mood, be sure to read the article for a trip down Memory Lane. And finally, after Google announced details of its next major update for Android, we asked our readers what they think the big 'O' in 'Android O' might stand for. Which sweet snack or delicious dessert will it be named after? Join in the discussion and have your say! Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology.

Man stabbed to death 250 yards from Prince George's new school But the family of the 18-year-old are up against ‘a brick wall’ from the California-based company. Wright died of a rare bone cancer in December and after a software update the family were locked out of his iPad. This means the funeral requests were not available to the family before they laid him to rest, but they still desperately want access to see his photos and videos. He discovered his cancer was terminal last year (Picture: Facebook/Liam Wright)) Although Jane, the teen’s mum, bought the device for her son it was registered to his name. Two days before he died Wright was too sick to tell his family what the password was for the devise when it updated itself. Baby girl blind and almost deaf after 'hammer attack that killed brother' Apple allegedly told the family that they needed a death certificate and solicitor’s letter costing £120. After getting the letter, the family were told they must provide also extra information. Liam’s sister Kerry told the Gazette: ‘They are saying it’s not the relevant information and they now want a court order costing us £360. ‘We’ve been told by the solicitor that the court is unlikely to grant us the court order with it being just one company so we don’t know what we can do.’ He had hoped of working with children in sports (Picture: Facebook/Liam Wright) The family have pointed out that they are able to close the teenager’s bank account but just not open his iPad. Kerry added: ‘Mum spoke to them and said “You can’t do this it’s wrong. How would you feel if it was photos of your son?”‘ The caner, osteosarcoma, was discovered to be terminal last year and was found after Wright had a football injury. Apple have been contacted for comment.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iTunes 12.6 Has Been Released – Here’s Everything That is New [Updated] By Uzair Ghani Mar 24, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has released iTunes 12.6 for both Windows and macOS. Here’s what the new update packs within its confines. iTunes 12.6 Introduces New ‘Rent Once, Watch Anywhere’ Feature Apple’s music and iOS device management software, iTunes, has received a new update today, bringing it up to version 12.6. What’s new in this update, you ask? Well, it now allows you to rent a movie on your desktop and you can then watch it anywhere you like as long as that device is running iOS 10.3 or tvOS 10.2. This is a huge deal since such a thing was not possible before, and the user was forced to watch a movie rental on just a single device. With the latest update, you can flint between devices with ease as long as you are within the rental time period, of course. Related iTunes 12.5.5 Download for Windows & Mac Released For Mac users, the new iTunes 12.6 update is available to download straight from the Mac App Store. Simply launch Apple’s app hub and then click on the Updates tab. Over here you will be presented with the latest update. Simply tap on the Update button next to it and you are good to go. Windows users on the other hand can download the new update using the Apple Software Update tool. Simply launch it and click on ‘Install’ when prompted with the new update. Advertisement Apart from the rental associated feature, the iTunes 12.6 update brings bug fixes and performance related enhancements to the table as well. This alone is worthy enough of an update if you are asking me. The update also signals towards the fact that iOS 10.3 and tvOS 10.2 are on the verge of release. So it’s a good idea to make necessary preparations beforehand on your devices if you want the upgrade to go through as smoothly as possible. The best thing to take care of in advance is free space, which is extremely necessary for the update to move forward. Last but not the least, if you have time, make sure you have backed up everything to a secure location. It’s better to be safe than sorry.

Most likely this has just been left behind because not many people still rent from iTunes. -1 6 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

A much-speculated 10.5-inch iPad didn’t materialize, nor did new versions of iPad Pros aimed at businesses and creative professionals. Apple unveiled the new iPads through a press release rather than a staged event, the opposite of the process reserved for bigger product releases, which typically are unveiled in September or October, in time for the holiday shopping season. The tablet market is in an extended decline after a few years of rapid growth. According to IDC, tablet shipments fell 20 percent, to 53 million in the final three months of 2016, compared with the same period in 2015. The iPad Air 2 is replaced by a new model simply called the iPad. It retains a 9.7-inch screen, but the display is brighter and the processor faster. Its price starts at $329 for 32 gigabytes of storage, down from $399. The smaller, 7.9-inch iPad Mini 4 now comes with 128 gigabytes of storage starting at $399, down from $499. It’s eliminating 32-gigabyte model, which used to sell for $399. Apple also announced the release of a red edition of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus; for each phone sold, Apple is donating an unspecified amount to HIV and AIDS programs. Apple is also doubling the storage on the smaller iPhone SE while keeping the $399 starting price. The new iPad Mini 4 is available right away, while the standard-size iPad comes out next week, with orders to begin Friday. The new iPhone SE comes out Friday as well, while the red iPhones are expected by the end of the month, with advance orders beginning Friday.

A much-speculated 10.5-inch iPad Pro didn’t materialize, nor did new versions of sizes in the Pro lineup, which is aimed at businesses and creative professionals.   The new devices are mostly refreshes of existing models.

The 7.9-inch iPad Mini 4 now comes with 128 gigabytes of storage starting at $399, rather than $499 before. Apple is eliminating the 32-gigabyte model, which sold for $399. Nothing else is changing. Apple is also releasing a red edition of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus; for each phone sold, Apple is donating an unspecified amount to HIV and AIDS programs. And Apple is doubling the storage on the smaller iPhone SE while keeping the $399 starting price. The new iPad Mini 4 is available right away, while the standard-size iPad comes out next week, with orders to begin Friday. The new iPhone SE comes out Friday, while the red iPhones are expected by the end of the month, with advance orders starting Friday. IDC analyst Jorge Vela said a 10.5-inch iPad might have offered room for a better keyboard, compared with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and it wouldn’t have been as bulky as the 12.9-inch version. Apple typically sparks consumer interest when it has new sizes and designs, Mr. Vela said, as seen by a jump in sales after the introduction of larger iPhones in 2014, though iPhone sales have fallen. Mr. Vela said a 10.5-inch version might have pushed iPad owners to upgrade.  A 10.5-inch version may still happen closer to the holiday shopping season, along with updates to existing Pro sizes. In the last three months of 2016, iPhones generated 10 times the revenue as iPads. Unit sales of iPads fell 19 percent from the previous year. Yet Apple CEO Tim Cook has been optimistic because many people were buying iPads for the first time, indicating that the market had yet to reach saturation, the point at which everyone who wants a particular product already has one. Apple is still the market leader, accounting for about a quarter of all tablets shipped in the fourth quarter, according to IDC. Samsung beat Apple to a tablet refresh by a month. The South Korean firm has announced an Android update, the Galaxy Tab S3, along with two new Windows models, both called Galaxy Book. Microsoft is also due for a refresh of its Surface Pro tablet, last updated in October, 2015. Amazon, meanwhile, continually refreshes its tablet lineup.

The Apple Watch, for instance, has been known to notify drivers of upcoming turns even though they are using their iPhone or have it connected to their onboard infotainment system. It’s also be known to tell folks that it’s time to rest while driving, or time to stand up, all the same. There are other notifications that come through as well, all of which can lead to distracted driving very easily since we humans don’t know how to ignore electronic devices to save our lives – literally. But, Apple is looking to fix all of that now, with a new patent that was filed last September and approved just this month. According to the patent, Apple wants its watch to detect when you’re driving based on motion detection, and then change what alerts are sent to the watch, how many can be sent, and where you receive them. Apple even wants the watch to be able to determine what notifications are too important to ignore when you’re driving as well. This feature could potentially be customized by the user of the watch or even car manufacturers, the latter of which could mean that notifications are sent to CarPlay-enabled receivers or car speakers instead of the watch. If you have an Apple Watch and have found the alerts to be rather annoying at times, this patent could be the solution to your problem. There’s no telling if or when this feature will make it into Apple’s lineup of mobile devices, but it could come as early as watchOS 4 and iOS 11 later this year. continue reading Source: U.S. Patent Office An Answer to an Outstanding Lawsuit? It was just a couple of months ago that a class-action lawsuit was filed against Apple in the state of California. That lawsuit stated that Apple has had the ability to block texting while driving since 2008, but chose not to do so. Here’s an excerpt from the complaint filed with that lawsuit: "Apple has the ability to outfit its iPhones with a lock-out device that would disable the smartphone while being used by motorists. In fact, it has had this technology since 2008 and was granted a patent on it by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2014. Yet, fearful that such a device would cause it to lose valuable market share, Apple refuses to employ the technology.” One of the biggest complaints from Apple users about Apple potentially blocking texting while driving is that the device may not be able to tell the difference between drivers and passengers. But, this new patent shows that the watch could be capable of determining the difference. If so, a similar software in a paired iPhone could be used to disable text messaging while you’re driving as well. In the end, that may upset some and is the reason Apple never brought the ability to block text messages to the iPhone anyway, but at least the Apple Watch will be less distracting to drivers should the software described in this patent manifest into reality.

Without kicking up much fuss beforehand, Apple has updated its website to announce a new iPad line, plus special edition iPhone 7 models and an update to the iPhone SE. See below for more on the new Apple arrivals. Jump to iPad news Jump to iPhone news Best Buy tablets – sharp displays and impressive battery life The new iPad – faster processor, lower price Today, Apple unveiled the new 9.7-inch iPad with Retina display. It has a Touch ID fingerprint sensor for added security, weighs in at 469g (slightly heavier than the 437g iPad Air 2) and is powered by Apple’s A9 chip, which means it should cope well with multitasking and resource-intensive apps. It follows in the footsteps of the iPad Air 2, which is no longer listed on Apple’s site. This iPad has iOS 10 pre-installed, which has a redesigned lock screen and smarter, expandable notifications that provide more information at a glance. Improvements to Siri mean that the voice assistant now supports third-party apps such as WhatsApp and Uber. There are two cameras on board – an 8Mp 1080p camera on the back, and a 1.2Mp front-facing FaceTime HD snapper. With these changes to the iPad family in place, there are now four key models to choose from if you’re set on an Apple tablet. There’s the new 9.7-inch iPad (from £339) 9.7-inch iPad Pro (from £549) 12.9-inch iPad Pro (from £729) 7.9-inch iPad mini 4 (from £419) The new iPad has the same screen size as the 9.7-inch Pro. But the pricier Pro offers support for the Apple Pencil (stylus) and Smart Keyboard (not included in the price). It also has a faster A9X chip and can handle 4K video recording. As soon as it arrives, we’ll be sending Apple’s latest iPad off to our test lab. We’ve rigorously tested plenty of tablets before it, including the iPad Pro 9.7, iPad mini 4 and iPad Air 2. To see our full range of tested tablets, head to our tablet reviews page. How much is the new iPad? Prices start at £339 for the latest member of the iPad family. This will get you the 32GB model with wi-fi only (no cellular 3G/4G). Upgrading to the 32GB cellular model will set you back £469. If you’ve got a little more money to spend, the 128GB wi-fi model costs £429, while the 128GB cellular iPad is £559. Considering the price of the old iPad Air 2 (£349 for 16GB, wi-fi only), you’ll get more bang for your buck with this new iPad. This latest model has a faster chip (compared to the Air 2’s A8X) plus more storage space, and it’s even a tad cheaper than its predecessor. The new iPad is available to order from Friday, 24 March. If you’d rather try it out before splashing your cash, the new models will arrive in UK stores shortly. If you’re a buyer on a budget, our advice guide on the best tablets under £200 can lend a helping hand when it comes to iPad alternatives. Limited edition iPhone and new iPhone SE models also unveiled Apple’s iPad isn’t the only gadget that has been added to the tech giant’s website today. We’ve also seen a special edition version of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple has teamed up with Product Red to launch the red edition mobiles, which have 128GB and 256GB of internal storage. The 128GB 4.7-inch iPhone 7 is £699 Sim-free, while the 256GB version is a hefty £799. The iPhone 7 Plus is £819 for the Sim-free 128GB model. If you want even more storage, the 256GB phone costs £919. Part of each purchase towards a Product Red iPhone goes to charity. Finally, there has been a minor update to the iPhone SE range. Previously, you could pick up the phone with 16GB or 64GB of storage. That has now been raised to 32GB (£379) and 128GB (£479). To see how Apple’s iPhone range scores in our lab, head over to our smartphone reviews page.

Although the payment system is currently on a select number of handsets, a wider roll-out could be on the cards. So what sets Samsung Pay apart from its mobile payment competitors, and when can we expect it on more devices? We take a closer look below. Best Buy smartphones – our expert reviews help your money go further Samsung Pay: a premium feature at an affordable price Right now, Samsung Pay is exclusive to the tech giant’s high-end mobiles (such as the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge), but that could be about to change. Sources speaking to digital culture and entertainment website Mashable have claimed that Samsung is looking to roll out its mobile payment system to its cheaper handsets, which is good news for buyers on a budget. India has been chosen as a testing ground for the initial Samsung Pay expansion, and there are suggestions that the £200 Samsung Galaxy J5 (right) will be one of the models treated to the update here in the UK. We’re seeing an increasing number of cheaper phones arriving with innovative features to rival expensive flagships. It doesn’t end with mobile payment support, either. Huawei’s £225 Honor 6X has dual rear-facing cameras, a feature that you’ll also find on Apple’s £720 iPhone 7 Plus. On a similar note, lots of mobiles below £300 now have a fingerprint sensor, with the HTC One A9s a recent example. Depending on Samsung’s final decision, it could be that Samsung Pay becomes a stock feature on all of its new releases in future. Samsung Pay vs Apple Pay vs Android Pay We’ve seen and heard plenty about rival systems, such as Android Pay and Apple Pay, so what makes Samsung Pay different? Unlike its competitors, Samsung Pay uses magnetic secure transmission (MST) technology, which emits a signal that mimics the strip you find on a standard credit card. Because of this, Samsung Pay can be used at any terminal where you’d usually swipe a card. Payments can be authorised using your fingerprint (if your phone has a sensor) or a unique Pin. In practice, this means that Samsung Pay can be used at places where Android Pay and Apple Pay can’t. When will Samsung Pay arrive in the UK? The latest rumours suggest that a Samsung Pay announcement will be made around the same time as the official unveiling of the Galaxy S8. Samsung’s ‘Unpacked’ press event takes place on 29 March, and it has already been confirmed that the Galaxy S8 will feature heavily here. Headline-grabbing smartphone aside, this might be where we hear more on Samsung Pay’s future in the UK, and we’ll be keeping a close eye on things as Unpacked draws closer. For more on tap-and-go mobile payments, see our What is Android Pay? and What is Apple Pay? guides. If you fancy trying the service out for yourself right away, our smartphone reviews page will tell you which Samsung phones are already supported.

Apple quickly appealed the decision, allowing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus to stay on the market. Now, a separate Beijing court has overturned the original ruling… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case As noted by the South China Morning Post, a Beijing court has ruled in favor of Apple, recognizing that Apple has not infringed upon any design patents. The decision puts an end to the ongoing patent dispute and “quashes the decision” stated by the original ruling: The court “quashes the decision of the bureau” and “recognises that Apple … has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili”, according to the verdict reported by the People’s Court Daily. Furthermore, today’s ruling says that the iPhone 6 has features that “completely change the effect of the entire product, and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers.” The lawsuit was originated by Chinese smartphone company Shenzhen Baili, which claimed that the design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus copied the design of its 100C smartphone. The basis for the claims was that both devices featured curved edges and rounded corners. As for the future of Shenzhen Baili, things are looking bleak. The company has “collapsed” amid public criticism of its products and the budget-focused Chinese market. Winning a legal battle against Apple was likely one of the few ways Baili could salvage itself, and now potential for that is gone. But since then the company has collapsed, hit by public criticism of its products seen as poor quality and more so by China’s ultra-competitive smartphone market which has seen many start-ups go under. Apple has long spoken out against patent trolls and this case represents another victory for the company. Currently, Apple is involved in ongoing legal cases with a variety of companies, most notably including Nokia and Qualcomm. Had the case against Baili continued for Apple in China, it could have set a dangerous precedent in the Chinese market, which represents a huge area of importance for the company. Nevertheless, now that the case has been finalized in Apple’s favor, business can continue as normal.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson BEIJING A Chinese court has ruled in favour of Apple in design patent disputes between the Cupertino, California company and a domestic phone-maker, overturning a ban on selling iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones in China, Xinhua news agency reported. Last May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple's Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office's ban to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili's design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua. In a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones. Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board's decision. It is unclear if Apple will appeal.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A #SocialSkim: Apple Takes On Snapchat, LinkedIn Beefs Up Lead Generation: 11 Stories This Week by Christian Neri  |   March 25, 2017  |  1,317 views Tweet Kindle Email Top In this week's 'Skim: Apple launches a Snapchat-inspired video editing app; LinkedIn announces big news for its Sales Navigator, adds new retargeting tools; Foursquare plots to take over the world; YouTube phases out annotations; Instagram has a surprising influence on older users; and much more... Skim for this week's roundup! 1. Apple unveils video creation and sharing app Apple might not be ready to take a full leap into social media, but what it unveiled last week could be called baby steps. The technology giant introduced Clips, a new, social-media-inspired video, photo, and music editing app on iOS that shares quickly and easily across social networks. Why social-media-inspired? Users will be able to add filters, speech bubbles, shapes, emoji, and even "full-screen posters with animated background and customizable text." Apple's also added what it calls "Live Titles," animated captions and titles based on what users say. There will be a music library of tracks for users to choose to set their clips to, and the app will automatically suggest tags of people who are in your contacts or have been previously identified within your iOS Photos app. Clips will launch in April. 2. LinkedIn buffs up its lead generation tool, Sales Navigator Finding leads on LinkedIn just got a bit easier for brands, with the social network announcing a new Enteprise Edition of its Sales Navigator, its lead-generation solution. The improvements include new customer relationship management integrations, with widgets for quick profile viewing shared within CRMs such as Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics. For companies already using the Professional or Team editions of Sales Navigator, a LinkedIn spokesperson described the new Enterprise Edition as one for high-functioning sales organizations, as it now includes up to 50 InMails per month and TeamLink Extend, which lets anyone in your company opt in to share his/her LinkedIn network with TeamLink so that all employees can reach out to one another for introductions to prospects, even if the employees are not directly connected. 3. Others are trying, but Facebook is dominating social video Gary Vaynerchuk said its video feature is a brand's best friend, and now anew report from social analytics company Quintly shows that Facebook not only dominates video for marketing campaigns but also exemplifies the trend of siloed content's becoming a thing of the past as social networks continue to integrate features copied from one another. Among the brands studied that use video in their Facebook campaigns, 90% used native Facebook videos, whereas just 30% and 2% used YouTube and Vimeo, respectively. Facebook native videos—those uploaded directly to the platform—also garnered 186% more engagement than other formats, and they were shared 4.6 times more than others. 4. Foursquare is quietly plotting its takeover of the world You might think of Foursquare as long gone from the social media space, but the company has other ideas. It recently announced Foursquare Analytics and, in the process, continued its transformation from a social media company to a location-data powerhouse. Foursquare Analytics is essentially a dashboard of insights that lets companies see how they're performing based on measurable, real-world visits. With 50 million monthly users around the globe, and 92% of consumer spending still taking place in the physical world, Foursquare argues the real world lacks features like cookies that make digital work and the company's no-hardware-needed setup means brands can begin providing timely offers to consumers in new ways. Foursquare Analytics from Foursquare on Vimeo. 5. LinkedIn to boost advertising using email addresses and website visits Although it won't be rolled out until November, we've got word of a new LinkedIn ad targeting program that will bring the professional social network more in step with other platforms' modern advertising businesses. LinkedIn will bring back the ability for marketers to retarget consumers who have visited their websites with ads on LinkedIn, as well as let them target consumers based on email addresses. These techniques are already employed by rivals including Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Pinterest, and will be a part of LinkedIn's new "Matched Audiences" program. 6. Older users most influenced by Instagram ads It turns out Instagram ads could be a surprisingly effective way to influence the decision-makers in organizations who ultimately decide to buy, or subscribe to, your B2B products or services. A new report from Influence.co finds that users 65-74 and 45-54 are the most likely to search out products after seeing promoted posts on the platform. Though Instagram has certainly become more of a pay-to-play playground for brands, that might not be a bad thing—if the ROI is worthwhile. 7. YouTube to phase out annotations, focus on mobile-friendly features You might use YouTube as a part of your social media strategy to better showcase your products and all they can do, but maybe you're using the platform less effectively than you could. The Google-owned social video network is phasing out one of its oldest features, annotations, in favor of newer, mobile-first capabilities including end screens and cards. Annotations let users place pop-up calls-to-action on the screen on a video, while cards place a discreet "information" symbol at the top right corner of videos that encourages users to click through to relevant websites. End screens are placed at the end of a video, and include several types of clickable overlay images that users can select to either visit a website, subscribe to the channel, or view another video. Do you already use end screens and cards? If not, check out the video to see how to get started! 8. How much you can expect to pay for Instagram influencers Influencers charge $271, on average, to share sponsored content on the platform and, while that cost varies significantly according to industry, it also is strongly correlated to audience size. Have you thought about seeking out influencers in your field as a part of your social media strategy? A recent report from Influence.co and a great recap from MarketingProfs dives into what you can expect to pay, whether a male or female influencer will cost you more, the average number of followers you can expect your targeted influencers to have based on niche, and much more. 9. Facebook makes text posts more visual with background colors Facebook began letting Android users spruce up text-only posts with background colors and larger text back in December, and now it appears the same feature is slowly rolling out to iOS users. The capability lets users select a custom background color to place their text against in order to make the post more visual and engaging. If brands ever need to publish something without a video, GIF, or other visual to go along with it, they should certainly take note of this new way to enhance what might otherwise be a boring, uninspiring post. 10. Musical.ly, the social music app taking over, rolls out new features It might be the greatest success story to come out of social media's rush to video, but also one that your brand's never even considered as an opportunity. We introduced you to Musical.ly, which lets users set their own videos to their favorite songs, back last May. As a reminder, the app's highly engaged users spend an average of 13 minutes per day on the platform! Worth noting is that Musical.ly, which now claims 40 million monthly active users, continues to innovate and launch new capabilities, like its latest duet feature. Moreover, the app's user base has grown older: Whereas at the beginning of 2016 90% of the app's user base was in the 13-24 demo, by September that number had fallen to 60%. In other words, the door is opening wider and wider to brand opportunities. Keep an eye on this one, folks. 11. We'll wrap with Germany's massive threat to Facebook and Twitter The fight against fake news and online hate speech escalated dramatically last week, when the German parliament drafted legislation that could result in fines for the likes of Facebook and Twitter—up to €50 million—if they don't remove blatantly illegal content within 24 hours. That could lead one to believe that the timing of news that Twitter suspended over 600,000 accounts accused of promoting terrorism in just the second half of 2016 alone wasn't a coincidence. The German parliament suggests that social media companies have long failed to address the problems of fake news and hate speech that live on their networks, but free speech advocates in the country are expected to push back against the new law. The German government's move comes after Chancellor Angela Merkel raised concerns that fake news and bots could influence upcoming elections.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson BEIJING A Chinese court has ruled in favour of Apple in design patent disputes between the Cupertino, California company and a domestic phone-maker, overturning a ban on selling iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones in China, Xinhua news agency reported. Last May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple's Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office's ban to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili's design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua. In a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones. Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board's decision. It is unclear if Apple will appeal.

The news broke Tuesday when Motherboard reported that it had been contacted by one of the hackers and had been shown pictures of email correspondence between the hackers and Apple security personnel. However, Business Insider reported today that a reliable source who knows Apple’s security operations claims the “email is fake.” According to Business Insider, the ransom was set at “$75,000 in cryptocurrency like bitcoin or $100,000 in Apple gift cards.” However, NBC reports that the group has been in contact with NBC Bay Area and is now demanding Apple pay them $700,000. NBC could not confirm the identity of the individual or whether his claims of being with the group were true. 200 Million iCloud accounts will be factory reset on April 7 2017 — Turkish Crime Family (@turkcrimefamily) March 21, 2017 If Apple does not figure out a way to stop us they'll be facing serious server issues and customer complaints — Turkish Crime Family (@turkcrimefamily) March 23, 2017 The hackers claim to have gained access to Apple IDs and passwords of over 200 million iCloud subscribers in some reports, but the group has contacted several media outlets with figures ranging from 200-750 million in account credentials. Apple’s iCloud was not hacked directly, but rather the credentials were “culled” through breaches in other third-party services. The hackers say Apple has until April 7 to comply with their demands or else they will wipe the data from all the accounts. 'Turkish Crime Family' Demands $75000 in Bitcoin from Apple in Exchange for Hacked iPhone … … pic.twitter.com/ESei8KV5ef — BTC Breaking News (@btcbreakingnews) March 22, 2017 It is possible that the whole thing is a hoax. Business Insider surmised that there are several “reasons to doubt the hackers’ claims, such as their thirst for publicity and their fluid story.” A few factors point to the extortion attempt being a hoax. First, conflicting reports on the ransom amounts are all over the place. Motherboard says the hackers want $75,000 in untraceable bitcoin or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards, which would be trackable. The NBC report says they want $700,000 in cash, which is also potentially traceable. Likewise, the number of compromised accounts is not consistent either. Business Insider states that several news agencies were contacted, with the group telling them they had 200, 250, 519, or up to 750 million Apple IDs and passwords. A unified team of hackers would know exactly how many accounts it has access to and would certainly agree on a single set of demands. The third issue that puts the whole thing in doubt is the group’s public announcement of a deadline. Contacting media outlets and setting a time limit is supposed to place pressure on Apple to comply. However, publicizing the deadline only serves to warn the users whose accounts may be in danger effectively nullifying any bite that the hackers might have had on Apple. Users knowing that they have until April 7 before their account will be in danger have plenty of time to sign into their accounts and change their passwords. The only way for the hackers to prevent this is to have already gone through all of the accounts and changed the passwords to lock out the owners. As of today, there have been no reports of this occurring. Hackers intent on getting money from Apple would not cripple themselves in this way. ⚡️" #Apple says it has not been hacked " ❗️#Hackers #Security #iOS #iCloud @Apple ⏩https://t.co/VUhjTjbaj2 @FortuneMagazine @FastCompany pic.twitter.com/f5tnXcTtZc — Fintech Trading Tech (@BourseetTrading) March 23, 2017 Apple seems to agree with BI Business Insider. “Apple is unsure if the group’s claims are true, but people at the company say they doubt they are.” Despite this, Apple is taking the iCloud hacking threat seriously. According to NBC, Apple issued a statement Wednesday regarding the matter. “There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID. The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services. We’re actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved. To protect against these type of attacks, we always recommend that users always use strong passwords, not use those same passwords across sites and turn on two-factor authentication.” Even if the hackers are serious and do have account credentials, there is no need to panic. As Apple stated, strong passwords and two-factor authentication are good at preventing data theft. Here is what iCloud subscribers should do in light of this news. First, try to sign in to iCloud. If you cannot log in, your account may be compromised, and you should contact Apple immediately. Once you are in your iCloud account, change your password clicking the “Manage” link under Apple ID. A new web page will open where you will need to sign in again and then you can change your password. Hackers say will reset 200 Million iCloud accounts https://t.co/RbBZcpSego#icloud #unlock #apple #hacked #iphone #ipad #macbook #bypass pic.twitter.com/wk96d5jrSy — myicloud.info (@IdeviceTool) March 23, 2017 Make your password secure by using upper and lowercase letters as well as numbers and special characters. The area where you change your password has a meter that will tell you how strong your password is as you type it. Try to fill this meter all the way up. The longer it is, the stronger it is. One technique for creating a secure password that you can remember is by altering a short, memorable phrase by changing characters within it. For example, “My son is good at math” could become “Mys0n!5g00d@math.” Note how the spaces were removed, the o’s became zeroes, the word “is” became “!5.” and the word “at” became the @ symbol. The second thing to do is turn on two-factor authentication. You will find this option right below where you change your password. What two-factor authentication does is that anytime the service detects you trying to sign in from an unknown browser, it will ask you to enter a code that it sends to another device like your phone. After entering this code, it may ask you if you want to trust the browser or device you are using to access your account. If you are using your own computer, phone, or tablet, you can select “trust,” and it will not ask to put in the authentication code again. If you are on a public computer or are borrowing a friend’s, you would want to select “don’t trust.” That way the two-factor authentication will be reset on that device keeping your account secure. Those two things should be enough to protect your account, but it is also a good idea to have a backup of your iPhone on your computer. Storing your backups automatically to iCloud is convenient, but if anything were to happen to iCloud or your account, everything including your backups could be lost. It only takes a few minutes to open iTunes and sync your iPhone once in a while, especially after you have made significant changes or added many contacts or photos. The Apple iCloud hackers, the Turkish Crime Family, should be taken seriously until we find out whether they are just a bunch of jokers on April 7. Change those iCloud passwords and secure your accounts.

Overnight and this morning, however, some beta users have started to receive a “What’s New” splash screen that lists out a few new features for Apple TV, presumably coming at some point in the future… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case First and foremost, the “What’s New” screen describes an upcoming Remote app for the iPad. Currently, the Apple TV Remote app for iOS is made for iPhone only, while the iTunes Remote app is outdated but does work on the iPad. tvOS beta 10.2, however, seems to indicate that the Apple TV Remote app will be updated with support for iPad and lyrics: Remote control from iPad See music lyrics and playlists in the Remote app for iPhone and iPad, along with the ability to select movie chapters, audio tracks, and closed captions. Additionally, there’s indication of faster list scrolling coming with tvOS 10.2. According to the tvOS beta, the Apple TV will soon support swiping along the far right side of your remote for faster scrolling: Faster list scrolling Navigate long lists faster by swiping along the far right side of your remote to quickly jump forwards or backwards. The splash screen also advertises two known/expected features. First is the TV app, which has been available for a while. In this case, its inclusion in “What’s New” is likely meant to push users towards trying the app as it continues to expand to support more video streaming services. Discover more with TV App Continue watching and discover new TV shows and movies across 40 apps including HBO Go, USA, and Syfy Finally, tvOS 10.2 further confirms that the “Rentals across devices” feature that recently came to iTunes will be supported on tvOS.

Last May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple's Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office's ban to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili's design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua. In a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones. Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board's decision. It is unclear if Apple will appeal.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Apple IPhone 8: All About Apple's Anniversary IPhone In One Place Posted: Mar 27 2017, 11:51pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Mar 27 2017, 11:53pm CDT, in News | Apple     The next generation iPhone, expected for a 2017 release, will mark 10 years of iPhone - it will be special. Apple is definitely not going to miss the tenth birthday of arguably the most demanded smartphone series in the world: the iPhone. The best way to celebrate an anniversary of a smartphone is to imprint the history in a ceremonial smartphone. iPhone 8 is expected to be the ceremonial model which will imprint the tenth anniversary of iPhone in the history. Don't Miss: Today's Electronics Bargains at Woot.com The iPhone 8 is most-definitely going to be stuffed with latest technology features and high-end components. Read this article till the end to find out all the features and specifications iPhone 8 will be packing. Of course, most of the content is based on rumors and leaks, as the smartphone is set to release in the second half of this year, but still, information in this article is based on the most reliable resources, and will often be updated. The latest news suggests that iPhone 8 will feature plastic OLED display, meaning that the iPhone 8 will most probably be curved. Samsung Display will manufacture the display OLEDs for iPhone 8’s display, and is expected to produce almost 100 million units of those. iPhone 8 may feature a peculiar set of edges: Some of the rumors suggesting that the iPhone 8 will feature a curved-edge screen are now becoming more frequent and from more reliable sources. Don’t get confused though, iPhone is definitely not turning into Samsung’s flagship models entirely. The reports state that iPhone 8 will in fact, feature a flat OLED screen, while the screen then enters into a slight curve on both the edges. The curve will be so small that it might not even serve any purpose individually. But the glossy reflection due to a curve and almost no side-bezels in the line of sight means that the upcoming monster will look even more futuristic and while providing a smooth visual experience. It may be possible that the reports stating these facts might be mentioning a prototype iPhone 8 model which Apple may have decided to explore. If so, there will also surely be another prototype with longer curves and even some functionality. After all, Apple is widely known to experiment all the possible builds for any of its upcoming device. Stay in sync with us as there is going to be solid information released on thiss matter soon.  Will The Tenth Anniversary Edition Be Called iPhone 8? A recent report from Macotakara states that the anniversary edition may be named “iPhone Edition” instead of iPhone 8. Leaks from different reliable sources claim that the anniversary edition model of iPhone will be made available after the releases of iPhone 7s and 7s Plus models. All three of this year’s iPhone releases are expected to be made in the same event. A pattern can be detected when studying the names of iPhone models since the famous iPhone 4s. Since iPhone 4, the ‘s’ model of the current iPhone is released the very next year of the original iPhone model release. For instance, iPhone 4s was released in 2011, one year after iPhone 4s (2010), and the iPhone 5s was released in 2013 while iPhone 5 hit the stores in 2012. Apple may not necessarily follow tradition this time, this year is too special for Apple, no one can be certain until an official news is released. As far as expectations are concerned, it might be possible that Apple releases iPhone 8 this year while iPhone 7s and 7s Plus are discarded, or maybe the tenth anniversary edition of iPhone could be named “iPhone X”, anything is possible. Is a Tenth Anniversary iPhone “Plus” Also Possible? Could be, Apple started the tradition of Plus editions since the release of iPhone 6. The pattern followed all the way through iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, and if iPhone 7s is expected, it’s expected to arrive with a 7s Plus. But there is still the exception that makes us unsure. If Apple follows the pattern, we will enjoy a larger-screen version of iPhone 8, while if Apple wants to keep the legacy of iPhone 8 unshared, it could do that. Release Date: Either its coincidental, or Apple likes to drop patterns for iPhone enthusiasts to study and expect the future plans of Apple for iPhone. Every iPhone model from the iPhone 5 has been announced in an special event. The mentioned special events are held on Wednesdays of Tuesdays in the first or second week of September. The pattern doesn’t end there, each announced iPhone from iPhone 5 has rolled out into market two Fridays after their official announcement. The only model that broke this pattern was iPhone 6s, which was launched on the first Friday after its official announcement. Coming back to our first point, either Apple carefully left these patterns for us to expect the iPhone 8 in the first week of September with the official launch on the second Friday after the announcement, or its just coincidence and iPhone 8 could be announced on any unknown date this year. TSMC to start mass production of Apple’s A11 chipsets in April: According to latest reports, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has prepared to initiate mass production of Apple’s A11 chipsets. The rumors suggest that the production will start in April. The semiconductor manufacturer will reportedly be producing over 50 million units of Apple’s new SoC before the start of July. Note that the A11 chipsets are going to be featured in the iPhone 8, the tenth anniversary model of iPhone and the traditional iterative models, iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. Although a debate goes on trying to determine whether the A11 will debut in iPhone 8 or the iPhone 7S duo. The A11 SoC’s architecture is built upon a 10nm FinFET manufacturing process. Reports suggest that A11 will be loaded with a wafer-level integrated fan-out technology. This new technology will not only improve the battery usage efficiency of the chip, but will also drastically improve the graphical performance of the device powered by this processor. 50 million more units are going to be produced by the end of 2017, which will add to the previous 50 million units produced by the end of June. TSMC has undoubtedly a huge job ahead. The schematics of A11 were reportedly completed during the mid of last year. During the same timeframe, it was rumored that TSMC will be the sole manufacturer of Apple’s A11 chipsets, which would make it two in a row. (TSMC was also the sole manufacturer of A10 chipsets) The rumors have now been confirmed, furthermore, TSMC might also be planning to stablish a manufacturing plant in USA especially to produce Apple’s chipsets, although those plans have been further delayed to 2018.  All New Design: A company as creative as Apple doesn’t wait for something to happen, it plots the future of its products quite earlier to get more time for prototyping and enhancing the end-product. iPhone in specific, is known to make an unpredictable entry in each of its iteration when we talk about design. iPhone 3G had a plastic frame, iPhone 4 had a glass back and antenna band out of nowhere, then arrived the iPhone 5 with an untraditional aspect ratio of 16:9 and sharp-square edges with rounded corners, suddenly the next iPhone had a larger display screen and rounded edges. Only iPhone 7 failed to surprise the world as it followed the same design traits as iPhone 6. Although it could be because Apple wanted the world to get completely bored with the current design so everyone would fall in love with the new design in iPhone 8. As seen in rumored renders of iPhone 8, the next model in-line is going to make a more heroic entry in terms of design. With a minimal-bezels front, virtual home button or a complete function bar, and fingerprint sensor integrated on the display screen, people will pay anything to get their hands on the upcoming iPhone 8.The back is expected to be glass, while the edges will either be stainless steel or aluminum. Color Themes: iPhone 5s, 6s, and 7, each of these models were accompanied by a completely reimagined color theme. iPhone 5s with Gold, iPhone 6s with Rose Gold, and iPhone 7 with Jet Black color theme. iPhone 8 is most-probably going to introduce another innovative color theme to signify its value in Apple’s history. A report by Macotakara suggests that a new color theme featuring red as the primary color will be available for current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the same theme could also be an option for the upcoming iPhone models this year. Specifications: Apple’s own line of mobile chipsets – the A-series – has been featured in iPhones since 2010. Each iteration of the smartphone received a new iteration of the CPU chipset too. iPhone 8 is also expected to receive an upgraded chipset (probably A11). Secondary processors have been used often in iPhone models to handle smaller independent features in the device, like motion voice activation and big.LITTLE fusion. The A11 could be packing the processing power to not only implement these features, but also augment their capabilities and induce AI-functionality. Not to forget, the virtual function area will also be adding load to the chipset. Apple has been tirelessly working to create iPhone an “Apple-only” entity. Custom chipsets were the first step, rumors suggest that future iPhones will feature custom Apple-made Graphical Processing Units and modems. For now, it is rumored that Intel will supply the modems for iPhones released this year. Any Possibility Of The Fancy Smart Connector? The magnetized connectors which were introduced in iPad Pro, later spotted in the Apple MacBook Pro, could surely be a great addition to the future iterations of iPhone. Capabilities of the smart connector surpass from charging and enter into the modular arena. If a smart connector is engineered for iPhone 8, it could be used for a miniature keyboard specifically designed for iPhone 8, like a keyboard was designed specifically for iPad Pro. Speaker packs are an option, augmented cameras, 360-view VR cameras, 3D cameras, mimicking capabilities in car infotainment systems, all could be possible. Keep checking back on the article to stay up-to-date on the matter. Display: iPhone’s LCD panels with standard screen resolution have been a huge help in battery saving, making them a good choice so far. But introduction of VR-environment and specifications of Samsung and LG’s flagship models are making the current display of iPhone an obsolete one.Not to worry though, a high quantity of rumors claim that Apple will introduce the OLED display panels with 1920x1090p and 2560x1440p screen resolutions in the upcoming models of iPhone this year. Although, Apple worked really hard to develop the 3D Touch feature in iPhones’ LCD display panels. The feature could be discarded, or Apple could re-engineer the new OLED panels, or possibly even stick with the old LCD panels altogether. Digitimes has also reported that one of the iPhone model this year will feature a 5.8” AMOLED display while the other models will pack the regular LCD panels. OLED versions of future iPhone will most-probably be curved, claims Korea Herald. Such iPhones will utilize plastic, instead of glass, ultimately creating the question: “If iPhone 8 is Glass Back, well it not be the OLED version?” iPhone 8 will not adopt the True Tone System, although it did receive the DCI-P3 color mechanism, which is also implemented in iPad Pro. Still the True Tone System is a considerable short-coming for the upcoming iPhone. True Tone System measures the surrounding light and adjusts the Gamma/Contrast ratio to provide a visually smooth experience. Will iPhone 8 Be IP68 Certified? iPhone 7 was a certified IP67 model, which made it impervious to accidental and minimal exposure to water, but it is too risky to push the limits. iPhone 8 on the other hand, is highly expected to be IP68 certified. Completely waterproof (dustproof too), says the job description. Imagine diving into seawaters without any fear and photographing your friends and fellow fishes with the dual-camera you so love in iPhone 7. iPhone 8 is highly anticipated to be IP68 certified according to a report surfaced through The Korea Herald. Are Wireless Charging Rumors True? An implementation of wireless charging had been impossible through metal surfaces, which was the main reason why iPhones since the iPhone 5 couldn’t offer the wireless charging feature. Apple however, is a stubborn child. Reports stated that iPhone has been working on developing a mechanism which would offer wireless charging (inductive charging) even through metal sheets. Rumors of success followed recently, making the aluminum-back of upcoming iPhones no longer a drawback. May it be a glass back, metal, or plastic, wireless charging is now advanced enough to function through any of these surfaces. So, do expect a wireless charging feature in future iPhones. Ming-Chi Kuo, an expert analyst from KGI dropped the word that Apple is going to use a graphite sheet as a protector for the 3D display panel against the heat generated due to wireless charging. What no one else could offer, will be brought by Apple. Apple recently patented a lot of concepts suggesting that wireless charging could be conducted even from a distance. The resonant inductive coupling will allow future iPhones to charge without being placed on a pad. This technology may not be operational till the entry of 2018. Ceramic Frame, Possible? Yes, after watching the Apple Watch 2 been built inside a ceramic frame, you might want to know if iPhone 8 could also feature such material which even stronger that stainless steel. Using a ceramic frame for a device as large as a 5.5-inch iPhone is quite costly. So, fingers crossed on this one. 4K gaming in iPhone 8 will be possible by the PowerVR Furian Architecture: Imagination Technologies just received massive praise for their latest marvel, the PowerVR Furian chipset, which will be the most capable CPU chipset for mobiles till now. The most amazing news is that 4K gaming might be a possibility by this new chipset developed by Imagination Technologies. PowerVR Furian’s development was centralized to increase graphics performance and power efficiency, these traits could allow intensive applications to be able to run smoothly on future iPhones. The chip in mentioning is reportedly capable of producing 70% to 90% better performance in real-world application’s performances. This is achieved by a 35% improvement in pixel shader, 70-80% improved fill rate in comparison with the current Series7XT Plus mobile GPU based on the PowerVR Rogue architecture. The new chipset will also offer 4K video, which will ultimately make an iPhone with 4K screens possible. The 4K videos recorded by iPhone 7 are not supported by the current architecture, hence the quality of these videos is stripped-down while playing the videos on the device. With PowerVR Furian, future iPhones could be capable of supporting 4K video quality. Keep in mind that iPhone will reap most of the benefits from the development of PowerVR Furian, as Apple had its stakes in Imagination Technologies since 2008. For those who are curious, iPhone 8 will probably NOT be packing a PowerVR Furian architecture. The officials at Imagination Technologies clearly told that the Furian chips will probably be featured in mobile phones released in 2018. A “limited supply” launch of iPhone 8 expected in September: Barclays’ top analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O’Malley, and Jerry Zhang claim that their computations place an iPhone 8 launch in September, though only in limited numbers. These analysts’ reports suggest that a full supply will initiate in the last quarter this year. The current lobby of industrial news groups are divided into two groups, one that harbingers that three new iPhone models will be released this year while the other suggests that only two new models will be seen in the launch event. The latter is the traditional pattern for Apple, but a tenth anniversary isn’t a common year. The group suggesting three models to be released this year unanimously agrees the third model to be a top-notch model as a celebration for iPhone’s tenth anniversary. If an iPhone 8 is expected (also referred to as iPhone Pro, iPhone Edition, and iPhone X), it will be loaded with high-end features like an in-screen fingerprint scanner, more powerful battery, wireless charging, virtual home button and a function area, bezel less design, and much more. Barclays’ analysts side with the group expecting three new models. They highly-expect a third model to be launched, which would be better than any iPhone models till now. But the analysts also suggest that the third iPhone will be limited in supply and will take weeks between shipment and pre-order.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Apple Patented A Hybrid MacBook Which Would Be Powered By IPhone And IPad Posted: Mar 25 2017, 9:13am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Mar 25 2017, 2:28pm CDT, in Rumors | Apple   USPTO    Apple was just granted a patent which would preserve copyrights of a “Hybrid MacBook” to for Apple. The patent application points to a laptop device which is kind of a modular computer. This modular computer could use iPhone at the location of the touchpad and an iPad instead of a laptop screen, creating a revolutionary touch system. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo Switch in stock online This hybrid will also have the capability of using processing power of the connected iPhone or iPad. Such ideas were taken up by tech giants including the likes of Microsoft and Motorola but reaped very little success in the field. The patent granted to Apple this Thursday indicated Apple’s intentions to develop a hybrid device of its own. To what degree will the company succeed, or even attempt to execute it, only time can tell. Apple is notoriously popular for applying for a patent of any creative or innovative concept that produces among the workers of the company. Even though the implementation of this concept seems like a huge step towards a new generation of computers, it’s hard to believe that Apple will go through with it. Especially when the company portrays its iPad as a complete notebook replacement.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Hackers threaten to wipe out iCloud data unless Apple pays ransom Apple Hackers threaten to wipe out iCloud data unless Apple pays ransom By Bindu Nair - Mar 25, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet A group of hackers calling themselves ‘Turkish Crime Family’ is trying to blackmail Apple into paying them a ransom. They’re threatening to reset iCloud data and remotely wipe out iDevices on April 7 if their demands aren’t met. In a Pastebin post, the 7-member Turkish Crime Family said that they asked for $100000 per person. They claim to have over 750 million Apple owned extensions out of which 250 million are live. The hackers assert that the credentials were gathered from multiple databases and encompass @icloud.com, @me.com and @mac.com domains. Worryingly enough, Turkish Crime Family say that the total number of active iCloud accounts in their possession is growing since more people are getting involved and sending them additional data. The group appears to have been in touch with Apple over email, as evidenced by screenshots given to Motherboard by members of the unit. Also See: Apple to begin manufacturing iPhone 6, 6S in India soon Turkish Crime Family also uploaded a YouTube video which allegedly depicts them logging into a couple of stolen accounts, allowing them to view backed-up photos and remotely reset devices. Apple seems to have responded to this by asking them to take the video down and warning them of legal action. Apple later told the publication that no iCloud or Apple ID breaches have taken place. However, it did confirm that the list of email addresses and passwords appear to have been obtained from third-party services. The company is actively working towards preventing unauthorized access and coordinating with law enforcement.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 25, 2017 at 9:22AM Analysts often talk about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers in terms of their content share gains in the latest iDevices and their revenue growth potential. Those factors are certainly important, but those discussions seldom focus on dividends. So today, we'll examine five companies that supply components for Apple and offer reliable dividends. Qualcomm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was the exclusive supplier of the iPhone's baseband modem between 2011 and 2016. Apple split modem orders between Qualcomm and Intel after that deal expired, but Qualcomm's modems are still reportedly faster than Intel's -- which means that Apple probably won't stop using them anytime soon. Image source: Apple. Qualcomm currently trades at 17 times earnings, which looks cheap relative to the industry average of 22 for broad line semiconductor companies. It pays a forward dividend yield of 3.7%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 63%. It's raised that dividend annually for 14 straight years. Texas Instruments Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) supplies a wide range of analog and embedded chips for Apple, including display drivers, charging controller ICs, and power management ICs for iPhones. TI produces these components at a lower cost than many rival chipmakers, thanks to its recent shift from 200mm to 300mm wafers -- which reduced its production costs by about 40%. Texas Instruments has a P/E of 23. It pays a forward yield of 2.5%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 47%. It's raised its dividend annually for 13 straight years. The company has also repeatedly stated that it is committed to returning "all" of its free cash flow to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) won a major victory against Samsung when it became the sole supplier of Apple's A10 chips last year. Multiple reports also indicate that TSMC will also be the sole supplier of this year's A11 chips. Those design wins were likely related to the ongoing battles between Apple and Samsung, as well as reports that Samsung-produced A9s were less power-efficient than TSMC-produced A9s. TSMC's ADR shares currently trade at 16 times earnings, which is much lower than the industry average of 22 for IC manufacturers. The company currently pays a forward yield of 2.9%, and has a payout ratio of 52%. However, TSMC pays its dividend annually instead of quarterly, and it's only consistently risen annually since 2013. Analog Devices Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) sells capacitance sensor controllers for Apple's Force Touch feature, which senses how much pressure a user applies to a display or trackpad. The feature is widely used in current-gen iPhones, MacBooks, and Apple Watches. The Apple Watch. Image source: Apple. Analog Devices is listed under the same industry as TSMC but trades at a much higher 28 times earnings. But looking ahead, rising sales of its Force Touch controllers and other components should lift its earnings, so its forward P/E of 18 looks more reasonable. Analog Devices pays a forward dividend yield of 2.2%, has a payout ratio of 57%, and has hiked its payout every year since its IPO in 2012. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), the company formerly known as Avago, supplies Apple with power amplifier modules and film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) hexaplexers for three-band carrier integration. Pacific Crest Securities estimates that those components boosted Broadcom's content share from 25% in the iPhone 6 to 30% in the iPhone 7. Broadcom has a negative P/E due to acquisition expenses and earnings distortion related to Avago's purchase of the "old" Broadcom last February. But looking ahead, Broadcom trades at 14 times forward earnings, which is a below-average multiple for a broad line semiconductor company. Broadcom pays a forward yield of 1.9%, and the company has raised its dividend annually for seven straight years. Look beyond Apple and dividends... These five companies are all Apple suppliers with decent dividends, but investors who are interested in investing in these stocks need to understand the other headwinds that they face. Qualcomm's chipmaking and licensing businesses all face tremendous pressure due to competition, regulatory probes, and major legal clashes with Apple. TI and Broadcom both rely on other industries for growth, which may or may not offset their iPhone gains. Analog Devices could eventually face competition from other capacitance sensor controller makers. Therefore, investors should fully understand these risks before buying these stocks for their dividends or exposure to Apple's supply chain. Leo Sun owns shares of Qualcomm.

The company opened a new location in Cologne, Germany, another one in Miami, Florida, and last but not least one in Nanjing Jinmao. We’ve rounded up some images of the grand opening experiences at all three locations, so head below to check them out.. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The new Cologne, Germany location at Schildergasse has been in the works for quite a while now, but it’s now open to the public. We shared photos of the construction process a few months ago, showing the store start to take shape. Original photos of Apple’s signature wooden tables from the store can be dated back all the way to April of 2015, though. Images and video of the Schildergasse grand opening come courtesy of Macerkopf. The first visitors to the store this morning received a free Apple t-shirt. The new (RED) iPhone 7, 9.7-inch iPad, and iPhone cases + Apple Watch bands were also all available to purchase this morning. As for the new Miami store, reports of its existence first began last year when it was rumored that the Apple Store would be the ‘largest retail store’ in a new Miami shopping center, the Brickell City Centre. A variety of customers shared images from the Miami opening on Twitter. Customers were lined up out front for hours in advance of the opening. Lastly, Apple today also opened a new retail store in Nanjing Jinmao Place. There aren’t as many images of this opening, but it appears that it too opened in typical Apple celebratory style. Have you attended any of today’s Apple Store grand openings? Let us know down in the comments and be sure to share any images and video you may have taken.

Apple's newest iPad arrived without any of the fanfare that usually accompanies updates to the company's lineup, but that doesn't make it entirely unexpected. With iPad sales dropping, Apple's new tablet—which will go by the simple moniker iPad—displaces the 9.7-inch iPad Air 2 and positions itself as an affordable alternative to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Starting at $329, the 32GB iPad is Apple's most affordable tablet. It's priced lower than the 7.9-inch iPad mini 4 ($399), previously the lowest priced iPad you could buy. It's also $270 less than the starting configuration of the iPad Pro ($599), making it a better option if you're on a budget. But before you buy, there are some compromises Apple made to hit that lower price point. Read on to see how to two slates compare. Name Apple iPad (2017) Apple iPad Pro (9.7 inch)   Lowest Price %displayPrice% %seller% $329.00 MSRP %displayPrice% %seller% $599.00 MSRP Editor Rating   Dimensions 9.4 by 6.6 by 0.29 inches 9.4 by 6.6 by 0.24 inches Screen Size 9.7 inches 9.7 inches Weight 1.03 lbs 0.96 lb Screen Resolution 2,048 by 1,536 pixels 2,048 by 1,536 pixels CPU Apple A9 Apple A9X Operating System Apple iOS 10 Apple iOS 10 Screen Pixels Per Inch 264 ppi 264 ppi Camera Resolution 8MP Rear, 1.2MP Front-Facing 12 MP Rear, 5 MP Front-Facing   Read the Review Read the Review Design and Display In terms of design, you're looking at two similar-looking devices. On both slates, you get Apple's high-quality aluminum unibody build, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the front, and the usual buttons and ports along the sides. However, there is a difference in dimensions. Measuring 9.40 by 6.60 by 0.29 inches (HWD) and weighing 1.03 pounds, the iPad is a tiny bit thicker and heavier than the Pro (9.40 by 6.60 by 0.24 inches, 0.96 pounds), but most people probably won't notice. The big compromise here is display. Though both slates have a 9.7-inch Retina panel with a 2,048-by-1,536 resolution and a crisp 264 pixels per inch, you'll notice that the iPad display looks different. That's because it's not laminated, it doesn't have an anti-reflective coating, and it doesn't support a wide color gamut. There's also no True Tone, meaning the screen won't use the ambient light sensor to dynamically adjust the screen's white color balance to make text more readable. What this means in practical terms is that compared with the Pro, the iPad display will be less visible outdoors, will likely wash out in direct sunlight, and will generally have duller, less vibrant colors. If outdoor usability is important to you, the Pro is the clear winner here. Processor, Battery, and Camera Under the hood, the iPad has a 64-bit A9 processor and embedded M9 coprocessor, making it faster than the A8 on the iPad mini 4, but not quite as powerful as the A9X chipset on the Pro. In practical terms, the performance difference shouldn't be too big. The A9 is still a perfectly good chipset that's also found on the iPhone 6s. In our experience, it still handles iOS 10 without any trouble and doesn't suffer from any stuttering, lag, or performance issues. That said, if future-proofing is your concern, you'll get a bit more mileage out of the Pro's A9X. The iPad is expected to have a 10-hour battery when browsing or watching videos on Wi-Fi, but we'll have to reserve judgment until we put it to the test. For reference, the iPad Pro clocked 5 hours, 38 minutes when streaming full-screen video over Wi-Fi at maximum brightness; the old iPad Air 2 logged a bit less at 5 hours, 15 minutes. We expect the iPad to fall somewhere in this range. The iPad has a 8-megapixel rear-facing camera that's capable of recording 1080p video. The pictures it takes likely won't be as sharp or colorful as the 12-megapixel camera on the Pro, which also supports Live Photos, True Tone flash, and 4K video recording. The Pro's front sensor is also better. It boasts a 5-megapixel front camera compared with the iPad's 1.2-megapixel sensor, giving it better quality for selfies and video chat. Software and Comparisons Both slates run iOS 10, so you won't encounter any difference there. Where features come into play is with the add-on accessories you can get with the Pro, like the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard. The iPad isn't compatible with either of these, so if your main usage is going to be productivity rather than multimedia you may want to pick the Pro. It has the best specs you can get, though it comes at a premium. Of course, the iPad will still work with any standard Bluetooth keyboard and at $329, it's the far more affordable option, making it a good choice for any buyer on a budget.

But guess what? Using two-factor authentication should protect you completely. It’s easy to set up, so take a minute and do it now. You used to be able to set up two-factor on the account settigs page at appleid.apple.com, but now this has to be done on a Mac or iOS device. (Apple ID users who don’t have a compatible device can still use an older two-step verification system—see below for more.) iOS Follow these steps on an iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch running iOS 9 or later. The iOS device must be protected with a passcode (Settings > Touch ID and Passcode). IDG Once you set up two-factor on an iOS device, you’ll see a code pop up when you try to log in to iCloud anywhere else. If you don’t see a pop-up or get a text message, you can cme back to this Settings &gt; iCloud screen and tap Get Verification Code. (Click to enlarge.) Launch the Settings app, and go to iCloud. Obviously you need to be signed in with the account you want to protect with two-factor authentication Tap your Apple ID. It doesn’t really look like a button, but it is. Then tap Password & Security in the next menu. Tap Turn on two-factor authentication. You’ll see an explanation screen, and tap Continue. You may be asked to verify your identity by answering the security questions you set up when you created your Apple ID. Next, enter a phone number where you can receive a text message or a phone call with a two-factor code. You can also specify if you want a text or a call. Then you’ll get that text message or call, and enter the six-digit verification code on the next screen. That’s it! Two-factor is on, and this is your official Trusted Device. The next time you sign on to iCloud.com, or set up your iCloud account on a new device, you’ll have to first enter your username and password, and then be prompted to enter a code. That code will come in a pop-up on your trusted device, texted/phoned to the number you provided, or, you can come back to this screen and tap Get Verification Code. Mac Setting this up on a Mac is nearly the same steps as on an iOS device. The Mac must be running OS X 10.11, El Capitan. IDG Open System Preferences and select iCloud. Click the Account Details button, and sign in if prompted. In the Security tab, click the button labeled Turn on two-factor authentication. Read the message and click Continue. Verify your identity by answering your security questions. Enter a phone number you can use to receive verification codes, and choose if you want to get text messages or calls. Enter the code that’s sent you to right away to finish up. IDG What if my device is too old? If your Mac isn’t running El Capitan, or your iOS device isn’t running iOS 9, you can still use two-step verification, which is slightly different than two-factor authentication, mostly because it relies on a text message being sent to a phone number, while the newer “authentication” is baked more seamlessly into the OSes. Plus, the older verification method requires you to hold onto a Recovery Key in case you ever lose your password. IDG Two-step verification always sends you a text message. With the newer two-factor authentication, you'll get this cool pop-up on nearby trusted devices signed in to the same iCloud account.  You can read more about the differences from Apple as well as from our own Glenn Fleishman. Apple still provides a way to enable two-step verification, by following this link, signing in, and following the instructions.

ENTERTAINMENT MUSIC California Sounds: Frank Ocean's radio show, Ann Magnuson's 12-minute op-ed and Kevin Morby's new song Ann Magnuson Ann Magnuson (Austin Young) Ann Magnuson (Austin Young) Randall RobertsContact Reporter Frank Ocean, “Blonded 02” radio show. (Beats 1/Apple Music). The Los Angeles-based R&B superstar recently issued the second installment of his Beats 1 show, and it feels like a shuffle-play peek at Ocean’s musical psyche. In opening with a breathtaking chorale spiritual from jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams’ 1964 album, “Mary Lou Williams presents Christ of the Andes,” Ocean sets a meditative tone, as if to center listeners in a moment of overwhelming power. He jumps from vintage to contemporary, reflecting moments in time against each other. Los Angeles producer and guitarist Steve Lacy’s “Dark Red” butts against a buzzing new track by New England/London group Something for Your M.I.N.D. Ocean drops songs by hip hop producers J Dilla and DJ Shadow, plays Port Arthur, Texas, rap duo UGK, R&B legends Usher and Whitney Houston and beyond. And, of course, he plays a few of his own works: “Solo,” from his album “Blond,” and his new single, “Chanel.” Combined, the set confirms a crucial Ocean trait: excellent taste. (Available with Apple Music subscription.) Ann Magnuson, “Open Letter to an Open Letter” (self-released). To paraphrase the singer, actress and performance artist Magnuson, “Seriously, what the heck?” Not one to pull punches, the Los Angeles-based artist repeatedly employs a more combustible word than “heck” on her new 12-minute work, which wrestles with the Internet, social media, hashtag culture, superficiality and the Trump-era political landscape, and does it along with a Last Poets-style conga rhythm accompaniment. Magnuson rose in New York’s 1980s downtown arts scene, earning attention for her deft monologues and acclaim in musical circles for her work in the 1990s as one half of the group Bongwater. (Warning: The song below contains a lot of profanity, may strike some as offensive and is not safe for work.) The artist premiered her new song, “Open Letter to an Open Letter,” in mid-March at the Trepany House at the Steve Allen Theater. She did so as part of a sold-out performance called, “Seriously, WTF?! Dream Girl Reacts to the National Nightmare.” In a post for the website Dangerous Minds, Magnuson outlined the genesis of the song, which she recorded a few years back but never released. “In the three years since the piece was written the mad chatter on the Internet has become so voluminous, so unhinged, so ugly and combative that there can be no doubt that we really are in the midst of a Civil War. And that battlefield is getting really bloody.” The song bears that out. Kevin Morby, “Come to Me Now” lyric video (Dead Oceans). The Mount Washington-based singer and songwriter earned much praise for last year’s delicate album “Singing Saw,” which landed on a lot of best of 2016 lists. For his forthcoming album, “City Music” (June 16), Morby focuses on urban themes. SNAP Video Kevin Morby, "Come to Me Now" Kevin Morby, "Come to Me Now" See more videos “Come to Me Now” is the first song to come from the album, and you can hear Morby’s avowed influences, Lou Reed and Patti Smith, in his delivery and in the musical atmospherics. "The organ you’re hearing on this song is an old pump organ from the 1800s,” wrote Morby in release notes. “I wish I could remember the brand — but I don’t. This was my favorite part of recording this album, playing this thing and pumping air into it with the foot pedals.” Morby added that at first he thought the organ was a studio prop but committed to using it when he learned that it still worked. Added Morby: “Above it hung a framed photo of the original owner of the studios property, who died some time ago. Apparently his ghost still occupies the premises."

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Apple’s new 9.7 inch iPad sells for $329 and up 03/21/2017 at 8:59 AM by Brad Linder 7 Comments Apple is updating its iPad lineup with a new entry-level 9.7 inch model with a starting price of $329, which means it’ll be the most affordable tablet available from the Apple Store when the new model goes on sale Friday, March 24th. That’s because Apple is dropping the iPad 2 and iPad mini 2, and only selling iPad mini 4 models with 128GB of storage or more, leaving you with these choices: iPad 9.7″ for $329 and up (32GB or 128GB) iPad mini 4 for $399 and up (for 128GB) iPad Pro 9.7″ for $599 and up (32GB, 128GB, or 256GB) iPad Pro 12.9″ for $799 and up (32GB, 128GB, or 256GB) The new 9.7 inch model has a 2048 x 1536 pixel display, an Apple A9 processor, up to 10 hours of battery life, an 8MP rear camera, a 1.2MP front camera, and a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. It measures about 0.3 inches thick, weighs about 1 pound, and Apple says you should able to get up to 10 hours of battery life from the tablet’s 32.4 Wh battery. Apple offers 32GB and 128GB models and you can opt for a WiFi-only model (with 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.2 support) or pay extra for a version with 4G LTE support for all major US wireless carriers. Apple has also launched new red iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models, and updated the iPhone SE: now you can buy that model with 32GB or 128GB of storage for the same price as the previously available 16GB and 64GB versions. What I find particularly fascinating about this move is that while Apple isn’t exactly selling $100 iPad models to compete with low-end Android tablets, it’s getting tougher and tougher to think of the iPad as premium brand when Apple’s product lineup covers such a wide range of price points. Meanwhile, Samsung is still hoping people will be willing to pay iPad Pro-like prices for premium Android tablets. press release Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 7 Comments on "Apple’s new 9.7 inch iPad sells for $329 and up" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest SmileyAja Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Given slumping mobile sales overall, it reeks of desperation BUT… the good kind for the consumer. This is going to send a shiver down the conformist spines of Android Premium devices (those that copy price but add little else of value). I say it’s about time Apple got out of it’s comfort zone, even if they were forced out by market forces and their own cannibalization of macOS/devices.

And this price is turning my head. I’m on the fence. The issue is it would be for a multi user household to stand a few different duties. Android allowing multiple sign-ins on a device is a big advantage. All in all while it’s something I’ll consider I’m also still considering Nvidia’s Android tablet. While that device is a couple years old and in many ways outclassed by this new ipad for similar money, the Nvidia tablet is more flexible in ways that might suit my needs more. I will be reading reviews on this when they come though. Also wondering what retailers like Target, who traditionally discount hard on ipads around the holidays, will do with this device.

Alexa, Cortana or Siri? 24 Mar 2017 A Beijing court has overturned a ruling that Apple’s iPhone 6 violated a Chinese manufacturer’s patent which saw the US tech giant ordered to cease selling the smartphone in Beijing. In May last year the Beijing Intellectual Property Office ruled that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili with its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and would be barred from selling those models in the capital. Sales, however, were not suspended while Apple appealed against the administrative order. The Intellectual Property Court in Beijing on Friday ruled in favour of the California-based firm. The court “quashes the decision of the bureau” and “recognises that Apple ... has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili”, according to the verdict reported by the People’s Court Daily. The intellectual property office, an administrative body of Beijing municipality, had ruled that the two Apple phones infringed a Baili design patent. It had accused the US firm of having “copied” the exterior design of Baili’s 100C smartphone, which is characterised by a curved edge and rounded corners. But the Beijing court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features that “completely change the effect of the entire product ... and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers,” finding Baili’s claim was without legal basis. When it took on Apple in December 2014, Baili was a promising electronics firm, backed by internet giant Baidu and eager to tap the telecoms boom. But since then the company has collapsed, hit by public criticism of its products seen as poor quality and more so by China’s ultra-competitive smartphone market which has seen many start-ups go under. ‘Don’t buy iPhone 7, or you’re fired’, Chinese hospital staff warned Even Apple is under pressure. While China, along with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, remains its second largest market after the US, the Cupertino-based company saw its turnover in the Greater China region fall 12 per cent in the last quarter of 2016. Apple’s market share has plummeted in mainland China, falling behind local competitors such as telecoms giant Huawei, newcomers Oppo and Vivo, and “internet of things” pioneer Xiaomi. Apple has already had intellectual property problems in China. In May 2016 a maker of “iphone” branded leather goods won a lawsuit filed by Apple as the court ruled Xintong Tiandi had registered the word as a trademark in 2007, while Apple smartphones did not officially go on sale in China until 2009.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Tillerson warns of US military strike on North Korea 2 Occupy leaders arrested and charged a day after Lam win 3 HSBC axes 120 IT jobs in Hong Kong 4 Australia-based academic fears long forced stay in China 5 Why are Chinese moving to Malaysia by the thousands?

A new jailbreak tweak release called Zeal by iOS developers Rabih M. and Stijn aims to answer all the cries from battery sticklers that have yet to be answered by Apple. It provides both an informative battery management interface that you can invoke on demand to see more about how your battery is doing and conserve power. Zeal can be broken down into two main parts: the alert and the banner. Both provide different features based on what you prefer to see, and we’ll discuss them both below. The Zeal alert The alert mode of Zeal can be invoked manually with Activator and enables you to bring up a window in the center of your screen with information about your battery and several options to save battery at a glance. It’s called an alert because it’s based off the alert system that’s built into iOS, hence it looks like an alert-styled notification message. Once you invoke the interface, you get information about your current battery level. You should also take notice of the easy Low Power Mode toggle button, a display brightness slider, and the Control Center-like toggles right beneath it. The toggles are all customizable, as you’ll see later in this post, but one thing worth pointing out is that if you pull down on the grabber at the bottom of the alert, you’ll see even more advanced information about your battery that Apple never shows you, including: Your current battery capacity Your current battery temperature Your battery’s maximum capacity The number of charge cycles your battery has been through The wear level of your battery This is the useful information that iOS device users will never get to see without a jailbreak. For whatever reason, Apple likes to keep this battery information dumbed-down for the end user. Apple computer users are likely more familiar with this type of information, as it can be pulled up on Macs as well. It’s worth noting that this data is pulled directly from the battery, so these aren’t third-party algorithms; these are the statistics every battery monger wants to see! The Zeal banner Another way to use the tweak is in banner mode. It’s a bit less informative and offers fewer features, but if you hate the way alerts get in the way of everything, then the banner mode provides a way to get back to what you’re doing without being as disturbed. Just like the alert mode above, the banner mode can be invoked with an Activator action. Upon invoking it, you see a notification-style banner that shows how much battery life is remaining; tapping on or pulling down on the banner reveals additional options that are seen in the alert mode as well. Among the things you’ll see are a Low Power Mode toggle button, a brightness slider, and your toggle buttons. Unlike with the alert view, you don’t get to see all the detailed information about your battery, which is a little disappointing. The banner-style interface is the minimalist option between the two available modes that Zeal comes with. Configuring Zeal Zeal adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where you’ll be able to configure the tweak to your liking: The options you get here include: Toggle the tweak on or off on demand Choose the alert mode you want to use Configure what toggle switches appear in the interface Choose the Activator method you want to use to invoke the interface Get a notification when your battery is full Choose how many switches appear on each page of the alert Display how much longer to full charge when plugged in Choose between dark or light mode Schedule dark mode for certain times of the day Choose how many switches appear on each page of the banner Allow pulling down on the banner to reveal more information A respring button is included right below the toggle switch so you can save any changes you make to the settings. Once you’re configured, you’re ready to start using Zeal; just use the Activator action you chose, and you should see one interface or the other (depending on what you chose). Conclusion Zeal is an incredible release, and if you’re one to keep a keen eye on your battery to make sure you’re getting as much up-time as you feel you should get, then this is a must-have for you. I think the alert-style interface is the best way to go, as you can see more information at a glance. You don’t really have to worry about it popping up in the way of what you’re doing because you’re manually invoking the interface when you want to see it anyways, so the banner option doesn’t make as much sense to me, personally. Your mileage may vary, as it comes down to personal opinion in this case. If you want to give Zeal a try for yourself, you can download it for $0.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak supports all jailbroken devices running iOS 9 and 10.

Blip dude Uhh, no. Just because a jailbreak isn’t available for the latest and greatest devices doesn’t mean its dead. The days of having your cake and eating it too however, are possibly behind us. So in the future decide what you want the most, the latest iPhone or the latest Jailbreak. Lastly, so what if iOS 10.3 is coming out?? Ever thought that maybe Pangu (or TaiG) might release a Jailbreak for that firmware later in the summer?? Kamran Mackey They won’t/can’t. 10.3 has a brand new file system that is extremely secure. I’d like to see people try and make a jailbreak for 10.3. It’s highly unlikely that’ll happen. Blip dude That same BS was said back in iOS 9, or rather it’s said about every update of every OS out there available for consumers, yet 2 jailbreaks manifested since iOS 9.0, and a Jailbreak has already manifested from iOS 10. Will it be tough?? Definitely!! I don’t expect Apple to make things easy and leave security holes all over iOS. But every OS sadly always has an exploit that isn’t discovered early on, so you better believe iOS 10.3 is not 100% secure. There’s no such thing as perfection, so it’s NOT a matter of will it happen, but more of when will it finally happen!! CryptoCoin420 Umm 10.1.1 on iPhone 7 is jailbreakable. It’s not great but it’s better than nothing. (JailbreakQA) King Shoot 10.1.1 is jailbreakable on 7, all devices except the 7 and 7+ are jailbreakable on 10.2 and below, I don’t see how jailbreaking is dead. Just because your latest and greatest iPhone doesn’t have a jailbreak on the latest and greatest iOS doesn’t mean jailbreaking is dead. Nuff Said There needs to be an open forum. Natalie Rip jailbreak. Seems like iOS 11 may see the last jailbreak. It’s getting harder and harder and not many people are working on it anymore. I’d love to see this on my iPhone but the whole mess when saving SHSH2 blobs happened a lot of us got left in the dark 🙁 Nuff Said Apple won. Natalie They sure did! Kinda sucks, but just proves how secure our data is now ^^; Steve Harold Regardless of all of the people whining below about not being jailbroken, I am very happy about this tweak, and I am very excited about all of the new tweaks that are coming out. Rumor has it Springtomize is on the way, after that we can call this a true jailbreak. Tommy yup, springtomize is on the way. JbA2B This is not a terrific or awesome app. It does what about 10 other battery apps do. Hey developers, how about a battery app that analyzes each running app and reduces the power to them either selectively or user determined to save battery life (like hogs such as messenger apps and social network apps). Now, that would be a terrific app. These apps are like reading multiple websites that tell you to “restore” you phone when something doesn’t work properly…yep, restore, that’s a good time. So, how about an app that does more than show us info about the battery since there are so many apps that do it already.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Facebook adds Snapchat-style effects and auto vanishing Stories to its mainland app Apple seeds first betas of iOS 10.3.2, tvOS 10.2.1, watchOS 3.2.2 and macOS 10.12.5 Luca Todesco announces his departure from the jailbreak community Hands-on with tvOS 10.2: fast scrolling, updated Remote app & more Hands-on video: everything new in macOS Sierra 10.12.4   The latest jailbreak news Luca Todesco announces his departure from the jailbreak community Last chance to downgrade from iOS 10.3 betas and save blobs for iOS 10.2.1 Add some squareness to iOS with ringUI Jailbreak tweaks of the week: YouTubeVolume, Zeal, & more… Zeal is a battery management system for your jailbroken iPhone or iPad iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

On Thursday, the streaming music service mostly known as a place to hear podcasts and remixes from unknown DJs confirmed that it had taken $70 million in debt funding -basically a loan from various investors-in order to stay in business. It's never a good sign when venture-backed companies have to raise money from debt financing groups, because it indicates that traditional investors don't have much hope for the company. This appears to be the case for SoundCloud, as TechCrunch reports that the debt funding was raised because the company couldn't close a $100 million round of funding. Back in February, when SoundCloud released its 2015 financial information , we found out that the company had lost $55 million for the year and was at the risk of running out of cash. Yet, while having an extra $70 million is certainly helpful, it's probably not going to be enough to save SoundCloud from the fate of Rdio, Grooveshark, MOG, and other failed music streaming services. In fact, looking at the landscape, streaming services in general are kind of fucked. The payment model for streaming music services makes it very difficult for companies to actually make money. In addition to infrastructure costs, payroll, and marketing, music licensing fees paid to the labels mean that the profit margin for subscription streaming is often negative. Profitability, even for the biggest players, is still largely a pipe dream. As a result, it's a game where only services with a lot of funding and a lot of users (Spotify), or a lot of backing by a parent company and a lot of users (Apple Music), are relatively safe. At least for now. But who is the most fucked? Who is just sort of fucked? Who has the best shot at surviving? Here is a ranking of streaming music companies, ranked from most to least fucked. Most screwed 1. PonoMusic PonoMusic technically isn't a streaming service, but we included it on the list because it's just so very fucked. You may recall that Neil Young's terrible Pono Player had an accompanying online store from which Pono owners could buy high resolution music. Hilariously, that store didn't even get Young's May 2016 single (it was a Tidal exclusive), which was a very bad sign for the future of both the service and player. In July, the company announced that the PonoMusic store would be going " offline " as it switched to a new source for its content. But more than eight months later, the store is still offline . In fact, Pono hasn't tweeted since January, and the music player doesn't appear to be for sale on its website. If PonoMusic ever makes an actual comeback, we will be shocked. 2. SoundCloud Poor SoundCloud. The service has raised an enormous amount of money-$320 million since 2009, according to Crunchbase -and the product is good . It's also known as a launching ground for indie artists before they make it big (Chance the Rapper, Lorde are famous alums), and it's been platform to which aspiring DJs could upload their tracks. But the reality is that SoundCloud can't compete against its bigger, better-funded rivals. The fact that it couldn't close a funding round and had to raise debt instead speaks volumes. Moreover, SoundCloud Go, its premium product, hasn't exactly pulled in paying users-in fact, the company had to launch a dumbed-down, cheaper version last month. Here's a bet: Within 12 months, Spotify or Google is going to buy SoundCloud. 3. Tidal Tidal has basically been a disaster since Jay-Z relaunched it back in 2015. In just two years , the company has gone through multiple CEOs , faced lawsuits from customers and employees, and was reportedly late with payments to some of its indie labels. Even Jay-Z feels like he was ripped off ! Tidal might last a bit longer, but eventually, Jay-Z will probably get tired of investing money in a service no one cares about and give up the ghost. 4. Napster/Rhapsody You didn't misread that. Napster-or at least its brand name-is still around. Of course, the only thing that remains of the original peer-to-peer music app is the logo- everything else is actually just Rhapsody, one of the very first streaming music services. (The two merged back in 2011.) In many ways, the Spotifys and Apple Musics of the world owe a huge debt to Rhapsody/Napster. Rhapsody was the first subscription service that licensed streaming music from all of the major label groups. But being early isn't always a good thing, and the company has struggled over the years. As of 2015, it had just 3.5 million paying subscribers. We're more and more amazed that Napster/Rhapsody is still alive with every year that passes. 5. Pandora Pandora is in a heap of trouble-take note of its depressing financial results and recent layoffs-but unlike most of the other stand-alone music services, it's also a public company. More importantly, Pandora has users. Pandora's free product has about 81 million monthly active users, which makes it one of the most popular services around. The problem, however, is that those users aren't making the company any money. It's pinning a lot of its hopes to its new Pandora Premium service, but early reviews say that it has nothing to offer over Spotify or Apple Music. If its stock plummets far enough, Pandora could be a great takeover target. Medium screwed 6. Deezer Deezer isn't very popular in the US, but the service has more than 6 million users across the globe. The company planned a French IPO back in 2015, but ended up canceling it , citing "market conditions"-that's code for "Pandora is tanking and we're afraid our share price will be bad"-but still managed to raise another $109 million in January 2016. It's hard to say what the future of Deezer is, but the company hasn't made any layoffs, so that's an OK sign. 7. Groove Music Microsoft's music service isn't exactly a focal point for the company. (In fact, we forgot it existed until we started writing this story.) And that's why it's medium-level screwed. On the one hand, Groove Music has Microsoft's very pliant coffers to keep it up and running. On the other hand, if Microsoft decides it's bored of doing its own streaming service (as Sony did back in 2015), it could wind up nuking the service. 8. iTunes Music Store Technically, iTunes isn't a streaming service, but its importance in the digital music space earns it a place on this list. For nearly a decade , iTunes was the most popular place to buy digital music. But times are changing. In January, Nielsen reported that in 2016, music streaming overtook digital music downloads for the first time. That means that iTunes's revenues are declining, and that's bad for the traditional iTunes Music Store. The good news is that Apple has an alternative for iTunes waiting in the wings: Apple Music. Last May, music industry analyst Mark Mulligan predicted that Apple Music revenue would overtake iTunes Music Store revenue by 2020, at which point Apple might consider turning off the old download store. Within a few years, the iTunes Music store will probably be fucked, but for now, it's still the most popular way to buy music. Least screwed 9. Google Play Music Google Play Music isn't as popular as the other major streaming players, but the fact that it's backed by Google gives it a good shot at survival. Google Play Music is actually a few things: It's part iTunes (you can buy songs); part iTunes Match (you can upload songs you downloaded elsewhere for access anywhere); and part Apple Music. As a bonus, anyone who subscribes to Google Play Music also gets a YouTube Red subscription, and vice versa. For $10 a month, that's a lot of streaming music and ad-free YouTube content. 10. iHeartRadio iHeartRadio is run by iHeartMedia (the company formerly known as Clear Channel Communications), and thus has a huge tie-in with most of the nation's largest radio stations. iHeartRadio might not have cachet of Spotify, but with 100 million registered users in the US, it has a lot of ears. Moreover, because its owner is the biggest player in the terrestrial radio business, it doesn't have the same financial issues as Slacker or Pandora. iHeartRadio might not be cool, but it's also not screwed. 11. Amazon Music Unlimited Amazon has had a music service for its Prime users for a few years, but in October, it launched its direct Spotify/Apple Music rival, Amazon Music Unlimited . Though it is very likely that Amazon sees its music offering as a loss-leader-Prime members pay $8 a month instead of $10 for non-Prime members-as long as Amazon doesn't get bored by music, it's probably pretty safe. 12. Spotify Make no mistake: Spotify has some very real business problems. For one, it can't make money , though some investors insist it might find profitability this year. For another, musicians and labels don't all love the service. And the longer it delays its IPO , the more money it owes some of its investors. None of that is great. But the reality is that Spotify is far and away the biggest streaming service globally-both paid and free-on the planet, with more than 50 million paying users. Moreover, even though labels and artists often decry how much Spotify pays them, only the biggest artists can actually afford to not be on the service. Post-IPO, Spotify could be screwed, but for now, it's the definition of too big to fail. 13. Apple Music Let's be honest: Apple Music will probably never outpace Spotify in number of subscribers. Spotify had at least a four-year head start, and it has a free product that can get people hooked. But that doesn't matter. In less than two years, Apple Music has managed to attract more than 20 million paying subscribers, something no company on this list (save Spotify) can even fathom reaching. Plus, Apple Music is backed by the richest corporation in the world. And as stated above, in the future, Apple Music will likely be the iTunes Music Store's replacement. As revenue for the iTunes Music Store declines, Apple is going to do everything in its power to make Apple Music make up the difference. Ones we've already lost Rdio: Rdio was acquired by Pandora in 2015 and was the basis for the new Pandora Premium. A lot of us really loved Rdio, but in the end, its death was entirely predictable . Grooveshark: Who knew a business model built entirely on intellectual property theft wouldn't work? (Not even OG Napster was as brazen as Grooveshark.) The service, which was awesome for music fans-if not great for musicians-was wonderful, but it was sued out of existence back in 2015. Beats Music: Beats Music launched in January 2014, and as music services go, it was pretty rad. Then Apple bought Beats in May of 2014 for $3 billion. It ended up using the underpinnings of Beats Music for Apple Music, which was launched in 2015. MOG: Beats Music might be Apple Music's precursor, but Beats Musics' precursor was MOG. For a brief moment, it looked like MOG could make a name for itself (it was available in the US before Spotify and offered a similar service), but it couldn't compete and was sold to Beats for just $12 million in 2012. Songza: Songza was never that popular, but its curated playlists made it a favorite for many music lovers. Google acquired the service in 2014 and shut it down at the beginning of 2016. Fortunately, most of Songza's best features are now integrated into Google Play Music. Last.fm (for streaming): Last.fm used to be a great way to stream music, but its owner, CBS, shut down that feature in 2014. The scrobbling service-the Last.fm term for making a record of every song a person listens to-still exists. Milk Music: Samsung tried to enter the streaming music space in 2014 with the bizarrely named Milk Music. But the service curdled and ultimately shut down in September 2016. GhostTunes: Country superstar Garth Brooks famously hates digital music, including iTunes. Still, even Brooks had to recognize that even the most ardent Chris Gaines fans are annoyed by CDs. In 2014, Brooks launched GhostTunes , his own shitty version of iTunes. Amazingly, the service managed to exist until Amazon bought it (and the digital rights to Brooks' catalog) in October 2016 . Sony Music Unlimited: Sony used to have its own subscription streaming service. Sony Music Unlimited launched in the US in early 2011, just a few months before Spotify's stateside debut, but never managed to gain a lot of users. Sony conceded defeat in early 2015, ditching its own program for a Spotify-backed service .

Apple products are not typically thought of as budget devices, but Cupertino today announced a brand new iPad model, and the focus is on affordability. The new iPad is simply called the "iPad" with Apple marketing it as "best-in-class performance at its most affordable price ever." It costs $329 and replaces the iPad Air 2 in the tablet lineup. For your $329, Apple is offering a 9.7-inch iPad with a Retina display (2,048-by-1,536 resolution) and 32GB of storage powered by the 64-bit A9 processor (also found in the iPhone 6s). It runs iOS 10, offers Wi-Fi and Touch ID, 8MP and FaceTime HD cameras, weighs 1 pound, and boasts 10 hours of battery life. Color options include Silver, Gold, and Space Gray. You may also be happy to hear it does retain the 3.5mm headphone jack. Apple decided not to offer a 64GB storage option, instead jumping to 128GB, which will cost $429. If you want the extra storage and cellular, expect to pay $459. All options include a Lightning-to-USB cable and power adapter. Apple will start accepting orders on Friday, March 24, with stock arriving in Apple Stores next week. This is a simultaneous release across the US, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Denmark, India, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, and Taiwan get it in May. Apple points out that the iPad mini 4 does offer better value for money in terms of storage space compared to this new iPad. If you don't mind the smaller 7.9-inch display, the 128GB WiFi model costs $399. Philanthropic iPhone fans, meanwhile, can also order a (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus on Friday, too. Get it with 128GB or 256GB of storage, starting at $749. Apple's budget iPhone SE, meanwhile, will also be available in in 32GB and 128GB models, starting at $399, replacing existing 16GB and 64GB models. Check Out the Red iPhone 7 Surprise!

In May last year the Beijing intellectual property bureau had ruled that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili with its iPhone6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and would be barred from selling those models. Sales however were not suspended while Apple appealed against the administrative order. The Intellectual Property Court in Beijing on Friday ruled in favour of the California-based firm. The court "quashes the decision of the bureau" and "recognises that Apple ... Has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili", according to the verdict reported by the state judicial daily Renmin Fayuan Ribao. The intellectual property bureau, an administrative body of Beijing municipality, had ruled that the two Apple phones infringed a Baili design patent. It had accused the US firm of having "copied" the exterior design of Baili's 100C smartphone, which is characterised by a curved edge and rounded corners. But the Beijing court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features that "completely change the effect of the entire product ... And both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers," finding Baili's claim was without legal basis. When it took on Apple in December 2014, Baili was a promising electronics firm, backed by internet giant Baidu and eager to tap the telecoms boom. But since then the company has collapsed, hit by public criticism of its products seen as poor quality and more so by China's ultra-competitive smartphone market which has seen many start-ups go under. Even Apple is under pressure. While China, along with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, remains its second largest market after the US, the Cupertino-based company saw its turnover in this "Greater China" region fall 12 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Apple's market share has plummeted in mainland China, falling behind local competitors such as telecoms giant Huawei, newcomers Oppo and Vivo, and "internet of things" pioneer Xiaomi. Apple has already had intellectual property problems in China. In May 2016 a maker of "iphone" branded leather goods won a lawsuit filed by Apple as the court ruled Xintong Tiandi had registered the word as a trademark in 2007, while Apple smartphones did not officially go on sale in China until 2009.

If you want your Apple iPhone to do something new, you usually just head to the App Store and find a pre-made tool get it done. When smartphones came out, that was all you needed — an app for that. Today you might view a photo attached to a text on your Apple Watch, drag and drop individual files between iCloud folders on your phone, download them to PhotoShop on your Mac to manipulate and recombine them, and re-upload the final versions to the cloud. Life today, in short, is more complicated. What if you want one app to do something to another app? Say, call an Uber every time you order Seamless for pick-up? Or what if you want one device to do something to another one — like having photos from certain iPhone camera roll folders automatically download to your Mac? That gets messy. There are few ready-made solutions that meet the Steve Jobs criteria of "three clicks or less." Now, Apple is getting back to those roots, said John Feland of consumer experience analytics firm ‎Argus Insights. The App Store took a novel interface — mobile — and simplified the portal connecting phones to the internet. Apple's newest acquisition, Workflow, has the potential to do the same thing on a higher level for the smart home, particularly for voice, by simplifying the way we connect our devices to each other, Feland said. Workflow is an app that allows you to automate certain actions. (Here's a guide to how it works.) TechCrunch first reported Apple's takeover of the app, which Apple said had "outstanding use of iOS accessibility features, in particular an outstanding implementation for VoiceOver with clearly labeled items, thoughtful hints, and drag/drop announcements, making the app usable and quickly accessible to those who are blind or low-vision." "Rather than asking Siri to do 12 things in a row, you can give it one task" Apple is tight-lipped, so it's hard to know exactly what the engineers in Cupertino will come up with — Workflow could easily fade into the background of other products. But Forrester analyst Frank Gillett said it's unusual for Apple to acknowledge an acquisition and keep an app on the market, suggesting Workflow might stick around. The software menu for your life Workflow is somewhat of a visual programming tool that's easier than writing an app but probably too wonkish for the average consumer. Gillett said Apple might get under the hood, making it easier for every iPhone user to make DIY programs. But another theory is that a new generation of developers, or "prosumers," could create "workflows" that act as micro or mini apps, Feland said. The Workflow app would then become a menu or "store" where consumers could go and select sets of commands that were premade by others. For instance, a Workflow "developer" could create a "Gone Fishing" workflow that automatically locks the doors, turns down the thermostat, and shuts off the lights for the weekend. You open the Workflow app, search for the one you need, and when it's time to head out, all you have to do is tell Siri, "I'm going fishing." That's important, Feland said, as Siri has "languished" behind competitors like Amazon's Alexa and Google Home, who have a more open platform ripe for integration across devices and apps. Apple has already opened the gate to these kinds of integrations. Siri opened to developers last year, and users can now do things like buy an iTunes movie on one device and continue watching it on another. Workflow is also important as Apple tries to extend computing experiences beyond your phone, which is increasingly become the "digital hub" that Steve Jobs once envisioned when he dropped "Computer" from the company's name. "Some of this is Apple shifting velocity," Feland said. "Apple is trying to almost make iOS the core operating system that people are using. They are shifting to much more of a model that's not performance, but it's about connectivity." So just like creating playlists was a heavy burden for the small screen of the iPod in the early 2000s, complex tasks can be overwhelming on a pair of AirPods, a Watch or the augmented reality glasses Apple is rumored to be making. The solution for the iPod was iTunes on a personal computer -- a spread-out interface with plenty of room to create playlists. In a similar way, Workflow could automate processes that are repetitive or tedious to do on a small screen. But it could also force developers — Apple's loyalists — to adapt to a new way of making technology. "By owning the technology, they are telling developers, this is going to be important so you should support it," Gillett said. An Automator for the iPhone The Workflow acquisition comes after Apple lost Mac automation expert Sal Soghoian in October, a departure that ruffled feathers in the software development community. Soghoian had been critical of using tools like app extensions to replicate the Automator function on Mac. Tweet: You actually can script iOS. Try Workflow "Developers, but also people that are making music and content, were getting frustrated because they are being pushed into a less rich capability set," Feland said. But Apple is already grooming the next generation of developers — seeding its new iPads with children's games to learn Apple's newest programming language, Swift. Importantly, these games work on touch screens, not Macs. Tech commentator Jan Dawson notes that Workflow is a "much more user friendly approach to automation than Automator, and what I'd hope we'll see here is that same approach applied to built-in automation across Apple's product lines including the Mac." Workflow could even create a deeper platform that enables hard-core Apple users to do more serious work from their connected devices. Consider Final Cut Pro — a "pro-sumer" software product that was eventually adopted by serious media professionals. Still, Gillett thinks it's "ridiculous" to think we're anywhere close to an "iPhone Pro" replacing Macs at design schools. He said he thinks there may be more powerful MacBooks and desktop Macs in the pipeline for developers. "What I think is true is they misjudged emotions of their developers who were disappointed with the latest MacBook Pros," Gillett said. "I don't think there's anyway to make a phone to do development work."

The documents released by the anti-secrecy site Thursday morning pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn’t disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple’s statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance “targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans.” The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday’s statement. “We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information,” the statement read. “We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain.” Apple said that while it takes users’ security and privacy seriously, “we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.” Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, “and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder.” Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way.     Tags: apple, wikileaks, information, statement, fixed, vulnerabilities, Other stories from today: Disney CEO: ‘Last Jedi’ not changed due to Fisher’s death More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott Apple: Software flaws in latest WikiLeaks docs are all fixed     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   Do you think on-demand ride companies like Uber and Lyft are helping with the area's traffic congestion?

In May last year the Beijing intellectual property bureau had ruled that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili with its iPhone6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and would be barred from selling those models. Sales however were not suspended while Apple appealed against the administrative order. The Intellectual Property Court in Beijing on Friday (March 24) ruled in favour of the California-based firm. The court “quashes the decision of the bureau” and “recognises that Apple ... has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili”, according to the verdict reported by the state judicial daily Renmin Fayuan Ribao. The intellectual property bureau, an administrative body of Beijing municipality, had ruled that the two Apple phones infringed a Baili design patent. It had accused the US firm of having “copied” the exterior design of Baili’s 100C smartphone, which is characterised by a curved edge and rounded corners. But the Beijing court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features that “completely change the effect of the entire product ... and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers,” finding Baili’s claim was without legal basis. When it took on Apple in December 2014, Baili was a promising electronics firm, backed by internet giant Baidu and eager to tap the telecoms boom. But since then the company has collapsed, hit by public criticism of its products seen as poor quality and more so by China’s ultra-competitive smartphone market which has seen many start-ups go under. Even Apple is under pressure. While China, along with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, remains its second largest market after the US, the Cupertino-based company saw its turnover in this “Greater China” region fall 12 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Apple’s market share has plummeted in mainland China, falling behind local competitors such as telecoms giant Huawei, newcomers Oppo and Vivo, and “internet of things” pioneer Xiaomi. Apple has already had intellectual property problems in China. In May 2016 a maker of “iphone” branded leather goods won a lawsuit filed by Apple as the court ruled Xintong Tiandi had registered the word as a trademark in 2007, while Apple smartphones did not officially go on sale in China until 2009.

(AP) Apple says purported hacking techniques released by WikiLeaks this week have all been fixed in recent iPhones and Mac computers. Documents released yesterday pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn’t disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement yesterday, Apple says the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also says the Mac vulnerabilities were all corrected in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple’s statement is consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been remedied, based on its preliminary analysis. tags Apple wikileaks CIA iPhone iPhone hack more from business US top court rejects bid to revive $7.25 billion credit card settlement Mar 27, 2017 20:14 IST India lifts ban on bulk export of major edible oils Mar 27, 2017 19:56 IST FD vs Stocks: Which One Should You Choose?

This free app is coming alongside iOS 10.3 in April. This is what you need to know about the new Apple Clips app with Live Titles and the rest of the features that are part of this new iPhone and iPad video app. Read: Best iPhone Apps “Clips gives iPhone and iPad users a new way to express themselves through video, and it’s incredibly easy to use,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Apps Product Marketing. “The effects, filters and amazing new Live Titles we’ve designed for Clips let anyone make great-looking, easily sharable videos with just a few taps.” Apple announced Clips alongside a new Red iPhone 7 and a new iPad with a 9.7-inch display in late March. What is the Apple Clips App? This is the new Apple Clips app. The Apple Clips app is a new video app from Apple that helps you make more shareable videos. The app only works on the iPhone and iPad, but it isn’t limited to sharing with other iPhone users. You can load up videos, photos, and music in the Clips app and it will combine the clips into a shareable video that you can post on social media or send through iMessage. With the Clips app, you are able to shoot live video, grab video and photos from your camera roll and then edit and combine them without the need to use complicated video editing software. You can add filters, emoji, shapes and customizable text. Once your video and photos are lined up, you can choose from dozens of music tracks that automatically line up to the length of your video clip. Apple Clips App Release Date The Apple Clips app release date is in April. Apple did not outline a specific date but does mention that you need to use iOS 10.3 with the new app. Apple is well into the iOS 10.3 beta process and there are some signs that this update will arrive in March, but this news release suggests that the iOS 10.3 release date is coming in April alongside Clips. Apple Clips Live Titles One example of Live Titles in the Apple Clips app. Apple’s big new feature in the Clips app is Live Titles. These are animated captions and titles that you create as you speak. Apple describes the feature, “Users can add animated captions and titles using just their voice. Captions are generated automatically as a user speaks, and appear on screen perfectly synced with the user’s voice. Users can mix and match different styles, and tap any title to adjust text and punctuation, or even add inline emoji. Live Titles supports 36 different languages.” You can add comic book filters, speech bubbles, shapes and even full screen animated posters that add to your videos. Can Apple Clips Share to Facebook, Snapchat & Instagram? Apple designed the Clips app to help you create videos using your photos, your iPhone or iPad camera and music. The company is not limiting where you can share the clips to. In the announcement, Apple specifically mentions that you can share to Facebook, Instagram and through the Messages app. Apple also mentions YouTube and Vimeo. You can save and share Apple Clips to a variety of social networks. If you share through the Messages the app can automatically suggest sending to people who appear in the clips and the people you share with most often. Once you have a Clips video in your camera roll you can upload to your Instagram Story or to Snapchat. Is Apple Clips Free? The Apple Clips app is free to download and use on your iPhone and iPad. The app only works on the iPhone 5s and newer and new 9.7-inch iPad, all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, iPad mini 2 and later as well as the iPod touch 6th generation. There is no indication that there will be in-app purchases to unlock extra music tracks or Live Titles at this time. 28 Best iPhone 7 Cases Speck Presido iPhone 7 Cases   1 / 28 Speck chose to deliver a new line of iPhone 7 cases that look and feel amazing.

(Reuters file photo) A Beijing court has overturned a ruling that Apple’s iPhone 6 violated a Chinese manufacturer’s patent which saw the US tech giant ordered to cease selling the smartphone in China. In May last year the Beijing intellectual property bureau had ruled that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili with its iPhone6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and would be barred from selling those models. Sales however were not suspended while Apple appealed against the administrative order. The Intellectual Property Court in Beijing on Friday ruled in favour of the California-based firm. The court “quashes the decision of the bureau” and “recognises that Apple ... has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili”, according to the verdict reported by the state judicial daily Renmin Fayuan Ribao. The intellectual property bureau, an administrative body of Beijing municipality, had ruled that the two Apple phones infringed a Baili design patent. It had accused the US firm of having “copied” the exterior design of Baili’s 100C smartphone, which is characterised by a curved edge and rounded corners. But the Beijing court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features that “completely change the effect of the entire product ... and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers,” finding Baili’s claim was without legal basis. When it took on Apple in December 2014, Baili was a promising electronics firm, backed by internet giant Baidu and eager to tap the telecoms boom.

Even Apple is under pressure. While China, along with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, remains its second largest market after the US, the Cupertino-based company saw its turnover in this “Greater China” region fall 12 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Apple’s market share has plummeted in mainland China, falling behind local competitors such as telecoms giant Huawei, newcomers Oppo and Vivo, and “internet of things” pioneer Xiaomi. Apple has already had intellectual property problems in China. In May 2016 a maker of “iphone” branded leather goods won a lawsuit filed by Apple as the court ruled Xintong Tiandi had registered the word as a trademark in 2007, while Apple smartphones did not officially go on sale in China until 2009. tags Apple iphone iPhone Shenzhen Baili iPhone 6 Plus Apple more from business China’s HNA in talks to buy controlling stake in Forbes Mar 28, 2017 10:34 IST Japan’s SoftBank pushing for merger between Flipkart and Snapdeal: Report Mar 28, 2017 10:19 IST FD vs Stocks: Which One Should You Choose?

Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt Apple a stinging defeat in China last year, were once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs. In 2016, they leapfrogged the rankings and shoved Apple out of the top three. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti)   Bloomberg     Duan Yongping is convinced Tim Cook didn't have a clue who he was when they first met a couple years ago. The Apple boss probably does now. Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world's largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, they leapfrogged the rankings and shoved Apple out of the top three in 2016 -- when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time. They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn't adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg in what he said was his first interview in 10 years. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardizing its winning formula elsewhere, Duan said. "Apple couldn't beat us in China because even they have flaws," the 56-year-old electronics mogul said. "They're maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas." That's not to say Duan doesn't appreciate the iPhone maker's global clout. In fact, the billionaire's obsession with his U.S. rival is well known: he's long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its chief executive officer. "I've met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we've chatted a little," Duan said. "I like him a lot." Apple couldn't confirm Duan's meeting with Cook when contacted by Bloomberg. But Duan has blogged incessantly about Apple's products, share price and operations since 2013, when the company was worth half what it is today. He needs "a really big pocket" because he carries four devices, including a heavily-used iPhone. In a 2015 post, he argued Apple's profit should reach $100 billion within five years. Today, Duan won't say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple's new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino. "Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from," Duan said. "We don't have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves." Oppo's gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China's Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong's Communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics. Duan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China's Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant. His first product was the "Subor" gaming console with dual-cartridge slots -- a direct shot at Nintendo Co.'s classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 100- to 400-yuan Subor became a hit in the absence of local competitors. Duan even enlisted Kung Fu star Jackie Chan to endorse the device. By 1995, revenue from the Subor exceeded 1 billion yuan. Duan left to set up a new business that year as the operation flourished -- a pattern he would repeat in later years. He christened his second venture Bubugao, literally "rising higher step-by-step." BBK, as the company came to be known, created a popular line of VCD and MP3 players but later also made DVD players for global brands. Subsidiary Bubugao Communication Equipment Co. became one of the country's biggest feature-phone makers around 2000, going head-to-head with Nokia and Motorola. It was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out dueling marketing campaigns in markets from India to Southeast Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets, IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur said. "The companies fully understand how to make the best of their people, a specialty they inherited from Duan," said Nicole Peng, a senior director at Canalys. Importantly, they understood their millennial audience. "Many of their managers are young and have been working at the company since graduation." Duan's latest endeavors were, in part, dreamed up in Apple's backyard. By 2001 at the age of 40, Duan had decided to move to California to focus on investment and philanthropy, later installing his family in a mansion he reportedly bought from Cisco Systems Chairman John Chambers. But the advent of the smartphone forced the entrepreneur out of retirement. By the second half of 2000s, BBK was on the verge of falling apart as sales of its basic devices slowed. The likes of Huawei and Coolpad were making smartphones priced at around 1,000 yuan. That nearly put the company under, Duan recalled. "We were in serious discussions about how to close the company peacefully -- in a way that the employees can leave unhurt and suppliers don't lose money," he said. Those intense brainstorming sessions spawned the two businesses that would go on to embody Duan's greatest success. In 2005, the entrepreneur and his protégé Tony Chen decided to create a new company. Dubbed Oppo, it sold music players but ramped up to smartphones in 2011. In 2009, BBK itself created Vivo, headed by another of Duan's disciples, Shen Wei. "Making mobile phones was not my call," said Duan. "But I reckoned we could do well in this market." At first, neither label garnered much attention. The iPhone was captivating users with its revolutionary apps system and elegant interface, while BlackBerrys lorded over the corporate market. But Oppo and Vivo then developed a marketing-blitz approach that relied on local celebrity endorsement and a vast resellers' store network across China. They crafted an affordable image that appealed to a millennial crowd, then tricked out their devices with high-end specs. On the surface, Oppo and Vivo phones now routinely surpass the iPhone on measures such as charging speeds, memory and battery life. It paid off. The duo together shipped more than 147 million smartphones in China in 2016, dwarfing Huawei Technologies Co.'s 76.6 million units, Apple's 44.9 million and Xiaomi's 41.5 million, IDC estimates. Oppo and Vivo both doubled their 2015 haul. In the fourth quarter, they were No. 1 and No. 3, respectively -- Huawei was second. Their approach worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, where midrange phones became a mainstream hit, said Tay Xiaohan, an IDC analyst. Duan's smartphone progeny are also gaining some momentum beyond their home turf. In the fourth quarter, Oppo and Vivo were fourth and fifth in the world, respectively. About a quarter of Oppo's shipments went to markets like India, where it hopes to dig in before Apple establishes a meaningful presence. Duan also owns a "small amount" of Alphabet Inc., whose Android operating software runs Oppo and Vivo devices as it does the majority of the world's smartphones. "Smartphones are an unprecedented opportunity. We forecast at least for the next 10 or 20 years, there's no replacement. But we don't know," Duan said. Cook said on the weekend that Apple doesn't have a specific goal for market share. "The competition is more fierce in China -- not only in this industry, but in many industries," Cook told the China Development Forum in Beijing. "I think that's a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making good products." Duan has increasingly kept his distance from the Chinese smartphone makers despite remaining a significant shareholder (he won't say how much). He says he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy California with his journalist wife and kids. In fact, he attends board meetings but claims to get most of his information on Oppo and Vivo from the internet, to avoid "disturbing them." His rivals have been less considerate. Last October, Xiaomi Corp. co-founder Lei Jun lambasted competitors who build dense store channels in rural areas in pursuit of quick sales. In an interview with China Entrepreneurs Magazine in October, Lei accused such players of using "imbalanced information" to trick buyers into shunning Xiaomi, precipitating its decline from the top spot. "Those who said this were insane," Duan said without naming names. "When someone talks about an information imbalance, deep down they believe consumers are idiots." His most visible passion these days is stock investment, which is why he agreed to pay a then-record $620,100 in 2006 to lunch with Buffett. Quotes from the Sage of Omaha still pepper Duan's blogposts, right alongside tips on golf and Apple. Duan cemented his reputation as a savvy financier in part by digging his friend, Netease Inc. founder William Ding, out of a hole. Ding's internet company tanked to as low as 13 cents after the dot-com bubble burst, then almost became the first U.S.-listed Chinese company to get tossed off the Nasdaq over an auditing issue. Duan came to his friend's aid, buying about 5 percent of Netease with just $2 million in 2002, when the stock price averaged 16 cents. Company filings show he still held just over 4 million shares as of March 2009, but Duan said he sold much of that when Netease hit $40. His other much-studied holding is premium-liquor company Kweichow Moutai Co. He said he bought in at 180 yuan in late 2012. While it nearly halved in 2014, Moutai today trades above 370 yuan. Duan isn't shy about talking up his trades, not least of which is Apple, which remains near a record high despite a rare sales decline in 2016. But looking back on his decades as first entrepreneur then stock-picker, his proudest moments remain rooted in BBK. Though he claims to keep it at arm's length, he admits to worrying about succession and whether the company culture will survive another generation of leaders. Management has tossed around the idea of an initial public offering but that wasn't an urgent consideration, Duan said. And while BBK's Vivo and Duan's own Oppo have done well, there's no certainty in a fast-moving business. Both are starting to ramp up everything from the features on their phones to marketing campaigns: Oppo notably used Barcelona's Mobile World Congress to unveil its most advanced camera technology yet, signaling a new maturity. One thing's for sure, Duan doesn't see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge. "I've made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback," he said. "If there's a problem they can't fix, then neither can I."

Liam Wright, from Middlesborough, died aged just 18, after battling a rare bone cancer called osteosarcoma in December last year. Facebook 3 Liam Wright was just 18 when died after battling a rare bone cancer called osteosarcoma Three months after Liam’s tragic death, his sister Kerry Lamb revealed her family’s battle to retrieve precious photos and videos of him after Apple allegedly would not assist them, Gazette Live reported. She said they were forced to go ahead with his funeral arrangements – not knowing what he wanted -after they were unable to unlock the device containing his wishes because of a software update. Kerry, who claims Apple didn’t help, said: “The funeral directors were coming and we knew Liam had put notes on his iPad about his funeral. “We wanted to see if there was anything written on there about what he wanted.” Facebook 3 Liam Wright pictured with Middlesborough footballer Emilio Nsue, before his death Facebook 3 His family claim Apple has been no help to them after they were unable to unlock his iPad containing his dying wish and memories of him Liam’s mum Jane bought the iPad for her son several years ago and it was registered under his name. His sister Kerry said: “It has lots of photos and videos on it. It went into activation lock on December 5. “By that point, Liam was too poorly to speak to tell us the code so we contacted Apple. “He was the only one who knew the code so we needed Apple to unlock it.” MOST READ IN NEWS STEPOSAURUS World's largest dinosaur footprint discovered Down Under... and it's as big as a man YOUTUBE VIDEO NASTIES Sickos trick kids into watching scary videos by disguising them as Peppa Pig clips KIM IN THE CROSSHAIRS Japan to 'bomb North Korea' in missile strike before despot Kim Jong-un can 'destroy' the country LIFE ON THE HIGH SEAS Incredible pics reveal plans for 460ft luxury superyacht that comes with a helipad and 330ft AIRSHIP WASHINGTON ON LOCKDOWN White House bomb scare evacuation ‘after man approaches building claiming to have explosives’ DOOMED FINAL JOURNEY Woman livestreams her own DEATH when she collides with bus while broadcasting her drive The only way is sex slur Towie star Jon Clark ruins Mother's Day for innocent mum and hubby after branding them 'SWINGERS' to his 400,000 Instagram followers THE DEFIANT ONE Teen daughter of Westminster killer Khalid Masood rejected bully dad's demands to convert to Islam and defied him by heading to school prom in revealing dress HOT WHEELS Randy couple filmed having sex on a moving bus in front of shocked passengers 'NO MORE COLOUREDS' Britain's biggest buy-to-let landlord bans 'coloured' people from renting flats 'because of curry smells' NOT THAT SORT OF BED Shocking moment TWO randy couples caught 'having sex' against a wall in a town centre flower bed TOP DOLLAR TK Maxx raises eyebrows by putting £2 Primark T-shirt on sale for £32 - but is all as it seems?

It’s just ridiculous. “I know they have data protection rules but we were even able to close his bank account with the death certificate.” Liam was diagnosed after pulling ligaments in his leg when he sustained a football injury. It appeared he was getting better, but he received the devastating news that the cancer was terminal. Liam died at home surrounded by his close family and leaves behind his mum, sisters, Kerry and Kirsty and nieces and nephews, Sean, Tyler and Aisha. The Sun Online has contacted Apple for comment.

Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close Deciding whether to pay $749 for the new red iPhone is almost entirely a cosmetic decision. The anodized red hue is a head-turner and benefits the AIDS awareness campaign Red. Apple has already put a similar color on its iPods, but this is the first time it has come to the iPhone. Courtesy of Apple   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Apple announced several new products last week, including a cheaper version of the iPad and a new red shade for the iPhone. Consumers can place their orders for the new devices starting Friday. If you've been thinking about treating yourself to something new and are intrigued by Apple's announcements, here are some things to consider before you buy. The strongest selling point for the new 9.7-inch iPad is its price. The tablet now starts at $329, which is $70 less than its previous price. It has a retina display and comes in three colors: gold, silver and space gray. The new iPad appears to be a replacement for the iPad Air 2, so it's best to think of it as a successor to that product -- an in-between, easy-to-carry tablet for watching video and Web browsing. It is about 20 percent thicker than its predecessor but is still pretty trim at 1.03 pounds. The lower price tag comes with a few trade-offs, however. It doesn't have Apple's latest processor but packs the same one from the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, meaning that it is a little slower than the latest iPhone. The new tablet also has no support for the Apple Pencil or Apple's Smart Keyboard -- those appear to still be reserved for the iPad Pro line. That will probably be fine for most people. If you're looking for a full laptop replacement, however, it's probably not your best option. Apple also upped the storage space on the iPad mini to 128 GB, for $399, which could make the smaller tablet more appealing as a travel companion for watching video -- if you don't mind the price. The smaller size makes it a little more plane-friendly than a full-size tablet. As for the new red iPhone, deciding whether to pay $749 for it is almost entirely a cosmetic decision. The anodized red hue is a head-turner and benefits the AIDS awareness campaign Red. Apple has already put a similar color on its iPods, but this is the first time it has come to the iPhone. If you're really digging the color or if you are an AIDS research supporter, those are the reasons to buy. There's no difference in the actual hardware, so you won't be upgrading anything apart from your style.

This week however, Apple has doubled the capacity, the smartphone now comes with 32GB or 128GB of internal memory. You get the extra storage for free, as the suggested retail price remains the same. The 32GB iPhone SE carries a price tag of €489 / $399, the 128GB version costs €599 / $499. You can place a iPhone SE preorder now, they will be delivered from Wednesday March 29th.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Security Image Source: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock Apple denied the massive iCloud hack (but you should still change your password) Chris Smith @chris_writes March 23rd, 2017 at 8:51 AM Share Tweet A hacker group claiming to have access to hundreds of millions of iCloud accounts threatened to remotely wipe iPhones associated to these accounts unless Apple pays a ransom amounting to up to $100,000 in cryptocurrency or iTunes gift cards. Just as we suspected at the time, Apple has now confirmed that its servers were not breached. But that doesn’t change the fact that some hackers out there believe they can remotely wipe iPhones linked to certain Apple IDs… so it’s time to change passwords again. Don't Miss: The 5 best crystal clear cases for your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus “There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID,” a company spokesperson told Fortune. “The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.” Apple did not confirm the authenticity of the data the Turkish Crime Family says it has, as the report notes. A person familiar with the email accounts and passwords contained in that data set says it matched the LinkedIn breach from 2012 when hackers grabbed information tied to more than 100 million accounts. The LinkedIn hack was only revealed last year, but that’s enough of a reason to change your passwords, especially if you haven’t done it since then — and especially if you use the same password for several different accounts, including the Apple ID you use on your iPhone. Apple, meanwhile, is “actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved,” the same spokesperson said. “To protect against these type of attacks, we always recommend that users always use strong passwords, not use those same passwords across sites and turn on two-factor authentication.” The company says it has taken measures according to “standard procedure,” without elaborating on what’s been done.

 How Apple can silence the haters, crush Google and Microsoft, and build a thousand-year empire Matt Weinberger Mar. 25, 2017, 8:00 AM 42,741 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim CookGetty/Justin Sullivan It was only last summer that Apple CEO Tim Cook declared his vision for a company that lasts one thousand years. But Cook's far-reaching calendar already seems to be in trouble, with an ever-growing list of rivals and weaknesses threatening to undermine the Apple empire. Just consider: Google's homebuilt Pixel phones are innovating where iPhone stagnates. Microsoft is now building PCs and tablets that turn more heads than the Mac and iPad. Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant and Echo device are poised to own the nascent smarthome market before Apple's competing HomeKit really builds any momentum. Meanwhile, Apple's biggest fans worry that the company is losing focus, building iterative and inelegant new hardware rather than the highly-polished and groundbreaking products that the company made its name on. And impatience for new iPhones, the mysterious "Apple Car," or even the reported Apple smart glasses runs rampant. That's not a very reassuring situation for a company with such a long-term ambition. And with only a few years under his belt as CEO of Apple, Cook still has a lot to prove. But while everybody freaks out over the idea that Apple has lost its mojo, it's worth stepping back and looking at some of the things the company has already done to safeguard its future. It may not be enough to last a millennia, but there's reason to be optimistic that Apple isn't flying blindly into the future.  Children are the future In the short term, Apple is easing up on its infamous "Apple tax," lowering prices for its products in a bid to reach a bigger audience. Just this week, for instance, Apple revealed a new low-cost iPad and it upgraded its least-expensive iPhone model, reflecting Apple's desire to fight Android in terms of price, not just features. That cheaper iPad is great for consumers, but it could also give Apple a new and more stable foothold in classrooms, too.  The new $329 Apple iPadApple And speaking of classrooms, that's a major push for Apple, too. Cook has said on multiple occassions that he wants Swift, Apple's homegrown programming language, to be the main way that kids get into programming. Because while Swift can theoretically be used to build software for any gadgetry, it's best on iPhone and Mac. In other words, Apple's short-term play is pretty straightforward. Get as many people using Apple technology as possible, with a special focus on starting them when they're young and keeping them hooked. Beyond iPhone The most important thing to remember about Apple is that its number-one priority is to sell more iPhones. Everything from iMessage to the AirPods are designed to get you onto an iPhone and keep you from moving to Android.  That's not going to change in the short term, for the very simple reason that, despite the early success of gadgets like the Amazon Echo, the smartphone is still the best balance between portability and power available today.  Microsoft believes that devices like its HoloLens can one day replace every screen in your home by projecting the images into your eyes.Microsoft But the smartphone's supremacy won't last forever. Many people, including Cook himself, believe the next step is augmented reality (AR), where headsets project images into your field of vision. Notably, Microsoft believes AR makes smartphones obsolete. Why carry a phone when all the information you need is beamed straight into your eyes? Companies like Microsoft, Magic Leap, and Google are all trying to take advantage of this forthcoming shift in hopes of conquering the next market before Apple can even get started. And make no mistake, this has Apple on the defensive. Beyond any single Android device, it's a gigantic existential threat to the whole idea of the iPhone, the product on which Apple's tremendous valuation hinges. So Apple fans and shareholders should feel some relief that Cook is making some savvy moves of his own. Foundation and empire Apple has already been quietly, but surely, building out its big play for the future. If the advantage of augmented reality is that you don't need to look at your phone to get the information you need, then Apple actually has that covered: The Apple Watch presents contextual alerts on your wrist, while the wireless AirPods put the Siri virtual assistant straight into your ear. It's not as flashy as holograms and other augmented reality trickery. But with Magic Leap and Microsoft both struggling to get their advanced AR headsets out the door to a wide audience, there's something to be said for Apple focusing on tech that's ready to be used in real life, here, today. Besides, Apple is said to be working on its own smart glasses, similar in theory to Google Glass, that would fill in that missing visual component. Change the time to your destination time zone as soon as departingChinaFotoPress / Getty Images Importantly, all of these Apple products must be synced to an iPhone to be their best. That provides an important bridge between old and new, giving customers a familiar product experience as they try the next new thing, and smoothing out the financial transitions as Apple's business moves from one product to another. If and when Apple ever releases its rumored Siri-powered, Amazon Echo-style smart speaker, expect that to need an iPhone connection, too, likely using its homegrown W1 long-range Bluetooth chip.  One day, perhaps, Apple will move beyond the iPhone and stop relying on it as the center of this connected world. At that point, the company will likely turn to iCloud and other Apple services which can provide the connective tissue to keep new generations of Apple gadgets in sync — no iPhone required.  Thousand years The strategy is the same as it's always been for Apple, which is getting people to buy into not just one product, but a whole (not inexpensive) ecosystem of its products. And only its products. Apple is a lifestyle brand as much as it is a technology company. A lot of Apple's strength has been in making new technologies seem cool and desirable.YouTube/EveryAppleAd Apple understands that no individual product is eternal. And that's the secret to its far-reaching vision for the company.  Even as newfangled products and technologies seem poised to end the iPhone's reign, Apple is already laying a subtle but strong foundation that will keep consumers tied to its ecosystem for many years to come. If you're planning a company to last a thousand years, that's what you'd call a pretty good start.

By: AFP | Beijing | Updated: March 25, 2017 5:41 PM In May last year the Beijing intellectual property bureau had ruled that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili with its iPhone6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and would be barred from selling those models. (Reutres) A Beijing court has overturned a ruling that Apple’s iPhone 6 violated a Chinese manufacturer’s patent which saw the US tech giant ordered to cease selling the smartphone in China. In May last year the Beijing intellectual property bureau had ruled that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili with its iPhone6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and would be barred from selling those models. Sales however were not suspended while Apple appealed against the administrative order. The Intellectual Property Court in Beijing on Friday ruled in favour of the California-based firm. The court “quashes the decision of the bureau” and “recognises that Apple … has not infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili”, according to the verdict reported by the state judicial daily Renmin Fayuan Ribao. The intellectual property bureau, an administrative body of Beijing municipality, had ruled that the two Apple phones infringed a Baili design patent. It had accused the US firm of having “copied” the exterior design of Baili’s 100C smartphone, which is characterised by a curved edge and rounded corners. But the Beijing court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features that “completely change the effect of the entire product … and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers,” finding Baili’s claim was without legal basis. When it took on Apple in December 2014, Baili was a promising electronics firm, backed by internet giant Baidu and eager to tap the telecoms boom. But since then the company has collapsed, hit by public criticism of its products seen as poor quality and more so by China’s ultra-competitive smartphone market which has seen many start-ups go under. Also Watch: Even Apple is under pressure. While China, along with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, remains its second largest market after the US, the Cupertino-based company saw its turnover in this “Greater China” region fall 12 percent in the last quarter of 2016. Apple’s market share has plummeted in mainland China, falling behind local competitors such as telecoms giant Huawei, newcomers Oppo and Vivo, and “internet of things” pioneer Xiaomi. Apple has already had intellectual property problems in China. In May 2016 a maker of “iphone” branded leather goods won a lawsuit filed by Apple as the court ruled Xintong Tiandi had registered the word as a trademark in 2007, while Apple smartphones did not officially go on sale in China until 2009.

(Apple's new iPad uses the A9 CPU). That's because the iPad Pro was intended to be a laptop replacement, whereas the iPad is still seen as a tablet for media consumption. Other benefits of the iPad Pro are a 12-MP rear camera, 5-MP FaceTime camera, and the ability to record 4K video. By comparison, the new iPad has an 8-MP camera, 1.2-MP FaceTime camera, and maxes out at 1080p video recording. But Amazon isn't the only retailer with iPad Pro discounts. If you need more storage space, Best Buy is taking $100 off all 9.7-inch iPad Pro 128GB models in all colors. Both Amazon's and Best Buy's deals could end at any time, so act fast if you want a new iPad Pro.

The iPhone 6S topped the charts with a total of around 60 million units shipped, followed by the iPhone 7, 7 Plus and the 6S Plus, according to a recent report from intelligence firm IHS Markit. For more context, the research takes into account quarterly shipment data for more than 350 smartphone models. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY In fact, Apple had such a massive lead over fellow competitors that the first non-iPhone entry in the report – Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge – comes at number five. In addition to Apple and Samsung, the only other phonemaker to make it into the top 10 was Oppo. Here’s a look at the data provided by IHS Markit: While Samsung had five handsets in the top 10, it still proved incapable of topping Apple at overall units shipped. Interestingly, IHS remarks that Huawei – the third largest smartphone maker – didn’t even have a single entry in the top 10. As MacRumors remarks, it’s worth noting that the figures quoted in the research are estimates, “and that shipments do not necessarily reflect sales.” Still, given that earlier reports suggested that last year Apple clinched an all-time high market share with its iPhone sales, IHS Markit’s findings hardly come as a surprise. And judging by more recent research, the trend will continue this year too. on IHS Markit Read next: Hate speech leads to thousands in donations for girl coders GeariPhoneSamsung Share on Facebook (154) Share on Twitter (132) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

Jehnny Beth) [LISTEN] Music User Profiles Could Be Apple Music’s Missing Key [OPINION] By Arron Hirst 25th Mar 17 10:35 am Share Tweet Quickly issuing a patch to the just released iTunes 12.6 – earlier this week, the brief appearance (and then removal) of a “Show on Profile Page” toggle on iTunes’ playlist edit page could indicate that Apple isn’t quite done with making its multimedia jukebox software, social. The change spotted by an eagle-eyed user on Reddit would appear to suggest that the company is actively looking into ways to make its closed club music service more open, whilst at the same time keeping that draw for potential new subscribers. Of course, today, it’s already possible to create your own Apple Music playlists – and share them with friends, family or colleagues via Apple’s provided direct link option. (It’s actually the exact same option we use to share our new music playlist: #THEHOTLIST – every week). Listen to THE HOT LIST #30 on Apple Music But it’s clear that, despite this current functionality, Apple also has a want to make this playlist creation aspect of Apple Music more community-driven. See even though you can create playlists to share with others you may know, or who are close to you, it’s not yet possible for other Apple Music members to search out those same created/curated playlists – even if you’ve made them public by sharing your playlist’s direct link at least once. By adding the ability for users to create their own profile pages within Apple Music, the service becomes less of a dictatorship – (after all, not everyone will unreservedly love those daily recommendations Beats 1 throws out), and instead fosters a community of music lovers, for music lovers. Subscribers to Spotify will know that the streaming service already seemingly understands this, as it carries the ability for them to become physical ‘curators’ of their own playlists and music tastes – also being able to easily share these collections and collaborations with others, if they so choose. And while Apple Music does have some of this capability, profile pages would appear to be the missing piece of the puzzle as the company works to allow for person-specific music ‘hubs,’ that should in turn further help to drive streams of the service’s many avaialble tracks.

Listen Now:https://t.co/Z4Mx2xXgif#NewMusic #Mar19 pic.twitter.com/lq1JTDV52J — RAZMAG™ (@razmagazine) March 19, 2017 In fact, it could be argued that this has been the company’s end goal from the very beginning – as when originally signing up for Apple Music you may remember that listeners were also asked to choose a ‘nickname’ under their Apple Music account settings. So far, this nickname has only been used for identifying listeners when leaving comments on Apple Music Connect posts from other artists and industry professionals, but with the above described feature slip now out in the open, its not too out of the way to suggest that the firm could be working on building out Apple Music’s social aspect to include listener profiles. Exactly when this social music functionality will materialise for Apple Music members, is unclear. But it’s not out of the realm of possibility to believe that the feature could drop… as early as this year. / The Loop More info iPhone + iPad Apple Music FREE More Breaking Music?

Today, the company’s special red iPhone 7 and 7 Plus goes on sale, with a hefty $919 (£919) price tag for the most expensive model. The phone was prominently marketed to consumers as “an unprecedented way to contribute to the Global Fund and bring the world a step closer to an AIDS-free generation”. But despite the claim appearing in promotional material, the company is refusing to explain how much of the profit will actually go to charity, following multiple requests from PinkNews. The small print on Apple’s website specifies that only an unspecified “contribution” will go to charity from each purchase, despite Apple’s high profit margins on the lucratively popular device. The phone was launched as part of a partnership with (RED), a non-profit entity which specialises in AIDS-themed brand deals with corporations. (RED) does not carry out any primary HIV/AIDS work itself – instead contributing to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS. PinkNews has repeatedly asked both Apple and (RED) to clarify how much Apple’s charitable contribution will be from the sale of each phone, and how much will go to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS. A spokesperson for Apple declined to comment, pointing a release that explains the company has “raised $130 million” across the entirety of its ten-year partnership with (RED). Though the number may seem high, it works out at 0.01% of the company’s estimated $1.25 trillion net revenue over the same period, which netted the company $274 billion profit. As part of its (RED) partnership, Apple has launched a string of similar products in the past – including special edition iPods, speakers and even Apple Watches that touted their link to fighting AIDS. The iPhone, however is its most expensive to date. (RED) did not respond to any of our multiple requests for comment – though curiously one of our emails sent to (RED) appears to have been opened in Cupertino, California, where Apple’s headquarters is located. Despite the lack of reply, the PinkNews email was opened over a hundred times. In a release, Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said: “Since we began working with (RED) 10 years ago, our customers have made a significant impact in fighting the spread of AIDS through the purchase of our products. “The introduction of this special edition iPhone in a gorgeous red finish is our biggest (PRODUCT)RED offering to date in celebration of our partnership with (RED), and we can’t wait to get it into customers’ hands.” Deborah Dugan, (RED)’s CEO, said: “Apple is the world’s largest corporate donor to the Global Fund, contributing more than $130 million as part of its partnership with (RED). “Combining the global reach of the world’s most loved smartphone with our efforts to provide access to life-saving ARV medication in sub-Saharan Africa, customers now have a remarkable opportunity to make a difference and contribute to the Global Fund through the purchase of this new beautiful (PRODUCT)RED iPhone.” 22 reader comments Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous story Court upholds gay widower's right to be named on husband's death certificate Next story Taiwan's top court is hearing a case that could make marriage equality legal More like this AIDS charity exposes huge government cuts to HIV support Apple is ‘hiding’ AIDS charity tie-up from users in China Apple launches iPhone ‘to fight AIDS’ – but won’t say how much money is going to charity Democrats to re-introduce LGBT Equality Act in Congress Dozens of big businesses back trans student in Supreme Court bathroom case Apple takes stand against Trump on transgender rights Watch Apple boss Tim Cook show off his singing skills in James Corden’s latest Carpool Karaoke Barbra Streisand called Apple CEO Tim Cook to complain Siri says her name wrong More: HIV AIDS Apple iPhone phone Red Red iPhone Trending Trending Now Orange is the New Black stars tie the knot in beautiful intimate ceremony Russian government warns citizens not to be homophobic while on holiday in Europe Graham Norton receives backlash for pressuring Cara Delevingne into talking about her sex life on live TV This trans guy wants you to know his powerful before and after story Trending Orange is the New Black stars tie the knot in beautiful intimate ceremony Russian government warns citizens not to be homophobic while on holiday in Europe Graham Norton receives backlash for pressuring Cara Delevingne into talking about her sex life on live TV This trans guy wants you to know his powerful before and after story Latest stories Merkel’s rivals to publish draft same-sex marriage bill ahead of key German election Lesbians and bisexual teens more likely to smoke than straight peers, study finds Beauty and the Beast and Power Rangers are “a lifeline” for LGBT youth, says GLAAD head Lawsuit accuses port authority of unlawful arrests of gay men Rachel Dolezal, who claims she is black, under fire for comparing herself to transgender people This man was so desperate to appear Ellen he hired a fake set and a fake Ellen © 2017 PinkNews Terms Contact Advertise

Tragic Liam Wright's sister has told of her family’s battle to retrieve the precious memories of the much-loved teenager. Mirror Online reported in December how Liam had raised £250,000 for charity before finally losing his battle against type of rare bone cancer. Members of his devastated family in Brotton in North Yorkshire knew his Apple iPad contained details of Liam’s last wishes regarding his funeral arrangements. However Gazette Live reports how they were forced to go ahead with the service not knowing them as they were unable to unlock the device after a software update - and they claim Apple would not assist them. Three months on and the family are continuing the fight to access the iPad for their treasured photos and videos of Liam but so far say they have “hit a brick wall” with the media giant. © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Credits: Collect Unknown Liam’s mum bought the iPad for her son several years ago and it was registered under his name. “When he got a phone, he continued to use the iPad but also allowed the rest of his family and younger relatives to use it as well,” said his sister Kerry Lamb. “It has lots of photos and videos on it. “It went into activation lock on December 5. "By that point, Liam was too poorly to speak to tell us the code so we contacted Apple. “We knew he had made quite a few notes about his funeral on the iPad. “He hadn’t want to speak about it - we knew he was dying and he knew he was dying - but it was not a conversation he wanted to have. “He was the only one who knew the code so we needed Apple to unlock it.” But Apple did not help, she claimed. © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Credits: Evening Gazette Liam finally lost his battle on December 7 - surrounded by his close family - leaving behind his mum Jane, sisters, Kerry, and Kirsty, and nieces and nephews, Sean, Tyler and Aisha. “The funeral directors were coming and we knew Liam had put notes on his iPad about his funeral,” said Kerry. “We wanted to see if there was anything written on there about what he wanted.” They again contacted Apple but were told they would need to send a death certificate and solicitor's letter which cost them £120. “They are saying it’s not the relevant information and they now want a court order costing us £360,” said Kerry. © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Credits: Evening Gazette “We’ve been told by the solicitor that the court is unlikely to grant us the court order with it being just one company so we don’t know what we can do. “All we want is the photos and videos. “It’s just ridiculous. I know they have data protection rules but we were even able to close his bank account with the death certificate. “We’ve been passed from pillar to post. It seems you get different answers depending on who you speak to. “Mum spoke to them and said ‘You can’t do this it’s wrong. How would you feel if it was photos of your son?’ © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Credits: Collect Unknown “She’s not too bad at the moment but it gets her very upset when she sees other people’s photos of Liam and she can’t even access her own.” Liam discovered he had a rare type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma after sustaining a football injury. It appeared the former Freebrough Academy pupil was getting better - but early last year he received the devastating news that his cancer was terminal. He did not tell his closest friends he had weeks to live because he didn’t want them to worry. © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Credits: Collect Unknown The aspiring personal trainer had hoped to work with children who “didn’t fit the sporting category”. Kerry said: “He hoped to work with children who were overweight, and he wanted to give them a bit of confidence. “He was a gentle giant. He loved everyone and everyone loved him.” The Gazette contacted Apple in relation to the family’s complaint but have not received a response.

(Photo: Mic) Siri is an intelligent artificial intelligent assistant by Apple for iPhones and iPads. However, there are some commands that should be taken seriously as they can cause a panic situation with law enforcement agencies. As reported by Cnet, the latest social trend that is going viral is threatening to become a dangerous one. Asking Siri to say 108 is equivalent to America’s 911 emergency services in India. Apple made it easier for people to call for emergency services around the world and saying the command would simply dial an emergency service in the country you connect. For example, if you ask Siri to dial 911 in the UK, it would dial the UK emergency services 999 in the country. And for any reason if you end up saying ‘Hey Siri, 108’ into your iPhone, it ends up calling the local emergency services in that country. This craze is going viral overseas and people are fooling around with Siri to dial 108 (India’s emergency services – either as a prank or a test). This causes Siri to call 911, which is become a huge task and inconvenience for 911 emergency services in America. The law enforcement agency in Texas is not happy about it. Cnet reported that The Sheriff's office of Harris County, Texas, has taken to Facebook ask people to stop. The post reads: “The Harris County Sheriff's Office, along with Texas NENA, are encouraging iPhone users NOT to test the '108' command. This viral prank is becoming increasingly popular on social media, with various speculations as to what the command does. The command, in fact, will instruct Siri to call emergency services, which could potentially tie up emergency lines. In case of an emergency, please dial 9-1-1.” The prank was shared on social media websites and everybody seems to be playing around with Siri to find out what happens. This could soon be a case of ‘cry wolf’ where the emergency services would not be able to distinguish between a prank call and a real emergency. On the contrary, someone who was to really call up for an emergency would suffer because of the massive issues. Mic reports, ‘This prank is problematic because it uses resources that are vital for others trying to receive help in real emergency situations. Roughly 240 million calls are made to 911 in the United States each year and placing prank calls can be considered a crime.’ According to the National Emergency Number Association: ‘It's a prank call when someone calls 9-1-1 for a joke, or calls 9-1-1 and hangs up. Prank calls not only waste time and money, but can also be dangerous. If 9-1-1 lines or call takers are busy with prank calls, someone with a real emergency may not be able to get the help they need. In most places, it's against the law to make prank 9-1-1 calls,’ reported Mic. Pranksters who tell their friends to say "108" to Siri are effectively having their friends call emergency services without reason. The lesson here is to know your country's emergency service number and not say it to Siri unless you're really in an emergency.

Technology | 25 March 2017 Hayley Tsukayama Washington - WikiLeaks claimed Thursday that the CIA had found a way to intercept and hack into Apple iPhones just a year after the company's smartphone hit the market. The group also claimed that the CIA was able to infect Mac computers. But it's very unlikely that your iPhone or Mac was affected, experts say. Apple said that its preliminary assessment of the WikiLeaks documents show that the "alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released." The company also said that the alleged Mac exploits described by WikiLeaks were fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Share this story AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File The CIA referred The Post to an earlier statement that declined to comment on the accuracy of the WikiLeaks information, but denounced disclosures "designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries." The documents offer a rare glimpse into the world of modern espionage, said Jeff Pollard, a security and risk analyst at Forrester Research. For Apple and other companies, he said, it also shows that it's very difficult to secure their products all the way from their factories to their customers. "The most concerning part of this is that it highlights that it doesn't matter how secure you keep a device," he said. "You have to understand that there could also be something that gets delivered to you in a device that you purchased." Read also: Who wants multiple iPhone personalities? According to WikiLeaks, the documents allege that, as far back as 2008, the CIA was able to install software on iPhones before they were shipped to their intended owners. There's no evidence of tampering done at Apple's factories, experts said. The documents also purportedly show that the CIA found a way to install software on Macs that could not be removed, even if a user were to reinstall their operating system. There is a specific mention of the CIA trying to intercept a laptop that it knew was being given to someone as a gift to plant its malware. Both methods require physical access to the devices. There is no evidence in the documents that the CIA used these methods on a broad scale. Experts who examined the documents said there is little chance that the average consumer - particularly in the United States, given the CIA's foreign focus - would have been affected by these attacks, said Will Strafach, a noted iPhone security expert and co-founder of Verify.ly, a mobile app intelligence service. It's also unlikely that anyone could look at these documents now and design a similar hack, he said. "It's too old. And even if it wasn't too old, it requires you to get to a device that is en route to somebody specific," he said. The release of these documents follow a similar disclosure from WikiLeaks earlier this month, which allegedly outlined a suite of hacking tools used by the CIA that target smartphones, cars and televisions. The group has said that it will work with technology companies to help patch flaws exploited by the CIA's hacking tools, but offered few details on how such a partnership would work, Reuters reported. Apple said that it has not "negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information" and has instructed the organization to submit information though its normal processes. "Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain," the company's statement said. "We are tireless defenders of our users' security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users."

Consumers can place their orders for the new devices starting Friday. Share this story The Apple iPhone 7 and Air Pods. Picture: Beck Diefenbach, Reuters If you've been thinking about treating yourself to something new and are intrigued by Apple's announcements, here are some things to consider before you buy. The strongest selling point for the new 9.7-inch iPad is its price. The tablet now starts at $329, which is $70 less than its previous price. It has a retina display and comes in three colours: gold, silver and space gray. The new iPad appears to be a replacement for the iPad Air 2, so it's best to think of it as a successor to that product - an in-between, easy-to-carry tablet for watching video and Web browsing. It is about 20 percent thicker than its predecessor but is still pretty trim at 1.03 pounds. The lower price tag comes with a few tradeoffs, however. It doesn't have Apple's latest processor but packs the same one from the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, meaning that it is a little slower than the latest iPhone. The new tablet also has no support for the Apple Pencil or Apple's Smart Keyboard - those appear to still be reserved for the iPad Pro line. Read also: Who wants multiple iPhone personalities? That will probably be fine for most people. If you're looking for a full laptop replacement, however, it's probably not your best option. Apple also upped the storage space on the iPad mini to 128 GB, for $399, which could make the smaller tablet more appealing as a travel companion for watching video - if you don't mind the price. The smaller size makes it a little more plane-friendly than a full-size tablet. As for the new red iPhone, deciding whether to pay $749 for it is almost entirely a cosmetic decision. The anodized red hue is a head-turner and benefits the AIDS awareness campaign Red. Apple has already put a similar colour on its iPods, but this is the first time it has come to the iPhone. If you're really digging the colour or if you are an AIDS research supporter, those are the reasons to buy. There's no difference in the actual hardware, so you won't be upgrading anything apart from your style.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Notebooks Apple Has Added Its 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 on Its Refurbished Store for Bigger Savings By Omar Sohail Mar 24, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple initially added its 13.3-inch MacBook Pro 2016 that came without a Touch Bar to its online refurbished store but if you were eager to get your hands on a significantly powerful machine at higher savings, then you are definitely in luck. By Purchasing a 15-inch MacBook Pro With Touch Bar on the Refurbished Store, Customers Can Save Between $360-650 Purchasing a new MacBook Pro model that comes with a Touch Bar can be a very expensive investment, and if you are looking to purchase the 15-inch model for more horsepower, then the price tag will certainly force you to think twice. Apple believes that it has found a solution to this problem by selling refurbished units of the 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 version. Related Apple’s 10.5 Inch iPad Pro Enters Limited Production; Don’t Expect An Early Launch States Source You will be getting the same hardware packed inside and there are several ways for that Touch Bar to work in your favor. Plus, if you are saving between $360-650 on this purchase, what better way to invest them than by purchasing Type-C dongles and adapters for your peripherals. Though the notebook belongs to the refurbished category, it should be noted that you will get Apple’s legendary customer service in return. In addition, you are also getting a one-year limited warranty and a 14-day return policy if you are dissatisfied with the purchase. The only drawback of purchasing a refurbished unit from Apple’s online store is that AppleCare cannot be purchased. Advertisement Still, getting 12 months of warranty period ensures that Apple is delivering top-notch build quality from these refurbished notebooks. The 15-inch MacBook Pro comes with four Thunderbolt 3 ports that deliver a maximum throughput of 10Gbps. With these ports, you can power up to two 5K or three 4K monitors and even daisy chain them to attach storage peripherals ranging from Type-C USB external hard drives and more. Related The iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus & iPhone 8 Will All Feature Wireless Charging; Apple Watch 3 Will Support LTE – Apple’s Supply Chain Reports If you feel that these machines are still too expensive, then it does not hurt investing in a Windows 10-powered machine. After all, the choices available on that side of the fence are pretty great if you dig deep enough. Do you think this refurbished model is going to be worth the money you end up saving?

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Mobile & Tabs Apple iPhone 8 to be available in limited quantities after launch: Report Apple iPhone 8 to be available in limited quantities after launch: Report Apple iPhone Edition is expected to come with a major design overhaul given the year 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of iPhones. By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Published:March 25, 2017 1:03 pm Apple iPhone Edition is expected to come with a major design overhaul given the year 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of iPhones. Apple’s upcoming flagship smartphone dubbed as ‘iPhone Edition’ and not iPhone 8, will be available in limited quantities after the September launch, with majority of stock expected by late fourth quarter. Apart from iPhone Edition, the Cupertino technology giant will launch two more iPhones at its upcoming event called iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. “Suppliers generally had good things to say about the upcoming iPhone 8 launch (for our purposes iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone Pro) as new features drive a more complicated manufacturing process and higher ASPs. We now believe that all three devices will feature wireless charging and will all be launched in the normal September timeframe, although the majority of iPhone Pro volumes may not be available until Q4,” according to research from Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O’Malley, and Jerry Zhang via MacRumors. The report is in conflict with Macotakara’s earlier claims the iPhone Edition, along with iPhone 7s and 7s Plus won’t be available until much later once they’re launched. Further, Barclays analysts claim all three iPhone models will feature wireless charging though the charging accessories will be sold separately. Apple iPhone 7s and 7s Plus are said to be minor updates over their predecessors. iPhone Edition, on the other hand, is expected to come with a major design overhaul given the year 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of iPhones. Apple iPhone Edition could be the most expensive iPhone ever, costing over $1000 (Rs 67,000 approx). It is rumoured to feature a curved 5.8-inch OLED display, out of which only 5.15-inches will be usable screen. There will be no physical home button and Touch ID will be embedded in the display. Apple could stick with dual rear camera setup as we saw on iPhone 7 Plus and there will be a front-facing 3D sensor module. Read: Apple iPhone 8 to have ‘water drop design’ as homage to first iPhone: Report Further Apple iPhone Edition is said to come with a ‘water drop’ design similar to the original iPhone, according to a report from Korea’s ETNews. It claims Apple is using a 3D glass material on the back of the new iPhone 8, which will be curved around the top, bottom, left and right edges. iPhone Edition will have an glass chassis, similar to the iPhone 4S, and ditches the aluminium body that we’ve seen on the iPhone 5 and above.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Security Hackers Threaten Apple to Remotely Wipe Millions of iPhones If the Company Doesn’t Pay Ransom By Rafia Shaikh Mar 21, 2017 55Shares Share Tweet Submit Hackers: we will reset iCloud accounts and remotely wipe victim's Apple devices on April 7 Hackers are apparently threatening Apple over a massive trove of stolen accounts, including iCloud and other Apple email accounts. Identifying itself as “Turkish Crime Family,” the group is trying to extort the Cupertino tech giant to pay money if the company doesn’t want hackers to wipe out data of the millions of accounts they allegedly have access to. Today’s story comes only a week after hackers leaked a large trove of stolen celebrity nude photos, which were also stored in iCloud. So far, there is no evidence to suggest if this is the same group. Related Apple Won’t Pay Ransom & Denies Any Breaches, But Hackers Could Still Go Through With Mass iPhone Resets Apple hackers blackmail the company over stolen photos and credentials “I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing,” a member of Turkish Crime Family told Motherboard, the first publication to report the story. Motherboard added that the group has also shared screenshots of their communication with the Apple security team, along with giving the publication access to the email address they used to contact the tech company. Apple hackers are trying to make the company pay over $75,000 in cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin or Ethereum. They are, however, also willing to settle for $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards in exchange for deleting the cache of stolen data. Advertisement “Are you willing to share a sample of the data set?” an unnamed member of Apple’s security team wrote to the hackers a week ago, according to one of the emails stored in the account. (According to the email headers, the return-path of the email is to an address with the @apple.com domain). Their communication with Apple also suggests that the attackers have provided Apple’s team with a YouTube video that shows one of the Turkish Crime Family members allegedly logging into the account of an elderly woman’s iCloud account, with backed-up photos and the ability to remotely wipe all content from the device. “We firstly kindly request you to remove the video that you have uploaded on your YouTube channel as it’s seeking unwanted attention, second of all we would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law,” a message allegedly from a member of Apple’s security team reads. (Motherboard only saw a screenshot of this message, and not the original). The alleged Apple team member then says archived communications with the hacker will be sent to the authorities. Apple hackers have claimed to have access to over 300 million Apple accounts. However, there do appear to be some inconsistencies in their story, as another member of the collective said a total of 559 million accounts have been breached. The group also hasn’t provided access to any allegedly stolen iCloud accounts to the publication to verify their claim – a norm when hackers are trying to make a point. Related Apple Hires Jonathan Zdziarski – Popular iOS Security Researcher and Forensics Expert While Apple does offer highly rewarding bug bounties, its policy is against rewarding criminals with any compensation. The iCloud hackers are threatening that if the company doesn’t comply with their demands by April 7, they will reset iCloud accounts and remotely wipe victims’ devices. We have reached out to Apple for a comment on these claims and will update this story when we hear back.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple Has Stopped Selling the 16GB iPhone Completely By Uzair Ghani Mar 21, 2017 20Shares Share Tweet Submit With the release of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple gave up on manufacturing the 16GB iPhone. But it still sold a 16GB version of the iPhone SE up until now since the smartphone was announced in March of last year and did not see any refresh or change in between. Now though, the 16GB iPhone SE has been replaced by a 32GB model, which means you can no longer buy any 16GB smartphone from Apple at all. The Last 16GB iPhone is Dead – All iPad & iPhone Models Now Start with At least 32GB of Storage For reasons unknown and rather mind-boggling, Apple had been selling a 16GB iPhone up until 2017. Sure, it’s a great way to jump onboard the iOS bandwagon without burning too much money, but if you wanted a little legroom for some photos, videos or apps, then the 16GB model is the worst option to go with. Thankfully, Apple understood this – albeit late – and has killed off every single trace of a 16GB iPhone from its entire lineup. Heck, the company has no 16GB iPad anymore to sell, for those who don’t know yet. Related Facebook Is Now Adding Stories In Its Main App With 3D Camera Effects And More Advertisement So, starting today, regardless of any iPhone or iPad you are getting from Apple, you will get an experience that comes bundled with 32GB of storage, at least. The list of devices and their memory configurations are as follows. 12.9-inch iPad Pro – 32GB, 128GB & 256GB 9.7-inch iPad Pro – 32GB, 128GB & 256GB 2017 iPad – 32GB & 128GB iPad mini 4 – 128GB iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 – 32GB, 128GB & 256GB iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 6s – 32GB & 128GB iPhone SE – 32GB & 128GB It’s a welcome move from Apple, and one which will resonate well with fans. But quite frankly, down the road, someone will start pointing fingers at 32GB even, calling it the worst choice for photographers and app users. This is bound to happen given how rapidly app sizes are increasing along with those megapixels and higher resolution video recording capability. Compared to 16GB however, 32GB offers a perfect mix of space for those who ask for nothing more than ‘just right’ space to get started with things. Related Apple’s 10.5 Inch iPad Pro Enters Limited Production; Don’t Expect An Early Launch States Source Down the road, do you think Apple will replace the 32GB iPhone or iPad with a higher capacity model? I, for one, don’t see that happening for at least a couple of years.

Not likely Assistants will end up specialized  (SAN JOSE) MERCURY NEWS Published on March 25, 2017 Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print SAN JOSE, Calif. — It’s no wonder titans of tech are locked in an epic battle of the bots, racing furiously to produce the best virtual assistant. Their respective help-bots — Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant, Amazon’s Alexa, and Microsoft’s Cortana — promise consumers one of the most valuable commodities in the world: free time. Amazon’s Alexa help-bot on the Echo Dot and Tap competes with Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge Thanks to the sudden acceleration of artificial intelligence and advancements in speech recognition and big-data storage, the technology behind virtual assistants is rapidly spreading from phones to cars and homes, and the truly useful helper is approaching fast. The four giants are fighting for the biggest share of a market expected to grow to $12 billion by 2024. “There’s a tremendous amount of promise for these agents to help and assist with many different tasks that we face every day,” said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. “The more the agent can help you with, the more value it holds.” Today, the aid these virtual assistants provide remains limited. Most users of Google Home and Amazon Echo devices — which host Assistant and Alexa, respectively — stream music, play audio books, and control smart-home devices, according to surveys by San Francisco analytics firm VoiceLabs. Still, the virtual agent’s foundation in AI means the more it learns about a user’s preferences and behaviors, the better job it can do. So while experts predict a handful of firms will dominate in this field, they’re split on whether consumers will be served best by one bot, or more. “People want one assistant, they don’t want two,” said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research in San Jose. “You want one assistant, to be very readily available wherever you are.” However, the various assistants likely will end up somewhat specialized in their expertise, with Google’s Assistant, for example, excelling in providing knowledge and managing schedules, and Microsoft’s Cortana leading on gaming, said VoiceLabs CEO Adam Marchick. In a few years, many people will use two or three different assistants, he predicted. The industry stands at a critical moment, because the first highly effective help-bot to get a foothold in a consumer’s home, phone, or car likely will stay, creating a barrier to competitors, Mr. Marchick said. For a virtual helpmate to run your life, it needs to engage with the providers of all the services you rely on, from your calendar app to your Uber ride. Those providers must either partner with the company operating the assistant, or design their app to integrate with the assistant. So Spotify will stream music upon request via Alexa, and Honeywell’s smart-home thermostat, via Assistant, will bump up the temperature 15 minutes before Grandma’s expected arrival. For providers, “if there is a competitive advantage to be gained, then absolutely they will do it,” said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at market research firm Parks Associates. For all the major players, virtual assistants provide important data that fuel the AI that powers and improves them, making both the assistants and the products they live in ever more marketable. For Amazon, Alexa is an enthusiastic purchasing agent for the e-commerce that drives the firm. For Google, Assistant is a turbocharged vacuum for the data the company collects to sell ads targeted directly at users. So far, Google and Amazon have focused largely on home-based assistants. Google’s new Pixel phones host Assistant, but it has an uphill battle because Apple has far more phones equipped with Siri on the market, said Tim Bajarin of the San Jose market research firm Creative Strategies. While building the supreme help-bot is clearly a priority for many firms, experts say the software today lacks the knowledge base to take the next big leap: to enable virtual assistants that can predict our needs to serve us better.

By Johanna Bennett Biography March 24, 2017 2:00 p.m. ET David Paul Morris/Bloomberg With Apple’s share price once again flirting with a record high, it seems that all anyone talks about is the next big iPhone launch. Buzz surrounding the coming 10-year anniversary iPhone is growing ever louder. Early Friday Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal sweetened his price target for Apple AAPL 2.072685973878478% Apple Inc. U.S.: Nasdaq USD143.8 2.92 2.072685973878478% /Date(1490734803214-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 28612540 AFTER HOURS USD143.77 -0.0300000000000011 -0.02086230876216968% Volume (Delayed 15m) : P/E Ratio 17.23474251497006 Market Cap 739132586320.996 Dividend Yield 1.5843224346310647% Rev. per Employee 1874840 More quote details and news » AAPL in Your Value Your Change Short position (ticker: AAPL) by 20% to $165 a share arguing that sales of the so-called iPhone 8 (as it is commonly called by analysts) due to debut late this year will shatter expectations and help fuel estimate-beating profit growth. Yet high hopes for the iPhone 8 aren’t the only reason to take a bigger bite out of Apple. Let’s not forget, it is one of the few technology companies that pay a cash dividend to shareholders. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani forecasts that the iPhone maker is poised to announce next month plans to significantly increase the capital it returns to shareholders with a $35 billion boost to its existing share buyback plan and a 15% dividend hike. Add that to forecasts for accelerating earnings growth, and “the fundamental reality remains that Apple’s valuations are materially subpar,” says Daryanani. More From Barron’s Our Independent Advisory All-Stars Grubhub Shares Could Slide 25% as Competition Grows The Bull Market: 6 Things to Ignore, 3 to Worry About He isn’t alone seeing Apple as a bargain. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) became one of the company’s biggest shareholders late last year when it added the stock to its portfolio. It’s not hard to see why some investors might be tempted to sell. At a recent $141.47, Apple’s share price has recovered dramatically from the selloff that marred 2015 and continued early last year, when Apple posted a full-year revenue decline for the first time in 15 years. But as Barron’s Jack Hough noted last week, iPhones aren’t falling out of favor and Apple’s high-margin services business continues to race higher. In fact, Barron’s Next noted recently that Apple’s services business could be a $50 billion concern by 2020, and the opportunity from things like AppStore, iTunes, AppleCare and iCloud are underappreciated by investors. The next iPhone launch is certainly a significant event. And analysts are using the terms “supercycle.” Yet much of the enthusiasm seems baked into the stock. And cautious voices on Wall Street warn that Apple needs to diversity its business. But there is much more to the Apple story than the iPhone8. With $240 billion in cash sitting on foreign shores, Apple could get a boost from President Trump, namely a proposed tax policy that would make it cheaper for companies to repatriate offshore cash. The “increased probability” of repatriation could get Apple’s management talking about long-term dividend payout targets, namely hiking its payout ratio. The current dividend payment totals $12 billion a year. Yet even in the absence of repatriation, Apple’s domestic free cash flow — expected at just under $22 billion this year — is more than enough to sustain a 15% dividend hike, Daryanani says. Moreover, Apple’s net cash position has grown to $159 billion. So the board has plenty of dry powder to cover the $31 billion remaining on its existing share buyback plans and to expand it. Granted, at 15.3 times forward earnings, Apple is trading near its highest price to earnings multiple in five years. But there is much to like including a respectable 1.6% dividend yield. Comments?

By India Ashok March 25, 2017 06:26 GMT Close Top five revelations from Wikileaks' 'Vault 7' Vincent Balestriere WikiLeaks has cast doubts on Apple's recent statement of having already fixed vulnerabilities linked to alleged CIA hacking tools targeting Apple products. The whistleblowing platform recently released new documents as part of its latest Vault 7 release, which allegedly details how the CIA developed customised hacking tools to compromise iPhones and Macs. Apple responded to WikiLeaks' disclosures, clarifying that the vulnerabilities detailed in WikiLeaks' latest Vault 7 release, titled "DarkMatter", have already been fixed. Apple's response to WikiLeaks' DarkMatter release read, "We have preliminarily assessed the WikiLeaks disclosures from this morning. Based on our initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released. Additionally, our preliminary assessment shows the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013." However, WikiLeaks disputes Apple's claim. Following Apple's statement regarding DarkMatter exploits, the transparency platform posted on Twitter, "Apple's claim that it has "fixed" all 'vulnerabilities' described in DARKMATTER is duplicitous. EFI is a systemic problem, not a zero-day. In another tweet, WikiLeaks wrote, "Darkmatter+Triton can be remotely installed CIA has 2016 version: DerStarke2.0 EFI is not fixable 'vulnerability'." WikiLeaks claimed as part of its "DarkMatter" release that it possesses other Vault 7 documents, which indicate that "as of 2016 the CIA continues to rely on and update these systems and is working on the production of DerStarke2.0. DerStarke is CIA's alleged virtually undetectable firmware, that acts as a loader for the Triton malware, which the spy agency allegedly used to hack into Macbooks. WikiLeaks' tweets seemingly stress that Apple products may still be vulnerable to being compromised, despite the tech giant's confidence in having addressed the security issues. Meanwhile, WikiLeaks' attempts at garnering a relationship with tech giants such as Apple, Google and others appears to have hit a snag. The whistleblowing platform claimed that it has reached out to Silicon Valley giants about providing access to its Vault 7 exploits. However, WikiLeaks included a list of demands to be met, without which it refused to provide access to firms. The homepage of the WikiLeaks.org website is seen on a computer after leaked classified documents were posted to it July 26, 2010 in Miami, FloridaJoe Raedle/Getty Images Apple has said that it will not negotiate with WikiLeaks for any information and that so far, the transparency platform has not provided it with any data that was not already publicly available.

The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple's statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance "targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans." Also Read: WikiLeaks: CIA hacked Apple devices in ways users can't fix The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday's statement. "We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information," the statement read. "We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain."Apple said that while it takes users' security and privacy seriously, "we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users."Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, "and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder." Mozilla, the organisation behind the Firefox web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way.

Apple's dock would use the iPhone as a touchpad. Credit: USPTOMore Apple's dock would use the iPhone as a touchpad. Credit: USPTO The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday (Mar. 23) published an Apple patent filing describing a method by which you would place an iPhone into a MacBook chassis and power the computing device with an iPhone. The smartphone would be strategically placed in about the same spot as a touchpad would on a regular Mac. Could Apple be planning such a move for the iPhone 8? The patent application, which was earlier discovered by AppleInsider, is called, simply, "Electronic accessory device." It says that the chassis would come with traditional computing parts, including a screen, keyboard, and GPU. But in order for it to actually be powered, you'd need to insert the iPhone into it and start working on the device as if it were a computer. MORE: iPhone 8 Camera Will Be All About AR, and Glasses Are Next The patent application is notable, given the rise of 2-in-1 hybrids that can act both as tablets and notebooks, effectively blurring the line between tablets and PCs. But no company has successfully married the phone and laptop yet. HP's Elite X3 is the most recent example, which connects to a laptop-like dock using Windows 10 Mobile's Continuum feature. Previous attempts to combine phone and laptop have included the ill-fated Palm Foleo and the Motorola Atrix Laptop Dock. Samsung doesn't look to be going the mobile route with its Galaxy S8, but it's expected to offer an optional desktop dock called DeX that could power 4K monitors, as well as a mouse and keyboard. Apple has conspicuously shied away from this kind of convergence and has said on numerous occasions that it believes there is -- and should be -- a clear distinction between mobile experiences and computing experiences. The latest patent application, however, suggests Apple is at least thinking about ways to bridge that gap. Specifically, the patent application calls for a way for data to be transferred between the devices. Additionally, the host device could have its own operating system installed, allowing you to simply use the iPhone's processor for power and access alternative software that would be running on the device. But it goes further. In a striking move, Apple's patent describes a touchscreen for the host device -- a feature we've yet to see in an Apple computer and something the company's executives say, doesn't work in the computing space. Another embodiment in the device sees an iPad acting as its screen. It's not clear whether a device like this will ever make its way to store shelves. Like other big companies, Apple files for patents on a slew of technologies, and many of them are never released. But an iPhone-powered laptop is definitely an intriguing idea.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology iPad (2017) vs. iPad Pro 9.7 Will Shanklin March 24, 2017 New Atlas compares the features and specs of the new iPad (2017) and iPad Pro 9.7 View gallery - 20 images Apple's new iPad marks a new budget-minded strategy for Apple's tablet line. The company still, however, has a high-end iPad that falls in the same 10-inch window. Let's compare the features and specs of the entry-level iPad with the high-end iPad Pro 9.7. Size Sick of Ads? Join more than 500 New Atlas Plus subscribers who read our newsletter and website without ads. It's just US$19 a year.More Information Height and width are identical, as they have been since 2013's iPad Air. That's good news for anyone who owns a snap-on cover or keyboard cover, as there's a good chance they'll fit both of these models. (Cases might be another story, as the iPads have different depths.) Weight Presumably in the name of keeping the price down, the new iPad gained a little heft over both the iPad Pro 9.7 and its predecessor, the iPad Air 2. Build The new model still has Apple's familiar aluminum unibody design. Apple keyboard It isn't included in the box (be ready to pony up an extra US$150), but the iPad Pro plays nice with a snap-on Apple Smart Keyboard that doesn't rely on a Bluetooth connection. The cheaper iPad only works with third-party Bluetooth keyboards. Apple Pencil The new model also won't work the Apple Pencil stylus. Colors Apparently Apple decided customers could live without rose gold in the new iPad. Display size No changes here, it's 9.7 inches both ways. Display resolution Fortunately there's no compromise in pixels for the cheaper new model, with the same "Retina" resolution found in all 9.7-in iPads since early 2012. Display type Until that alleged 10th-anniversary iPhone switches to AMOLED later this year (as it's rumored to), Apple sticks with IPS panels in all its mobile devices. True Tone display The iPad Pro 9.7 is still the only Apple device with a True Tone display, which adjusts its color balance in response to your ambience. (It's all in the sensors.) Chip This is a nice upgrade in the new iPad (compared to the iPad Air 2, not the Pro), in that it gets a same-generation system-on-a-chip as the iPhone 6s and iPad Pro. Not being the A9X variant of the A9, though, it's probably not going to benchmark quite as fast as the Pro. (Note that we're grabbing the 1.85 GHz from the iPhone 6s version of the A9 chip; it's possible it will be clocked differently in the new iPad.) RAM We won't know the RAM situation in the new iPad until we run some benchmarks, but we'd be surprised if the didn't use the same 2 GB as the iPad Air 2 and Pro 9.7. Battery Apple rates the same 10 hours of web-surfing, video or music-listening (while on Wi-Fi) for both models. Cellular option You can pay an extra $130 to get an LTE-enabled model of either tablet. Storage The only difference here is a 256 GB variant of the Pro 9.7. Camera megapixels The iPad Pro has better cameras, though we don't think many shoppers are too worried about that in a large-ish tablet. Touch ID Both have Touch ID fingerprint sensors. Speakers The iPad Pro gives you an extra pair of stereo speakers, for a more surround-like experience while watching videos or playing games. Software Both run iOS 10. Release The 2017 iPad is up for pre-order, and starts shipping next week. While it's now a year old, it doesn't look like the iPad Pro 9.7 is ready to be replaced by a successor just yet. (Rumors point to a 10.5-in iPad Pro with the same tablet size sometime this year.) Starting price (full retail) When the iPad Pro 9.7 launched a year ago, we wished it started at the same $499 as every one of its same-sized predecessors. But that pricey pill may be a little easier to swallow with its affordable new sibling. If you can live with a Bluetooth keyboard instead of an Apple-connected one (or skip the keyboard altogether), then the $329 iPad may be all you need. We'll have a more definitive take on the new iPad, though, when we run our full review. Until then, you can revisit our review of the iPad Pro 9.7.

By: AP | New York | Published:March 25, 2017 9:47 am Apple’s statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple said purported hacking vulnerabilities disclosed by WikiLeaks this week have all been fixed in recent iPhones and Mac computers. The documents released by the anti-secrecy site Thursday morning pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn’t disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple’s statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance “targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans.” The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Also read: CIA Wikileaks data dump: Reactions from Apple, Samsung, Telegram and others Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday’s statement. “We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information,” the statement read. “We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain.” Apple said that while it takes users’ security and privacy seriously, “we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.” Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, “and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder.” Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way.

Apple’s website is currently down in preparation for the sales, which are scheduled to start at 11:01 AM EDT today. Don't Miss: Netflix has 25 new originals set for release in April – here’s the full list Apple earlier this week announced a brand new iPhone 7 color, a new iPad, minor iPhone SE and iPad mini updates, and a slew of accessories. You can check out every single new product Apple announced right here. The red iPhone 7, part of Apple’s PRODUCT (RED) campaign, looks amazing — check out a hands-on unboxing video at this link. Other than the red color though, nothing changes inside the phone. The red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus each come with only two storage options, including 128GB and 256GB, just like the Jet Black versions. Prices start at $749 for the 128GB iPhone 7. The brand new 9.7-inch iPad replaces Apple’s iPad Air 2, and it looks like Apple is killing the Air brand across product ranges. The device features a better A9 processor and a better screen, and it comes in 32GB and 128GB versions. The new iPad is available in silver, gold, and space gray, and ships in the expected Wi-Fi-only and Wi-Fi + Cellular options. Prices start at $329 for the 32GB iPad, which is the lowest entry price ever for a brand new 9.7-inch iPad. Even a new iPad mini is more expensive, starting at $399, but the mini only comes with 128GB of storage. The refreshed iPad mini, as well as Apple’s new iPhone and Apple Watch accessories, are also available to purchase from Apple’s online store.

Given that Apple has not done a (Product) RED launch with an iPhone before, it did come as a surprise albeit a nice one since the red finish is rather eye-catching. The good news is that if you liked what you saw, then you’ll be pleased to learn that the phone is now available for purchase. We should point out that this is merely just a new coat of paint and that the innards and features are pretty much the same as every iPhone 7 or 7 Plus model. However the main difference is that part of the proceeds from the sales of the (Product) RED iPhone 7 will be going towards the Global Fund to support HIV/AIDS programs, so you will be doing your part for charity and society, if that’s your kind of thing. In terms of pricing, it does appear to be more expensive than the regular iPhone 7. The base model is priced starting at $749 versus the regular iPhone 7 simply because there is no 32GB option and it will be only available in 128GB and 256GB configurations. This is the same as the (Product) RED iPhone 7 Plus which starts at $869 for the 128GB model. However if you were planning on getting the 128GB model anyway then we guess there’s no real difference in price. We’re not sure if this (Product) RED iPhone 7 will be a limited run or if it will be always available, but if you’d rather not take that risk then head on over to Apple’s Online Store to make your purchase. At this time of writing the estimated shipping times on both models are set at 1 day. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iPhone and iphone 7.

His two daughters were by his side. We published Mr. Kaylin’s obituary at this link. This column by Randall Beach, Walter Kaylin’s son-in-law, was first published March 11 in the New Haven Register and on the NHRegister.com at this link, “Randall Beach: The amazing Walter Kaylin, already a legend,” We are pleased to republish it here with the permission of the New Haven Register. Walter Kaylin 06.28.1921 – 02.15.2017 When I picked up the ashes of my father-in-law, Walter Kaylin, last Monday morning at the crematorium in Wallingford and drove back to New Haven with him beside me, I thought about his wonderful life and his never-ending stories. Listen, you would have to expect vivid, funny stories from a guy whose wild tales were in anthologies entitled “He-Men, Bag Men & Nymphos” and “Weasels Ripped My Flesh.” Walter wrote those during the late 1950s and ‘60s for pulp magazines such as “For Men Only,” “True Action” and “Stag.” He spun sagas of macho men on dangerous tropical islands rescuing damsels and plugging the bad guys. Many of them were war-related. Check out the title of his contribution to “Men” magazine, July 1966: “The Black Lace Blonde, the Yank Jungle Fighters and the Chicom Plot to Grab the Mid-Pacific.” Walter’s colleagues in that New York City office were other tough-nut writers such as Mario Puzo, who would go on to write “The Godfather” and Joseph Heller, who later wrote “Catch-22.” Bruce Jay Friedman, another of Walter’s peers, noted Walter was nothing like the characters he concocted. “He looked like a divinity student, always buttoned up,” Friedman recalled on the backside of one of Walter’s anthologies. “Then the stories would come in. They were special — seamless and outrageous and wonderful. I think of him as a treasure.” But Walter didn’t achieve the literary fame later accorded to those other writers. His two books, “The Power Forward” and “Another Time, Another Woman,” didn’t sell and quickly went out of print. But at the age of 92, when he was living at Apple Rehab in Guilford, unable to walk, Walter saw those two anthologies get published, thanks to pulp fiction enthusiasts Robert Deis and Wyatt Doyle. “It means a lot to me,” Walter told me when I asked him how it felt to finally get such recognition. But he never took himself too seriously. He added with a sly smile, “I was reading those stories in bed last night and I was shocked at how savage they were. I was thinking, ‘My God! Could this be me?’” Walter got a lot of his source material during World War II, when he was a radio operator in the Signal Corps of the U.S. Army, stationed in the Philippines. He didn’t see much combat but he met a lot of unforgettable guys and “dames.” He recalled they were gorgeous, “all of them with mouthfuls of gold teeth.” Because Walter grew up in the Bronx near Yankee Stadium, he watched Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in action. When Gehrig was mired in a batting slump, Walter wrote him a letter, telling him not to worry, the hits would soon start coming again. Gehrig wrote back, thanking him. I wish Walter had held onto that reply. But he certainly remembered it well. Even when he was in his 90s, in a bed or his chair at the Guilford rehab center, he could still recall seeing those fabled Yankees and others of that era — Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays — playing for the local ball clubs. He also told us he saw Satchel Paige pitch after that star in the Negro leagues finally got a chance to play in the majors. Walter and his wife, Peggy Kaylin, loved living in New York but they also enjoyed getting out of town with their young daughters, Jennifer and Lucy. In the late 1950s, they began spending weekends in a beach-side cottage in Old Lyme. Eventually, they got weary of the Sunday night drives back to the city and they moved to Old Lyme to live there year-round. But Walter never stopped writing. Jennifer, the woman I married, recalls hearing him typing away in a room adjacent to the kitchen and later in his office upstairs, where he had an expansive view of the shoreline. When he wanted to take a break from his writing, he walked into the sun room on the first floor, sat down at the piano and played in his unique style: a rolling, rollicking, free-wheeling boogie woogie outpouring that was delightful. During his four years at Apple Rehab, he kept a succession of typewriters in his room and he was constantly thinking of story ideas, then getting them most of down on paper. We have been sorting through his many correspondences and story fragments and came upon a letter he wrote to an editor at “The New Yorker” magazine. “At age 90 I’m working on a highly unusual novel,” he wrote. “‘Hear the Chant of the Jungle’ centers on the relationship between 23-year-old Paulie Ohlbaum of the Bronx and a considerably older, incredibly tall Watusi woman, Roz, who emerged from Rwanda (Congo) to take care of him for the first two years of his life, then disappeared and has rematerialized 20 years later. By this time Paulie and his older brother, Luther, own and run a motel, Owl’s Eye, in Connecticut, on the Sound.” Walter went on for a couple of pages, continuing to weave the imaginative scenario. He concluded the letter: “Does this interest you? If so, I’d be happy to send you the first section, which concludes with Roz getting set to meet Paulie for the first time in 20 years.” We couldn’t find the editor’s response, if there was one. But it didn’t matter much to Walter. He kept writing anyway, up until the final week or two of his life. That’s an inspiration for all of us to keep going. He also kept playing the piano. Apple Rehab has a community room where residents gather and there’s a piano in the corner. Walter spent a lot of time seated there in his wheelchair, entertaining everyone within earshot. Over the last year or two, Walter would sometimes hold up the bent, arthritic fingers of his right hand and complain he couldn’t play piano as freely as he had in previous years. But that never stopped him. He loved movies, especially the classics from his prime. A month or two ago, my wife and I went to Best Video and rented “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre” for him. We watched it together at Apple. After it ended, Walter exclaimed, “That was some picture!” It would be the last one he ever saw. We also supplied Walter with Heaven Hill, his favorite Bourbon whiskey. He always enjoyed a little glass of it just before dinner time. That community room, and I’m sure all of Apple Rehab itself, is quieter now, some of the life gone out of it. There are many people, besides us, who miss hearing Walter play and miss his stories. His four grandkids, who he was so proud of, also dearly miss him. My younger daughter Charlotte posted a message that ended: “Papa, the world is already a little less cool without you.” He made it to 95. As he often told us in his final year, he had done enough. He was ready to go. His wife had died in 2010. Walter had few regrets; he didn’t dwell on such stuff. He had enjoyed life. For many years, he had sat with Peggy on the beach, sipping cocktails while listening to his jazz records playing from inside their home. As he watched the sun slowly set over the water, Walter always said, “It doesn’t get any better than this.” One day this spring we will scatter his ashes in that idyllic playground where life couldn’t get any better.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

So, tax-related incentives demanded by Apple will have to be looked from a different angle,” Sitharaman told PTI on the sidelines of Chemexcil function here. The government has not accepted most of the demands of the iPhone maker, she added. Apple plans to set up a manufacturing unit in Bengaluru this year, where it will assemble its products, probably only iPhone 6 and 6s models, according to reports in a section of the media. The American tech giant has sought various concessions on taxation and import of components for setting up the unit. The Cupertino-based technology giant currently manufactures in China and Brazil. Apart from tax sops, Apple also wants relaxation in the mandated 30% local sourcing of components. Earlier reports had said the company would be importing all its components on the grounds that it is bringing in cutting-edge technology to the country. Apple also wants to open a fully-owned retail outlets in the country. In January, Apple had indicated to the government that it was ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones, but wants fiscal concessions, including Customs duty waiver on imported components. tags Apple Inc GST Nirmala Sitharaman China Brazil more from business Bharti Airtel sells 10% stake in tower unit to KKR, Canada Pension Mar 28, 2017 10:58 IST China’s HNA in talks to buy controlling stake in Forbes Mar 28, 2017 10:34 IST FD vs Stocks: Which One Should You Choose?

The hackers are threatening to remotely wipe victims' devices if Apple doesn't pay by April 7. Apple responded to the threat by stating that there had not been any breach of its systems, and that if hackers had access to iCloud accounts then they must have gotten them from third party services — people often reuse their same credentials for multiple websites, which is a poor security practice. To prove they’re not joking around the group recently contacted ZDNet with a small sample of 54 account credentials for verification purposes. Some accounts dated back to 2011 and were no longer in use, but of those that could be contacted by ZDNet, 10 people confirmed that the passwords were accurate. Now, this doesn’t prove that the hackers have managed to obtain 300,000 credentials, just that they do have access to some. Moreover, most of the people confirmed that they used their iCloud email address and password on other sites, although three claimed that they weren’t used in any other site. Whether the threat is to be taken seriously or the result of a group of hackers looking for some publicity and the possibility of a quick payout (which we doubt will ever happen), it wouldn’t be a bad idea to change your Apple account password and enable two-factor authentication if you haven’t already done so.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed ‘Turkish’ hackers threaten to reset millions of iCloud accounts 23 Mar 2017 3 Apple, Data loss, Security threats Post navigation Previous: Ex-IT director accused of accessing his former employer for two years Next: News in brief: WikiLeaks drops more CIA documents; ISP privacy rules killed; Instagram launches 2FA by Guy Clapperton 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit A new band of hackers, styling itself the “Turkish Crime Family”, is claiming it has secured the details of some 200m iCloud accounts and that if Apple doesn’t pay a whopping $75,000 bitcoin or ethereum ransom (or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards) it will wipe the lot. There are a few problems to face initially. First, Apple says its systems haven’t been breached. The company told Naked Security: There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID. The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services. So 200m accounts obtained from previously compromised third party services is OK? Obviously not, but there’s no suggestion that Apple itself is responsible for any compromised security. The Turkish Crime Family itself appears to be new on the security scene, believed to have started life in Istanbul but now resident in Green Lanes, north London, according to one report. Helpfully, the organisation has a Twitter account. Another curious facet of the alleged breach is that asking for payment in extremely traceable iTunes vouchers seems more than slightly curious; why would you not ask for something with a less clean audit trail? The group itself disputes the amount that’s been reported and blames a media relations operative (presumably the same one who put an email address for media inquiries on the Twitter profile):   This sum of $75,000 is incorrect, this was submitted by one of our old media guys that is not a part of our group. The sum is a lot higher — Turkish Crime Family (@turkcrimefamily) March 23, 2017 The organisation has posted what it claims is video evidence to the Motherboard site. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More David Kennerley, director of threat research at Webroot, is among the first to wonder whether the threat is actually real. There are a lot of questions that need to be answered such as, do these hackers really have access to the data they claim? How did they get hold of such a large amount of data? Was it a vulnerability in Apple’s infrastructure or breach of third-party tool or organisation? Or does the fault lie with good old password re-usage between sites and apps from a consumer side? Wherever the data originates, assuming it’s genuine, Apple faces the decision of whether to pay the ransom or to tough it out. Whichever way it goes, it will want to take precautions to see that this never happens again. Kennerley says: Whether [the breach] proves to be huge news, or no news at all – it’s always good to remind ourselves, no matter the reputation of the organisation that we trust to protect our digital lives we should always take extra measures to protect our own privacy and data. Our advice would be to assume the data has been compromised somehow; if it turns out to be a hoax, the worst thing that can happen is that your data is more secure. Precautions include: If your data is stored anywhere online, assume it could be compromised by a faulty server, deliberate action or the host company going bust. Have a backup – so if your primary host is wiped for any reason you still have your data. Use two factor authentication where possible. Apple encourages it, and here’s an article about the whys and wherefores that we wrote a few months ago. Don’t use the same password everywhere. We can’t say this often enough but people still do it. Pick a strong password – here’s our advice on how to do that Observe the standard security hygiene protocols – don’t click on links from unknown sources, go to the website independently. Finally, there are still people who believe their Apple hardware is completely safe from malware just because it’s Apple. It’s great kit and it works beautifully but nobody is safe – see our article on Apple security.

Logging into and erasing 200 million accounts would take some time. If it started happening, Apple could easily block the attack. How is this even a threat? Reply Adam says: March 24, 2017 at 3:31 pm You know, that’s a good point. Also, they’d have to have some sort of server or admin-level access to be able to wipe or delete accounts, or even a single server’s-worth of accounts. The Turkish Crime Family having that level of access would either entail an incredibly serious, hitherto unknown breach in Apple’s defenses (improbable), or the help of someone on the inside (more likely, but still doubtful). Reply Jeff says: March 24, 2017 at 7:22 pm If an Apple user wasn’t backing up their entire device to the Apple Cloud, a device that was wiped wouldn’t have everything for Apple to restore. I suspect there are quite a few users that don’t do Cloud backups, or only back up a portion of their data. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

The constant onslaught of news makes it nigh impossible for mere mortals with real lives to keep track of everything. That’s why we’ve compiled a quick and dirty list of this week’s top 10 tech stories, from Apple’s highly anticipated red iPhone to Lexus’ new luxury yacht — it’s all here. Apple has finally taken the wraps off the new ruby red ‘iPhone (RED)’ On Tuesday, in partnership with nonprofit Product (RED), Apple added a brand new, ruby red iPhone model to its roster: the iPhone (RED). Like the company’s (RED) iPod Nano, Beats headphones, and Smart Battery cases, the launch promotes Product (RED)’s ongoing effort to combat HIV and AIDS, which remain among the globe’s worst health problems. More than 35 million people have died of the virus, and 37 million are infected each year, according to Product (RED). Read the full story here. Diets are not equal for all people; ancestral homelands can make a difference Proponents of specific food class-centric diets such as paleo, vegan, gluten-free, ketogenic, or the Mediterranean diet often tend to prescribe their plans for everyone. Not so fast, says a group from the University of California, Berkeley. Biologists at UC Berkeley and other institutions around the world have published research that shows genetic differences from natural selection based on dietary changes in Europe, Ars Technica reports.

Mercedes-Benz, Aston Martin, and Bugatti have all launched or shown concepts of yachts that are slick, fast, and extremely pricey.

Meet Bixby — the smart sidekick who’ll help you use your digital gear There’s a new name in artificial assistants, but Samsung argues this one won’t tell you dumb jokes or a weather forecast, nor will it look up facts for you online. This bright assistant is meant to improve your interactions with your digital life — not just with your smartphone, but with your washing machine, thermostat, vacuum cleaner, and more. It’s nothing less than a rethink of how we use our stuff. “Philosophically, what we’re looking at is revolutionizing the interface,” Injong Rhee, head of research and development at Samsung Mobile Communications Business Group, told Digital Trends.

Novel braille smartwatch enables the blind to read notifications The Dot is a smartwatch with a unique interface that is able to translate basic notifications for blind users by dynamically reproducing braille on its specialized surface. It has been in development for the past couple of years, but mass production has finally begun, with the first orders set to ship out in April. Although braille has been a useful tool for those with limited vision for close to 200 years, in an age of touchscreens and smart devices, many of the world’s millions of visually impaired can be left out of the loop.

Born in response to one of the most startling economic blows the community of Erwin has endured, the group was organized to “rejuvenate, invest, support and energize Erwin” soon after CSX brought the town’s more than 100 years of railroad operations to a sudden halt, the group said. RISE Erwin President Jamie Rice said its core group of about 30 members met for first time on the request of Lee Brown, chairman of the Joint Economic Development Board of Unicoi County, soon after the railroad pulled out. A cooperative recovery effort that extended from Erwin to Nashville was underway, and Brown wanted to include younger members of the local business community in those efforts, Rice said. “It was that fall that RISE Erwin came to be,” she said. “We were a diverse bunch, but we found we all had this common passion for where we lived. The CSX closing inspired us even more to not let our community just dry up and blow away. “We all felt this urgency, that the time had come, that we couldn’t wait for someone to come riding in on a white horse and save us and that we, ourselves, were going to have to do it.” What came next were months of strategic planning during which the group focused on ways promote the community through unique events that no one else was doing. The end result was a series of festivals, special events and an evening farmers market that over the course of the year brought thousands of people to Erwin for something new to do downtown. First out of the gate was the Great Outdoors Festival, a spring festival dedicated to outdoor recreation and all the many natural amenities Unicoi County has to offer. Held in late April, the festival was presented as a complement to Erwin’s very successful fall Apple Festival. And while the number in attendance did not approach the estimated 100,000 visitors who attend the Apple Festival annually, the approximate crowd of 10,000 people it attracted went down as a resounding success for a first time event. The Great Outdoors Festival will be repeated this year in early May and will include a fun new feature compliments of Trout Unlimited — a free fly fishing school with a casting pool set up on the streets and instruction from Trout Unlimited’s experts. Rice said the May 6 festival date is intentionally set two weeks ahead of the annual Appalachian Trail Days gathering in Damacus, Va., because it is a two-week hike to Damacus from Erwin and great time to draw hikers off the trail and help Erwin better establish itself as a “Trail Town.” With the arrival of summer, RISE Erwin brought an evening farmers market to downtown Erwin that played out weekly from the height of growing season through what turned out to be a very long fall growing season. While the logistics of coordinating a different food truck, live musicians, outdoor yoga sessions and other fun activities featured at the weekly markets proved to be a more mammoth undertaking than expected, Rice said it was also a good education. “That’s a festival you put on every week. But it was very well attended and we learned a lot of things we could improve on,” she said. This year’s evening markets will begin in early June with the first root and leaf crops of spring, run all the way through the apples, pumpkins and mums of early fall and wrap up just before the Apple Festival. But it was an event that Rice said had been 100 years in the making that first really brought attention to RISE Erwin’s ability to raise a crowd. Washington County Economic Development Board Downtown Development Manager Dianna Cantler had been working them with the group and encouraging them to embrace the their own quirkiness, Rice said. And when Cantler asked them to consider what it is that sets Erwin apart, Rice admits she was the one who raised her hand and brought up “the elephant in the room, the elephant named Mary.” Mary, the circus elephant hanged in the Erwin railyard 100 years ago last September, became RISE Erwin’s mascot. And in a series of a events staged in her honor in the final weeks of August — a high school drama, a car show, a low country boil dinner with live Cajun music and dancing, and a circus-themed glow parade with buskers entertaining on street corners and children’s activities coordinated by Hands On! Regional Museum — the Erwin Elephant Revival raised more than $7,000 for captive elephants at The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald. The revival will continue in a smaller form this September with another community dinner, another circus-themed glow event and the auction of eight baby elephant statues colorfully painted by professional artists and sponsored by town organizations and businesses. Rice said the statues will be displayed at various downtown locations throughout the summer “to give people something to look at when they come to Erwin.” And their auction will raise more money for the The Elephant Sanctuary and make room for what RISE Erwin hopes will be new generations of baby elephant statues in town. RISE Erwin staged its final event of the year at the end of December, a Nativity Parade that surprised everyone by bringing a crowd of 2,000 people out on the streets on a below-freezing weeknight just before Christmas. And of all the events RISE Erwin organized, Rice said the Nativity Parade is the most requested for a repeat. “No one else does anything like it,” she said. “And it is what Christmas is all about. “Our first year was so busy and exciting. We want to keep that going with new, fresh ideas to keep that excitement for our town. I think that’s part of the Appalachian spirit, to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and fix this ourselves.” RISE Erwin is still in search of sponsors for three baby elephant statues to help the Elephant Sanctuary.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Should you buy iPhone 7, 7 Plus or wait for the release of iPhone 8? Let's have a look at iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 8 might offer for those who are planning to buy a premium device. Raymond Ronamai   March 26, 2017 08:57 IST Apple's iPhone 7 PlusApple Website Apple spears to be running out of innovation on its iPhone but the craze for it is still palpable. Hype around its upcoming flagship dubbed as the iPhone 8 aka iPhone X has already started gaining momentum although there is still some time before its actual release. In fact, those looking for a premium smartphone will be confused whether to buy the current flagship iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus or wait for its successor. The Cupertino giant is tight-lipped on his next-generation device but it is unlikely to reveal any detail till the time of release as that has been the norm in the past. However, the company has the tradition of releasing its iPhone in September every year; so the iPhone 8 should come at around the same time as well. Also read: This is how you can transform your iPhone into a dream device: 5 ultimate gadgets you need Well, let's have a look at the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and what the iPhone 8 might offer for those who are planning to buy a premium device. The iPhone 8 should ideally arrive by September but reports have claimed that its mass production would not begin until September, which means there is a possibility of pushing its launch to October. Now, the question is whether you are willing to use your current device for six to seven months until the new iPhone is released. In terms of pricing, the iPhone 7 costs $649 for the 32GB model, $749 for 128GB, and $849 for 256GB, while the iPhone iPhone 7 Plus 32GB comes at $769, 128GB at $869, and 256GB at $969. This pricing of the upcoming iPhone 8 is still not known, and even guessing sounds not fair at the moment. Reports have, however, claimed that it might start at $1,000, which is expensive. Its bigger screen version should cost even more. So, the question comes to whether one is willing to shell out around $1,000 for the upcoming flagship. If we look at $969 price tag for 256GB variant of iPhone 7 Plus, the rumoured price of the iPhone 8 is not unreachable. When it comes to specifications, we don't know much about the iPhone 8. Reports have it that it will come in three variants with 4.7-inch, 5.5-inch and 5.8-inch displays. It is expected to feature an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) display instead of LCD panels, no physical button and with a wireless charger. Digitimes also reported citing industry sources that Apple would use its "Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology to redesign a new fingerprint ID solution" for its new iPhones, and not Synaptics' Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7 features a 4.7-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit widescreen with Retina HD and 1,334x750p resolution (326 ppi pixel density), a 64-bit architure-based A10 Fusion chip with M10 motion coprocessor, an Apple iOS v10, a 32GB/128GB/256GB internal memory, and a 2GB RAM. It also has a 12MP main camera with f/1.8 aperture, digital zoon (up to 5x), Optical image Stabilisation, six-element lens, and Quad-LED True Tone flash, a 7MP front-snapper with f/2.2 aperture and auto image stabilisation, and a 1,960mAh battery. The iPhone 7 Plus sports a 5.5-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit widescreen with Retina HD and 1,080x1920p resolution (401 ppi pixel density), powered by a 64-bit architure-based A10 Fusion chip with M10 motion coprocessor, runs an iOS v10, and comes packed with a 32GB/128GB/256GB storage and a 3GB RAM. It features a dual 12MP main camera (f/1.8 aperture) with wide-angle field of view + telephoto camera (f/1.9 aperture), Optical zoom at 2x, digital zoom up to 10x, OIS, six-element lens and Quad-LED True Tone flash, a 7MP front-snapper with f/2.2 aperture, and a 2,900mAh battery. Coming back to whether you should buy the iPhone 7 or wait for its successor iPhone 8, it appears like the latter will have a few new features besides usual upgrades. So, the experience you will have with the upcoming flagship could be something new, which will give you a reason to wait for it. However, most gadget lovers may not have the patience to wait for six to seven months. Moreover, the iPhone 7 is one of the best smartphones (if not the best) currently available in the market. So, its's worth buying it, and you have the option to upgrade to iPhone 8 or some other device after using it for a few months or even a year.

BUSINESS Technology Apple announces red iPhones and a new, cheaper iPad Red iPhone Apple A cut of Apple's sales of Product Red versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will go toward HIV/AIDS programs. A cut of Apple's sales of Product Red versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will go toward HIV/AIDS programs. (Apple) Nina AgrawalContact Reporter Apple Inc. announced a new, cheaper iPad and Product Red special editions of its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus early Tuesday. All three products will be available to order online and in stores beginning Friday, it said. Apple’s new iPad, a refresh of its iPad Air 2, boasts a 9.7-inch Retina display, a more powerful (A9) computer chip and a 10-hour battery life. The starting price for a 32-gigabyte model with Wi-Fi is $329, down from $399. An option with cellular service is available for $459. The new iPad may be part of the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant’s gambit to resurrect tablet sales. At about 24% market share last year, Apple is still the largest player in the tablet game, according to International Data Corp. However, the overall tablet market has been shrinking, with shipments declining 15.6% in 2016 from 2015, according to IDC. “IPad as a category hasn’t been growing,” said Timothy Arcuri, managing director at financial services firm Cowen & Co. “They’re trying to arrest the multiyear downward trend.” Arcuri said that as smartphones, including Apple’s, have grown bigger and more powerful, people have increasingly consumed media and entertainment content on them, obviating the need for an iPad. “Unless you can offer it at a super compelling price, there’s not a super compelling use case for it,” Arcuri said. (He pointed out that the iPad Pro, by contrast, offers users a tool for creating content, which they can’t get elsewhere.) In the smartphone market, Apple continues to do well, with a 10th-anniversary launch of a feature-rich phone expected this fall. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Product Red special editions may be one way to drum up excitement about the iPhone in general, Arcuri said — especially in China, where red is considered a lucky color. In that country, Arcuri predicted, the next generation of iPhones will “sell like hotcakes.” Wells Fargo says all its ATMs soon will take smartphone codes, not just cards Associated Press Wells Fargo plans to upgrade all 13,000 of its ATMs next week to enable customers to access their funds using their cellphones instead of traditional bank cards. The announcement was made by Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive Tim Sloan on Tuesday at an employee town hall in Orlando. Although banks...

The announcement was made by Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive Tim Sloan on Tuesday at an employee town hall in Orlando. Although banks... (Associated Press) Sporting a bright matte finish, the red iPhones mark 10 years of Apple’s partnership with Red, a branding campaign that works to raise money and awareness about HIV and AIDS. “The introduction of this special edition iPhone in a gorgeous red finish is our biggest [Product Red] offering to date,” Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a news release. “We can’t wait to get it into customers’ hands.” The Red campaign works as follows: Brands partner to create Red products and pledge a percentage of sales revenue directly to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a public-private financing body that supports prevention, treatment and care of these diseases in more than 100 countries. The Global Fund spends 100% of revenue from Red products on HIV/AIDS programs. The red iPhones are a special edition of Apple’s existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The regular iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch screen; its lowest-priced option has 32 gigabytes of memory and costs $649. The lowest-priced red version has 128 gigabytes and costs $749. Apple would not comment on what share of revenue it contributes to the Global Fund from its Red products, but said it has donated $130 million since its partnership with Red began 10 years ago. Apple is the biggest corporate contributor to the Global Fund, although private-sector contributions, including those from Red, corporate donations and nonprofits amount to only 5% of its revenue, said Seth Faison, head of communications for the Global Fund. Arcuri said he didn’t expect the red phones to affect Apple’s bottom line. “The big picture is that Apple is positioning itself as the good guy” in terms of social responsibility, he said. “They already won the high-end smartphone war against Samsung’s Galaxy, they’re ahead of a really big launch.… They’re continuing to try to burnish their image.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Atty.

Along with the same A9 processor as the bigger iPhone 6s, as well as the same front and rear cameras as its larger siblings, the iPhone SE was priced at $399 for the 16GB model, and $499 for the 64GB version. Today, Apple announced that the SE - which it describes as "the most powerful phone with a four-inch display" - is getting a modest upgrade. From Friday, it's doubling the current storage capacity of both models while maintaining its existing prices. That means that from March 24, you'll be able to get the iPhone SE with 32GB of storage for $399, or 128GB for $499. Sadly, the iPhone SE - which actually stands for 'Special Edition' - won't be available with the new (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition color option announced today for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

She was daughter of Tom and May McGahon of McSwiney Street and was born on 12th September 1937. At the age of 18 Sheila left her family and friends behind and headed to New York to work as an Au Pair. While there she met Michael Power from Dunlaoghaire and a few years later they married and started their family. At the age of 29 her first baby was born and within four years she had four children, Anita, Doreen, Maureen and Michael Jnr. Sheila and Michael snr decided to leave America and bring their family back to Ireland where they bought a house in Greenacres in her home town. Five years passed and their fifth child Elaine was born and 14 months later their sixth Gavin followed to complete their family as they thought. At the age of 46 Sheila felt unwell and attended the doctor thinking she had a kidney infection only to receive a surprise when told she was pregnant with her seventh child and in due course Kim arrived. In June 1984 Sheila, Michael and the seven children said goodbye to their family and friends and moved back to America where they settled in Bayside, New York. Sheila was a kind, caring, tender and loving Lady. She taught her children many life lessons and how to be parents to her 20 grandchildren and two step grandchildren. She loved to knit and all the children would have beautiful handmade sweaters. She was a skilled dressmaker and a hairdresser. Sheila loved to dance and was a dancer in many pantomimes. Her favourite time of the year was Christmas and every year the family would spend Yuletide together at Sheila’s house. This Christmas past Sheila had 39 for Christmas dinner despite being very sick a few weeks prior to Christmas and was in hospital and only discharged two days before Christmas. Over the last few years and especially in the last year she went through so much and fought so hard every day to stay with her family before passing off peacefully in hospital. She endured more than anyone would ever deserve but still smiled and enjoyed life as much as she could. She spent time with family laughing and enjoying her grandchildren. Her strength was unbelievable. Sheila is survived by Michael snr, daughters , Anita, Doreen, Maureen, Elaine and Kim , her sons, Michael jnr and Gavin, their spouses, 20 grandchildren and two step grandchildren, her sister, Carmel Hanratty, Dundalk and brother, Hugh McGahon, Galway, nephew, nieces, cousins, relatives and wide circle of friends, both in America and Ireland. She was predeceased by her parents Tom and May, brother, Jimmy, sisters, Patricia (Patsy) and Mairead. Sheila will be missed by everyone every second of every day. Funeral Mass took place on Monday 30th January 2017 at O.L.B.S. Church Bayside, New York, followed by burial in St. Charles Cemetery Farmingdale, New York.

TECHNOLOGY The Uber Investigation Is Looking Less and Less Independent It seems that no matter what the committee overseen by Arianna Huffington finds, CEO Travis Kalanick will be keeping his job. By Salvador Rodriguez Salvador Rodriguez is a staff reporter for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. He covers Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, tech diversity, virtual reality, and other aspects of technology and entrepreneurship. Previously, Rodriguez was the Silicon Valley correspondent for the International Business Times; before that, he was the lead tech blogger and gadget reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. Rodriguez has interned with The New York Times in Arizona, The Arizona Republic, and the Houston Chronicle. He was born in Mexico and raised in Texas, and he earned his journalism degrees at Arizona State University. One of his special skills is the ability to name all the Super Bowl winners chronologically from memory. @sal19 Staff reporter, Inc.@sal19 WRITE A COMMENT Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Uber's investigation into its workplace environment appears to be even more convoluted and less independent than originally thought, based on remarks made by board member Arianna Huffington in a call with reporters Tuesday afternoon. The investigation was announced in February following an explosive account by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler that alleged an environment rife with sexism and sexual harassment. In response, CEO Travis Kalanick said an investigation would be conducted to look into Uber's workplace. Kalanick said the investigation would be led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and attorney Tammy Albarran, partners at the Covington & Burling law firm. "Joining them will be Arianna Huffington, who sits on Uber's board," Kalanick wrote in a February memo announcing the investigation to his employees. Huffington's role in the investigation, however, appears to have changed. "I am not conducting the investigation," Huffington said on the call Tuesday. The former editor in chief of The Huffington Post explained that the investigation is being run by Holder and Albarran's team. Huffington said the lawyers are speaking with employees and that employees are encouraged to contact the investigation team through an anonymous tip line. "That report will be completely thorough, completely independent, and presented to a subcommittee of the board that Bill Gurley, David Bonderman, and I sit on," Huffington said. "The committee that Holder is leading will report to the subcommittee, not to management." This apparent finessing of Huffington's role comes after Huffington's independence and history as a company leader came into question. In February, Inc. reported instances when sexual harassment was allegedly tolerated and covered up during Huffington's time at her publication. Additionally, her involvement drew criticism from notable investors Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein, who questioned how a board member of Uber could independently investigate her company. Despite saying that she is not involved with the investigation -- which is expected to be completed and reported to the public by the end of April -- Huffington on Tuesday suggested she has visibility into the direction of the investigation so far. She indicated as much after reporters asked about Uber CEO Travis Kalanick's job security. At first, Huffington responded that the board was confident in Kalanick and had no plans to replace him. Later, when asked if the situation would change should the investigation find evidence of wrongdoing on Kalanick's part, Huffington responded by saying, "It's the same answer. It's not something that's been addressed because it hasn't come up, and we don't expect it to come up." Earlier in the week, Huffington seemed to imply she was actively involved with the investigation, telling CNN that she has spoken with hundreds of women who work at Uber and reached her own conclusions based on those conversations. "Yes, there were some bad apples, unquestionably. But this is not a systemic problem," Huffington told CNN. "What is important is that the structures that were not in place are now being put in place to make sure that women, minorities, everyone, feels completely comfortable at Uber." On the Tuesday call, Huffington refuted the statement, saying CNN had reported the comments out of context. "The ultimate decision of what is or isn't a systemic problem will be borne out by Eric Holder and Tammy Albarran's investigation," Huffington said. "Whatever that investigation finds will be honored by Uber. Everybody -- Travis, the board, management -- have made it clear that whatever the results of the investigation will be honored and they will help us create a completely equitable workplace where there is zero tolerance for both sexual harassment and sexists." Uber did not respond to a request for comment clarifying Huffington's role in the investigation. [Update: Following publication of this story, Uber offered this clarification: "Eric Holder and Tammy Albarran are conducting the investigation in cooperation with Liane Hornsey and Angela Padilla. The results of the investigation will be reported into the subcommittee on the board, of which Arianna is a member. That committee will ensure the company implements the investigation's recommendations as part of the larger review of Uber's culture."] Published on: Mar 21, 2017 Advertisement
All News Movies Games TV Culture Anime March 25, 2017 Reinier Macatangay Super Mario Run plagued by pop ups, but still fun (Android review) Finally, Super Mario Run is out on Android through the Google Play store. For months, it had been exclusive to iOS because of a deal between Nintendo and Apple. Now, Android smartphone users get to enjoy this landmark game. It is a landmark game because for years Nintendo hesitated to enter the smartphone market out of fear no one would buy their own hardware. To compromise, it looks like “casual” versions of top Nintendo franchises are going to be released for Android and iOS, while deeper titles will remain on the Switch and 3DS. It makes sense, as Nintendo can lure a different crowd by using phone games as bait. Is the bait enjoyable? Well, it is a debatable point. Remember how people made fun of modern gaming using the original Super Mario Bros.? Bubbles were placed over Mario’s head to mock the way today’s games lecture players on obvious points. (Credit: hiwiller.com.) Super Mario Run is not too far from the above picture. Forced pop ups and tutorials are present throughout, even past the game’s beginning stages. Simply starting the main game comes across as a frustrating process because of Toad informing the player on nearly everything. Toad is just trying to be helpful, but he starts to become annoying after a few times since every single minuscule detail requires a notice. The little guy just needs to take a breather and wait a bit, as not everyone cares about whatever arrived in a gift box. Plus, the game plagues users at the beginning with a tutorial on jumping and a few other game mechanics. Most casual gamers can figure out the controls to a 2D Mario title on their own. The pop ups are a shame because beneath all the clutter lies a solid game. Sure, the graphical style seems no different than the DS and 3DS New Super Mario Bros. series, but the “automatic runner” premise adds a new dimension to the gameplay. The overall level designs are still good too (although short). Yet, for the older gamer who grew up playing the classic 8-bit Mario games, trying out this entry will be jarring because of the constant hand holding. Perhaps Nintendo should offer an option at startup and let people decide if they want so much help. It would make a lot people happier to not tap so through many options and updates. The main gameplay experience is always most important. Some readers might disagree with the above criticism, and that is fine. Again, underneath the extra distractions is a legitimate Mario series entry for Android and iOS. Going through each level is fun, even if exploring is more difficult since Mario keeps running. As for the extra modes (which Toad will undoubtedly lecture on), Toad Rally is a nice addition. Players compete against other Super Mario Run users around the world, but the opponent is only a “ghost.” In other words, no one is facing off against a live player. The Toad Rally mode is not unwelcome though and adds replayability. The Kingdom Building mode seems less attractive. If players are interested, they can add buildings and other items to the hub world, or rearrange and move things around. Others might find it interesting. One last nitpicking point: the price. Even a few Nintendo fans will find $9.99 too expensive for an automatic runner with short-ish (but well designed) levels. Super Mario Run is not without flaws and the price is high, but with patience, gamers will remember why they love Mario all over again.

Well, the back of it does, anyway. I’ve never been a fan of phones with white bezels. I find them distracting — particularly in sunlight — and have always preferred the “single slab of glass” appearance that a black border gives off. So I was disappointed that Apple went with white on the front of the Product Red iPhone. It wasn’t surprising given that’s what you get with the gold and rose gold iPhones. But Apple hasn’t always done that. The white iPhone 3G and 3GS had a black on the front. More recently, the same was true for the iPhone 5C, which had a black faceplate opposite its vibrant colors around back. But sadly that’s not the direction Jony Ive went for the special edition iPhone 7. So what’s a person to do? Well, you could buy a second phone and swap the displays, as seen in the video below. But that might get expensive unless you’ve got a friend who for whatever reason wants a white front on their black iPhone. There’s another, far more affordable option: just buy a screen protector. You’ll need one that’s edge-to-edge with colored glass at the top and bottom. You can find the one seen here by searching for “Sparin” on Amazon. It’s around $14. A lot of people find it silly to put another layer of glass over their smartphone display. And yeah, usually it’s a sleazy $30 add-on that carriers try to sell you alongside a new phone. But in this case, it’s really just a way to get rid of that white front. Nearly all of it, anyway. You can see the white plastic border that’s between the curved glass and red aluminum. But on the whole? This is exactly what I wanted. Yes, the one obvious downside is that you’re stuck with a white home button. But there’s really just no avoiding it. Even if you were to actually replace the screen, you’d need to leave the original white home button alone. Otherwise, Apple’s deep iOS security would freak out and you’d probably lose the ability to use Touch ID and Apple Pay. Not worth it. Does it look a little dumb? Sure, maybe. But I can live with it. The full-screen protector adds a little extra bit of thickness to the phone. Put on a case, and pretty much any remaining trace of white goes away. You’d probably want something a little more transparent for your red phone, though. Ahhhh. A big slab of black glass. Just the way Apple should’ve done it from the start.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

Unfortunately, it comes equipped with a white front plate, much like the Gold, Silver, and Rose Gold iPhones, something that's been a point of criticism for people who think it would have looked better with a black front plate. YouTuber Danny Winget recently tore apart a red iPhone 7 Plus and replaced its logic board and front plate with parts taken from a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus, giving us a glimpse at what an actual (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 Plus with a black front would have looked like. Winget had to replace not only the front plate but also the logic board because if he swapped just the front portion of the device, the Touch ID fingerprint sensor would have been rendered unusable. Apple ties the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to an iPhone's logic board and disables it for security reasons if any of the parts are swapped out. Therefore, most of the internal structure of the (PRODUCT)RED iPhone had to be replaced with parts from the Jet Black iPhone. Purchasing an entire Jet Black iPhone 7 or 7 Plus for the purpose of creating a hybrid red/black iPhone 7 is probably out of the question for most people, but it's an interesting proof of concept. This method essentially ruins the Jet Black iPhone 7 involved, making it a rather pricy project, and it destroys the waterproofing seal on the red iPhone. It's also worth noting that this is a highly complicated process that essentially requires tearing apart two iPhones, melding them together, and hoping nothing goes wrong, something that the average person won't want to attempt. For a closer look at the Special Edition (PRODUCT)RED iPhone, make sure to check out our hands-on video.

Rating: 63 Votes Zorn 3 days ago at 11:26 am I would swap my matte black 7 for the red iPhone if it had a black front option... dang it Same. Ugh. Looks cheap with the white front. Combined with not even bothering to replace the silver ring around the TouchID with a corresponding red one, this really is par for the course for Cook's Apple. Lazy, uninspired products from a successful company that went on autopilot. Rating: 45 Votes Zorn 3 days ago at 11:36 am I don't think it's "Crazy" for Apple to make a black bezel pairing with the Product Red iPhone. However, I was not shocked when Apple chose to use the white bezel. But It's a possibility the white bezel was used with the Product Red iPhone from having more parts remaining from silver iPhone, being its allegedly less popular or extra stock of that specific part. I would be willing to bet $500 on this. Under Jobs, if the part from the black iPhone wasn't the right shade to compliment the red aluminum, he would have had them try 15 other shades of black to find the right one. Under Cook, this is an accounting decision. Which color are we overstocked on? Yeah, perfect, use that one!

That particular colour combination is too aggressive, especially for a brand like Apple. It worked better on the U2 iPod because rock n' roll was essentially the theme, but on an iPhone? Nope.

In May last year, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple's Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling iPhone 6 models, ruling that Apple violated design patents of Chinese maker Shenzhen Baili with its smartphones. The Chinese phone-maker had lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed upon by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office's banning order to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili's design patent for 100c phones, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday. The court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features that "completely change the effect of the entire product...and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers," finding Baili's claim was without legal basis. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there is no sufficient proof to claim the designs constitute violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal against the ruling. In another related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones. Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court yesterday ruled to maintain the board's decision. It remains not immediately clear if Apple will appeal. Apple phones are popular among China's urban young people, but the sale faces stiff competition from domestic phone makers, which produce a wider range of affordable and quality smartphones. Last year, three domestic brands — OPPO, Huawei and Vivo — outperformed Apple as China's top selling phone brands, according to a report by the International Data Corporation. OPPO sold 78.4 million handsets in China last year, tailed by Huawei with 76.6 million units. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) closed a deal to acquire automation app Workflow for an unspecified sum. The iPad and iPhone app let users create macro commands using functions built-in with other apps to automate tasks. The app is also compatible with Apple Watch. Workflow has been available in the App Store for about two years at a cost of $2.99. As of Thursday morning, it is free. Ari Weinstein, one of the Workflow team members who will be joining Apple as part of the deal, said in a statement cited by TechCrunch: We are thrilled to be joining Apple. We’ve worked closely with Apple from the very beginning, from kickstarting our company as students attending WWDC to developing and launching Workflow and seeing its amazing success on the App Store. We can’t wait to take our work to the next level at Apple and contribute to products that touch people across the world. Integrating Workflow’s capabilities with Siri is, according to TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino, a virtual no-brainer: If you spool out the thread here it’s not hard to see Workflow being integrated heavily with Siri, allowing even more seamless activation and composition of actions now that the team has access to Apple’s private APIs, which are more robust than the tiny bit of Siri that’s public so far. Examples of how the app works are available at the Workflow website. Here are the guts of a macro called “Running Late”: Find calendar events Get travel time Text Send message Provided that you’ve associated a person and a phone number with the calendar event, a single tap on the Running Late icon will execute that string of commands.
