Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is looking into opening its first official store in South Korea in an effort to compete directly with Samsung in the company’s home country. The Wall Street Journal reports that the Apple Store might even be located right across the street from Samsung’s headquarters in Seoul. The Cupertino company has apparently been sending retail executives to South Korea in the past few months to look at potential locations. It’s also considering another site on popular shopping street Garosu-gil. However, it could be a year before the store is ready to open. The Korean market is still dominated by local giants Samsung and LG, which make up about 80 percent of smartphone sales in the country. Apple managed to grab 25 percent of the market in 2014 when it launched the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. However, it’s since dropped to a 10 percent market share. Apple currently has a rare opportunity to make inroads in Korea due to the Galaxy Note 7 recall. Samsung is still struggling to regain consumer confidence, giving its Cupertino rival a chance to win over new customers. Opening an Apple Store right in the heart of South Korea could send a strong signal that Apple is ready to fight Samsung on its home turf.

Is Now Daniel Niles’ “Favorite” Play (AAPL) Here's why AAPL continues to impress analysts and drive AAPL shares higher By Aman Jain, ValueWalk  |  Sep 24, 2016, 7:00 am EST     Popular Posts: Facebook Inc Warning: Slower Growth Means Lower FB Target Price Apple Inc.

Shares Slump As Sales Miss Estimates (WMT) Here’s Why Target Corporation is Still a Buy (TGT) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) View All Posts Apple Inc. (AAPL) has failed to impress the high-profile tech investor Daniel Niles since early 2015, but things have changed drastically now. On Thursday, Niles, a founding partner of AlphaOne Capital Partners, told CNBC’s Closing Bell that now Apple is his “favorite play.” “That’s the one that will help really drive the market and if you look at it, the stock is down 15 percent from its level really back in that early 2015 time period,” Niles said. The tech investor added that Apple  is the most valuable company in the market at present, and he believes that its stock is driven by three factors. First, Apple should be able to achieve its revenue guidance for September easily. Niles said that ignoring the fact that the company “burns 3.6 billion” in channel inventory, it only really needs to grow revenues about 1% sequentially. “Over the last four years, it’s been 6 to 7 percent that they’ve averaged in September,” he said. Second, carriers are again subsidizing iPhones, and this, Niles believes, would make many customers upgrade. Lastly, the valuation is great. “Apple gets a nice combination of defense with a nice, big yield.” In other Apple news, the rivalry between Apple and Samsung Electronic (SSNLF) is set to intensify further as the U.S. firm is planning to open a new Apple Store very close to Samsung’s HQ in Seoul, South Korea, according to a Wall Street Journal report. 10 Stocks That Should Be in Your Portfolio Right Now This indeed is really close, and according to people familiar with the matter, this move can prove very beneficial to the iPhone maker. There is a lot of untapped potential for the iPhone in South Korea because it is a large market, and Apple has made limited headway in the country so far. South Korea is Asia’s fourth-largest economy and has been a tough market for Apple. Hometown favorites Samsung and LG dominate smartphone sales there, and together, they account for about 80% of the smartphone market in the country, notes the WSJ. At present, Apple relies on third-party retailers, and therefore, having a store will likely have a significant impact. According to the WSJ, the iPhone maker is looking for a location in the up-market Gangnam area, which houses most of the busiest subway stations and Samsung’s headquarters. Samsung will definitely be unhappy to hear this as it is already going through the trouble of recalling the Galaxy Note 7 handsets that are exploding while charging. As of now, there have been no comments from the U.S. firm on the WSJ report. Can Nike Inc (NKE) Buck the Athleisure Downtrend? The post Apple Inc.

Apple's reported plans are quite understandable, and the company might have a few ways to make its device stand out, particularly to iPhone/iPad users. But given the competition and the relatively modest size of the addressable market, the product is unlikely to have a big financial impact on the world's most profitable company. Bloomberg reported on Friday Apple is prepping "an Echo-like smart-home device based on the Siri voice assistant." It adds the device has reached the prototype testing phase, but cautions Apple's plans aren't finalized and the project could still be scrapped. The Information had already reported in May an Echo-like device is being prepped. But VentureBeat reported a few days later Apple's home assistant would be built into a new Apple TV set-top, rather than work as a standalone device. It looks as if The Information's report was closer to the mark. Bloomberg's scoop comes just nine days after Amazon unveiled a new version of its hockey puck-shaped Echo Dot device that goes for just $50 -- $40 less than the original Dot, and $130 less than what the original Echo sells for -- and features a better speech processor. It also comes ahead of an Oct. 4 Google event at which the company is expected (among other things) to share a launch date and pricing for its Google Home speaker/assistant, which was first unveiled at its May I/O conference. Android Police reports Home, which (along with Android 7.0) supports a new Google Assistant service, will sell for $129. So how will Apple's solution stand out? For starters, Bloomberg's sources state the product will feature "more advanced microphone and speaker technology." They add Apple might use technology obtained through its acquisitions of face-recognition startups Faceshift and Emotient to allow its device to "act based on who is in a room or a person's emotional state." The fact the product will leverage Siri could also let it take advantage of Apple's iOS and MacOS user data -- whether obtained via Siri or other means -- to deliver personalized responses and reminders, as well as stay aware of a user's daily activity. And one has to assume it will support Apple's HomeKit home automation platform, which allows iOS devices and the Apple Watch to control many smart home products. At the same time, the Alexa assistant powering Amazon's Echo line has already created a pretty big ecosystem of supported home devices and web/mobile services. Amazon disclosed last week the number of "skills" supported by Alexa has topped 3,000, up three times from June levels. Google, like Apple, hasn't made as much progress as Amazon in creating an ecosystem for its assistant service. But its artificial intelligence and natural language-processing strengths could help Google Home stand out, as might the user data it takes in via offerings such as Google search, Android, Gmail and Maps. Meanwhile, Apple will be facing off against Amazon and Google in what's still a fairly small market. In June, The Information reported Amazon is looking to sell 3 million Echo units in 2016, and up to 10 million in 2017. For comparison, Apple sold 231.5 million iPhones last year at an average selling price (ASP) that -- given Echo devices are priced between $50 and $180 -- was likely more than four times higher than Amazon's current Echo ASP. Thus, even if Apple sells as many home speakers next year as Amazon is reportedly hoping to sell, the product's revenue will be equal to a tiny fraction of Apple's iPhone revenue. Both literally and figuratively, an Apple-made Echo rival will be peripheral to the company's biggest profit engine. Get an email alert each time I write an article for Real Money.

The report shows an 8.1 percent gain in retail revenue to US$3.4 billion during the first half of 2016, the strongest growth since the late 1990s, according to report author Joshua Friedlander, senior vice president of strategic data analysis at RIAA. Streaming music revenue rose 57 percent to $1.6 billion during the first six months of the year. Streaming accounted for 47 percent of overall industry revenue, compared with 32 percent in the year-ago period. First half @RIAA US music industry numbers are out! Paid subscriptions fastest growing revenue source in 1H '16. https://t.co/Xrjrhy9wjb pic.twitter.com/aKysVC4f7h — Josh Friedlander (@joshpfried) September 20, 2016 Huge gains in streaming revenue and market share fueled the increase. The revenue increases include figures from Apple Music, Tidal, and paid versions of Spotify. They also take into account SoundExchange distributions from Internet radio services including Pandora and Sirius XM, and on-demand services from YouTube, Vevo and ad-supported versions of Spotify. The biggest contributors were the newly launched paid services from Apple and Tidal, as well as growth in existing services, like Spotify Premium. Revenue and subscriptions more than doubled during the first half to $1.01 billion. The number of paid subscriptions doubled to 18.3 million during the first half. Subscriptions accounted for 30 percent of industry revenue. SoundExchange distributions rose 4 percent to $403 million, a new record figure. On-demand ad-supported streaming rose to $195 million, a 24 percent increase compared with prior-year figures. The new report confirms anecdotal evidence of a shift from several fronts since 2015. Apple, Tidal Apple last June launched a new streaming subscription service, Apple Music. It started with a free three-month trial before the $9.99 monthly subscription rate kicked in. The service gives customers access to more than 30 million songs and the Beats 1 premium Internet radio service. Apple last fall reported that it had converted more than 6.5 million customers to paid subscribers, with another 8.5 million taking up the trial offer. The company last month announced that its paid subscriber rolls had expanded to 15 million. CEO Daniel Ek last month tweeted that Spotify had expanded its paid subscription reach to 40 million subscribers. That figure was on the nose, according to a Spotify official who asked not to be identified. "Suddenly you're an overnight sensation after 10 years of hard work," the official told the E-Commerce Times. A lot more major companies likely will move into paid streaming subscriptions and away from digital downloads, he said. The surge in paid streaming is temporary, cautioned Russ Krupnick, managing partner of MusicWatch. Growth will slow down, he told the E-Commerce Times. However, premium services will continue to make changes -- such as offering exclusive content, higher resolution and other features -- to persuade consumers to jump on board. "The premium services are going to become more premium and more differentiated," Krupnick said. "The free services will have more limits placed on them." YouTube Dispute The big question for the music industry is whether the shift toward paid streaming subscriptions will alter the overall profit model for record labels and artists. Both struggled during a long period of revenue depletion from the decline in vinyl and CD sales due to illegal downloading. "These subscription services pay artists and labels a fair market rate, which really helps foster the reinvestment in these artists and new investment into up-and-coming artists," said RIAA spokesperson Cara Duckworth. However, fair compensation disputes continue, she noted, citing YouTube as an example. The industry blames those conflicts on what RIAA Chairman Cary Sherman calls "outdated laws," like the 1999 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Duckworth told the E-Commerce Times. Ad supported, on-demand music streams accounted for only $195 million in revenue for the industry during the first half of 2016, or 6 percent of industry revenue, Sherman noted in a post on Medium, in spite of YouTube enjoying the benefit of 57.9 billion music streams in its top 50 list.

Apple Music has been busy of late, mostly raking in the plaudits for the five Apple-exclusive-released albums that have hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart so far in 2016. Now it's beefing up its content team with the recent hire of Scott Seviour, a veteran artist development and marketing executive who has worked at Epic Records, RCA and ABC News over the years. The news was first reported by Business Insider. James Corden Channels David Bowie, Slash & Spice Girls in New Apple Music Ad Most recently, Seviour had started and run his own business, The Seviour Company, launched in January 2015 after he left his Epic Records post the previous August. According to his LinkedIn, which currently lists his role as simply "original content," he worked alongside Radical Media as a music producer for Hello World!, a nature show on the Discovery Channel in that role. At Epic, he served as the EVP of marketing and artist development from 2012-2014; prior to that, he spent a decade overseeing artist development at RCA. Seviour's diverse background in both A&R and television raises a number of possibilities for what his addition to the Apple Music team means for the streaming service moving forward. Certainly, the company has been active in securing high-profile exclusives in terms of album and single releases, utilizing those to attract subscribers to its nascent service (it currently claims 17 million paid subscribers), and Seviour could add to Head of Content Larry Jackson's rolodex. He also worked closely with Epic chief L.A. Reid in his role at that company, an interesting connection simply for the reason that three of those five previously-mentioned Apple exclusives that hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 came out of Reid's stable at Epic (Future's Evol, DJ Khaled's Major Key and Travi$ Scott's Birds In the Trap Sing McKnight). Drake Looks Beat Up on 'Please Forgive Me' Film Poster But his background in television also could provide another clue as to the direction that Apple Music is headed. Aside from their commercials with Taylor Swift and Khaled, among others, Apple Music has also bankrolled Drake's "Hotline Bling" video, streamed Swift's 1989 Tour documentary exclusively on the platform and debuted the long-form visual album Endless from Frank Ocean last month. Drake's upcoming short film project Please Forgive Me is also expected as an Apple Music exclusive, while a series based on Carpool Karaoke and a deal with Birdman for a Cash Money Records documentary are also in the mix. All that is to say that there are several possible roles for Seviour to play on the Apple Music original content team in the coming months. Apple Music did not return a request for comment or clarification on his role as of press time.

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship The Curious Case of Chris Ziegler’s Employment at The Verge and Apple Nilay Patel: Hey everyone — there have been questions about Chris Ziegler and his absence from The Verge in the past few weeks. I want to provide answers for those who have been worried about him. First, Chris accepted a position at Apple. We wish him well. […] Chris began working for Apple in July, but didn’t tell anyone at The Verge that he’d taken a new job until we discovered and verified his dual-employment in early September. Chris continued actively working at The Verge in July, but was not in contact with us through most of August and into September. During that period, in the dark and concerned for Chris, we made every effort to contact him and to offer him help if needed. We ultimately terminated his employment at The Verge and Vox Media the same day we verified that he was employed at Apple. This is really bizarre. Obviously The Verge can’t have staff members simultaneously working for one of the companies they cover, but surely Apple would consider this just as much of a conflict of interest as The Verge would. No word on what Ziegler is (or was? — several little birdies have told me Ziegler is not listed in the company directory) doing at Apple. And Ziegler’s Twitter account has been silent since August 8. ★ Friday, 23 September 2016 Display Preferences Copyright © 2002–2016 The Daring Fireball Company LLC. Ads via The Deck

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Sep 23, 2016 at 5:27PM Image source: Apple. There are now more than 60 million people subscribing to the big three on-demand streaming music platforms. Spotify announced this month that it has 40 million subscribers, just after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced that Apple Music has 17 million subscribers. Earlier this year, Tidal said it had 3 million subscribers. Other high-profile streaming services such as YouTube Red haven't released any official subscriber numbers. But the fastest growing of all the popular on-demand streaming platforms is also the largest and oldest. Spotify added 10 million new subscribers in the period from March to September. Apple, by comparison, added somewhere between 4 million and 6 million in that same period. The growth of on-demand music subscriptions is eating away at Apple's iTunes revenue, and Apple plans to make up that lost revenue and more with Apple Music. Spotify's popularity represents a much bigger loss to Apple than a bit of music revenue, though. Apple the services company On Apple's second-quarter earnings call, CEO Tim Cook pointed out that services revenue growth accelerated to 27% from 24% in the first quarter. That growth slowed to 19% in the third quarter, however, as Apple came up against the initial release of Apple Music from the prior year. The healthy clip of service revenue growth is supported by Apple's large and ever-growing install base, which topped 1 billion at the beginning of the year. Even with declining iPhone sales, it's a safe assumption that the install base continues to climb. But even that huge install base isn't enough to convert a lot of users into loyal paid streaming subscribers. Even if every Apple user had two devices from the company, Apple Music's take rate is just 3.4%. It's probably much lower. Spotify, by comparison, historically converts about 25% of its total listeners into paid subscribers. More recently, that number has been climbing higher. Spotify's subscriber rate may be growing faster than its total audience because the idea of subscribing to a service has finally gone mainstream. Apple may be in part to thank for that, but Spotify is seeing more of the benefits. Its increased conversion rate has allowed Spotify to add double the number of new subscribers over the past six months as Apple. The real value of Apple services The rapid growth of Spotify's paid subscriber base isn't a threat to Apple investors because it's representative of the opportunity Apple is missing in services revenue. It's a threat because the real value of Apple's services such as Apple Music comes when users decide to upgrade their hardware. An Apple Music subscriber is much more likely to choose an Apple product since its functionality is built right into the device. Put simply, Apple Music increases the value of the iPhone, iPad, and all of Apple's devices for those who subscribe. That's true for all Apple services, including iCloud, Apple Pay, iMessage, iTunes, or the App Store, among others. The more Apple services an iPhone, iPad, or Mac user uses, the higher the switching costs. Despite Apple's efforts to outmaneuver the competition with Apple Music's executive team of music insiders -- Jimmy Iovine, Dr. Dre, and Trent Reznor -- it's been unable to overcome Spotify. Apple is even throwing its considerable pile of cash around, signing deals for exclusives and producing original videos for artists. Spotify refuses to engage in those tactics. Clearly, that's not the determining factor for many subscribers. That said, Apple Music hasn't been a failure by any means. Being able to claim 17 million subscribers in a little over one year is nothing to sneeze at. It took Spotify more than six years to reach that point. Those 17 million are some of Apple's most valuable users -- producing service revenue, and probably buying new Apple hardware year after year. Apple Music's slower growth over the past six months compared with Spotify suggests that Apple's services strategy will need more than the streaming service to have the desired impact of increasing the value of Apple's hardware.

White Teacher Calls Students a Bunch of Broke ‘N—rs’ Who Will Get Shot Deputy Editor for Tech Site Was Simultaneously Working for Apple for 2 Months by Josh Feldman | 6:40 pm, September 23rd, 2016   In a stunning admission of a serious conflict of interest, the editor-in-chief from tech site The Verge revealed today that one of their deputy editors was pulling double-duty working for Apple for a whole two months. And for those two months, no one at Apple had any idea. Verge EIC Nilay Patel posted a note online today in response to questions about Ziegler’s recent absence from the site: Chris began working for Apple in July, but didn’t tell anyone at The Verge that he’d taken a new job until we discovered and verified his dual-employment in early September. Chris continued actively working at The Verge in July, but was not in contact with us through most of August and into September. During that period, in the dark and concerned for Chris, we made every effort to contact him and to offer him help if needed. We ultimately terminated his employment at The Verge and Vox Media the same day we verified that he was employed at Apple Vox Media conducted an investigation into whether his secret employment at Apple “any impact on editorial decisions or journalism produced at The Verge.” They concluded it didn’t. Patel explained that this is being publicly disclosed “in the interests of transparency and respect for our audience.” Based on Ziegler’s user page, he does not appear to have written about Apple recently.

It’s all thanks to the new built-in Home app that ships with iOS 10 and watchOS 3. Resident Apple HomeKit enthusiast, Zac Hall, already wrote a thorough walkthrough of the new Home app during the initial iOS 10 beta period, but now that iOS 10 and watchOS 3 are shipping, it’s only right to give it another in-depth visit with a corresponding walkthrough. What is the Home app? The new Home app is a centralized hub for managing Apple HomeKit-enabled devices. These are devices that have been specifically certified by Apple to work seamlessly. As you’ll learn, the set up process and day-to-day device interaction has much improved with the release of iOS 10. Previously, users had to rely on third-party HomeKit apps in order to achieve similar functionality. A good example of this is the recently updated Home – Smart Home Automation app from Mattias Hochgatterer. These apps work, and in some cases do things better than the stock Home app, but it’s difficult to compete with the level of native integration baked into a stock iOS app. There’s also something to be said for an app that appears on your Home screen by default; not to mention that it’s free. With the new Home app in iOS 10, it’s super-easy to set up and manage HomeKit-enabled devices. The app features integration with Control Center, 3D Touch quick actions, and as you’d expect from anything HomeKit related, support for Siri. Home app settings are synced via iCloud, so any iCloud-enabled iOS device running iOS 10 — an iPod touch, iPhone, or an iPad — can be used to control your Home. iOS 10 Home app video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac’s YouTube channel for more iOS 10 videos You’ll need at least one HomeKit-enabled product If you’ve never used a HomeKit product, then there is a slight learning curve associated with setting up devices and controlling them. Many home automation products compatible with HomeKit have their own standalone apps available in the App Store, but the advantage of using the Home app is that you can access and control all of your devices from one centralized location. You might still have to use standalone product apps to facilitate firmware updates or for other one-off situations, but most devices can be controlled solely from the Home app once configured. The $69.99 Philips Hue Starter kit is a great first HomeKit accessory Before you can begin using the Home app, you’ll need at least one HomeKit-certified product. Before today, I didn’t own any HomeKit-enabled products, but I went out and bought a Philips Hue Starter Kit for this tutorial. The Philips Hue Starter Kit costs $69.99, and comes with a Hue bridge and two white bulbs. Philips, as you’re probably aware of, is one of the leaders in the connected home device category, and sells a variety of lighting-related products. If you’re just beginning, the Starter Kit is a great entry-level product that will introduce you to several of the concepts that you’ll need to learn in order to get the most out of HomeKit. Other HomeKit-enabled accessories you might want to consider Name Price Image Philips Hue Lightstrip Plus $89.99 ecobee3 Smart Wi-Fi Thermostat $249.00 August Smart Lock $229.00 The HomeKit hierarchy There is a basic hierarchy when it comes to using the Home app. Keeping this hierarchy in mind will make it much easier to understand how the app functions. Home → Rooms → Accessories → (Groups, Scenes & Automation) To use the Home app, you must have at least one home, one room, and one accessory. Groups, scenes, and automation are optional, but they allow for broader control over your home. Using the Home app Once you’ve acquired your first HomeKit device, launch the Home app, and you’ll be greeted with a “Welcome Home” splash screen that explains some of the things that are possible with the Home app. Tap the Get Started button to proceed. The initial accessory setup process in the Home app is fairly straightforward By default, you’ll see a new “My Home” screen that allows you to start building your connected home by adding locks, lights, thermostats, etc. You can customize the name of your Home, change its background wallpaper, and much more. Before you get into customization, however, you should add your first HomeKit-enabled accessory. Tap the Add Accessory button, and the Home app will scan your Home network in an effort to find any HomeKit-enabled devices. Make sure that your iPhone is connected to your local network, and that your HomeKit-enabled device is as well. Using the 8-digit setup code to get started In my case, the Philips Hue bridge showed up under the list of available accessories. Once you tap the accessory, you’ll be prompted to enter the 8-digit setup code that appears on the device’s packaging or the accessory itself. The Home app features a handy camera frame that allows you to capture the HomeKit code without needing to manually type it in. After the HomeKit code is successfully submitted, the Home app will pair with the HomeKit-enabled device. Once the pairing is completed, you’ll be taken to the Add Accessory page to finish up the pairing process. With some standalone products, there may be a 1:1 relationship between the Home app and the product itself. However, since the Philips Hue includes the Hue bridge along with the lights, there is an extra layer of complexity added to the mix, which we’ll discuss in a bit. The Add Accessory page allows you to identify the accessory by means of the Identify Accessory button. Tapping this button will cause the Hue bridge’s push-link button to flash as a means of identification. Other HomeKit-enabled products will have different ways to go about identification, but the basic premise remains the same. You can rename your HomeKit accessories, by tapping in the name box and adding a name of your choice. Along with name customization, you can set a particular location for the accessory. The location (or Room) is designated area of your house. A few location suggestions, such as Bedroom, Dining Room, and Living Room, are provided by default, but users can add their own locations by tapping the Create New button. You’ll need to rely on Philips’ Hue app to complete the bridge setup The Include in Favorites option at the bottom of the Add Accessory page lets you designate a device as a preferred accessory. Favorites appear in Control Center and in the Home tab for quick and easy access. Since the Hue bridge isn’t something that we’ll need to interface with on a regular basis, I’m keeping the Include in Favorites switch disabled. Pairing Philips Hue lights inside the Philips Hue app In some cases, you’ll need to rely on the manufactures app for initial setup, firmware updates, etc. That’s the case with the Philips Hue Starter Pack. After connecting to the bridge, you’ll need to launch the Philips Hue app to pair the lights with the bridge. When you launch the Hue app for the first time, it’ll search for the new bridge. Once it’s found, tap the Set up button to proceed with setup. You’ll need to press the push-link button on the Hue bridge in order to connect. Once the bridge connects, tap the Accept button to finish the bridge setup with the Hue app. You’ll need to use the Hue app to finish the bridge setup and connect to your lights Now it’s time to pair the lights. On the Light setup page, tap the ‘+’ button in the bottom right-hand corner to add a new light. To find new lights, make sure that the lights are connected to a lamp and powered on. Tap the Search button to begin searching for connected lights.Since I already had three Philips Hue color lights from an old Hue setup, the Light setup page showed a total of five lights. You can always use the device manufacturer’s app to further customize the experience, but since this post is primarily about setting up and using the stock Home app, that’s all we’ll need to use the Hue app for. Back to the Home app Once the lights are paired with the Hue bridge, you can head back to the Home app, where you’ll see each light listed on the Home tab. All of my Philips Hue lights recognized by the Home app Customizing the Home tab Tap the Compass button in the upper left-hand corner of the Home tab to enter edit mode. Here you can rename your home, see available Home Hubs, invite others to control accessories in your home, change home wallpaper, add notes that all shared users can see, and remove the home. You can edit all sorts of elements that relate to each Home you have configured If you frequent more than one home featuring HomeKit-enabled devices, you can additional homes by tapping the Add Home button in the upper left-hand corner. This allows you to control HomeKit devices in multiple locations via the Home app. Adding a new accessory to a home To add a new accessory to a home, tap the ‘+’ button in the upper right-hand corner while on the Home tab, and then tap Add Accessory. When adding a new accessory, you’ll need to step back through the initial setup process. You can add a new accessory from the Home tab Customizing the Rooms tab Once an accessory is configured, a room is added by default. Like the Home tab, the Rooms tab can be customized, and like homes, multiple rooms can be added. A room should correspond to an actual place in your house or on your property. For example, if I have a Philips Hue light installed in my office, it would be wise for me to create a separate room called Office. Customizing and creating new rooms is an integral part of the Home app experience Once on the Rooms tab, tap the List button in the upper left-hand corner to edit the current room. There, you can edit the room name and change room wallpaper. It’s a good idea to take a picture of the room so that it can be quickly identified as you’re swiping through rooms in the Home app. While most people probably won’t be adding multiple homes, almost everyone will have two or more rooms. To add an additional room, tap the Add Room button in the upper-left hand corner. Once a new room is added, you can swipe between rooms while on the Rooms tab. Adding a new accessory to a room To add a new accessory to a room, tap the ‘+’ button in the upper right-hand corner, followed by Add Accessory. From there, it’s just a matter of going back through the initial setup process as covered in the beginning of this tutorial. You can also add a new accessory from the Rooms tab Customizing accessories To get the most out of the Home app, it’s important to organize your accessories in a way that makes sense. In most cases, you’ll want to create separate rooms for each physical room or location on your property that contains a HomeKit-enabled device. You’ll also want to make sure to give your accessory a name that makes it easy to identify. The Home app lets you customize accessory names, icons, and more To customize an accessory, long-press on an accessory tile and tap the Details button at the bottom of the screen. From the accessory customization screen, you can choose a new icon, rename your accessory, set its location, include in favorites, and include it in the status page on the main Home tab. The customize accessory page is also where you can go to Group an accessory with other HomeKit-enabled devices. Once an accessory is grouped, it is treated as a singular device. Controlling accessories While the Home app has lots of depth, its most important feature involves directly controlling the HomeKit-enabled accessories that you configure. The Home app features a lot of rich ways to go about controlling accessories in a very intuitive and fun way. Accessories can be controlled in one or more of the following ways: The Home app on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Apple Watch The Home section of Control Center on iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch 3D Touch Quick Actions on the Home app icon for 3D Touch-enabled devices Siri on iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch or Apple TV Automation via the Home app (requires always-on iPad or Apple TV) …via the Home app The most basic way to control an accessory is via the Home app itself. For example, if I wanted to toggle a light on or off, a simple tap on an accessory tile will do the job. For more fine-grained control, a long-press on the tile will reveal additional options. In the case of Philips Hue lighting, a long-press will reveal a dimmer interface that allows you to dim or brighten any given light. Dimming a Philips Hue light For accessories that support enhanced functionality, you’ll find additional options after long-pressing. For example, with my Hue colored lights, I see a Color button that allows me to customize the color of the Hue lights directly from the Home app interface. HomeKit accessories can also be controlled via the Apple Watch app on watchOS 3. The Home app comes with an Apple Watch complication, but the complication is just a shortcut to the Home app itself. Still, it might be a good idea to set up a complication or at least add the Home app to the Dock since you’ll experience faster load times by doing so. …via Control Center In iOS 10, the Home app has its very own section in Control Center — something that third-party apps can’t claim. You’ll find the Home section by opening Control Center and swiping all the way to the right. There, you’ll find quick access to all of your favorite HomeKit accessories. The big advantage to using the Control Center shortcut is that it can be accessed quickly from anywhere within iOS. A tap on an accessory tile will let users quickly toggle an accessory on or off without launching the Home app. A long-press on an accessory tile within Control Center provides extended functionality, such as the ability to dim a light or change its color. Along with accessing favorite accessories established in the Home app, the Home section of Control Center lets users selects favorite scenes. You can toggle between favorite accessories and favorite Scenes by tapping the Scenes/Accessories button in the upper right-hand corner of the Home section of Control Center. …via 3D Touch Quick Actions If you have a 3D Touch-enabled device (iPhone 6s or iPhone 7), then you can take advantage of 3D Touch Quick Action shortcuts on the Home app icon. Doing so will lend you quick access to favorite scenes. …via Siri Siri is one of the best ways to control HomeKit-enabled devices, because it can be performed from a variety of devices and from anywhere on the interface. Siri control works on the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch and 4th-generation Apple TV. Using Siri to turn off a light Just say something like “Turn on my desk light” to control your devices via Siri. You can even get more specific by asking Siri to turn your office light purple or to turn your porch light brightness down to 50%. Siri is, by far, the most flexible way of going about controlling your HomeKit devices, because it is smart enough to recognize individual HomeKit accessories, rooms, and scenes. Controlling HomeKit devices using the Apple TV and Siri Remote You can control many HomeKit devices from a 4th-generation Apple TV as well, except for locks. Locks can only be controlled via an iOS device, presumably due to potential security issues. …via Automation We’ve yet to touch on Automation in this walkthrough, but this option allows you to automate HomeKit device actions based on specific criteria like location or time. Automation requires a 4th-generation Apple TV, or an iPad running iOS 10 that’s always on and always home. We’ll talk more about Automation near the end of this walkthrough. Automate your devices by means of specialized criteria Scenes Scenes are custom actions that generally involve two or more HomeKit-enabled devices in your Home. For example, you can create a scene called “Good Night” that turns off all of the interior lights and turns on the porch light. Scenes are different from groups because each accessory in a scene can still be controlled individually, and you can invoke different actions for each device. How to create a new scene On the Home or Rooms tab, tap the ‘+’ button in the upper right-hand corner followed by Add Scene. You’ll then be taken to the New Scene page. Apple includes four suggested scenes to start with: Arrive Home Good Morning Good Night Leave Home Users can also create their own custom scenes, with a customized icon and name, by tapping Custom at the bottom of the New Scene page. You can also customize any of the canned suggested scenes. Scenes are a good way to fire off commands to multiple HomeKit accessories simultaneously Once you arrive at the New Scene page, you can rename the scene, change its icon, and add or remove accessories from a scene. Accessories added to a scene can be further customized for that particular scene. Once a scene is set up, shortcuts for it appear in various places, such as in Control Center Apple includes a handy Test This Scene button near the bottom of the scene details for testing how a scene reacts. If you’re happy with the scene that you create, you can choose to Show in Favorites, which is enabled by default. Scenes added to favorites will appear in Control Center, on the Home tab in the Home app, and in the 3D Touch Quick Action popup. Controlling accessories away from home You can only interface with HomeKit devices while on your home Wi-Fi network, unless you have a device that acts as an always-on hub. The 4th-generation Apple TV or an iPad running iOS 10 can both work as a hub. The 4th-generation Apple TV works well as a hub To use off-network remote access, you’ll need to make sure that your devices are signed in to the same iCloud account. If you desire to use your iPad as a Home Hub, you need to go to Settings → Home on your iPad to ensure that the Home Hub option is enabled. If you’re using an Apple TV as a Home Hub, ensure that you’re signed in with the same iCloud account. If you don’t own an Apple TV, you can use an iPad as a Home Hub You can see a list of your Home Hubs by opening the Home app, tapping the Home tab, and tapping the Compass button in the upper left-hand corner. Under the Home Hubs heading, you’ll see a list of available hubs and the current status of each. Check the status of Home Hubs via the Home app Automation If you have an eligible Apple TV or iPad established as a Home Hub, you can take advantage of the Home app’s Automation feature to automate accessories based on one of the follow four criteria: My location changes A time of day occurs An accessory is controlled A sensor detects something To create a new Automated task, tap the Automation tab in the bottom right-hand corner of the Home app, followed by Create new Automation. Select any of the four available automation types on the New Automation page to begin building your automated tasks. Building an automated task Once you select your desired automation trigger, you can select the scenes and accessories to automate. You can mix and match scenes with accessories, and further customize those accessories as you build the automated task. Once completed, tap the Done button in the upper right-hand corner, and your automated task will be saved. Completing the build of an automated task Using Automation, I made it so that my porch light would turn off at sunrise and on at sunset. I could even change the light’s brightness via the granular brightness controls. Obviously, that’s pretty basic when it comes to automation, but if you have a variety of HomeKit-enabled devices, automation can get significantly more complex. Inviting others to control your Home If you have a lot of HomeKit-enabled devices, it goes without saying that you’ll probably want to share access with others in your household. Inviting others to control your home can also be useful for guests, house-sitters, etc. As long as the person has an iOS device running iOS 10 with an iCloud account, they’ll be able to control designated aspects of your Home using their own device. Of course, people can also use the Apple TV’s Siri Remote to control various areas of the home without needing an invite. To invite people to control your home from an iOS device, tap the Compass button in the upper left-hand corner of the Home app’s Home tab. Under the People heading, tap the Invite button to open the Add People page. Any family members that are found in your contacts will be instantly displayed for quick access. You can also invite people to control your home by using the To: field at the top of the page. You can invite others to control the HomeKit accessories in your home Once you have all of the people who you wish to invite added, tap the Send Invite button in the upper right-hand corner to send the invitation. Invited users will receive a push notification alerting them about the invitation. Invited users will need to accept the invitation Once an invitation is accepted, the “Invitation Pending” text below the invited user will disappear, and they’ll gain access to accessories in the Home. By tapping on an invited person’s avatar, you can manage users permissions. User permissions consist of the ability to access the home from a remote location (off network) and to allow editing (adding or removing accessories, scenes, and other people.) You can easily revoke invites by tapping the Remove Person button at the bottom of the individual people pages. Conclusion HomeKit has been around for several years now, but I feel like iOS 10 is its first mainstream introduction. Because Apple is placing HomeKit front and center with the new stock Home app, and because there is a nice assortment of HomeKit devices now available, it’s the perfect time to get started with home automation. The Home app, while not the most intuitive app that Apple has made, is a really good app and handles most of the basic home automation needs. The app has room to grow with regard to it being an end-to-end buck-stops-here solution for HomeKit enabled devices, but it’s a wonderful start. I don’t like the fact that I had to bounce between two apps during the initial setup process of my Philips Hue Starter Kit, but once the initial configuration was finished, the Home app was able to meet nearly all of my needs. Your experience with the Home app will largely depend on the types of HomeKit devices you use, but it seems as if Apple is serious about making the Home app, and thus HomeKit in general, a significant part of iOS 10.

Photograph: ABC Steve Dow @dowsteve Friday 23 September 2016 18.12 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 26 October 2016 18.19 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close In the old courthouse in Geelong, 75km south-west of Melbourne, the Back to Back theatre troupe is rehearsing their new play, Lady Eats Apple. Mark Deans begins the read-through of act three. “Blue car,” he says and, as per the script, is upbraided that – being a man with Down syndrome – he has never driven a car. Lady Eats Apple will take the audience from a creation story into the contemporary realm when it is staged at the Melbourne festival next month, and next year at Sydney’s Carriageworks. Most of the actors would be perceived by the general community to have an intellectual disability. They write the scripts in part by drawing on improvisations based on their own lives; the story also explores euthanasia and gods destroyed by their own success. Back to Back’s earlier play, Ganesh versus the Third Reich, dealt with Nazism and eugenics; first performed in 2012, it won a Helpmann award for best play and toured internationally, including in the United Kingdom. Yet some argue Australia has overall been lagging behind the UK’s broader commitment to disability-led performing arts projects. Continuing the rehearsal, Simon Laherty and Sarah Mainwaring put on white overalls, on which script is handwritten in two marker colours. Each actor unfolds creases in the other’s clothing, to see their intimate text, but also as intentional tactile gestures. “I so want to touch you,” reads Laherty. “I want to kiss you on the mouth.” “I’d like to have a coffee, kiss and all that stuff,” responds Mainwaring. “When I’m sick, you can look after me.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sarah Mainwaring, left, and Simon Laherty peer into the world in Back to Back Theatre company’s Lady Eats Apple. Photograph: Jeff Busby Back to Back artistic director Bruce Gladwin has overseen the ground-breaking company since 1999; in 2012, he told me “fear of the unknown” kept many actors with perceived disabilities from being cast in theatre, film and television. Arts Access Australia had then just launched its Don’t Play Us, Pay Us campaign to get more such actors cast. Four years later, progress is slow with “authentic casting”. But as September’s two-day biannual Arts Activated conference got underway at Carriageworks this week – at which the majority of arts managers and artists presenting had perceived disabilities – wins were also being celebrated. In August, for instance, Kate Hood – a one-time Prisoner actress who was diagnosed in her 40s with hereditary spastic paraplegia and now uses a wheelchair – began filming a role in Neighbours. “At last,” wrote Hood on Facebook, “a major Australian TV series, which is seen globally, has taken the step of casting a disabled actor to play a disabled person.” Many argue for the social model of disability: that disability is caused by the way society is organised, rather than by a person’s point of perceived difference. How do the Back to Back actors feel about the world “disability”? Sarah Mainwaring speaks slowly because of a palsy: “As a performer and writer I accept that word, but I don’t let it stop me.” Simon Laherty explains that the scene in which he and Mainwaring are reading from one another’s clothing is about anyone being allowed to find love: “A person can’t tell you how to run your life,” he says, zeroing in on the key issue of individual autonomy. “You can make your own choices.” Bruce Gladwin says that, in 2016, there are probably more independent productions and films being developed around the world that embrace disability “almost like an aesthetic choice” and with “larger casts of actors with disabilities”. He continues: “But then, there’s still other examples: The Dressmaker, quite a big Australian feature film, had a character with an intellectual disability who was the lynchpin.” Gladwin is referring to Gyton Grantley, who played Barney McSwiney in Jocelyn Moorhouse’s film. One critic described Grantley as a “standout” but, says Gladwin, “that film would have been greatly improved if that role had been cast [instead] with an actor with an intellectual disability”. There are some really talented people [with disabilities] who could do a lot of these roles. Bruce Gladwin, artistic director of Back to Back theatre “Anybody should be able to play anything, and you wouldn’t want to put any limitations on anyone creatively,” Gladwin stresses, “but there are some really talented people [with disabilities] who could do a lot of these roles and it would be great if they were being considered.” The problem with impersonation On the ABC’s recent miniseries Barracuda, the Geelong artist, street performer and actor Chris Van Ingen, who has cerebral palsy, played a key role in the final episode. The main character, champion swimmer Danny (Elias Anton), forms a bond with the brain-injured Dennis (Van Ingen), who wrote that the experience of being on set as a real character, not just an extra, was phenomenal: “I have finally been able to show that characters with disability can and should be played by actors with disability.” “It’s fantastic that a person with cerebral palsy played that role,” says Arts Access Australia co-chief executive Emma Bennison, “but it was still a portrayal where that person was being helped and supported. I would love to start seeing content where a person with disability is the person providing the help. That’s when we’ll have really arrived.” Bennison lauds the casting too of Keith Robinson as jester Feste in a recent Belvoir Street theatre production of Twelfth Night, for which the actor’s Guillain-Barré syndrome and use of a wheelchair was irrelevant. There is now more discussion about authentic casting than when the Don’t Play Us, Pay Us campaign was launched in 2012, says Bennison, yet still a lack of specific screen content created by people with disability. “In the same way the ABC has an Indigenous film unit, we need the public broadcaster to [establish] a disability content unit. That’s how we’re really going to see significant change.” (An ABC spokeswoman said there are no plans to set up a disability unit but “investment does go into specific [related] projects”.) At the Arts Activated conference this week, the actor Kate Hood told the audience that while about 18% of Australians have a disability, probably only about 4% of characters on stage and screen are portrayed with a disability. She called for the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance’s actors equity division to institute a quota on artists with disabilities; just as it was unacceptable to “black up” racially for a role, she said, able-bodied actors should no longer be able to “crip up” as disabled. Freaks: ‘A fleeting glimpse of the Old Weird America’ Read more ABC TV’s head of arts, Mandy Chang, responded at the conference that the 18% was “ringing in my ears”; she agreed with and would push for such quotas, saying the ABC’s “doors are open”, but, she admitted, “people [within the national broadcaster] don’t like [quotas]”. Screen NSW, meanwhile, has launched Screenability NSW, which includes an internship program and “upcoming” plans for a long-term job placement scheme in technical and creative areas of screen production. The comedian Tim Ferguson, cowriter and codirector of the new Australian feature film Spin Out, who has multiple sclerosis, lauded the initiative as “smart and dynamic”. Don’t play us, pay us Sarah Houbolt is a strategic projects manager with Accessible Arts in Sydney and convenor of the Arts Activated conference. She is also a circus and physical theatre performer, and is preparing to debut her one-woman show in Brisbane in November, playing KooKoo the Bird Girl: a character originally created by the actor Minnie Woolsey in Freaks, the 1932 Tod Browning film that used actors with disabilities as sideshow performers and which was banned in many countries for 30 years. Houbolt, who is legally blind and has the rare Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, shows me a picture of Woolsey, born in 1880, who in some accounts was rescued from a mental asylum. “I have a wig on at the moment but, if you Google images of me, you’ll be able to see the uncanny resemblance.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The actor and disability arts advocate Sarah Houbolt as KooKoo the Bird Girl. Photograph: Sarah Louise Cheesmur The film Freaks, says Houbolt, has been reclaimed by performers with disability. “The reason the film was banned is because people with disability had lead roles and speaking roles at a time that they shouldn’t have, so it was rebellious,” she says. “The film has a lot of positive power. It’s emancipating; it’s empowering.” Drawing on her strong knowledge of the art history of disability, Houbolt says there have been some important performances by actors with disability on screen, from Freaks, to Britain’s Cast Offs, to season four of the US American Horror Story: Freak Show: a fact that is often not known or celebrated enough. “So we’re not knocking at a closed door,” she says. “We’re going, ‘You’ve got to keep that door open. That door is already open; how dare you shut it in our face’.” We’re not knocking at a closed door. We’re going, 'You’ve got to keep that door open. How dare you shut it in our face.' Sarah Houbolt, actor and disability arts advocate Houbolt says the Don’t Play Us, Pay Us campaign is “appropriate” because “there are enough artists and performers and jobbing actors with disability to play those roles. If you’re casting for a tall blond, you cast for a tall blond; if you cast for someone who uses a wheelchair, you look for a person in a wheelchair. It makes perfect sense. It’s part of the body”. Dance and disability Who can be a dancer? Marc Brew was challenged by that question the day his life changed. Brew had trained with the Australian Ballet School in Melbourne. “My body was my life,” the former country boy from NSW told the Arts Activated conference at Carriageworks in Sydney in his keynote address: “I was trained to believe a dancer had to be on two legs.” Then, at age 20, he was in a car in Victoria with a group of friends when a drunk driver travelling on the wrong side of the road crashed into their vehicle head-on. Brew suffered massive internal injuries. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Marc Brew in For Now, I Am in London in March. Brew is an Australian dancer who moved to the UK 17 years ago, where he found greater support of dancers with disabilities than in Australia. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian Seventeen years ago, the idea of people with disabilities being dancers was poorly understood in Australia, Brew told the conference. So he left for the UK, where he found greater support. Today, as artistic director of the Marc Brew Company in Glasgow, he choreographs as well as performs in his own works. Scotland’s The Herald gave five stars to Brew’s latest show, MayBe, staged in Glasgow last week. “Access can be embedded in the creative process, rather than an afterthought,” Brew told his audience – meaning that access for his wheelchair becomes part of his act. Brew, who will be presenting a masterclass in Brisbane during his return visit to Australia, is encouraged that the country finally seems to be making progress in presenting work for dancers with disabilities. Sydney’s Carriageworks, for instance, has committed to a national strategy called New Normal, which is commissioning 10 new works by artists with disability over three years. For one, staged in August, Force Majeure teamed with Dance Integrated Australia to present Off the Record, with some dancers and actors with perceived disabilities – from deafness to Tourette to Down syndrome – which went largely unstated in the piece. Dance Integrated Australia’s founder and creative director, Philip Channells, says the company provides programs such as Corner Dance Lab and the Beyond Technique Residency to help people with physical, sensorial and mobility impairment attain the level of training that dancers who don’t have a disability can already access. “With Off the Record, we weren’t necessarily interested in making a statement about disability; we were wanting to challenge people’s perceptions of society,” says Channells. He argues disability is a “sort-of made-up word” that “doesn’t really exist: it’s our social attitude towards people who live differently which makes things difficult and challenging”. 'Disability' doesn't really exist; it’s our attitude towards people who live differently which makes things difficult. Philip Channells, creative director of Dance Integrated Australia Australian arts companies often fail to budget for access needs for performers with disabilities, says Channells, and there is still a lack of educational opportunities for performers with disabilities. He has also worked in the UK and says Australia is “about 20 years behind” with disability-led performance work. In dance, for instance, the UK has been developing the sector “for decades”, he says, citing the work of companies Stopgap, Candoco and Graeae among about 40 UK dance companies working with performers with disabilities – compared with a “handful” in Australia. He highlights the UK’s Unlimited festival, which was set up in London about the time of the Paralympics in 2012 to present work by artists with disabilities, and which is now largely funded through to 2020, as “extraordinary”. In Off The Record, the actor and theatre interpreter Alex Jones, who was born deaf, mostly used sign language – “my first language” – but later recited in speech a personal poem displayed on the wall. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘It’s about playing on the audience belief, and stereotypes’: Alex Jones with Jana Castillo in Off the Record. Photograph: Gregory Lorenzutti “That kind of threw people off, because a lot of people didn’t know that I could speak,” Jones says, lipreading our interview over the kitchen table at his Sydney home. “So, it’s about playing on the audience belief, and stereotypes – often people think deaf people can’t speak; like, deaf and dumb.” Born in Detroit and having trained for four years at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, Jones speaks in an Australian accent; he has lived here since being offered a role by the Melbourne-based Australian Theatre of the Deaf in 1997 and toured the country for a theatre-in-education program for two years. In 2001-02, Jones portrayed the character Lyle Slater in TV drama All Saints, before cofounding a hearing caption company. Today, he works for the National Disability Insurance Agency, administering the National Disability Insurance Scheme, a role that excites him for its “huge transformational opportunity” for people with disabilities. His past screen work was fun too but saw him “typecast” as the “poor deaf guy” character: “I’m still an actor but I don’t work professionally [at the moment] because of the inadequate amount of work available out there,” he says. There needs to be some type of quotas or standardised commitment from organisations to hire people with disabilities. Alex Jones, actor, theatre interpreter and NDIS administrator Jones thinks it would be fantastic if the ABC set up a content unit led by people with disabilities. “This is the Australian broadcaster and they have the responsibility to deliver and meet the needs of the community, knowing that people with disability are already disadvantaged [when it comes to] getting work.” Jones also believes that broader Australian society needs to accept and be willing to work with people with differences. He knows he was lucky to get a scholarship to study acting at NYU, which provided interpreters for his learning. “I’m not a big fan of quotas but I feel there needs to be some type of quotas or standardised commitment from organisations to hire people with disabilities,” he says. “Not only that, people with disability ought to take the responsibility to go and study, learn, work together, collaborate, go to conferences. “It’s a two-way street: it’s not always about what society and the arts community need to do for us but it’s also about how we need to show them.” • Lady Eats Apple premieres at the Hamer Hall, Melbourne on 8 October • Steve Dow travelled to Geelong with the assistance of the Melbourne festival More features Topics Disability Theatre Dance Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

 A high-level editor at a top tech blog secretly worked for Apple for months Biz Carson Sep. 23, 2016, 5:59 PM 10,590 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chris ZieglerBehance A deputy editor at The Verge took a job at Apple while still employed at the tech blog, according to a note posted by The Verge's editor-in-chief Nilay Patel.  On Friday, the news organization revealed that Chris Ziegler, a founding member of The Verge, had been working for Apple since July, but didn't tell anyone about his dual employment. "Obviously having an Apple employee on The Verge staff is a conflict of interest," Patel acknowledged in the note. Ziegler had actively worked on stories throughout July while also employed by Apple. After he fell silent in August, The Verge tried to get in touch with him since they were "in the dark and concerned for Chris". It wasn't until early September that The Verge verified that Ziegler had been employed at Apple the whole time and promptly terminated his employment from The Verge and parent media company, Vox, the same day. The Verge says an independent editorial review found it "did not have any impact on editorial decisions or journalism produced at The Verge or elsewhere in Vox Media." "Chris did not attempt to steer any coverage towards or away from Apple, and any particular decisions he helped make had the same outcomes they would have had absent his involvement," the editor's note reads.  During Ziegler's time at The Verge, he wrote primarily about cutting-edge car technology, including rumors about the Apple Car. His last post on the site about BMW's self-driving car efforts is dated July 1.  Vox Media did not respond to questions regarding how far back the editorial review went, how it was discovered he worked at Apple, or why he was kept on payroll after not showing up for work. Instead, the company's statement pledged to "continue to be transparent" if new information is discovered: "Chris is no longer an employee of The Verge or Vox Media. Chris accepted a position with Apple, stopped communicating with The Verge's leadership, and his employment at The Verge was terminated. Vox Media's editorial director Lockhart Steele conducted an internal review of this conflict of interest, and after a thorough investigation, it was determined that there was no impact on editorial decisions or journalism produced at The Verge or elsewhere in Vox Media. We've shared details about this situation with The Verge's audience and will continue to be transparent should any new information come to light." Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple blogger John Gruber said his sources cannot find Ziegler in the company directory, so it's unclear whether he remains employed by Apple at this time.

(update: Lit Motors too) Acquiring the British car icon would support Apple's automotive ambitions, but raise tough questions. Jon Fingas , @jonfingas 09.21.16 in Transportation Comments 1505 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Drew Phillips Apple's automotive plans might not be as grand as they used to be, but that isn't ruling out some bold moves. Financial Times sources claim that Apple is considering a major stake in supercar maker McLaren, whether it's a "strategic investment" or a full-blown acquisition. It's not certain what Apple's exact strategy would be with this deal, but it's reportedly eyeing McLaren for its engineering talent, technology and patents. And while there's no guarantee that the talks will lead anywhere, the tipsters say they started several months ago -- this isn't just a casual fling, if true. Neither Apple nor McLaren is commenting on the rumor. A McLaren acquisition would seem odd at first blush. This is a company focused almost exclusively on high-end cars and the automotive tech to match, such as Formula 1. An 'entry level' ride like the 570GT you see above starts at $201,450, which doesn't really dovetail with Apple's premium-mass-market strategy. However, it makes sense for a tech company looking for a partner with extensive technical know-how. McLaren is one of the pioneers of advanced material uses in cars (the F1 was the first road car to use a carbon fiber monocoque chassis), and it embraces everything from touchscreen controls to hybrid electric powertrains (like that in the P1). Even if Apple doesn't make a complete car, McLaren could help it nail the fundamentals of in-car tech. A complete buyout would raise questions, though. What would happen to McLaren's car range? Would it follow in Porsche's footsteps and diversify beyond pure sports cars, or even drop self-made cars entirely? And would Apple's Jony Ive have to give up his Aston Martins and Bentleys? Tim Cook and company can certainly afford to buy McLaren (its estimated worth tops out at $1.9 billion), but they'd have to make some difficult decisions about their involvement in the car industry. Update: New York Times sources not only echo the McLaren rumor, but add that Apple is reportedly talking about an acquisition with Lit Motors, best known for a self-balancing electric motorcycle. Apple has already taken on "several" of Lit Motors' employees, so this would be the next logical step. McLaren, meanwhile, tells the NYT that it's "not in discussion" with Apple regarding an investment. Take the rumors with a grain of salt, then. Still, it's hard to rule out acquisition talks when contacts for two major news outlets are saying that something is afoot.

The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

With the IOS 10 mobile operating system upgrade, Apple has promised us that its five-year-old personal digital assistant Siri would be better than ever, and would expand beyond the core Apple apps to also work with third-party apps like LinkedIn, Uber and Pinterest.  Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 109.95 -0.04 -0.04% Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN ▼ 404.56 -15.52 -3.69% Sanofi SA SNYNF ▼ 81.85 -0.95 -1.15% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 756.40 +9.91 +1.33% The results of my tests is that Siri is slightly improved, but only if you take the time to enunciate correctly and slowly, and teach the voice-activated assistant what you want. But that doesn't always work, as we found out when I tried, over and over again to find that nearby Indian restaurant — and Siri sent me instead to a place in San Jose, Calif., a brisk six-hour drive away. When I comparison shopped with Google's way superior "OK Google," voice assistant on a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Google got it right on the first try. After announcing the new Siri at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, Apple senior vice-president Craig Federighi said that using Siri would now be "the quickest path to getting something done....we want to make that possible." A lofty goal, but it's certainly not there yet.  On Apple's Siri webpage, the company touts many things Siri can do, so I decided to put it to the test, and tried each and every category. Here's a sampling: --Movie listings: "What movies are playing today," is the suggested query. When I asked, the results were a cross-section of A-listers ("Snowden" and "Sully") and others like "Bridget Jones's Baby" and "Mr. Church," along with a roster of six movie theaters within the general area of the USA TODAY Los Angeles offices. Then I tried to expand to showtimes at my local movie theater, asking for the showtimes for "Sully" at the Arclight Cinemas in El Segundo. "I don't see any movies matching "Sally," was Siri's response. I asked over and over again, but it just couldn't get Sully. (If interested, it's playing tonight at 7:15 and 9:50.) Score: C.  --Photos: Apple touts how Siri can now find specific photos of people and places in the iPhone Photos app. With over 100 photos of my friends Michelle and Jennifer, both of whom are clearly labeled in Apple Photos on the iPhone, I asked Siri to pull them up. It located Michelle, but not Jennifer.  I also asked Siri to find "my" photos of my hometown, Manhattan Beach. Siri picked up a few, but not key ones you'd expect, like pictures of the Pier, ocean waves and such, but instead photos taken in my home.  The key to photo requests is inserting the word "my." Without "my" Siri responds with the dreaded, "Here are some photos I found on the Web," which of course wasn't what I was looking for. Score: C. --Hail a car: "Hey Siri, get me an Uber."  Here I truly was saved from having to unlock the iPhone home screen, locate the app and click my location. Siri asked me what kind of car service I wanted. Several choices were offered, and when I dictated "Uber X," she got it, and offered to have a car to me in 2 minutes. The feature did what it was supposed to do. Score: A.  --Read your latest e-mail. I asked her to read my latest e-mail and Siri responded by reading it aloud. But what the assistant couldn't do is go further, to other recent "e-mails." Had I been driving, I would have wanted to hear all the new ones. For text messages Siri offered a wider selection. Score: B. --Work with apps. You can now dictate a message on LinkedIn and send money on Venmo . Both worked, but it took a while to train Siri. I had to repeat people's names several times, and Siri always got them wrong. When I finally opened the apps, highlighted their names and then tried again, it got it. And continued to get it, consistently. Score: B+. --Restaurants: The command follow this syntax:  "Find me a table for four in Chicago."  . When I tried it, using "Santa Monica," instead of Chicago, (my editors prefer I work local) it asked me for the time of the reservation, 7 p.m. I chose, and then it said none of the suggestions were taking reservations at this time. But Siri threw out a bunch of random restaurants to consider — Sushi, Mexican, American fare — which is fine, but that wasn't the idea. I wanted a reservation. When I tried to isolate the restaurant of my choice, and location, Siri said it was "afraid I can't book that right now," and suggested two other eateries. Maddening! Score: D.  With the new tools for Siri, Apple is competing with Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon to provide state of the art voice search and assistant tools. Beyond the apps, Apple also has brought Siri to Macintosh computers, where it's now part of the MAC OS Sierra operating system upgrade. But, as my colleague Ed Baig points out, it's not faring much better there either.  Speaking of Ed, I asked Siri to call him, but Siri said I didn't have his contact information in the iPhone and thus couldn't make the call. Not true! I tried again, this time requesting "Ed....Baig" slowly instead of "EdBaig," and voila, the call went through.  So Siri, it's great when you finally get things right, but after five years of trying to assist us, really, you should be way more efficient by now. Google gets it right most of the time on Android phones, why can't you? App developers I've spoken with over the past months told me they believed that with their involvement, they would come up with new ways and fixes for Siri that Apple never dreamed of.  Let's hope they're right. Hey Siri, we'll check back in with you in a few months for a status update.  Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham and listen to the daily #TalkingTech podcast on Stitcher and iTunes.

For die hard Apple fans, that’s definitely going to be the case, but for others, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant’s Series 2 wearable, coupled with watchOS 3, is the smartwatch that should have been released back in 2015. Similar to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the Apple Watch Series 2 looks nearly identical to its predecessor in terms of design. It’s worth noting that Apple’s new watch is actually is 1mm thicker than its older brother, a shift that was made to accommodate the wearable’s larger battery. Other often-requested features have also been added to the Apple Watch, including a faster processor, water resistance and an on-board GPS. If you were expecting a total refresh, however, you’ll be disappointed in the Series 2. Love it or hate it, Apple has stuck with the square 38mm and 42mm variants of the Apple Watch, right down to colour and strap variants, though there is a new ultra-expensive ceramic option for those with an insane amount of expendable income. Those hoping for a rounded Apple Watch that looks more closely to Motorola’s Moto 360, the current king of Android Wear Land, were likely hoping for a considerable revamp. In some ways, the Apple Watch Series 2 is actually Apple admitting that it didn’t nail everything about the first-generation device in terms of software and overall direction — this is something the tech giant rarely does — switching the wearable’s main focus from being a high-end fashion accessory, to placing a greater emphasis on fitness. Not afraid to get wet Given the fact that most standard watches feature some level of water resistance, it was seen by many, including myself, as a strange move that the first-generation Apple Watch couldn’t withstand water. Though, in the company’s defense, other than Pebble’s devices (excluding the Time Round), most premium smartwatches still lack the feature. The Apple Watch Series 2 is capable of being submerged in up to 50 meters of water, making it ideal for users who want to track their physical activity while swimming. I wore the watch on two occasions while swimming and found it worked fine when I was back on dry land. In order to blast unwanted water out of the Series 2 after it’s been submerged, Apple has developed a mechanism that sends water flying out of its speaker — an innovative feature, but one I found difficult to locate at first. To activate the feature you first need to swipe up from the bottom of the display. Another option is to navigate to the Activity app and then set swimming as your exercise. You’re then able to put the Apple Watch in swim mode and when you exit this activity, there’s an option to turn on the feature by spinning the digital crown’s knob. While neither of these methods are particularly difficult, it would have made more sense for Apple to include an automatic prompt that expels water from the Series 2. Also, while making liquid shoot out of the wearable is undeniably cool, shaking the watch also accomplishes basically the same thing. Still not a must-have device What hasn’t changed about the Apple Watch Series 2, however, is the fact that it’s still not a must-have device, though the same can be said about all smartwatches. While some still expect smartwatches to replace their smartphone completely, it’s likely that’s never going to happen, especially since Apple has reportedly dropped the concept of a 3G Apple Watch not tethered to the iPhone. WatchOS 3 takes many steps forward in terms of making the Series 2 a more independent device, but it still needs to be tethered to an iPhone to access most of its features. What the Apple Watch is, however, is a great companion device designed to triage notifications and run simple apps, and that has not changed with the Series 2; it’s only got better, especially when it comes to to speed. Apple’s wearable remains the top smartwatch on the market right now and that position is reaffirmed with the Series 2. watchOS 3 lives up to Apple’s lofty claims Despite its similar exterior, Apple has improved the Apple Watch’s internals considerably. Apple claims the Apple Watch Series 2 is 50 percent more powerful than the Series 1 thanks to a new dual-core processor and GPU that allows for more advanced graphics processing. In my few weeks with the watch, Apple’s claims seem to accurate, though this speed boost is also the result of watchOS 3, an almost complete revamp of the wearable’s user interface. The main shift present in watchOS 3 most people will instantly notice is that the new Dock that lets users to place the 10 apps they use most frequently in a state that allows them to launch almost instantly. Accessing apps located in the Dock is also simple and just requires a quick tap on the Apple Watch’s side button, the same input that once navigated to the favourite contacts screen in watchOS and watchOS 2. Furthermore, watchOS 3 adds a new breathe feature that encourages the wearer to take a few moments out of their day to meditate and reflect. While this sounds silly at first, as someone who works in what is often a high stress industry, I quickly grew to value these few moments of reprieve. It may sound ridiculous that a wearable needs to remind you to take a break sometimes, but in the bustle of a busy work day, sometimes a little nudge is helpful and necessary. Messaging has also been improved considerably in the latest version of Apple’s wearable operating system. Users are now able to quickly reply to texts by tapping twice in succession. New animated stickers and full-screen effects have also been added to the mix. Users are even able to create custom replies and send quick scribbles in a more intuitive way than what was featured in Apple’s last wearable operating system. Overall watchOS 3 is a monumental leap forward for the Apple Watch. It’s also worth noting that watchOS 3 speeds up the original Apple Watch’s app load time considerable as well, though some apps, mainly third-party ones, still take more time to load than most people will find acceptable. While third-party apps also take slightly longer to load with the Series 2 and watchOS 3, the speed issue is less noticeable with apps launching considerably faster. Runners rejoice, GPS is here One of the most requested features in the original Apple Watch is an on-board GPS. With the first generation wearable, in order to track runs and other kinds of exercise that requires the recording of precise movement, users had to bring along their tethered iPhone. With the Series 2 that’s no longer an issue thanks to the wearable’s built-in GPS, though it’s important to note that continuous GPS use limits battery life to about five hours. Your route isn’t visible on the watch in real time, but when you return home, the recorded data will sync with your iPhone. I’m no runner, but the few times I tried this feature I found it liberating; it’s great to leave your iPhone at home and forget about the connected world while exercising. Since the Series 2 is waterproof, water sports enthusiasts can also easily track their workout activity as well via built-in GPS. If you’re looking for just a fitness tracker, there are cheaper devices from other manufacturers that feature built-in GPS, with FitBit’s products being the most notable examples. But, if you’re looking for a device that is both a fitness tracker and a smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 2 is now a significantly more appealing option. Despite the Series 2’s larger battery, however, overall power still measures in at roughly a day due to the watch’s new on-board GPS. For some this will likely be a monumental disappointment. I, however, have never had an issue with plugging in my Apple Watch over night to charge, so the trade off between battery life and the addition of an on-board GPS, makes sense. This definitely won’t be the case for everyone though. All the ‘nits’ The Series 2’s new OLED tech results in the Apple Watch’s display being the “brightest display apple has ever shipped on any product,” measuring in at 1,000 nits of brightness and a level that is almost the same as high-dynamic range (HDR) televisions. Will the average person notice a considerable difference though? Probably not. In my experience, the brighter display only becomes apparent under specific lighting conditions. For example, at night the Series 2’s display looks significantly more vibrant than the screen in its predecessor, and the same can be said about direct sunlight. When indoors and under normal lighting, even with both the Series 1 and Series 2 Apple Watch set to maximum brightness, I found the difference negligible. A welcome companion The Apple Watch was always a stylish, feature-rich wearable, but with Series 2, Apple has fixed many of the major issues with the first-generation device, increasing its performance considerably. Current Apple Watch owners, however, can likely sit this one out given the massive improvements present in watchOS 3. Just download the software update rather than purchase an entirely new device because despite the Apple Watch’s various hardware upgrades, none of them warrant purchasing an an entirely new smartwatch. Those sitting on the fence, however, waiting for the second generation of the company’s wearable can now confidently pick up the smartwatch knowing it’s a solid device. Croc Ography Still an ugly squarish watch. Patrick O’Rourke I think that comes down to personal preference. I know plenty of people who prefer the square look of the Apple Watch to the circle of a traditional watch. It’s Me That, and the fact that geometry says round is inferior for most things you do on a smart “watch” other than telling time. Sure it tells time, but it’s also used for reading messages and viewing pics and using apps and displaying data. We don’t have round phones or TVs for a reason. Calling it a “smart watch” doesn’t make it the same as an analog watch. Traditional watches and clocks are usually round because that works best for a rotary dial, gear driven analog system. Pretending a smart watch is a traditional watch by forcing it to be round is like making TVs round because they tell time and should therefore be shaped like a wall clock (could call it a smart clock). Jon Duke I haven’t been here in months (here meaning the comment section) and yet, you still use the same broken record as month ago. It’s a watch. Even Apple will tell you. It should be round. The amount of people wearing it because it’s a watch is higher than people wearing it cause it’s a computer on a diet. The “smart” features are just an extra to he watch being a watch. Not the other around. Of course, I’m talking about the general population, not the niche people on here who actually fully uses the smart functions. It’s Me Nope. Most people buy smart watches for the “smart” part. If they wanted the watch, they’d probably buy, I don’t know, maybe a watch. There are some really nice watches out there. The fact that it’s a watch is secondary. In fact most of the people I know that wear any kind of smart watch had mostly given up watches long ago. They were looking to start wearing a watch again. They were attracted to wearing a smart device. It just happens to also tell time. Philosoraptor I didn’t want a smartwatch – I wanted a good watch with smart functions. Got the Garmin fenix 3 after the Apple Watch. Prefer the round face and battery life on GPS. It’s Me And that’s fine. It’s simply personal preference at that point, for both form and function. Nothing wrong with that. But to say that it (and I suppose all smart watches) should be round just because they tell time is a bit arrogant. Also a bit ignorant since the are squarish traditional watches that work and look just fine. Croc Ography This for people who do not know is an extremely beautiful and functional watch. Now this is a watch worth reviewing. It is unfortunate that this type of watch gets no love from these type of blogs. Jon Duke Sure. Your people do it so the whole world does. I’ve heard this argument hundreds of times. It’s Me Of course you have Jon. You made the statement yourself a few days ago. Duh. But you’re also saying they ought to handicap function for the sake of form…just so it can remind you of a traditional watch more. Jon Duke Let’s agree to disagree. Brad Fortin “It’s a watch. Even Apple will tell you.” People call it that, a smart “watch”, just like people still call them smart “phones”, but thinking of a smart watch as a regular watch with a few extra features is akin to thinking of a car as a mechanical horse with a few extra features. Smart “watches” are really wrist-computers that conveniently tell time, like how smart “phones” are really pocket-computers that have the ability to make phone calls. Telling time is only one of its many functions, and 99% of the rest of the functionality is better served by a square display. Many of the watch faces themselves are better served by the square display considering they display more information than any mechanical watch ever could. GeoInSD True. For years, I have found it funny that smartphones are thought of as phones since its function as a phone is almost an incidental feature. Jon Duke Fair comparison. Smanny Once again you are here trying to push your view that a round smart watch is inferior to a square smart watch. However you are forgetting that unlike smart phones which are less of a fashion statement and can easily be hidden, or covered with a case. Smart watches are on your wrist for everyone to see, and are not covered with a case. Many would love a smart watch, but don’t want a computer screen stuck on their wrist. Lots of people want the smart watch to look inconspicuous, or look like a regular watch. So believe it or not watches and smart watches are more of a fashion statement than smartphones ever were. Now putting fashion aside. Now let’s get to the interface and functionality. Shall we. If a watch OS is designed to take advantage of either a round or square watch face, then there goes your theory of a round watch face being inferior to a square watch face. For instance with Android Wear they said we want people to have their data quickly and easily with very little touching as much as possible. If you want to use a touch screen, then use your phone more. Don’t get me wrong you can still use the touch screen on Android Wear, but most things can also be controlled with wrist gestures or your voice. The Apple watch OS has no wrist gestures or hand gestures to control messages or viewing data on the little displays. They have a dial that you have to use your other hand and fingers to turn. You want to run an app including 3rd party apps on Android Wear, then you can tap the screen and say “open your app name”. You can substitute open with either start or run. If you don’t want to touch anything, then add in front “OK Google,”, then say “run my app”. Or say a number of different things like “show my steps”, or heart rate, current temperature, and many more things to say. Sure many like you its_me will like to poke around on Apples round icon menu that is arranged in a circle to run the apps. Let’s get real its_me you like to bring up other things like TVs, or computer displays and say they are not round, but also forget that they also don’t sit on your wrist. Also most TVs you cannot talk to them as well, nor do they have a touch screen. So stop bringing up stupid stuff to compare to smart Watches. Clearly you never used or worked with other smart watch platforms. If all you know is Apples square smart watch, then sure it’s the best for you. However to say it’s the best on the market without fully trying others. Then that is stupid on anyone’s part. It’s Me I take it from your long, rambling, nonsensical rant two thins. (A) you are drunk or head injured. (B) you have no experience in UI or UX development because you seem to confuse and conflate many aspects. Thanks smanny, you’re always good for a laugh. Smanny You talk about UI and UX not being related or that one cannot help the other out. If you think that, then you are really blind, and clearly once again are showing the world how ignorant you really are. So I guess Apple should get rid of 3D touch then? It certainly is not needed, and users can still get their work done without using 3D touch, correct? However it helps out with the User experience. Does it not? Now the same can be said with wrist or hand gestures, and voice with some smart watch platforms, like Android Wear. But if you don’t know this, then spouting off nonsense like you always do, once again makes you look ignorant. I don’t know why you are so pressed to get the news out that round watches suck, and that they are inferior. But that is your view, and thankful the vast majority would never agree to such a closed an inferior mind such as yours. It’s Me WTF? Seriously, are you drunk? You are making no sense. I want to believe you aren’t brain damaged, so please tell me you are drunk. What do gestures have to do with whether round is inferior as a shape for a display? What does 3D touch have to do with it? How do those make round better for anything but a dial? You say things like “If a watch OS is designed to take advantage of either a round or square watch face, then there goes your theory of a round watch face being inferior to a square watch face.” as though you honestly think that makes a difference. Any UI can be made to work with a round display. Or a triangular display. Or an oval display. DUH. Duh. Duh. That doesn’t make any of those better than a square shape. That means they can work, not that they work better. Or you bring up fashion, as though that forgives handicapping function. That is exactly what form over function means you monkey. Go back to bed. Your stupidity is really starting to get annoying. FlamesFan89 For me, square, round, or pyramid shaped, I really don’t care, this watch is ugly. It isn’t ugly because it is square, it is ugly because it is ugly. JD Still the best wearable on the market. – True Still not a must have – True. This is unfortunately the state of wearables there’s just not compelling reason still. The biggest push is fitness and it’s still not enough. Side note I still get how freaking thick it is and they actually made it thicker. It looks terrible on most people’s wrists, looks like Dick Tracey’s communicator watch Spencer Navarra-Chew “The Best Wearable”? I beg to differ. While I do think the Apple watch is generally superior to Android watches, it looses a lot of its appeal if your primary device isn’t also from Apple. Also, personally I prefer battery life over unnecessary features, so I’m patiently awaiting my third generation Pebble, while also looking at the latest offering from Withings. I’m also really fond of my my Moto Hint. It too is a wearable, and brings a lot to the table (although I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of the Sony Ear as a potential replacement). I think it’s fair to say: “The best wearable for people using iOS who want a high-powered watch” Patrick O’Rourke I’m a big fan of the Pebble and still use the Time Round on a daily basis. The watch is great as a notification device, but I haven’t found it useful for more than that because the app ecosystem is lacklustre. Spencer Navarra-Chew Sure, I agree. My point is that some folks want a simpler device like a Pebble, Withings or even Skagen device. Simpler does not automatically mean it’s worse, especially when you factor in size, battery life and an always on screen. JD True for the most part. I forget most people only use one ecosystem day to day. The Apple Watch only works with iOS but even so its still leaps and bounds above android. It’s Me Someone might argue that a Ferrari is the best sports car for people with money. Even for those without money, it would still be fine for them to claim it’s the best sportscar. Just because it has a limited audience doesn’t diminish whether someone feels it’s the best. If Apple opened up the watch to work with a android, do you think Spencer wouldn’t still complain about the review title? iOS only seems like a convenient excuse. iPhones are available to everyone. If Patrick called it the best smartphone, the same people would be complaining. TrickyDickie What is it with you Apple fans and car analogies? You always rate Apple up there with the likes of Ferrari, when in fact they are far from it. The top car manufacturers use quality components that justify the price. Apple don’t. It’s Me Wow. So they don’t teach analogy in schools anymore? Like at all? Do they teach anything? TrickyDickie Perhaps they do, but you Apple fans always put your iToys up there with the best, which isn’t true in reality. It’s Me I see. So you’re not sure. That helps explain your continued confusion. If you look up the mean of analogy it might help, but if not I guess it might not only be a lack of education at fault. TrickyDickie And there is the typical fanboy response to criticism of Apple… It’s Me Nope. Just pointing out stupidity. You weren’t criticizing Apple really, you were demonstrating a clear inability to understand analogy. I never compared Ferrari, I used them only as an example of limited markets not diminishing the standing of a product. Duh. Could have used bananas or toothbrushes or bricks as market analogies but I don’t think that would have helped it. It went right over your head. Whoosh. So you kneejerked some response that was based on a lack understanding. That deserved to be pointed out. It sucks that such simple concepts have to repeatedly explained to you. Life is going to be tough for you when you grow up, I think. TrickyDickie Whatever you say lol It’s Me Whoosh. p_lindsay No, he’s totally correct. You just fully eluded to Apple being the “Ferrari” of tech. It’s Me “Eluded”? Do they even have schools anymore? First you both don’t understand analogy or how it’s used. Now we’re eluding. p_lindsay Well you apparently don’t know what eludid means so I guess your question is valid. It’s Me Unfortunately, I do know what “eluded” means (not sure about eludid). Though the meaning seems to have eluded you. LOL Spencer Navarra-Chew I think you meant ALLUDED… disqus_nKCeshLGXf You’re giving him far too much credit. School? C’mon. Brad Fortin Car analogies tend to be easy to understand due to their ubiquity and relative simplicity. Which components of Apple’s do you think aren’t quality components? The Apple Watch, for example, is manufactured with largely the same process, the same precision, and the same quality metals and materials as a Rolex. The iPhone, as another example, is manufactured with higher-quality components and with far more precision that most competing devices (down to the micron, as opposed to most companies that only go down to a tenth of a millimetre, so literally orders of magnitude more precise), and their silicon is second to none (fastest CPU, fastest NAND, fastest ISP, etc). p_lindsay Dude, stop. I’m not a fanboy either way but Rolex watches are hand built in Switzerland and Apple watches are mass produced in China in the same factory as Playstations and your Grandmas TV. That isn’t even to say they aren’t well made, but comparing the two is ridiculous. The processes and components are not even similar. Just stop. Brad Fortin You realize that part of Apple’s manufacturing process is to design and build the machines that make their products, right? They’re not just retooling some machine Foxconn or Pegatron has sitting around, they’re custom-building their own from the ground up and essentially paying their suppliers to operate the machines for them. There’s an article over at Atomic Delights titled “How Apple Makes the Watch” that goes into the process and how no other watch manufacturer save Rolex makes watches as precisely as Apple. Maybe if you did a bit of research before blindly hating on Apple you’d realize they’re one of the best manufacturing companies in the world. p_lindsay Honestly dude, there is so much wrong with this I just can’t even bother. disqus_nKCeshLGXf “I don’t have an educated response. I’m out” p_lindsay No, you just wrote a bunch of retarded fanboy nonsense. First off, I don’t hate Apple, I made it very clear that I don’t view Apple Watch as poorly built, it’s just comparing it to hand built Swiss watches of several brand (not just Rolex as you suggest) with, in some cases hundreds of moving parts is beyond ridiculous. And Apple is absolutely not a manufacturer. They do fully design all of their products, but make no mistake, the machines are a retooling of other machines Foxconn and Pegatron have sitting around. They ARE the manufacturers, Apple is the Designers. Apple doesn’t even pretend that they manufacture. Or did you think “Designed in California” was just hyperbole? Spencer Navarra-Chew If you go back and read the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of my post, you’d notice I actually had 3 issues with the title. OS compatibility was only the first. My other two issues were with the assumption that high-powered “superwatches” are inherently better than simpler devices with multi-day batteries and the implication that smartwatches are the best wearables. To use your car analogy, it’s like saying that Ferraris are better than Ducatis and Land Rovers. I can’t speak for anyone else, but for the record, I’m happy to say that the iPhone 7 Plus is one of the 3 best smartphones on the market (with the Xperia XZ and Note 7 – battery issues notwithstanding) – I can’t give a definitive option as I’ve only been hands on with the Note 7 so far. Patrick O’Rourke Very true, the thickness really isn’t noticeable though. JD It isn’t till it is. What I mean is if you had nothing to compare it to that’s ok. But compare it to something like a Gen 2 Moto360 or Huawei and it’s quite a disappointment. Those watches aren’t even considered skinny. I wear a Swatch skin for days I don’t wear a smart watch Patrick O’Rourke Yup. I think we just have to accept that wearables are a great companion device, but not necessary. meister Agreed, which is why the high prices for them is what’s killing the sales..! They are miniature 2010 phones with a strap! 100-200$ max and they’d sell like crazy! Patrick O’Rourke I think that’s the common misconception. The Apple Watch isn’t a smartphone and never will be. It’s just a companion device. jclowater True it is a companion device but not only that. As a fitness device it can be much more useful than a phone alone, or at least more convenient. Garmin Fitbit and others have proved that there is a market for fitness watches. I am planning on buying an apple watch instead of Garmin because it also offers other apps. I just have not decided if the series 2 is worth the extra money. Spencer Navarra-Chew Patrick, I get that you are an Apple guy.I have no problems with that. Some of my best friends are Apple people. I’ve owned and used Apple devices myself. But I feel your pro-Apple bias is starting to skew the journalistic integrity of the site. As a senior editor, you have a responsibility to ensure the site retains a neutral outlook on the mobile market. First your review of the AirPods: while attempting to present a balanced review from the perspective of an Apple guy, you steadfastly refused to even acknowledge the existence of devices with comfortable features. Now a headline calling the Apple watch “The best wearable”? I’m not saying it’s not a great device (it is, at least with the new watchOS), but that kind of tabloid-style sweeping statement headline is not justified. The review itself is not bad, although again barely acknowledging the competition. It’s Me Neutral. That’s funny. The fact is, if he had praised any other brand, no one would be questioning his journalistic integrity. Say what you mean. If he isn’t bashing Apple, then he’s not doing his job. Jon Duke Actually, the title could have been “One of the best wearables just got better”, with the exact same article and the perception of fanboyism would not exist. He doesn’t to bash anyone. Just not out apple products on a pedestal at every occasion he has. It’s Me If he’s said any other brand was “the best” anything we wouldn’t be having this conversation. If next year he says the Gear is the best smart watch we won’t be having this conversation. If he’s said he hates the Apple Watch we wouldn’t be having this conversation. And if he’d said “one of the best” we’d still be having this conversation (though admittedly not necessarily you in particular). Patrick O’Rourke What he said ^ Spencer Navarra-Chew Maybe go back and read my original post. Go ahead I’ll wait. … Where did I question HIS integrity? But I feel your pro-Apple bias is starting to skew the journalistic integrity of the site. Think Patrick has been honest; his personal integrity is intact, but his ebullience makes the site unbalanced. There is no Pro-Android editor, Pro-Windows Phone editor, or Pro-BlackBerry editor that writes similar articles for the other ecosystems. So, where did I invalidate his opinion? I’m not saying it’s not a great device (it is, at least with the new watchOS)… The review itself is not bad, although again barely acknowledging the competition. I clearly agree that is’s a great device (with watchOS 3). I would like to see more comparisons in Patrick’s reviews, but that’s generally true of most reviews on the site. I wouldn’t have even brought it up except for: Now a headline calling the Apple watch “The best wearable”?… that kind of tabloid-style sweeping statement headline is not justified My only real issue with this piece. I won’t go back in to detail as I already have elsewhere in these comments. Jon Duke You are just assuming. Sure, Apple is always a polarizing topic. But, I would have said the exact same thing if he said the gear watch was the best. It’s Me ” (though admittedly not necessarily you in particular)” Patrick O’Rourke But then that title wouldn’t accurately reflect my thoughts on the Series 2. I feel the Apple Watch is the best wearable on the market. The only device I’ve put on a pedestal recently is the Note 7 and well, we know how that went for Samsung lol. I still content it’s my favourite handset ever though. Mo Dabbas I actually read an article from pocket now saying that so far 26 of the Note 7 cases were false. After starting investigation some withdrew their accusation, some didn’t respond, and some device testing showed no error with the battery. It tells you a lot about how overblown the story was. I’m not saying to use the older batch of the note 7, but I do believe many sites dramatised the situation and reported different stories without much investigation of how true they are. You know, like the one that it burnt some kids hand and then it appeared it’s not even a note 7 he was using. Spencer Navarra-Chew But then why isn’t your Note 7 review titled “The Best Handset Ever”? You kind of made my point for me right there. I generally don’t have an issue with your writing, but I really don’t see how you can justify this headline. I don’t expect these articles to be completely neutral, but stating your opinion as fact is a bridge too far. How about this headline “My favourite wearable just got better”? Jon Duke That’s fair. I guess people just always complain no matter the camp. Great review regardless of title tho. Spencer Navarra-Chew I’d give that title two thumbs up. I’d still like more compare and contrast with other devices in the review itself, but that’s actually fairly minor. Spencer Navarra-Chew You know what they say about assumptions, right? Why would you assume I’m anti iOS? The simple fact is this: While my current primary device is indeed an Android based device (Sony Xperia Z3TC), I’m actually OS agnostic. I actually do use an iPad mini 3 and a Windows convertible laptop daily. My previous devices include iOS (iPhone 4s, iPad), Windows Phone (Dell Venue Pro), Blackberry (Q10, Bold 9780, Curve 8900, Curve 8310), Windows Mobile/PocketPC (HTC Maple, HTC HD2, HP iPaq), PalmOS (Handspring Vizor, Sony Clie UX50, Sony Clie NR70), WebOS (Palm Pre), and of course Android (Moto Pro+, Dell Streak 5, Sony Xperia Z1, Samsung Galaxy Note 1). I like iOS. I like Android better, but that’s irrelevant. I actually think Apple Watch 2 is a better device than any Android Wear device. BUT If you want a “superwatch” (I don’t), and if iOS is your primary OS, then its a fantastic device. If you use Android (or others) it’s near useless. If you want a simple device with a long battery life, it sucks. If you want a wearable that doesn’t go on your wrist, this is not the droid you’re looking for. Simple. Patrick O’Rourke I wrote a glowing review of the Note 7 just a few weeks ago calling it my favourite smartphone of all time. Despite the battery issues, it still remains my favourite handset. I’m typing this message from a Surface Book that I use on a daily basis when writing, editing and managing the overall direction of MobileSyrup. My daily driver right now is a Moto Z. I’m pointing all this out because I am far from an “Apple guy.” What I am is a guy that likes great tech. I feel that the Series 2 is the best wearable out there, but this is my opinion and as always you’re free to disagree. That, however, doesn’t constitute that I am biased. What you call a “tabloid-style sweeping statement” I feel is completely accurate. In my AirPods review I compare the wireless earbuds to Samsung’s Gear IconX’s, the headphone’s main competitor. I also question the utility of wireless earbuds in general. In this review I mention the Moto 360 and the Pebble in various contexts. Jon Duke I missed the note article, what was the title of it? The issue, I think, isn’t the content of the article. It’s the way it’s titled. Like the AirPods article. It’s title “Welcome to the future” as if the tech doesn’t already exist. Same here. “The best wearable”. He could be the best, it probably is… To you. Everyone’s best isn’t the same. It’s fair to say it’s the best, to you, in the article but the title could have just been “One of the best..” and no one would be conplaining(they probably would, I admit it). Patrick O’Rourke The AirPods article is called “welcome to the future” because I believe that the W1 chip completely changes up the wireless headphone game. A review is the author’s opinion. I don’t expect everyone to agree with me, in fact, I often expect our readers to hold a completely different opinion on most of the products I review, especially the AirPods. That, however, doesn’t make my opinion invalid. To say “one of the best” doesn’t accurately reflect my thoughts on the Series 2 and the same can be said about the AirPods story. Also, here’s my Note 7 review. http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/08/19/note-7-review-canada/ Spencer Navarra-Chew I do think the W1 might be a game changer, but until I see some actual proof in the form of a compelling device, it’s just a tech demo. Jon Duke Thanks. Great read. I see you point. Smanny Patrick, I have been on this site to see long enough that you are biased towards Apple. It’s not just me. Others have noticed as well. You can say you tried or used this device or that device. Still doesn’t change the fact that you are biased. You claim to use a Moto Z right now as your daily driver. How does Apples watch work with it? Oh, that’s right it doesn’t work with any smartphone, except for Apple’s iPhones. So if your saying its still the best and still using Apples watch right now. Then clearly the Moto Z and any other phone other than an iPhone is truly your daily driver. “In my AirPods review I compare the wireless earbuds to Samsung’s Gear IconXs, the headphone’s main competitor” Really the icon X are the main competitor? Who said? You? Especially when there have been many other ear buds on the market before Samsung’s and now Apples. I even listed some others, but all you tried was Samsung’s, and said Apples was the best. However you never tried any others that have been on the market for a while now, and more are coming all the time. Please even you can see what I have said is 100% true. Spencer Navarra-Chew Fair enough Patrick, maybe I made an overly-broad statement of my own. I very much respect the fact that you’re willing to discuss my concerns. I too love great tech. My daily drive is a Sony Z3TC, I use an iPad mini 3 for things I can’t do on Android and I use a Toshiba Portege Z20t-b (Windows 10) for real work. You can look above for a more comprehensive list. I tell you this because I don’t want you to think I’m anti-iOS or pro-Android. I still have one main issue with your AirPod article. The fact that you’ve openly acknowledged your lack of knowledge and experience with Sony’s quick pairing technology even though it could change your opinion of one of your main praises for the AirPods. I’d be happy to give you a demo sometime. As for the headline, I’m rather incredulous that you can continue to defend it. How is your opinion that it’s the best wearable, stated as if it were a fact “accurate and informative”? Yes, you did mention it’s not round like a Moto360, it is water resistant like the Pebbles, and it has a GPS like the FitBits. I’d still like to see more direct comparisons of competing products in articles in general, but like I’ve already stated, I felt the review was fair, it’s the title I have the main issue with. Croc Ography I wrote the same thing about Patrick’s reviews a few months back. I felt the same oozing of Apple love that you noticed. I know Patrick’s says it is not true, but it certainly reads that way. Patrick O’Rourke If I like an Apple product I’m not going to pretend I don’t like it. To me, that’s doing a disservice to MobileSyrup’s community. I’m not an Apple fan, Microsoft fan, Sony fan or blind follower of any other company. I like good products and when I have a great experience with one, my review is going to reflect that. HatInTheRing I have to agree with you, here. Although your words are a little strong, this is suspiciously upbeat for a watch with ridiculously tepid reviews in its first iteration. Almost no reviewers called apple watch the best. So to say “the best gets better” seems a little click batey to me. Or, perhaps, as you mentioned, some bias is at play. All the reviews I’ve read are they Apple is late to the game with a device that does less than its competition. In fact, when the Samsung gear 2 came out many reviews read, finally a watch worth wearing in a market that for some reason apple has taken the lead. It is true that Apple lovers will by Apple stuff and pump Apples tires regardless of how mediocre the product is. I’m sorry this will offend Apple fanboys but it’s the truth. It’s Me Let the flaming begin! Raj Singh It is ONE of the best but calling it THE best is subjective. I do agree that it’s definitely better. The design is ugly, it’s too bulky and the watch faces suck compared to completely round smartwatches. Whatthewha I have to disagree about everything you wrote. You can’t judge the design by looking at a picture. Wear it on your wrist and it looks sleek and modern. I’m talking about the series 1, but series 2 is slightly bulkier. Neither are even close to being as massive as the Moto 360 or The Samsung Gear 2 or 3. The watch faces are varied, useful and fully customizable. Raj Singh Every watch you pointed out sucks but that’s just my opinion. For the record, I own an Apple Watch (and others that I think are better). Like I said, this is just my opinion. People are happy with it and ultimately that’s what’s most important. Patrick O’Rourke A review is always subjective. That’s actually the entire point of a review. The Series 2 is 1mm larger than the Series 1, a size difference that seriously isn’t noticeable (check the comparison photos above). It’s Me Is calling it ONE of the best any less subjective…? I suppose it would be less offensive some… Raj Singh That, too, is subjective. He stated his opinion; I stated mine. It’s Me Ok. Guess that makes sense. Calling a statement out as subjective but then provide another subjective statement as correction. Makes perfect sense. Carry on. Raj Singh There was no correction and there’s nothing wrong the subjective statement. These are just opinions, man. I just wanted to point out that my position was different than his. If subjective is too offensive for you, feel free to replace that first sentence with, “I think it is one of the best but I don’t agree with your assertion that it is the best.” It’s Me So the reason for pointing out the obvious, that it was subjective, was intentionally superfluous? Ok, gotcha. Raj Singh But it’s not at all superfluous to point out the obvious is the obvious. Pretty cool we have you patrolling the hallways. It’s Me No, you’re right. Pointing out that something that is supposed to be subjective is in fact subjective isn’t superfluous at all…we need people pointing out the obvious. Sorry to get in the way of your own hall monitor activities of pointing out the obvious. Carry on. Perhaps you can find a math paper and point out that it is math forcused. Raj Singh Did I say it wasn’t superfluous? And if it is, so what? It’s not a sin nor does it make me the hall monitor but passing judgment and setting guidelines on what and how people should comment in the comments section makes you sound like a self-righteous tw_t. It’s Me No one is setting guidelines raj. But if you’re going to take the time to point something out for being subjective, it comes off as odd that you follow it up with something subjective. It would raise the same questions if you pointed out something as being incorrect and then followed that up with an incorrect statement. Doesn’t make a lot of sense if it was a correction and is simply superfluous if you simply meant to point something out and then do it yourself. Anyhoo, carry on raj. Looking forward to more staying of obvious. Raj Singh I don’t think it’s odd to say, “you think it’s the best. I don’t think it’s the best.” I realize you take issue with the way I worded the statement. I will work on trying to communicate succinctly. It’s Me That wouldn’t have been odd, if that had been what you wrote. Anyway, you’re a bright guy so let’s leave this. I’m sure this conversation isn’t how either of us wants to spend the rest of the day. Cheers. Petit Baveux Please note that this article was written by an Apple fanboy for Apple fanboys. Brad Fortin “Given the fact that most standard watches feature some level of water resistance, it was seen by many, including myself, as a strange move that the first-generation Apple Watch couldn’t withstand water.” The first-generation Apple Watch is IP67 rated. People have worn it in showers, pools, hot tubs, and Apple’s own recommendation for cleaning a sticky digital crown is to turn the crown under running water. “What hasn’t changed about the Apple Watch Series 2, however, is the fact that it’s still not a must-have device, though the same can be said about all smartwatches.” Why is this still something that gets brought up so frequently? Aside from food, water, and shelter, most things in our lives aren’t a “must-have”. No TV is a “must-have” but I’ve never seen any TV review mention that, same thing with phones, computers, game consoles, cars, appliances, furniture, etc. For example, other items you’ve reviewed that aren’t a “must-have” but that weren’t described as not being a “must-have” include: AirPods, PlayStation VR, Hitcase, and Pokemon Go. None of those things are a “must-have” but at no point did any of those reviews mention that. Why single out this one item among so many that share the same “not a must-have” characteristic? Patrick O’Rourke Hey brad, 1. The first Apple Watch is not actually IP67 water resistance. It’s IP6X, which, to my understanding means that the device wasn’t actually tested. 2. This is something that gets brought up so frequently because when smartwatches first started getting released there was a perception that they would eventually replace our smartphones, becoming devices that are integral to our lives. That’s a common misconception. Smartwatches are great companion devices and little more than that. 3. The devices you mention in this comment are vastly different in terms of utility when compared to a smartwatch. For one, none of these products are always attached to your body in the way that a watch is. Also, no one has reviewed PlayStation VR because it isn’t out yet. I’ve also never reviewed any of Hitcases’ products. Brad Fortin 1. From Apple’s own support page on Apple Watch water resistance: “Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch (1st generation) have a water resistance rating of IPX7 under IEC standard 60529. ” So, no formal protection against dust but can be submerged up to 1 m for up to 30 minutes. 2. Maybe in their current incarnation, sort of like how early smart phones weren’t really a replacement for desktop computers, but over time the product category evolved to the point where such a thing was possible. The same thing will one day happen with smart watches, if not with some other smart wearable. 3. So, the article about Hitcase and the PS VR, why do they fall under the Reviews section of the website if they’re not considered reviews? As for the other products, I don’t see how their difference in utility should change whether or not they’re categorized as “must-have”. But back to my point: No other smartwatch or wearable ever reviewed by this site has ever been described as “not a must-have device”, especially not in a heading. Why is the Apple Watch being singled out from all other wearables in this respect? Patrick O’Rourke 1. IPX7 still isn’t certified water resistance as far as I’m concerned. 2. Smartwatches will never replace smartphones. 3. If a story doesn’t have ‘reviews’ in the headline, it isn’t a review. We sometimes categorize articles as reviews for site layout reasons, then remove them later. 4. Reviews are the opinion of the writer not MobileSyrup as a whole, so I can’t speak for the rest of the staff’s opinions. Also, you’re reading far to into the term “must-have device.” Brad Fortin So, never mind international standards, you’re going by your own self-defined standard? Alrighty then. Credibility diminished. Patrick O’Rourke Again, Brad, IPX7 covers “immersion in water” which is not the same thing as “water resistance.” In terms of the coding system there is a massive difference between these terms. I suggest you do more research on how IP Code actually works before calling my credibility into question. Brad Fortin Ingress protection *is* water resistance, whether we’re going by the dictionary definition (“designed to not be easily harmed or affected by water”) or the IEC standard (“The second characteristic numeral indicates the degree of protection provided by enclosures with respect to harmful effects on the equipment due to the ingress of water”). It may not be able to withstand high-pressure water jets or deep-sea water but that doesn’t mean it’s not water resistant. Mo Dabbas Ingress protection is what IP stands for. Read my reply to Patrick a bit up as I explained what the numbers mean ???????? Mo Dabbas When there’s an IP rating the first number is for intrusion protection, the second is for moisture protection. If the Apple watch 1 is IPX7 that means it’s not tested (or not rated) for dirt and such, but it is water resistant. If the second number is 8 then it’s water proof, and the highest is 9 which means it can survive water under pressure. For the first digit the highest is 7 which means it’s completely particles tight. Rev0lver “The best wearable just got better” I’ve said it once I’ll say it again, being the smartest kid on the short bus is nothing to be proud of. Jon Duke You know, I would have no problem with MobileSyrup calling the Apple Watch the “best wearable” if I’d see reviews of other smartwatches that explains why they are not as good. Now, it just really just sounds like someone who didn’t try anything else before saying something is the best. I doubt it’s the case, so why no other watch review? Patrick O’Rourke Check out our wearables section, there are reviews of many different smartwatches. I’ve personally used the Moto 360 1st gen, 2nd gen, Pebble, Pebble Time Round, Pebble Time, and Gear S2. I don’t spend a lot of time comparing the Apple Watch to Android Wear devices in this review, this is definitely true. In the future I may put together a shorter story that directly compares the Series 2 to a variety of Wear products though. Jon Duke I take it back. I checked and there is other articles. My bad. meister Just my personal taste but I just don’t like the design. It probably performs well and has nice features and all but the transition between the device and the band makes it look toyish to my eyes! Even worse when you look at it from the side! It just doesn’t make it look “expensive” imho. We should make a street test: put 5 or 10 different smartwatches on a table and ask the peeps which one they think it’s an Apple Watch 🙂 FlamesFan89 Do a Google image search for “kidizoom watch” or “Leapband”. I believe that both these children’s toy watches hit the market BEFORE the Apple Watch, which makes the design of the Apple Watch all that more hilariously bad. funkright I have the AW 2 on my left wrist and the new Fitbit Charge 2 on the right wrist. Can’t decide which one to keep. I bought the Fitbit Charge 2 because I wanted to go back to wearing a higher end automatic watch (Omega, Panerai et al), just can’t if I want to give up the features the AW 2 gives me (having had an AW 1 for the last year it gets marginally addictive)… First world problem, I know, but still.. meister Applewatch: nice software, bad design Samsung Gear: nice design, bad app selection Android Wear: nice design, bad software All of them are so close yet so far..! Lol Take apple’s os, put it in a huawei watch with a rotating bezel and we’ve got a winner! HatInTheRing This watch is gawd awful looking in my opinion. I also think the Pebble is. The Moto 360 is by far less toy looking. Samsung Gear is also a sleaker watch. ConcertMaster Funny because Patrick would have you believe the Pebble Round is the best wearable. lol! Sometimes the reviews these guys write are a joke Patrick O’Rourke The Time Round is one of my favourite smartwatches, especially looks wise. As you know, I’ve said this many times. ConcertMaster Yeah. Well if only the Time Round had the software the AW did then you’d have a winner over there for sure. Maybe a design tweak on that bezel as well… Patrick O’Rourke Yup, I agree! Alain Lafond Really! Watches are a non-product… Android or Apple… Buy it, show it, and put in your drawer. I don’t have that kinda money!!! danakin The headline reads: “Apple Watch Series 2 review: The best wearable just got better”. The word “best” implies, at least to me, that the object garnering the label has presented itself as top dog by some tangible measure(s). Aside from a passing mention of peak brightness this piece is a matter of opinion. I don’t know if the authors at MobileSyrup write the headlines but this is at best a plot for cheap clicks (ad revenue) or at worst amateurish journalism. I don’t think it’s too much to ask that Canada’s leading mobile technology site respect its readers by not conflating FACT and OPINION. That being said, Patrick does an excellent job of expressing his OPINION of the watch. It’s Me Do people really need to have it explained that a review is subjective and opinion? Seems like some people read an opinion and then confuse it as a statement of fact. If one doesn’t understand that, how can anyone take their critique of journalism seriously? danakin Lazy or misrepresentative journalism is inherently dangerous. In our society the 4th estate’s responsibilities should not to be taken lightly and yes, that extends to the minutiae of aligning headlines to content. As a news consumer this is important to me. To answer to the question in your first paragraph; no. It’s Me It was rhetorical, clearly the answer is yes. For example, you took a review, a piece that is subjective opinion by definition, and lashed out at it because it included opinion. It would be like attacking an editorial, also subjective opinion, for being subjective opinion. It’s nuts how you people read an opinion and then attack it for being opinion for no other reason than that you hold a different opinion. It’s fine to have a different opinion. Great actually. But don’t attack someone’s integrity just because you disagree. To additionally confuse fact with opinion and accuse them of doing the same based on your own confusion is just over the top. danakin I hope you have a nice weekend. Cheers. Patrick O’Rourke I’ve stated this a few times in the comments section already but a review inherently is based on the author’s opinion. That’s really the entire point of a review. The headline reads like that because this is, again, a review and my opinion. I feel that the Apple Watch Series 2 is the best smartwatch on the market and state this in the story. Readers as always are totally free to disagree with me and I expected that to happen with this particularly review. However, to write a review that isn’t based on my own opinion and experience with a product would be a disservice to our readers. What you’re talking about — a story just based on “facts” — is not a review. danakin Spin spin spin. BetelgeuseOrion lol apple used to bash oled saying that tech was crap, and here we are with an oled display on an apple product, It’s Me When did Apple ever bash it? You guys make up fantasy and then try to argue against things that never happened. What was often based was the complete crap that was pentile and the reduced subpixel count that meant. They’ve come along was since then, especially once the dropped it with Super AMOLED Plus and HD. Before that, it was pentile crap, which is what was complained about.

In a blog post published Friday by Elcomsoft, a Russian company that makes software to help law enforcement agencies access data from mobile devices, researcher Oleg Afonin showed that changes in the way local backup files are protected in iOS 10 has left backups dramatically more susceptible to password-cracking attempts than those produced by previous versions of Apple’s operating system. Specifically, the company found that iOS 10 backups saved locally to a computer via iTunes allow password-cracking tools to try different password combinations at a rate of 6,000,000 attempts per second, more than 40 times faster than with backups created by iOS 9. Elcomsoft says this is due to Apple implementing a weaker password verification method than the one protecting backup data in previous versions. That means that cops and tech-savvy criminals could much more quickly and easily gain access to data from locally-stored iOS 10 backups than those produced by older versions. Being a company known for breaking into iPhones, Elcomsoft unsurprisingly did not disclose the vulnerability to Apple before publishing its blog. But CEO Vladimir Katalov told Motherboard that his company responded to Apple’s security team after it requested more information about the bug through the company’s online support system early Friday morning. “Apple is definitely aware they have implemented [the flaw] themselves :)” Katalov told Motherboard in an email. An Apple spokesperson confirmed that the company is working on a fix. “We're aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update,“ the spokesperson said in a statement. “This does not affect iCloud backups. We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption.” The flaw could be a huge boon for law enforcement, spies, and sophisticated criminals who are able to gain possession of a victim’s iOS backup file. While iOS devices themselves are known for having fairly solid security backed by a hardware module called the Secure Enclave, one of the remaining avenues of attack is to trigger a device to backup either to iCloud or a local computer, where data enjoys far less protection. Normally, local backups are protected by a user’s password. But in iOS 10, Apple has implemented a weaker hashing algorithm—a function used to verify and store passwords in an unrecognizable format. This allows police and hackers to more easily “brute force” the backup file’s password by having a piece of forensics software guess millions of different passwords per second until it finds one that matches the stored hash. Using an Intel i5 processor, Elcomsoft says it was able to guess passwords on iOS 10 backups 2,500 times faster than using the same hardware against an iOS 9 backup. That same processor was still 40 times faster than using a top-of-the-line graphics processor to brute force passwords on backups created by iOS 9. (Elcomsoft doesn’t support GPU-based password cracking yet on iOS 10, but it should increase the speed even more once it becomes available.) When compounded with lists of commonly-used passwords, Elcomsoft says the amount of time it takes to crack an iOS 10 backup’s password can be reduced even further. Once an attacker has unlocked the backup, they can gain complete access to the device’s data in its saved state—including the keychain, a file that’s normally impossible to retrieve from the physical device which stores all the user’s logins and passwords. For its part, Apple at least seems interested in issuing a fix. But given the various pieces of software involved, it remains unclear how long it would take to roll out. “The fix itself is probably not so easy, because that hash might be used for some other purposes we are not aware of,” Katalov told Motherboard in an email. “So I guess that not just iOS update is needed, but also iTunes update as well, and probably some changes to the backup format.” UPDATE: Sept. 23, 5:50 p.m. ET: This story has been updated to include Apple's statement. Also, a previous version of this article mentioned rainbow tables as a method for determining a backup file's password, however rainbow tables would in fact not be usable in this case.

Highs Brighter screen is legible outside Waterproof and ready to swim Apps launch faster WatchOS 3 is streamlined Only watch that fits female wrists Lows Expensive One-day battery life DT Editors' Rating 8.0 DT Editors' Choice Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Wearable Reviews > Smartwatch Reviews > Apple Watch Series 2 review By Malarie Gokey Posted on 09.22.16 Research Center: Apple Watch Series 2 Welcome to So You Think You Want a Smartwatch: Season 2, where we try to identify whether you actually want a smartwatch, and which one is best for you. First question: Do you have an iPhone? Yes? Then step right up and check out the Apple Watch Series 2! It’s faster, brighter, and much more waterproof than last year’s model. It’s still super stylish and modern looking, too, and it’ll whip you into shape. But is it the right smartwatch for you? Well, we’ve been using one for the past four days in an effort to find out. Here’s what I learned. Familiar Apple watch design is now waterproof Nothing to see here, ladies and gents! Apple’s new Watch Series 2 looks just like last year’s Watch — which is to say, it’s lovely. It has the same curvy, rectangular shape and it’s about the same thickness. It still comes in two sizes: 38mm and 42mm. All the same Apple Watch bands and accessories are compatible with the new model, and you can choose from a number of different finishes. We tested the 38mm sport model with the Milanese band we bought last year; we also had a sports band to test the sporty features. Now that the Watch Series 2’s body is entirely waterproof, you can safely submerge it in up to 50 meters of liquid and even take it swimming. The display locks when it’s submerged. Every nook, cranny, and crevice has been hermetically sealed to prevent leakage, and the speaker is specially designed to eject water every time the Watch peeks its face above water. Apple’s new Watch Series 2 looks just like last year’s Watch, which is to say, it’s lovely. We dunked the Watch underwater for 30 minutes and pulled it out to test the feature. If you want to trigger the ejection of water, you just swipe up from the bottom of the screen; tap the water droplet, and then turn the digital crown until it squirts out all the water inside. It’s really neat to see the Watch spitting like this. Last year’s Apple Watch was only splashproof, so the addition of full waterproofing and swimming features is a huge win for Apple. It’s one of the first major smartwatches to be waterproofed to this degree and fit for swimming. The Pebble, Nixon Mission, Casio WSD-F10, and some Garmin watches are your main alternatives, and none is as fashionable or slim as the Apple Watch. They’re much more sporty looking. New OLED screen tech also makes the Series 2 display the “brightest that Apple has ever shipped on any product” at 1,000 nits — around the same level as high dynamic range (HDR) televisions. Although the first Apple Watch had a brighter display than many other smartwatches, the Series 2 blows it away. You can actually read everything in full sunlight, yet the dark theme in WatchOS 3 never blinds you with tons of annoying white light. The Apple Watch’s design still looks as futuristic, sleek, and modern as it did the day it launched. While everyone else goes round, Apple is stubbornly sticking to the curvy rectangle. Even though many of us sometimes wish the Apple Watch were round, every time I strap it on my wrist, it just looks so good. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Part of its unique appeal still lies with the size. Apple is the only company that makes a smartwatch that fits my wrist comfortably and doesn’t look like a hockey puck. I’ve tried to love the round women’s Moto 360, the Huawei Watch, and the Fossil Q Wander, but they’re all a bit too big. Sure, they’re better looking than most other smartwatches that claim to be “gender neutral,” but they’re still not as natural looking on a small wrist as the 38mm Apple Watch. Then there are the watch faces. Apple offers a number of feminine faces, including Minnie Mouse, flowers, butterflies, and a variety of color combinations for simple, minimal looks. The cherry on top is the wide array of bands you can buy from Apple and third parties that are feminine. Other smartwatch makers may think of women to a degree when they make their products, but nobody is as female-friendly as Apple. WatchOS 3 and a better processor work miracles WatchOS 3 breathed new life into the first-generation Apple Watch, and it runs even better on the Series 2. That’s thanks to a cutting-edge processor called the S2, which has dual cores and a GPU that’s twice as powerful as the first Watch’s chip. It is noticeably faster than the first one. On Series 2, apps load almost instantly, especially when you pop them in your dock. The dock is just a button press away from the home screen, too, making it much easier to access your favorite apps than before. In terms of smartwatch features, WatchOS 3 makes the Apple Watch Series 2 a real success. Our favorite feature is the reminder to breathe and take a moment to meditate a bit each day. It’s a much-needed feature for busy people who forget to breathe well when they’re stressed. Reminders to stand up from time to time are helpful too, albeit sometimes annoying. Messaging is much better on the Watch now, as well. You can quickly reply to texts by tapping twice in quick succession. New animated stickers and full-screen effects allow you to express yourself “more visually.” And you can write custom replies with a scribble, even in Chinese. There’s a built-in safety feature that lets you program an SOS message to be sent in the event of an emergency, too. Related: WatchOS 3 review: Watch Apple breathe new life into into smartwatches Apple’s new Watch also has GPS on board, so it’s no longer reliant on a phone for location data. That means you don’t have to bring an iPhone along anymore when you’re out running, biking, or swimming. To trigger the GPS, just start an outdoor workout. Continuous GPS can go for about five hours before you’ll run out of battery, which is decent — good enough for a marathon, Apple told us. Your route isn’t visible on your watch in real time, but you should really be focused on your workout – not your wrist – when you’re running down the street. It felt freeing to escape my phone for an hour, and it was still very cool to see a map of my route on the iPhone when I got back home. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Now the Apple Watch can track swimming, too, which is a big deal for water sports enthusiasts and swimmers alike. The watch will even learn your body’s movements to better record your workouts over time, and still tracks your heart rate, too. These new features make the new Apple Watch a much better fitness tracker, though we wish it supported more activities natively –things like yoga for example. It’s not going to show you your route in real time, as Samsung’s Gear Fit 2 or more sport-oriented wearables will, nor does it auto track different activities, which is a shame. If you just want a fitness tracker, you don’t need Apple. But if you want both a fitness tracker and smartwatch features in an appealing package, there’s no better option than the Apple Watch. Battery life is a solid day The Apple Watch Series 2 has a slightly bigger battery than the original, but it will still really last you through just one day before you need to charge it. Most smartwatches last about the same, and if you don’t use GPS too much, it could possibly last you a day and a half or two.  It really depends on how much you use it, but you’ll probably have to charge it at night. The same Apple Watch charger works with the Series 2, so no worries there. Tons of different models to choose from Just like last year, the Apple Watch Series 2 comes in a wide array of styles, materials, and colors. Stainless steel and aluminum finishes are still available, and there’s a new ceramic option. All the same Apple Watch bands work with the new models, so you have options ranging from around $50 up to insane price points like $690. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Pricing starts at $370 for the base model of the Apple Watch Series 2 with a sport band, and races up from there. The 14K gold Edition model is gone, but you can still be a high roller who drops a grand on the Apple Watch if you get a Hermès band or the ceramic model. Apple is big on collaborations with high-end brands, so it continued its partnership with Hermès to offer two new leather straps: one with a single silver buckle ($1,399) and one with a double buckle design ($689). In a nod to the sporty crowd, Apple teamed up with Nike to make a special activity-focused Apple Watch called the Nike+. It’s really just an Apple Watch Series 2 with special software and a perforated band that’s supposed to be breathable and durable enough to handle workouts. The Apple Watch Nike+ starts at $370, same as the Series 2, and debuts in October. We look forward to testing it. Related: The ultimate Apple Watch buyer’s guide The Apple Watch is still among the priciest smartwatches you can buy, but its base model is nearly on par with the competition at $370. If you want to save some dough, first-gen Android Wear watches can now be had for as low as $270. Warranty and customer service information Apple has a one-year limited warranty for the Apple Watch, which covers defects and other manufacturing issues, but not accidental damage like smashed screens. You can also get AppleCare+ for your Apple Watch, which gives you expert phone support and more coverage, including up to two incidents of accidental damage each with a service fee. The $50 extended warranty adds two more years of coverage to most models, though the Edition and Hermes ones get three years of coverage.

If you live near an Apple Store, you can schedule an appointment with the Genius bar and have your device looked at. The technician will let you know what’s wrong and walk you through potential solutions. Apple will often repair your device on the same day you bring it into the store, which isn’t something you can say about any other smartwatch maker. If you don’t live near an Apple Store, you can start a live chat with an Apple rep online. Apple’s customer service is exceptional – there’s really no competition in this space. Competition is scarce, and Apple is king Apple may have been late to the smartwatch game, but it is the undisputed ruler of the realm now. Apple sold the most smartwatches of any company in 2015, and now sits second only to Rolex in the larger watch market. Given Apple’s clear dominance and Android Wear’s struggles, most of Google’s partners haven’t released new smartwatches in 2016. So right now, you have a choice between the new Apple Watch, the brand-new Samsung Gear S3 watches (large watches for men that work only on Android, and best with Samsung phones), and some new Fossil Android Wear watches (which are less techy and more for the fashion crowd). Watch OS 3 makes the Apple Watch Series 2 a real success. Although the newest version of Android Wear is a big improvement over the initial release, it’s not available to download just yet. It’s also still not the most intuitive smartwatch OS we’ve used. That award goes to Samsung’s Tizen-powered Gear OS — and Apple’s WatchOS 3. If you’re an iPhone user, the Apple Watch Series 2 is the one for you. Only some Android Wear features work on iOS, and most hardware is a year old now, which doesn’t bode well for the competition. But if you’re set on an Android Wear watch, your best choice at present is the Huawei Watch, which comes closest to being gender-neutral and attractive. For most women, the 38mm Apple Watch is still your only viable smartwatch choice. Unless you have bigger wrists or prefer large watches (newsflash, tech world: women don’t), any Android Wear watch will look slightly silly on your wrist. Yes, even the Huawei Watch, the second-gen Moto 360, and Fossil’s Q Wander, all of which offer watches for the ladies, are a bit big on the wrist. The DT Accessory Pack Trident Odyssey Valet for Apple Watch $25 Apple Watch Band $60 Apple Watch stand $8 I still see more women wearing Apple Watches than I do men, and I rarely see anyone on the street wearing anything else. It’s still the one to buy for the small-wristed. It’s still totally debatable as to whether you need a smartwatch at all, however. No one, including Apple, has made a strong case yet as to why you need to shell out $370 for another device that’s largely dependent on your phone. Even we aren’t convinced, and we’re geeks! If you really want to track your fitness, there are dozens of cheaper devices to chose from. However, smartwatch fans who want everything – notifications, apps, fitness, and mindfulness – need look no further than the Apple Watch. If you already have an Apple Watch, you don’t need to upgrade. Just wait for the third Apple Watch – the tech will be much more advanced by then, especially if Apple waits a year and a half before its next upgrade.

Apple TV just in time for the December holiday period. It wouldn’t be a stretch to think that the old 4th generation Apple TV from October 2015 had been delayed. And now we may be getting what we wanted all along just one year later. The 4th generation Apple TV may be short-lived. At Last. Signs of 4K UHD Apple TV Appear Various sites are reporting a confidential submission to the FCC for approval of a device that seems to have the earmarks of a 5th generation Apple TV. What would be the in-favor arguments? The 3rd generation Apple TV was released in March, 2012 with a minor update in January 2013. We didn’t get the 4th genration until October 2015, and that gap was painful. It was likely delayed because Apple was waiting to release it, with fanfare, along with a streaming TV service. That failed. Hence the delayed launch of an 1080p device that had been “on the shelf” for a long, long time. We like to see yearly updates to certain Apple products, and now we may be getting one. Apple may well be on track focusing on the 4K hardware experience and moving away from an agenda driven device. Late last year, 4K UHD TV was coming along nicely, with beautiful sets available at discount. However, HDR was not in full swing until after CES in January of 2016, and this year, we have HDR standards from the UHD Alliance. HDR 4K UHD TVs are shipping right now. This is the key technology that makes an upgrade from HDTV compelling. And so, I propose this holiday season is the right time for Apple’s much thirsted for 4K/UHD/HDR/DolbyVision Apple TV. Other rumors suggest that it may be a Siri-driven competitor to Amazon’s Echo, but from the linked article above, this new device has a similar shape and screw placement to the existing Apple TV. I don’t think Apple, if it’s going to compete with the Amazon Echo, is quite ready. Finally, I should note that when we ask Apple to update its products frequently and remain state-of-the-art, we also need to mindful that we’re prepared to cough up the cash to enjoy those latest products. And if Apple does release a 5th generation 4K UHD Apple TV, there are many uses for that older, 4th gen. model in other rooms. Unless you have a 4K UHD TV in every room.

Thanks for any suggestions. September 23, 2016 at 7:00 EST PM Lee Dronick September 23, 2016 That said, it’s almost certain that Apple will hold an event in October to announce new Macs. However, which ones will be refreshed and which ones won’t even be mentioned is what the buzz is all about. October 11th is the date I’m betting on. Any later, and the holiday buying season will be adversely affected. And just this afternoon I shipped my 2011 MacBook Pro to my sister to replace the ancient iBook that I gave her a few years ago, it finally croaked. My plan is to get myself the next new MacBook, MacBook Air, or something. I am also considering the iPad Pro.

As a company with ten to the 11th dollars in the bank they are not leading in a bold way. The problem with TVs is the bundle of wires, contracts, and remote controls that the Apple TV just makes worse (another set top device). Someone please come in and disrupt this space (such is looking to be beyond the DNA of the current Apple management team)!!!!

The FCC documents point to this being a "wireless device" that includes radios for NFC and Bluetooth. Notably absent is any mention of Wi-Fi, which is odd. The model number is listed as A1844, which doesn't line up with any existing Apple product line. The only physical clues we get are two Torx screws on a chassis with slightly rounded corners. Apple specifically requested that the FCC remove any diagrams, electrical schematics and even technical description about its device. However, photos of this phantom product will be available to the public 180 days after the grant of equipment authorization. Cue the rumor mill Some have speculated that this could be an updated version of the Apple TV, possibly with 4K and HDR support, something the fourth-generation Apple TV lacked. However, MacRumors notes it's uncharacteristic of Apple to include regulatory text etched onto the back of a consumer device, which includes a wiring guide. Others wonder whether the device could be Apple's Siri-enabled speaker, though a lack of Wi-Fi doesn't make sense. Yet more ponderings include the existence of a new AirPort Extreme networking device, though why it needs NFC, we don't know. Last but not least, there's always a possibility that the device is for Apple's internal use only. Having NFC and Bluetooth makes sense for payments and iBeacon technology, which allows mobile phones to interact with signals from the real world. For example, customers walking into target would get a notification on their phone about items currently on sale. Until we have a more concrete picture from Apple - or, you know, leaks start spouting from everywhere - we're left scratching our heads as to what Apple is up to.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Apple 'Pressing Ahead' Into Prototype Testing for Echo-Like Smart Home Device Powered by Siri Apple 'Pressing Ahead' Into Prototype Testing for Echo-Like Smart Home Device Powered by Siri Friday, 23 September 2016 Apple is said to be "stepping up plans" for its connected smart home device powered by Siri, which would rival the technology that Amazon has made popular in its Alexa-enabled Echo speaker system (via Bloomberg). After two years of research and development, the Apple device is said to be in prototype testing, but because Apple hasn't officially finalized any plans it "could still scrap the project." Similar to Echo, the Siri device is said to be able to control smart home accessories like lights, locks, and curtains all through voice activation, and would most notably be the first new piece of Apple hardware introduced since the Apple Watch, and the iPad before that. To compete with Amazon -- and Google's own similar device called "Google Home" -- Apple will introduce "more advanced microphone and speaker technology," according to people close to the project. This could potentially include an ecosystem-wide upgrade to Siri's current functionality. Beyond the home device, Apple is researching new ways to improve Siri on iPhones and iPads, two people said. With an initiative code-named “Invisible Hand,” Apple hopes to give users the ability to fully control their devices through a Siri command system within three years, one of the people added. Currently, the voice assistant is able to respond to commands within its application, but Apple’s goal is for Siri to be able to control the entire system without having to open an app or reactivate Siri. For example, a user would be able to ask their iPhone to open a web page and then share it with a friend without the need to ever launch the Siri interface. Other examples from Apple’s current research include being able to print a PDF by speaking “print” while reading it or saying “help” in order for the system to help the user navigate a particular task or application. Apple has also been researching opening this ability to third-party apps, the person said. A few prototypes in testing are said to include technology related to facial recognition, potentially fueled by Apple's acquisition of Faceshift and Emotient, "which may help the device act based on who is in a room or a person’s emotional state." Otherwise, the device will be able to perform all of the Siri actions expected of the personal assistant, including responding to text messages, playing music, searching the internet, and more. Apple Maps integration is a possibility, which Apple is considering so Siri could alert you exactly when to leave the house for an appointment. Before it moved to a standalone speaker unit, Apple considered introducing Siri into a voice-activated feature on the new Apple TV, but the company decided on a more reliable button addition to the Apple TV remote over shouting commands across a room to activate Siri. In its original testing in 2014, Apple crafted a small and a large version of the Siri speaker, said to be like the Amazon Echo and Amazon Echo Dot, "but those early efforts may not translate into a final product." The prototype phase has advanced to the point of Apple engineers testing the device in their own homes, according to the individuals with knowledge of the project. As Bloomberg pointed out, while this is not an exact measure of when the Siri speaker might launch, Apple CEO Tim Cook was known to test out the original iPad at his home "for roughly six months before its introduction." Apple employees also tested out the fourth-generation Apple TV about a year before its launch in 2015. Ultimately, the Siri speaker is described as a way for Apple to "augment the iPhone," and drive sales for the company's devices following a year where it faced dwindling returns for its iPhone line. Its most recent device launches for the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and Apple Watch Series 2 have all faced the expected initial shortages most Apple products encounter in their first few weeks on the market, but Apple has chosen not to reveal first weekend sales numbers for the iPhone 7 because it feels the results are "no longer a representative metric" due to demand outweighing supply.Tags: Siri, Amazon Echo Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: CNET - Affiliate - on September 15, 2016< > Embed Turn your smart home on with Control4 and Amazon&apos;s Alexa 01:17 New Alexa support for Control4's smart home scenes let you control all of your gadgets with a single voice command.

And the Wii U, too, of course, but it’s 3DS that Nintendo focused on in its latest Nintendo Direct, announcing a few more games for the aging handheld.   All of them have a little bit of weirdness to them. There’s a port of the Wii U game Yoshi’s Woolly World that heavily features the tongue-lolling dog-thing Poochy (unless he dies on the way back to his home planet). There’s Super Mario Maker with no online level sharing. There’s a new Pikmin… but the real-time strategy has been traded in for Mario-ish side-scrolling action.   All in all, as I argue on this week’s Game|Life podcast, it’s a very safe lineup from Nintendo—taking as few risks as possible, attempting to provide 3DS software that could sell very well while still reserving the majority of its effort for the launch of NX.   After calming me down about Nintendo, as is their job, WIRED’s Jake Muncy and TIME’s Matt Peckham discuss Obduction, the new puzzle adventure game from the creators of Myst.

(It’s nearly available here in the U.S., but you can play it on Xbox One right now if you set your regional settings to Japan.)   Talking about Nintendo and Dark Souls pretty much ran us out of time, so Matt Peckham and I take just a moment at the end to talk about one of the more interesting virtual reality experiences I had at Game Developers Conference last week.

TIME’s Matt Peckham and WIRED’s Jake Muncy have been playing a lot of Tom Clancy’s The Division, and they attempt to convince me that I should play it too.   Jake’s also spent a little bit of time with Square Enix’s new episodic Hitman, I’ve built a level using keys and doors in Super Mario Maker, and I wish I could give some extra dollars to the makers of Peter Panic on iOS in exchange for more songs.

Specifically: Jake Muncy and Time gaming editor Matt Peckham have been playing Superhot and Far Cry Primal, and have an enjoyable discussion about those, largely without me, who didn’t play them. But I did play Star Fox Zero, and Matt actually spoke to Shigeru Miyamoto about it, so we have a lot to say there, too. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Game|Life Audio Skip Social.

Maarten de Boer/Getty Images Podcast RSS iTunes Download At the DICE Summit this week, I got the chance to talk with Penn Jillette, one half of Penn & Teller, and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, following their keynote presentation. The pair are working together on a new version, with some virtual reality elements, of the classic Desert Bus. Their session at DICE focused on how game developers can use principles of magic in their designs.   After a few minutes of conversation, I realized I wanted to share the whole session with everyone. So on this episode of the Game|Life Podcast, it’s the whole interview. To call it “wide-ranging” might undersell it a bit. Here’s some of what you can expect:   Desert Bus Hillary Clinton Janet Reno Virtual Reality, Shakespeare, and politics The Music Man The time Penn met Notch The Residents Guarding magical secrets The Internet as world-peace engine Fake lottery tickets   And more. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did, and thanks to Jillette and Pitchford for joining in. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Game|Life Audio Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

I had a lot of thoughts about the message that this game was trying to convey, but I held a lot of them back at the time of its release for fear of “spoilers.”   Well, the statute of limitations on that is quite up, and more to the point, I haven’t been able to find other analyses of the game that get at what I was taking away from it. Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture tackles one of the great questions of human existence—coming to terms with the inevitability of death—and gives us a metaphor to help us think about it. It can be a profound experience, aided by one of the greatest (and most impactful, in terms of its literary connection to the game’s message) original musical scores in recent memory.   On this episode of the Game|Life podcast, Jake Muncy and TIME’s Matt Peckham join in for a no-holds barred pull-apart of Rapture.

There are certainly a lot of leaks and rumors coming out about it, which would tend to indicate that Nintendo is getting close to announcing something about the new dedicated game machine that it’s often said it planned to discuss at some point in 2016.   TIME’s Matt Peckham joins me on this episode of the Game|Life podcast to discuss the NX rumors and what it might all mean, what we might hear at Nintendo’s upcoming financial briefing on February 2, and of course what we both think about Jonathan Blow’s The Witness, because you pretty much have to talk about that these days on gaming podcasts.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) are trading down more than 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon after point-of-sales tracking market research firm GfK issued negative commentary regarding iPhone 7 sales. As per the firm’s channel-checks-based data, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus witnessed 25 percent lower sales in its launch weekend than the previous model — iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus — at least in the 15 countries that were included in the sample. It should be noted, however, that these figures represent sales in 12 European countries, China, Australia and Taiwan, but not in the United States. Related Link: Buy Apple On The iPhone 7 Launch, As Demand Is Exceeding Supply: Citi Strangely, several respected Wall Street research firms had been expecting pretty much the opposite, even though, for the first time, Apple had decided not to publicize its first weekend sales numbers, arguing that they would be much more determined by supply than by demand. “We have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers,” the tech behemoth said recently.

While the original Apple Watch was not rated for swimming, many users had no issues regularly using it in the water, although its lack of built-in swim tracking features limited its usefulness. With Apple Watch Series 2, Apple has not only upgraded the water resistance with new gaskets and seals to make it suitable for swimming, but added new Pool Swim and Open Water Swim workouts to help track your progress. As part of the Apple Watch Series 2 introduction earlier this month, Apple highlighted how it worked with swimmers in the company's fitness labs to develop the software to accurately track swim workouts, from using the accelerometer in the watch to measure arm movements to tracking energy expenditures during workouts. So how well does the new Apple Watch work when you take it for some swims in a pool? Let's take a look. Getting Started Swim tracking is managed in the same Workout app as other types of exercise, with both pool and open water swim workout options to choose from and a variety of different goals available for each workout. When you launch a pool swim workout from the Apple Watch, the first screen lets you input the length of the pool you're going to be swimming in. The default value in the U.S. is 25 yards, which is the most common pool length, but you can adjust this manually down to the exact yard as needed. A force press on the screen lets you change between yards and meters. The next screen is where you set your goal for the workout. As with other types of workouts, you can swipe left and right on the watch to choose between calories burned, time or distance, or simply set an open goal. If you've previously completed swim workouts, the watch displays your best performances for each of the metrics, giving you a reference for setting new goals. In the Pool Once you've selected your pool length and workout goal, you're ready to go. Hit the Start button and the watch will give you a three-second countdown and you're off. During your swim workout, the Apple Watch can display up to four different metrics. By default, these include workout duration, active calories burned, laps completed, and distance. Using the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, however, you can customize the display to rearrange the order of the different metrics or replace some of them with other options including average pace, total calories burned, and heart rate. Alternatively, you can set your Apple Watch to display only a single metric at a time and use the Digital Crown to change metrics during the workout. One unique aspect to swim workouts is that once the workout begins, the Apple Watch screen automatically locks to prevent accidental taps that can occur as water interferes with the touch sensing. If you want to pause your workout at any point, simply press the Digital Crown and the side button simultaneously. Pressing them again resumes the workout tracking. As detailed during its introduction earlier this month, the Apple Watch Series 2 has a clever feature to help clear water from its speaker, using vibrations of the speaker itself to expel water from the speaker cavity when your workout is complete. Once your workout is paused and you're finished, turning the Digital Crown expels the water from the speaker and unlocks the screen, which then allows you to swipe right and end the workout, resume the workout, or re-lock the display. How Well Does It Work? So how well does the swim workout tracking work? The answer is very well if your goal is to simply swim back and forth to rack up yardage. The watch accurately senses individual strokes and both open turns and flip turns at the ends of the pool to calculate the distance you've traveled, elapsed time, and calories burned, and I found the active calories burned metric calculated by the watch to be close to figures estimated by other sources for various types of swimming activity. Apple notes that the heart rate sensor may not function properly during swimming activities as water may interfere with the measurements, but that calories burned continue to be estimated using the watch's accelerometer. In my experience, however, the heart rate sensor continued to function very well in the water, accurately capturing my heart rate throughout my workouts. Where the Apple Watch's swim tracking starts to fall short is for people looking to do more varied swim workouts based around swim sets and focused exercises like stroke drills and kicking. The Apple Watch's tracking is linked to its ability to sense arm motion, which means if you're doing a kick set, it won't pick it up at all. Or if you're doing specialized drills to work on your technique, such as one-arm strokes, if may not track accurately if you don't have a regular stroke rhythm. The Apple Watch's pace calculation also becomes less useful if you're doing interval-based sets, as it's simply going to tell you the interval you were going on instead of your actual swimming pace unless you manually pause the workout as you finish each repeat and resume before starting the next one. That quickly becomes tedious, especially as I found myself having to visually check the watch's screen each time to make sure it was pausing and resuming correctly, as pressing the crown and side button didn't always register properly. It would be great if the watch could sense when I've stopped at the wall to rest and automatically pause my workout and then resume once I push off the wall on my next swim. It obviously starts to get tricky differentiating random arm movements while resting from the start of a new swim with only an accelerometer to go on, but I feel like there could be some improvements made here. I'd also love a way to edit workouts after the fact to include untracked activities such as kick sets and drills, even if it's just adding in the yardage. For now, I'm using a third-party app like MyFitnessPal to create a second workout to estimate my calories burned for the portions of my workouts the Apple Watch can't track. Finishing Up Your Workout At the end of your workout, the Apple Watch app displays a summary of your session, including the time of day the activity took place, dominant stroke used, distance, workout time, pool length, laps completed, average pace, average heart rate, and both active and total calories burned, as well as the weather at your location. All of that data gets synced over to the Activity app on your iPhone, where it's visible in the Workouts tab. A bonus view on the iPhone lets you break down the average pace number and see your pace for each 100-yard segment of the workout. And of course the exercise and calorie data also automatically syncs over to the Health app on the iPhone, as well as third-party apps hooked into HealthKit, to help track your overall health status. Open Water Swimming Aside from pool swims, the Apple Watch Series 2 can also track open water swims in the Workout app. I'm not as much of a fan of open water swimming and so I haven't had a chance to test that function out, but it operates in a similar fashion to pool workouts, allowing you to set a goal for time, distance, or calories, or leave an open goal. As with pool swims, you can customize the metrics shown on the Apple Watch's display during a workout using the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. The default metrics are duration, active calories, burned, average pace, and distance, but these can be rearranged or swapped out for total calories burned and heart rate metrics from your iPhone. Once you hit "Start" it will track your swimming progress, and as long as you are using a freestyle stroke it will use GPS to plot your location and speed while the accelerometer tracks your calories burned. Once your open water swim is completed, you can view a map of your route within the Workout entry in the Activity app on your phone. Wrap-up Plenty of serious and not-so-serious swimmers and triathletes already wear fitness watches to track their workouts, but this is my first foray into wrist-worn swim tracking. I like the tracking the Apple Watch can provide in pool swims to help keep tabs on my yardage, heart rate, and calories burned, and it's something I'll likely continue playing with. It's great for tracking long workouts with a minimum of stopping. If you're doing sets of short swims or varied sets involving drills or kicking, it can be frustrating to have that activity go untracked or to have to manage pausing and unpausing the tracking to separate swimming from resting intervals. Frequent focusing on the watch to ensure it's tracking accurately and at the right times can also divert your attention from the actual swimming, although that will likely improve over time as I gain familiarity with using the watch in the pool. For those reasons, the Apple Watch Series 2 may not yet become an everyday swim tracker for me, although I'll keep experimenting with it to figure out the best way to incorporate it into my workouts to provide the best data with minimum disruption to my workout focus. Where the new Apple Watch could be a major benefit, however, is for open water swimmers. The lengthy freestyle swims are ideal for tracking with the Apple Watch, and the watch's GPS should make it a great tool for tracking those lake and ocean swims where it's difficult to estimate how far you've swum. It's certainly not the first GPS swim tracking watch, but for open water swimmers it's a great addition to an Apple Watch they can wear throughout the day to provide a host of other functions.

If you are serious about the sport it's best to get a dedicated watch made for it. The AW tries hard to be a Jack-Of-All-Trades and truly is a master of none when it comes to sports tracking. It's a good activity tracker and huge convenience with notifications, ApplePay, signing in your Mac now. That is where it shines. I'm hoping future iterations of the Nike branded AW becomes more of a unique, dedicated sports tracking watch than the marketing gimmick it is with the upcoming release. Apple needs to start designing sports watchs as sports watches rather than just slapping a name and unique band on the same watch that is in the other AW lines. Rating: 14 Votes WildCowboy 8 weeks ago Even with a rating of "waterproof," I wouldn't take my Apple watch into the ocean (saltwater). Does anyone known if Apple has commented how ocean-proof the new watch is? Apple officially says it's okay to use in the ocean. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205000 Apple Watch Series 2 may be used for shallow water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean. One of our readers also emailed Jeff Williams to specifically ask about using the Nike version while surfing. Here's the reply he got: Nike only comes in Aluminum. If you rinse with fresh water after surfing, you should be great. We actually conduct out salt water corrosion testing without rinsing, and the watch performs well. That said, given you surf daily, I'd recommend rinsing. Rating: 8 Votes 69Mustang 8 weeks ago Nice informative article. We need more posts like this. Kudos. Even with a rating of "waterproof," I wouldn't take my Apple watch into the ocean (saltwater). Does anyone known if Apple has commented how ocean-proof the new watch is? Not picking on you, but I wish this "waterproof" misunderstanding would go away. The watch isn't waterproof and afaik there is no, nor has there ever been, such a thing as ocean-proof. The Apple Watch has a water resistance (WR) rating, not a waterproof rating. It will never have a waterproof rating, especially in the US where it's prohibited from advertising a watch as waterproof. Apparently, the warranty is not clear about it, it only says you shouldn't misuse it and it's marketed to be used in a pool. Frankly, I'd still be way happier with a waterproof certification. You'll never get one. Here's a good explanation in layman's terms. It's from CNet so watch out for the abhorrent autoplay video pop up. Water resistance v Waterproof ('https://www.cnet.com/how-to/water-dust-resistance-ratings-in-gadgets-explained/') /rant over. apologies. Rating: 6 Votes cult hero 8 weeks ago I wonder how long can last sport bands trough heavy swimming sessions Only kinda-sorta related but I have a pair of sport bands—one of them I picked up a week ago. I do a lot of running and weightlifting in mine and I can say that close to a year of doing so has taken away the "soft" feel of the original. The new one feels much nicer when I put it on. It's probably a combination of drying out and getting a little more rigid. The band is still fine and by no means uncomfortable, but there is a pretty noticeable difference in the sport bands over time. As someone who does a variety of workouts, often in an impromptu manner, I really like the watch (and especially after the latest OS update). The jack-of-all-trades is extremely useful. And there's the added bonus of my phone being silent most of the time. Rating: 5 Votes BuddyTronic 8 weeks ago You can call it "Mary" if you want, but that doesn't mean it meets the accepted definition of waterproof. Keep in mind that the depth ratings are shorthand for withstanding a specific pressure - and once you start thrashing it around through the water - by swimming, say - you're actually causing significantly more pressure to be exerted upon it. If you take a "50 meter watch" to 50 meters deep (or even 49) and start swimming around with it, I think you may become rather sad at the outcome. I now understand - thanks for taking the time to explain a bit more. "resistant" is the way to get out of warranty issues. Nevertheless I will abuse the hell out of my Apple Watch S2 and see what happens. First one did pretty good. I'm definitely going to shower with it after swims and definitely going to have shampoo around it. It will all be fine, and if I break it, I'll buy another and be "careful" I guess. This stuff becomes junk after a year anyway, and the money I blow on it is a tax deduction for my work as a developer, and good for my health - I need all the motivations I can get to keep the beer belly away. Money can be replaced, but the time it takes to baby my iPhone is a real waste of time. So many guys I see have iPhone 5's in "mint" condition with no scratches - whoop-dee-doo. Mine is covered with scratches and worth 50 bucks less usually so I never understood why people want to keep the precious iPhone so pristine - same for the watch, and same for anything that doesn't have a beating heart inside :) Just my way of looking at it. Rating: 3 Votes 69Mustang 8 weeks ago Apple Watch S2 certification is very confusing! up to 50 m.. what about dust resistance? does it even have dust resistance? because obsiously is not mentioned So Macrumors.. how about you stop praising Apple Watch S2! because when it comes to water and dust resistance the iPhone 7 destroys the Apple Watch S2!!! The confusion comes from two different types of certifications. Water resistance on watch v IP rating on phone. Water resistance on the watch is and ISO rating. Specifically, ISO 2281-2010 per Apple's description: "Apple Watch Series 2 has a water resistance rating of 50 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010. This means that it may be used for shallow-water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean. However, Apple Watch Series 2 should not be used for scuba diving, waterskiing, or other activities involving high-velocity water or submersion below shallow depth." The iPhone 7's IP67 rating says that it stops the ingress of water from a depth of 1m for up to 30 minutes. So it's definitely not more water resistant. Dust resistant? I can't say. The AW has never listed it's level of dust resistance. The original and Series 1 watch only state IPX7 which gives an indication of water resistance but no dust resistance. Rating: 3 Votes needsomecoffee 8 weeks ago Masters swimmer... 99% of the time we swim a work out coach has posted on a white board. Rest between every interval. Surely there is a masters swimmer soon to be located at the giant donut who could write an app in which a coach could post his/her workout, and swimmers could DL to their watches. Pressing the crown between each interval is nothing. Watch is then tracking a per interval workout rather than the whole shebang. Swimmers could upload their results after practice, coach could analyze, teams could compete (social factor), etc. I guess neither Tim nor Jony nor Eddie spend much time in the pool. Time to delegate to a masters swimmer with some chlorinated passion - surely there are many at Cupertino. Finally two points: 1) 3300 yds / 131 laps = 25.29 yds per laps. Did the author enter this value for lap length, or is this an error (yikes). 2) Author did not mention any strokes per lap calc - is this righteous stat is available???

Post the deal, two of Tuplejump's co-founders -- Rohit Rai and Satyaprakash Buddhavarapu -- have joined Apple, industry sources said. When contacted, Apple in an emailed statement said: "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans." Artificial intelligence has become a key area of focus and investment for tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook that are competing head-on as they develop products like virtual assistants and bots. The Cupertino-based company is betting big on the Indian market. In July, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said that India is one of its fastest growing markets. Earlier this year, Apple had announced setting up of a new office in Hyderabad to accelerate maps development, apart from a design and development accelerator centre in Bengaluru to support Indian developers creating innovative applications for iOS. Besides, sales of its iconic smartphone iPhone also grew 51 per cent year-on-year in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. Apple chief Tim Cook, who visited India in May, had also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss various topics, including manufacturing and setting up retail stores in the country.

Here's our guide on how to use Auto Unlock for the Mac series in macOS Sierra version 10.12. For our complete guide to using macOS Sierra, head over here. macOS Sierra continues to connect with other devices Pushing the connectivity message further, Apple now allows you to unlock your computer without even having to type in the password. Using your Apple Watch and Bluetooth connectivity, your Mac computer (desktop or Macbook laptop) will recognize it’s you before you even put your hands on the keyboard. Here’s how to enable Auto Unlock for your Mac with your Apple Watch: first, make sure that your Mac is running Sierra, and has Bluetooth turned on ("System Preferences" > "Bluetooth" > "Turn Bluetooth On"). Your Apple Watch needs to be running watch OS3, and must have a passcode enabled. Then, make sure both your Mac and Apple Watch are logged in to the same iCloud account. After that’s established, you have to go into “System Preferences” on your Mac computer. Then go into the “Security & Privacy” menu, which you can find in the top row. Corey Mueller/Popular Science The 'Security & Privacy' menu in macOS Sierra You need to click this to set up your Apple Watch as a way of unlocking your Mac. On the “General” menu, there should be an option that says “Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac.” Check that box, and you’re almost there! You also have to enable Apple’s two-factor authentication for this to work, if you don’t already use that. Now, to the actual unlocking part. Lock your Mac and walk a fair distance away. Manually unlock your Apple Watch, walk back to your computer and open it up. Press any button to get it out of sleep mode, and a message should appear under your name and icon saying, “Unlocking with Apple Watch…” and, if it all runs smoothly, voila, unlocked computer.

Today we’ll take a deep-dive into what has become my daily driver in the true wireless earbud world. Earin true wireless earbuds really feel like the perfect package, if only they had included two more things… Design | Charging Capsule The first time I saw the Earin’s charging case for its true wireless earbuds, I immediately thought, “This is how Apple might have designed wireless earbuds back in the PowerBook G4 and Power Mac G5 days.” The Earin charging case looks like a mix between Apple’s iSight Camera and Men in Black’s Neuralyzer. The small lipstick styled capsule slides out to reveal two tucked away and charging earbuds. Charging status is indicated by a small red LED light built into the top portion of the charging case. Maintaining the simple profile is a micro-USB port meant to charge the capsule itself, where another LED indicator is tucked away. The striped top half of the charging case helps provide some grip when sliding out the charging case’s earbud tray, which pulls out with a satisfying click. The tray itself is a little strange to deal with. The earbuds sort of snap-in and out of the plastic tray, but the first few times in doing so I felt as if I was going to break the earbuds. In removing an earbud, the gold charging contacts within the case are made visible and the earbud’s design choice of outer gold lowercase ‘e’ becomes evident. The visual design, which I thought was nothing more than that, allows the earbud to easily charge within the case by giving it multiple points of contact inside the charging case. The charging case not only acts as a storage and charging device, but whenever an earbud is pulled from the capsule it immediately turns on. This creates a really seamless experience but provides annoyances whenever the earbuds refuse to connect to your devices. Even worse, if the charging capsule’s battery dies and your earbuds technically still have battery life remaining and you just placed them in the capsule for storage, getting the earbuds to turn back on is annoyingly difficult. It seems that whenever the capsule’s battery dies, the Earin has no way of knowing when to turn back on. Design | Earbuds The earbuds are elegant and simplistic in design, and it’s something I’ve come to appreciate tremendously. They look as though you picked up any normal pair of in-ear earbuds and just snipped the wires. The design is familiar and comforting. No buttons, no touch sensitive areas, just a singular earbud. The earbuds are slightly curved at an inward angle to help provide better insertion and hold when sitting in the ear. This is possibly my first gripe with the earbuds. It took quite a long time until I could find an ideal position in my ears. Image Credit: Earin Setup Guide While Earin’s setup guide indicates that a good fit would be by facing the earbuds with the L and R symbols facing behind you, I found that it worked better when it was actually facing forward away from me. It sat more comfortably in my ear, but more importantly didn’t feel as though it was going to quickly fall out. To help ensure a locked-in fit, Earin includes two additional earpiece accessories they call Stabilizers. These comma-shaped pieces fit around the earbuds and hook into your ears to ensure an even better hold. I spent some time testing the earbuds with and without the Stabilizers and didn’t find much of a difference in fit. While I could feel the Stabilizers in my ears, they didn’t feel as though they added much support. This changed when I went on a few runs with the earbuds. Without the Stabilizers, I definitely felt the earbuds slowly slide out and around my ears. Adding the Stabilizers helped hold the earbuds in better and gave me more peace of mind while running with them. Comfort One of my biggest concerns with any pair of true wireless earbuds will be the overall comfort. Getting a pair of earbuds to sit in an ear canal comfortably, while fitting the general population can be difficult. Apple took a shot at this by creating their EarPods, but even with those, I know people who find them uncomfortable. The Earin earbuds provided no exception. Although they look like a pair of regular earbuds with the cord cut, I was still concerned with the fact that these earbuds would fully rely on sitting inside my ear canal to not fall out. The Earin includes multiple replacement ear tips to help each user find their most comfortable choices. Including two rubber tips, and two Comply(TM) foam tips, I landed on using the smallest rubber tips for best comfort. Truth be told I run into this problem with every pair of earbuds. Even the smallest rubber tips feel too big in my ear, and over time it feels like the pieces are “expanding” in my ears. For reasons like that I’ve stuck with the Apple EarPods for so long. They don’t rely on sitting deep in the ear canal to get a comfortable fit. Regardless of the slight discomfort all earbud rubber tips provide me, the Earin earbuds weremore comfortable than most. I frequently forgot they were in my ear and even have had music stop and I just left them in as earplugs. The design of the Earin earbuds created a nice seal from the outside world where the music is really focused only on you. I know some earbuds have begun to implement something akin to “active listening” which creates a blend of your music with outside noises so as to not have you miss anything from the outside world that may be important. I think this is the direction all wireless earbuds may eventually need to move to, and having that in future Earin earbuds would be something nice to have. Audio After my last experience with true wireless earbuds, I fully expected a degraded audio quality with the Earin too. They blew me away by not sounding as if any quality was lost, but by also provided a better overall sound quality than the EarPods. This isn’t something to write home about as I know better earbuds do exist, but the sound quality was great for what they were. Trebles were clear and in the forefront without overriding the mids or bass. The bass was light, without muddling the rest, though it did leave a lot to be desired. I wish the bass was a bit more, and I think that’s why Earin included a Bass Boost option within their iOS app. I wasn’t fan of the bass boosted audio though as it felt more like it just muddled the bass instead of adding to it. The mids sometimes felt too light, and almost missing in some music. The treble would be clear alongside the bass, but sometimes the mids would feel like the background accessory to the other two. In the Syllable D900s review, I complained that the audio was completely out of balance, and I had to jump into iOS’ settings to manually rebalance the audio. The Earin didn’t have this problem nearly as much, but I did appreciate that their iOS app had a way to adjust for it. See more in the iOS App section below. Bluetooth Connectivity and Range No matter how great the sound or overall experience a pair of true wireless earbuds may bring, they will always face the trouble of the wireless protocol it relies on. Apple recognized this and is putting a focus on its advantage of the W1 chip as potentially helping alleviate these issues. That being said, when the Earin was within clear view, the range provided to be solid and hold well past 10 meters. Image Credit: Earin Setup Guide The range on the Earin was much better than expected, but users should be aware of device/iPhone placement when using them. Earin’s user guide explains to users that depending on where they place their device, specifically behind them, that interference would occur. Looking at the reviews for the Earin on Amazon, a lot of customers complained that the earbuds would disconnect from one another and sort of create a “swaying” audio experience. The last pair of true wireless earbuds I tested also had this issue, and I’m beginning to foresee this being a problem for all true wireless earbuds. This swaying audio experience occurs whenever one of the earbuds disconnects from the other, and then quickly reconnects. In my case the Earin would play audio fine to both earbuds, then the right earbud would disconnect, and then quickly reconnect. Normally it took only half a second to reconnect until it just decided not to… This brings up the most annoying experience in using the Earin earbuds; more often than I felt comfortable with the earbuds would disconnect from each other and have no way of reconnecting. In the previously described audio sway scenario, I often had the right earbud fully disconnect and never reconnect to the left earbud. The only way to get them to reconnect and communicate with one another again was to place them inside the charging capsule and then pull them back out. This “reset“ them, as putting it in the case and removing it powered them off and on again. Tie this in with the strange dead capsule battery issue listed under the charging case section above, and you have an overall annoying experience in what should be so much simpler. This is the area that really makes the lack of any buttons on the Earin a detriment to the experience. More on that later. Battery Life As companies continue to release true wireless earbuds, battery life will be at the forefront of the competition. Most people hate charging their devices (something I don’t really mind at all), but more importantly having to charge in the middle of the day can be quite the nuisance. This is where the Earin shined for me. Earin states the batteries should last for roughly 2 hours and 50 minutes, and I found this estimation to hold true. I would listen to music on the Earin earbuds for up to 3 hours straight at a time without needing to recharge them at all. At first, I thought it was a fluke, but I kept repeating the results over and over again. This happened so much so that I just began using the Earin as my everyday earbuds over my EarPods. I don’t frequently find myself listening to audio for more than a few hours at a time, so the inconvenience of charging the Earin in its storage capsule was anything but. iOS App Earin includes an iOS app with the earbuds that can help improve the experience a little further. The most important feature for me that they included was the ability to adjust the earbuds’ audio balancing. In the Syllable D900s review, my biggest complaint was that the audio was totally imbalanced and I had to go into the iOS’ accessibility settings to account for it. The Earin app allows me to quickly adjust the balancing, even though I only found myself moving the balance to the left by one point. (I’m realizing more and more that my left ear may not be hearing audio as loud and clear as my right ear.) The app also includes a Bass Boost option which I never kept on. It reminds me of the Bass Boost option old boomboxes from the 90s had. A “good” idea in theory, but in practice the sound never improved by enabling it. Earin’s app also gives users the ability to check individual battery gauges for each earbud, although this means users can’t check battery life using iOS’ battery widget. I would sometimes use the left earbud in a mono mode to play music, and being able to check out the battery left in that earbud in the app was a nice touch. Future Wishes I could delve so much deeper into this, but without getting too crazy, the Earin really needs to add some form of a button onto the earbuds. The lack of any means I miss out on playing/pausing music, answering/declining calls, and adjusting volume all from the earbuds. Luckily I have an Apple Watch that quickly allows me to do all of that, but for someone who doesn’t own a Watch, going back to the phone just to adjust for these simple actions is nothing but annoying. Even the cheap Apple EarPods include all of these features within a three button system. Second, I really wish Earin would a microphone in future designs. I mentioned how comfortable the Earin was, and how I frequently left them in even when the music was paused. Having to pull them out and refine their positioning just to answer a phone call was tiresome. It pulled me away from my “all-in” working mode I would normally get into when I wore these. Conclusion Without a doubt, the Earin true wireless earbuds have become my latest daily drivers. While I love some of the quality of my other headphones, they can’t beat the comfort and usability of the Earin earbuds. I truly hope to see future iterations include a multipurpose button and microphone for taking phone calls. For now, the Earin is my favorite true wireless earbuds package. Being able to quickly pull them out, fully charged, and just get to listening was an experience I want to have with all true wireless earbuds. While working on this review I kept toying with the idea of comparing the Earin earbuds to Apple’s upcoming AirPods, but I decided against it. The AirPods’ specs on paper look like they may beat out the Earin earbuds, but until I get them in my hands for a full experience, I don’t find it fair to compare. Keep an eye out, though, as soon as Apple’s AirPods are available, we’ll be doing another deep-dive and comparison against them. Earin’s true wireless earbuds are available to purchase from Amazon at $199 with Prime shipping or from Earin directly at $199 (with free shipping).

The iPhone maker's shares fell to a low of $111.15 a share before closing down 1.7 percent at $112.71 a share. Declines accelerated after a report from market research company GfK that supposedly raised concerns about sales of the latest iPhone. The findings are based on point-of-sale data in 17 countries during the launch weekend. GfK confirmed the existence of the report to CNBC, but said it is exclusively for subscribers, and would not divulge its contents. Meanwhile, a separate report in technology website Digitimes indicated that chip orders for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will likely fall about 20 percent sequentially in the first quarter of 2017, citing chip suppliers. Strong preorders for the device last week had helped Apple shares jump 11.4 percent in their best week since October 2011. Apple had said it would not release first weekend sales figures for the newest iPhones, which hit stores last Friday. Tech was the second-worst performer in the S&P 500 on Friday. Among the movers were Apple suppliers Skyworks, down more than 3 percent, and Qorvo, down more than 2 percent. Apple makes up about 14 percent of the weighting of Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, and the fund dropped close to 1 percent. CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Shop with Apple Pay on macOS Sierra Apple Pay, once the domain of iPhone and Watch users, has arrived on macOS Sierra. Here’s how to use it. Right now, the number of online merchants accepting Apple Pay is somewhat small, but you can expect that number to grow as more and more get on board. To use Apple Pay on your Mac, make sure you’re first set up to use it. You will still need an iPhone to complete Apple Pay transactions, and ensure that Continuity is working between your iPhone and Mac as well. Additionally, this feature will only work on Safari. To use Apple Pay on your Mac, we first go to a website that supports it. Naturally, Apple.com is already set up to handle such transactions, so we’ll perform an example transaction there. First, select an item and place it in your bag. If the site supports it, you’ll see a “Check out with Apple Pay” option. Go through the rest of the transaction, and click the black Apple Pay button. A dialog will then appear prompting you to confirm the transaction on your iPhone. You’ll then be prompted on your iPhone to confirm by placing your finger on the Touch ID sensor. If you’re using your Apple Watch to pay, then you will need to press the side button twice to complete the transaction. That’s it. Once the transaction is completed, you will be presented with a transaction confirmation and e-mailed an invoice. RELATED ARTICLES How to Set up Apple Pay and Google Wallet on Your Phone How to Make Macs and iOS Devices Work Together Seamlessly with Continuity If you have doubts about using Apple Pay to buy things on the Internet, then rest assured, it’s more secure than using a credit or debit card. With each transaction, Apple Pay uses a single-use token, which means that it doesn’t transmit your card information during the sale. Instead, the process takes place between your Mac and iPhone or Watch. Apple itself describes the process as such: When you use Apple Pay to make a purchase on your Mac in Safari, Apple Pay transfers purchase information in an encrypted format between your Mac and your iOS device or Apple Watch to complete your transaction. Like we said, right now the number of supported websites is small, but that’s likely to change in the coming months. In the meantime, be on the lookout for the black Apple Pay logo, because it means you won’t have to go searching for your purse or wallet to retrieve your card.

The video is definitely worth checking out for some laughs. Thanks to the most advanced folded paper technology, and Apples new W1 chip, Apple has the power to deliver the worlds most intelligent bag. The "AirBag" features IR motion sensors, which automatically detects moisture, weight, and fullness and can transmit its status to your iPhone. The "AirBag"s battery also offers up to 3 hours of carrying power, a direct poke at the AirPods 5 hour battery. The "AirBag" comes with a standard 5lbs capacity, or you can opt for the "AirBag Plus" which offers 10lbs capacity.

Peculiar puck-shaped Apple gadget gets certified By Jacob Kleinman | September 23, 2016 Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo It’s been just over a year since the 4th-generation Apple TV was unveiled, bringing tons of the new capabilities to the set-top box. We’re not necessarily expecting another physical refresh anytime soon, but a recent FCC filing suggests the company might just be working on an update. A mysterious new gadget passed through the U.S. regulatory agency earlier this month. An image of the proposed label shows an Apple TV-style design with a similar shape and screw placement. The device also offers Bluetooth and NFC support. There’s no mention of Wi-Fi, but it’s possible Apple is simply reusing the same wireless hardware from earlier models. There’s plenty of room for improvement with a 5th-generation Apple TV, including 4K and HDR support along with upgraded internal specs. It’s also possible the company could be working on something else entirely. The use of NFC suggests it could be some sort of point-of-sale terminal for Apple Pay. Or maybe it’ll make pairing even easier than the current Bluetooth option. This might even be the company’s rumored smart home hub. Apple is expected to hold at least one more major event this year to unveil its new MacBook lineup and a few other products. We may just see this mysterious gadget make an appearance at the same time, though it’s also possible the company could keep us waiting until next year or longer.

Here's our guide on how to use Apple Music on the MacBook series in macOS Sierra version 10.12. For our complete guide to using macOS Sierra, head over here. Apple Music on your computer Finally, Apple’s push for online music streaming has found it’s way to your desktop. And it's very much in line with the redesign that Apple Music got in iOS 10. If you don't have Apple Music already, you'll need to get a subscription first: it costs $9.99 a month, $4.99 a month for students, and $14.99 a month for a family of up to 6 people, each with their own devices. Cleaner and more user friendly, the new version of Apple Music has stayed consistent between its iPhone app and its larger counterpart. Much like the app, your Mac’s Apple Music now has music curated by AI, its own staff, and outside sources like Rolling Stone, Disney, and even Carnegie Hall. You can discover these under the “Curated Playlists” tab in the “Browse” section of Apple Music. Corey Mueller/Popular Science The Curated Playlist section of Apple Music Under "Browse," you'll find a "Curated Playlists" tab. In this, you'll get can get album and playlist suggestions based on your mood, your listening habits, or by people in the industry. In the “For You” tab, suggested playlists and albums that are both delivered and updated daily to bring new music to your ears. This has suggestions from real editors of the genres you like and from artificial intelligence that scans your preferences and listening habits. You can also use the "Connect" tab to get exclusive information directly from your favorite bands. You can even go in and edit by clicking on the "Find More Artists and Curators" button, expanding the numerous music suggestions Apple Music already makes. Corey Mueller/Popular Science The Connect tab in Apple Music The feature that lets you follow specific artists. It’s super user-friendly and easy to navigate, which is helpful for music listening and discovery. You can add whatever music you happen upon to your library simply by clicking on the “...” in the blue circle on the right-hand side of the screen. Click “Add to Library” and it should be available for you, as well as available for download in your iPhone Music app -- given that your iCloud account is the same on both. Corey Mueller/Popular Science Add the album you just discovered to your Library Click this for more options, then simply press "Add to Library," and boom, new music at your disposal. Apple Music’s desktop presence is a huge step at continuing to take on Spotify, considering that Apple Music was difficult before the iOS 10 and macOS updates. The throne for music streaming services is no longer just on mobile devices, the turf has now been expanded to computers.

Trending in Apple How Apple’s stock apps will use the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro [Gallery] February 16 AAPL: 96.64 2.65 Outspoken Apple investor Carl Icahn dumps 7M shares of AAPL stock for $750M Jordan Kahn - 9 months ago @JordanKahn iOS Devices Photo via: Huffington Post Comments (19) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Activist investor Carl Icahn, who on several occasions in the past has published open letters offering advice to Apple on stock related issues, has reportedly cut his stake in the company. CNBC reports that a filing discovered today shows Icahn has cut his shares by approximately 7 million, valued at approximately $750M, to 45.7 million shares as of December 31st, 2015. But it’s unclear exactly the motivation behind the move by Icahn, who has long been an outspoken advocate of the company and its stock performance. Icahn has been quite vocal about Apple as he continued to increase his stake in the company up until now. The main issue at the heart of Icahn’s prodding of Apple and CEO Tim Cook has been regarding shareholder buybacks and related initiatives that Apple has put more of a focus on in recent years. As for February last year, Icahn was one of the company’s ten largest shareholders with around $6.5B worth of stock and was publicly boasting about Apple being undervalued as it hit its highest market cap ever. Following the milestone for Apple, Icahn said he had “gained further confidence” in Apple and that he believed “the market should value Apple at $216 per share.” Icahn continued, “This is why we continue to own approximately 53 million shares worth $6.5 billion, and why we have not sold a single share.” On December 31st, 2015, the day Icahn reportedly reduced his stake in Apple by 7 million shares, the company hit a high of 107.03 per share. It has declined since– around 15%– and today hit a high of 96.85 per share. That’s an almost $100M difference in the stock value on those 7 million shares on the day Icahn sold versus today.

That carried them for a few years after his passing but Apple has now been fading for a while. Just look at the turnout for the iPhone 7. Icahn knows that it’s time to jump ship. Good luck going down with it captain. LikeLike WaltFrench - 9 months ago Reply Unless there’s more info not reported here, it’s ALSO unclear the actual dates (which should be a good guide to the price) on which he sold the bulk of his position. (Yes, you can trade millions of shares of AAPL or other stocks in one day but generally don’t panic and risk pushing your sale price down.) Might’ve caused that little dip in November, so he only got $118 or so. I sure don’t know. But he probably saved himself quite a bit more than the guesstimate above. He could have turned around a few days ago and bought all the shares back for $94 each a couple of days ago, and had a few dozen million to put into a helluva night on the town. Again, I don’t have the detail reports but usually you have a while to file, and you DON’T want to let others see your plans before you’re required to report. Also, I don’t advocate that others consider buying and/or selling quickly; it’s more likely to work against you than for you. Seems the mercurial—but also, extremely successful—Mr. Icahn held a solid position for many months.

And sure enough, he bails as when it suits him. Of course that’s the game isn’t it? It’s all about me me me and not anyone else. Make a buck regardless of the company itself or anyone else. The free market at work. LikeLike Rolf Haug (@rolfhaug) - 9 months ago Reply There was way more to it than that – Cook was praised for issuing those bonds. They were calling him “Tim Cook the banker”. Their first issuance in 2013, they literally nailed the bottom of the bond market. He was able to borrow that money at 1.6% interest. Way better than bringing back their overseas money at a 35% tax rate. At those types of interest rates to finance a dividend and buyback, you’re basically making money on your debt. They wouldn’t have to borrow this money though if Congress would reform the damn tax code. But creating that dividend and buyback changes the investor base. It changed AAPL from a high volatility trading stock with huge swings up and down, to an investor base thats more steady – dividend investors don’t tend to sell in and out constantly. They hold and collect the dividend. It puts a floor under the stock. There’s lots of funds that were never able to add AAPL to their portfolio because it didn’t pay a dividend. It opened it up to a whole new class of funds and investors. That and the split also helped it get added to the DJIA. Besides – Icahn still owns 46 million Apple shares – he only sold 7 million. Large investors always make sales at the end of the year to help pay some of their tax bills. LikeLiked by 1 person Smigit - 9 months ago Reply If Tom Cook did something Icahn was asking for its because it made sense for Apple to do it, not because they were bending over to a single shareholder. Icahn asked for a great deal of many things over the last 24 minutes the and Apple certainly didn’t bend over to deliver on all accounts.

Apple stock is a dog which only serves Apple executives who hold millions of shares. The small retail investors are getting almost nothing but a 2% dividend which is better than nothing. There are no significant share gains ahead for loyal shareholders. Playing Wall Street is a game for investors like Icahn who almost always win big. It’s hard to imagine Apple’s share price being stuck under $100 for the rest of 2016 but the way Apple is going it isn’t likely to get any better. All Apple knows how to do now is take on debt and never come up with any good acquisitions. LikeLike Rolf Haug (@rolfhaug) - 9 months ago Reply That all depends when you got in – Apple has always been tough as a trade but great if you just own it. Even at these lower levels I’m up almost 50%. Icahn isn’t the type of investor who gets into momentum stocks like FANG; they go up huge but you can get crushed in the blink of an eye. He’s also been there and done that with Netflix back when it had great value. He bought into Netflix in 2012 at around $50 a share (pre-split) and sold it mid 2015 for a $1.6 billion profit. Momentum stocks that run one year don’t tend to repeat the following year.

Trending in Apple How Apple’s stock apps will use the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro [Gallery] April 6, 2015 How-To: Choose the best stand or desktop mount for Apple’s iPads and Macs Jeremy Horwitz - 2 years ago @horwitz Feature iPad MacBook Pro Mac MacBook iPad Air 2 Comments (13) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple currently sells more “laptop” than “desktop” Macs, but in reality, most Macs will be used substantially on flat surfaces — desks, tables, and sometimes nightstands. iPads are more lap-friendly, but also tend to get used upright, particularly for watching videos and access in the kitchen. Since I’ve spent a lot of time testing Apple device stands and mounts, I wanted to share what I’ve learned with you, so you can choose the solution that best suits your Mac, iPad, or both at the same time. Below, I’ve hand-picked options for different types of users, starting with passive MacBook stands such as Twelve South’s BookArc for MacBook Pro ($50). Made from Mac-matching aluminum with gray rubber inserts, BookArc is designed to safely hold a MacBook Pro upright so that its ports and SD card reader are easily accessible. Twelve South also sells a smaller version of BookArc for the MacBook Air, a bigger BookArc for the Mac Pro, and an earthy version called BookArc mod for fans of wood. That’s a rarity, as most Mac and iPad stands are designed to match Apple’s products, as you’ll see inside… The passive MacBook stand options continue with Rain Design’s mTower ($50), a futuristic cradle that manages to riff on Apple’s design themes without looking derivative. Made from a single piece of sandblasted aluminum, it can accommodate any MacBook model from the 11″ Air to the discontinued 17″ Pro thanks to rubber inserts hidden inside. It has the least conspicuous use of non-metal materials, if that matters to you. My personal MacBook Pro sits inside a Cooler Master L-Stand ($39). Viewed from the long side, it looks like a metal L, with a boxy (rubber-lined) hole for the MacBook. Mirrored accents on the box give it a really nice touch of added style in person. While L-Stand is large enough to accommodate every MacBook from the 11″ Air to the 17″ Pro, it doesn’t have any special inserts for the thinner models, which will consequently lean inside the frame. I’d call this best-suited to Pro models, and not as great for Airs (or the upcoming 12″ MacBook). Another set of options comes from Henge Docks, which makes the Vertical Docking Station for MacBook Pro with Retina display ($94) and a Metal Edition version. One really nice thing about these solutions is that they manage all of the cables that go into a MacBook’s left side — power, USB, audio, and Thunderbolt — so all you need to do is (carefully) insert your MacBook Pro inside for connection to your monitor, speakers, and other peripherals. Just be aware of two issues: Henge ships its docks with Mini DisplayPort cables rather than Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt 2 connectors, and all of the connections can be difficult to make correctly unless you do a little fiddling with the plugs to make sure they’re being held in the right places. Active MacBook Stands Perhaps the most popular Mac stands are “active” stands for MacBooks — ones that are designed to make Apple’s laptops feel more like desktop machines. The #1 best-selling laptop stand at Amazon is Rain Design’s mStand ($45), a sturdy single-piece aluminum design with rubber padding to protect both the MacBook and the desk underneath. With a nearly 6″ lift off the table’s surface, mStand enables you to raise and angle the MacBook’s screen to your chosen height, which helps both with visibility and FaceTime calls — no longer will your chin be the focus of video chats. Cables can be managed with a hole in the stand’s back, too. Gorgeously designed with spring-loaded, adjustable support, Twelve South’s HiRise for MacBook ($70) has the ability to raise any MacBook Air or Pro from two to six inches off a table. It’s made from steel with rubber pads for the MacBook and plastic on the bottom, enabling you to rotate the stand around. HiRise is the rare MacBook stand that can bring different MacBooks to the same height as Apple’s monitors, adjusting to the needs of different Mac sizes. Note that some users have complained that the MacBook can slip off its angled V-shaped holder when it’s not in use. There are also a couple of interesting MacBook stands designed for portable use. BlueLounge’s Kickflip comes in 13″ ($18) and 15″ ($20) versions, each a hard plastic hinge that attaches to the bottom of the MacBook, folding open to securely prop the machine up for easier typing. I really liked the fact that Kickflip is so easy to fold down when it’s not being used. Twelve South sells a lot of other MacBook stands, and I’ve had mixed feelings about them — some are much, much better than others. The company’s alternative to Kickflip is called Baselift ($40), a plastic and microfiber pad that attaches to the bottoms of Macs to elevate them as needed. Reviews have been mixed overall, but most positive when used with the 11″ MacBook Air, which doesn’t have a version of Kickflip to call its own. iMac + Thunderbolt Display Stands While iMacs and Thunderbolt Displays don’t need stands, there’s legitimate value in reclaiming some of the space underneath them to use as a storage compartment. I personally use and really love Just Mobile’s Drawer ($85), which sits comfortably under 21″ and 27″ iMacs or Thunderbolt Displays, combining a very solid aluminum frame with a black slide-out drawer. The drawer’s front has a large central hole to make opening easy, and the back has two small holes in its upper corners if you want to place cables inside to store peripherals. This is seriously one of my very favorite Mac accessories, and one that gets more use (to declutter my desk, holding batteries for my Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad) than I ever would have guessed.   As an alternative to Drawer, Twelve South’s HiRise for Mac ($80) is smaller and takes a different approach. It’s designed to let you change the height of your iMac or Apple monitor by supporting the monitor’s stand on your choice of inner grooves, leaving the rest of the metal compartment open for storing items. The box has enough room inside for a Mac mini or some hard drives, including a perforated frame for proper ventilation. iPad + Mac Stands If you want a stand that will mount an iPad or iPad mini directly next to your Mac, you have options. Aukey sells the Desk Stand Holder ($36), which combines a gooseneck clamp for your iMac or Apple display with a hard plastic clip that holds your bare iPad, iPad Air, or iPad mini in place. You have to pick the version with the iPad holder that matches your model. Twelve South sells a more deluxe set called HoverBar 3 ($100) that includes clips for iPads, Airs, and minis, plus a desktop kickstand for the detached iPad. iPad Stands As I’ve mentioned in prior reviews, I’m a huge fan of ZeroChroma’s combination iPad stands and cases, which combine everyday protection with the ability to prop the tablet up for easy viewing whenever needed. ZeroChroma’s stands can rotate 360 degrees and support your choice of angles, including everything from video to typing positions. The option I personally use on my iPad Air and iPad Air 2 is Folio-Slide (iPad Air 2 version $70, iPad Air version $40), but you can compromise edge protection and save cash with the basic model Vario-SC (iPad mini version $35, iPad Air version $30). This is seriously my most-used iPad accessory, and the only one I’d feel completely lost without. If you want your iPad to be as slender as possible and don’t mind carrying a stand separately for times when it’s needed, there are lots of generic “tablet stands” out there to choose from. My personal favorite is Belkin’s FlipBlade Adjust ($33), a really well-made and nicely adjustable aluminum stand with rubber lining in all the right places. But Anker makes a less expensive (and very popular) alternative called the Multi-Angle Portable Stand ($10) which is Amazon’s #1 best-selling tablet stand due largely to its pricing. A stand that’s inbetween the others is Lynktec’s 360° Tablet Kickstand ($40), which I recently reviewed here. It uses a residue-free microadhesive to attach to the back of any iPad or virtually any iPad case, adding a sturdy metal kickstand with nearly infinite adjustability. High-quality materials make this a great option. Stands that also charge iPads are relatively uncommon, in part because so many people want their iPads to be upright in landscape orientation — a position that forces charging to take place from the left or right edge. But if you want to use your iPad in portrait orientation while charging, Twelve South’s HiRise ($35, above left) and HiRise Deluxe ($60, above right) both provide nice ways to do that: HiRise is a minimalist iPad Air/iPad mini stand that depends upon a self-supplied Lightning cable for charging, while HiRise Deluxe includes the cable and a more easily adjustable back support. Both can also work with iPhones. Last but not least, if you’re looking for an iPad desktop stand that’s designed to be left on your desk but capable of being adjusted in pretty much any way you prefer, The Joy Factory continues to offer an incredible collection of carbon fiber-assisted stands — some with medical and professional applications. Two of its MagConnect models combine an 8″ adjustable arm with the ability to magnetically grab an included iPad frame: the Desk Stand ($75, left) has a plastic base, while the Tripod and Microphone Stand ($78) can attach to 1/4″ or 5.8″ screw mounts. If you need even more adjustability, the Clamp Mount ($135, right) has two 8″ arms and a clamp to grab your desk or table.

Trending in Apple How Apple’s stock apps will use the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro [Gallery] March 15 AAPL: 104.58 2.06 Feature Request: How Apple could enhance Do Not Disturb and VIP to better control notifications Zac Hall - 8 months ago @apollozac iOS Feature Request Night Shift do not disturb VIP Comments (16) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit There’s a new display and brightness feature in iOS 9.3 called Night Shift which “automatically shifts the colors of your display to the warm end of the color spectrum after dark.” Apple even says that Night Shift “may help you get a better night’s sleep” which is mainly why I’ve been using (and enjoying) the feature during the iOS 9.3 betas. Who doesn’t want a better night’s sleep, right? But Night Shift has me thinking about other ways iOS could be optimized to make our iPhones and iPads less distracting at night. The foundation for what I have in mind is already there: Do Not Disturb and VIP. But both of these features are currently short of where I’d like them to be to work best for me. Here’s what I’d love to see DND and VIP offer: Do Not Disturb is a system-wide setting that silences calls and alerts when active. DND can be enabled and disabled manually or scheduled to turn on and off at a set time each day. VIP is a Mail-specific feature which lets you create alert settings for incoming email specific to certain contacts. By default, new email makes a sound and badges the app icon, but only VIPs appear on the lock screen and Notification Center. For starters, Apple could introduce DND and VIP to each other. You can allow phone calls during DND from certain groups of people: everyone, your Favorites (iPhone only), no one, all contacts, or specific groups of contacts. Optionally, you can also let repeated calls come through; this prevents a second phone call from being silenced when it follows a prior phone call within 3 minutes. Do Not Disturb only makes exceptions for phone calls. VIP only makes exceptions for email. And VIPs don’t get through when Do Not Disturb is enabled. That seems like an oversight due to DND predating VIP. And if DND and VIP could work together as described, Do Not Disturb mode could then scale beyond just being a system-wide-with-phone-call-exceptions feature. Phone calls barely register on my radar compared to iMessages when it comes to communication. What I’d love to do is this: set my wife as a VIP, then have DND let her phone calls and iMessages and emails pass through. The current system-wide-with-phone-call-exceptions approach is way too restrictive for me to use comfortably. I tried scheduling DND last night after thinking about the appeal of Night Shift potentially offering a “better night’s sleep” and other ways to achieve that. Instead of being less bothered by my iPhone, though, I was more distracted. Knowing that zero iMessage alerts could get through, I found myself periodically checking Notification Center to see what I might have missed (nothing). Optionally, Do Not Disturb could go further without VIP (which only easily applies to Apple apps) and be enabled for all apps by default, then turned off on an app-by-app basis. If your contacts use Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp to send important messages that you don’t want to miss, then you could flag these apps as exceptions for DND in their Notifications settings. Beyond this simple expansion, Do Not Disturb mode could get a lot smarter with location-based triggers, not just timed, so you could DND at the office or at home but be on alert when you’re anywhere else. And VIP could expand without DND integration. In Messages, for example, I use a text tone for my wife and mom while messages from anyone else come in silently. I’d set certain contacts to VIP for Messages and let all other messages come in without any alert if possible. Overall, Do Not Disturb is a potentially useful feature and VIP is nice on occasion, but bringing to two features together would make each one better. And expanding DND from a system-wide-with-exceptions-for-phone-calls feature to one with more control would allow me to shush my iPhone on a healthy schedule without worrying about missing an important text alert at night.

When she sleeps over a friend’s house and occasionally has a hard time sleeping, iMessaging me (at any time) is what helps her. Unfortunately what that means the way things are currently set up is that I have to turn DND off for the night, and all that entails, so she can reach me. Because she is with her friends, texting is quiet. Calling me is not. So I would love to have this on so that I would wake up if she texts me at 2 AM. LikeLiked by 3 people Matt Sullivan  (@mattone) - 8 months ago Reply I would like to see Do Not Disturb (DND) simpler to use. On/off from Control Center is good but I often forget that I’ve enabled it. I would like to see a option to turn on DND for 30 mins, 60 mins, etc. Currently, to do this, one must deep dive into Settings and select a time of day. This requires too much thinking (and math) to quickly use. I wish it was more like older microwave oven with a single dial.

To me, the VIP “problem” is more an issue with Contacts groups being next to non-functional on iOS. Secondly, Apple needs to get with the “Tagging Revolution”. If I had more flexibility with how I could tag and “group” Contacts, I think the whole PROCESS would work better overall. Apple seems to be trying to “feature-up” their apps with “fixes” from 1998. It wasn’t scalable then, and certainly moreso dysfunctional now. The need for VIP is a symptom of a disease, and VIP isn’t the cure. You’re right that better integration would help, but I think an entire re-envisioning of Contacts.app is needed. If Contacts.app was a better app (think more CRM, ACT!), it could server as the hub for a lot of these decisions. But the smarter DND is really needed. As @mattone mentions, having a Control Center shortcut for a handful of select durations would be GREAT. I’d like to see DND integrate with Alarms as well; think power naps! Getting to the heavy stuff, Calendars needs to gain a DND checkbox when creating Events. I usually know ahead of time when I’m going to want DND to be on (meetings, court, etc). Which brings that I’d like SUPER DND too (MUTE). I have lawyers for clients; and BOY do judges hate cell phones. When you’re in and out of court rooms a lot (and I’d assume the same could be said for meeting rooms), keeping track of of the Silence switch can be difficult. Location Services probably wouldn’t do good enough, not enough precision. (Maybe this could be a nice area for iBeacon integration? Court rooms, movie theaters…) Personally, I’d prefer a mix. But having Calendars be able to use a “shadow DND” calendar–similar to the Busy/Available blocking–would be a good step. Again, this would be a place where Tags and Smart Rules would shine. I’d love to be able to tag events anyhow, but being able to tag a meeting as a DND or MUTE as well as BILLABLE, CASUAL, PROJECTOR (way to roll in Resources) would be fantastic. Finally, having a choice of a more visual notification on the Lock Screen that the DND or MUTE is currently on would be nice. I’d be just fine with a big ol’ red Ghostbusters circle/slash on there. (Or, probably more to Jony Ive’s liking, a red muted speaker icon.) LikeLiked by 1 person tomtubbs - 8 months ago Reply For these articles – do you make radars / feature requests?

For example, I don’t want to be alerted every time an email comes in from my work email (unless they are VIP). But I do want to be alerted to all personal account emails.

Instead, Apple demanded Peggy Bush, 72, to attain a court order in order to gain access to the account. See the video after the jump for the full story. Initially, Apple said that a death certificate would suffice but the company changed its mind on followup calls, making this situation even more frustrating for Bush. She just wanted to play her iPad freemium card game in peace. Law regarding digital assets after death is murky, although Bush points out that death certificates enabled her to transfer pensions and benefits, making it seem ridiculous that Apple would also not cooperate with the same information. “I thought it was ridiculous. I could get the pensions, I could get benefits, I could get all kinds of things from the federal government and the other government. But from Apple, I couldn’t even get a silly password. It’s nonsense,” 72-year-old Peggy Bush told Go Public. CBC contacted Apple directly, who have since sorted the specific problem with Bush’s case, but it would not elaborate on its company policies regarding iCloud and Apple ID ownership after death. This serves as a warning for others to sort out their digital assets ahead of time, perhaps by sharing important account passwords with trustworthy friends. Apple said that Bush’s situation was a “misunderstanding” but refused to comment further. Many are asking for government oversight of digital-accounts-after-death situations, demanding laws be modernized to treat account data in the same as any other possession when someone passes away. Independent of the confusion associated with this particular case, Apple is clearly lagging behind in this area. Facebook and Google have made big leaps in accommodating deaths with their respective cloud services. For example, Google has a clear process for Google account recovery after death posted on its website. Apple has no such form. Users who find themselves needing iCloud and Apple ID ownership transfer should contact Apple Support for assistance.

Dave Huntley - 10 months ago Reply This story peeves me no end, because CBC that originally played the story complete with crotchety old woman bleating all she wanted was to play a game. Well the daughter, who was also involved and a driver of this going to the media could have just created a new profile and downloaded the game… but oh no, they state the husband NEVER WANTED TO SHARE THE PASSWORD in the first draught of the story. Then he dies, she says she should have it. Imagine the story the other way around, wife demands password and he is alive. He says no. I fail to see the difference here, she wants to read his email etc, he wanted her out, for whatever reason. If she truly just wanted to play a game then why the endless bickering and bother? This part of the story, her reasoning MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. Apart from 5 mins of fame, over a non story, the old woman was asked to prove her claim, given what was released in the emdia I think it’s damn right she gets kept out of the husbands mail. Apple wants absolute proof, and given all of the above, how can you trust her? Sadly though, why would you even cover such a ridiculous story? Digital media rights may be a good story, but this was one old woman and a daughter trying to spin a story about playing a game, when that was easy to fix – the truth was they wanted the email he wanted her kept out of.

The account is owned by the man, or lieu of his unavailability due to death, his estate. Was the woman in question the sanctioned executor of her husband’s estate? I don’t know. And clearly Apple didn’t know either. Apple did the right thing by protecting the account. A death certificate just means that someone is dead. It does not decide how the dead man’s stuff is treated and who controls it. And control of a dead person’s estate doesn’t always just go to the spouse (A 2nd marriage with two families involved is often a reason why the spouse is not in 100% control) Of the estate that I was an executor for, the fact that I held a death certificate gave me no particular or capabilities – even though I was the executor. I always had to show the original, stamped court order that made it clear that I was the executor. I’m not sure why this woman couldn’t do the same. Oh, and the spouse? The widow was decidedly NOT an executor of the estate. As executor, I’d have to sue Apple and the widow if the spouse illegally gained access to the departed’s account. LikeLiked by 3 people Dave Huntley - 10 months ago The husband apparently didn’t want her reading his mail and looking at her I would want her in mine. Since that is what he wanted, who are you to say otherwise? If she wanted the game, which is what she and the daughter said, it was real easy, wipe the device, get your own ID and download the game. But nope, they want his mail. Reading someones mail is not the same as transferring pensions. So two things: This is not about digital ownership of anything. and the woman is trying to get in to something the husband wanted her out. This is far too much effort for a free game, she is obviously not telling the entire story. LikeLike Scott (@ScooterComputer) - 10 months ago Reply Ummm, have you considered that the information in the first draft (I’m assuming you were having a pint) about the husband in some way specifying he was unwilling, “NEVER WANTED”, to share the password was INCORRECT? Perhaps that was why the revision in the article? I mean, CORRECTIONS are a reason to revise. Just saying. But otherwise you’re just being a shrill shill…”why would you even cover such a ridiculous story?” Because it is informative. Because it shows that Apple has a ‘UUUGE gaping hole in their digital products policy. It is said that there are only two certainties in life, Death and Taxes. Yet Apple seems to be completely ignorant of Death? It is absurd. It is even MORE absurd for a company who makes so much money off of digital content sales, the largest company in the world by market cap, and a company that prides itself on being both so progressive and responsive to its customers needs. I’m not sure if you’re familiar with the demographics of the western world, but Death is an issue that more Apple customers are going to be dealing with. I’d rather know sooner than later that Apple has a dumb policy (I already knew it, but, whatever) since then more customers can reach out to Apple and provide Feedback to get it corrected. You, on the other hand…you just sit there and do nothing. Apple is magic. UNICORNS! For the record, it is my opinion that Apple should NOT necessarily be providing passwords. (And I’d bet that in this case the family didn’t GET a password, they got a password reset and gained access to the account.) Apple really should however be engineering their system to facilitate the transfer of digital goods. In THAT case, the Mrs. in the story above (sorry for her loss) should have created a new Apple App Store account/AppleID and Apple should have transfered the purchases (“property”) from Mr.’s account to Mrs.’ account. This problem extends past Death as well…there is another Big D in western civilization that many of Apple’s customers will encounter: Divorce. And let me tell you, the same problem causes big divorce court drama (I’ve been called in as an expert witness on several cases). So it is pretty stupid on Apple for not having a mechanism in place to support this by now; really, the only conceivable reason they are still clinging to the current policies is greed…they just want the “victims” of their policy stupidity to just buy the stuff again.

I would assume this case is just about the digital assets, and there should be law allowing for the transfer of digital assets and licenses in my opinion just like any other property, but passwords are about privacy and just being married to someone doesn’t give them the right to reveal the private contents those passwords protect. My wife knows all of my passwords because I want her to know them in case something happens to me.

So you’re still secure. 1 or 2 people can’t just gain access to all your passwords.

Yes Issue 2: Is the password property that can be assumed by successors? Analogy here should be drawn from real-life passwords (the things that authenticates that you are who is claiming to do the transaction): That would be a signature. A person’s signature is transferable but property acquired using that signature can be transferred to other persons. It is wrong for successor in title to sign own husband’s signature. So, it should be wrong for her to demand his password. She could demand a transfer of right to the iPad and the app, not deceased owner’s password, finger print, iris scan, facial recognition indices, personal passcode, etc. Issue 3: Can a person have expectation for protection of his personal secret upon his death? If a person while alive indicates certain aspect of his life a secret he’d rather keep from his successors in title, The law protects that secret upon his death, even goes out of its way to do so under equity. Personal dignity is something their rule of law protects for humans more than for anything else. And the courts in every land protect it even upon death. That is the basis of secret trusts. Under this law, if a person gives a part of his property to a secret trustee to benefit a hidden person (say an illegitimate child), the law protects that secret from the successors in title (say the wife) and allows that property carved out of the estate to be managed by the secret trustee (say a lawyer) who alone knows who is truly receiving that money. In this case, the user has personal secrets he has clearly shown that he does not want to share with his family and has secured that with the password token. The password is not a ‘simple stupid password”. It is a token of the deceased’s intentions. The user could have used a ‘family share’ setting but chose not to. His secret should be protected. Issue 4: Is successor in title of the deceased estate also entitled by virtue of this position to break inter vivos secret pacts made by the deceased? Apparently Not. If all you need to know everything I am keeping secret from you is to just survive me, then secret is no longer secret. And the phrase, “That will go to the grave with me” will be a hollow oath. What will be the implication if the deceased has access to information that will be particularly harmful to national security, safety of others living, and so on? Issue 5: To the extent that our Apple ID password and the things they encrypt amount to a secret pact between Apple and a user, Is it reasonable to expect that these pacts should survive the death of the user? It is arguable that it is a trust relationship whose sole beneficiary is the deceased, and in his sole interest should guide every decision of Apple’s and the courts.

Although Synology products include a variety of features, I will be focusing on two primary functions that I consider most essential and most useful to people today: Mac backup and home media management (TV shows and movies). With Apple no longer shipping optical drives in most of their products, I think now is a great time to convert your home movie collection of DVDs and Blu-rays to digital files, which a NAS is great for storing. The Apple TV 4 was another big factor: with an app, I can now view all the TV shows and movies, stored on my NAS, from my TV. Before I owned a NAS, I was worried about two things: whether the features would be useful and how much hassle would be necessary to get everything up and running. Hence, my review starts with an explanation of the setup steps involved … Hardware Setup At its dumbest, the Synology NAS is a USB hard drive. At its smartest, it’s an always-on network computer that handles a wide array of data, media and backup tasks. For any of this stuff, though, you need hard drives for storage. When you buy a Synology, you typically buy it standalone with empty drive bays. This means the first task to getting the NAS configured is to decide what kind of hard drives you want: speed, capacity, reliability, manufacturer and such. You can get away with any consumer OEM 3.5 inch drive really, it’s personal preference. Anything from Amazon will suffice for home consumer needs. Storage capacity depends on what you plan to use the NAS for, of course. Given the ever-falling price of HDDs however, it’s pretty cheap to pickup several terabytes worth of space. To get started quickly, I’d suggest getting two equal-sized drives from the same manufacturer. For my setup, I went with 2 x 3 TB WD-Red NAS drives from Western Digital, costing about $200 in total. Installing the drives into the Synology is very easy. The main NAS caddy contains two bays. Take one of the bays out and remove the side strips. Then, slide a hard drive snugly into the bay. Re-attach the side strips to secure the hard drive in place, and then slide the whole lot back into the Synology. Just make sure to insert the bays the right way up and you can basically do no wrong — there’s a right-side-up indicator engraved into the plastic. Looking at naked hard drives can be scary for some, but installation into the NAS is very straightforward and simple. The clever design of the Synology bays eliminates the need for screws, or any tools at all. Aside from hard drive installation, the Synology hardware is as simple to configure as any other home appliance. Plug in the Ethernet and power cord, then switch it on. Software Setup Before I tested this unit, I wasn’t sure what to expect with regard to setup. I knew about the easy-to-switch drive bays, but I had this feeling that the software configuration would be finicky and annoying. For the most part, I was very wrong. Setting up the Synology system is a breeze. After plugging in the unit, you visit a special website URL that acts as the web setup portal for the NAS. There’s a fair amount of waiting for initial loading to complete, but generally you just tick the boxes and progress. Eventually, you gain access to the real Synology system — again exposed through a web UI. It looks like a desktop GUI, a weird conglomeration of OS X and Linux elements, but it’s all in a browser. This is fine but it is sluggish; any click takes at least a second for something to happen. Clicking on things is not as responsive as a real desktop computer by any means, however much it tries to ape the visual appearance. Still, you don’t have to spend that much time in the fake OS, after you have set up stuff. I used the File Browser to configure some shared folders; one for Movies, one for TV Shows and one for the Time Machine backup destination. I wouldn’t say that ‘anybody could do this’ but if you have ever done anything remotely technical to a Mac before, there is nothing scary here. It’s mostly filling in a few forms and clicking Next. There are hundreds of online tutorials if you really want pictorial step-by-step guides for any feature, and the manual PDF included with the Synology is pretty good to boot. I think I referenced the official how-to guide once. Synology bundles its own movie / TV show server apps, but I think they are mediocre. The iOS apps are bad. There is an Apple TV app now (search ‘DS video’ in the tvOS App Store), but I prefer a third-party solution. I use Plex. Just like an iOS App Store, the Synology NAS has a Package Manager. Downloading Plex to the NAS is as simple as clicking Install from the web GUI. Plex then asks for pointers to the folder structure; these are the shared folders that were configured earlier. And that’s about it. From then on, the Plex service runs autonomously. Client apps (available for Apple TV, iOS and much more) connect to the server automatically — you don’t have to fiddle with the server side unless you want to change something structural with the server itself. Time Machine backup setup is a bit more intricate. You have to do things like create a new user, add a Shared Folder, allocate X GB of space to the Time Machine client, etcetera. Could Synology design this setup to be simpler? Does it really matter? Probably not. Like with Plex, the steps only needs to be done once and then it can be left to its own devices. On the Mac side, OS X sees the Synology just like a Time Capsule, as another Time Machine destination with the size allocated as defined in the setup. Obviously, there is a lot more the Synology can do beyond Plex and Time Machine. You can run your own email mailbox, host a web server on it, replace Apple Photos and much more. I want to focus on media and backup in this review because that’s what I find most compelling … and that’s what I use it for every day. I think the important takeaway is none of this is as hard or as scary as the alphabet soup of acronyms could imply. It could be simpler, for sure, but you really shouldn’t see it as a barrier to adoption. With setup over, it’s time to look at what using the Synology as a home NAS is like. Spoiler: It’s pretty great. Using Plex and Synology as a Media Server Loading content into Plex is straightforward. It’s a simple matter of dragging and dropping media files into the designated folder on the Synology. Plex will happily import most file formats, as it automatically transcodes the content on-the-fly to optimize the viewing experience for whatever device you are using to watch. To help Plex attach the correct metadata, it is recommended to name files in a certain way. For instance, films must be labelled like ‘Daddy’s Home (2015)’. The rules are very simple — read the documentation on this for more information. Acquiring such content is the real tricky bit here: the official method is to rip your movies from optical media, using a disc drive and HandBrake. Obviously, there are other avenues to find TV shows and theatre films digitally. I’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader. Once loaded, you can access your movies and TV shows through a variety of apps. There’s a browser-based client for Windows and Mac, as well as App Store downloads for iOS, Android, Apple TV and many more devices. The great thing is, because everything is being hosted on an always-on network-connected NAS, you can access your library outside of your home network too. It’s like a private cloud: you can be anywhere in the world and stream your personal video library to your devices. Discover Movies Movie Details Show Overview On Deck / Continue Watching TV Episode Details Advanced Search Options A big draw for me was the Apple TV compatibility. With older Apple TV models, you had to jailbreak to get some semblance of a Plex interface. With Apple TV 4, Plex can simply offer an official client in the App Store as a free download. The app is great. The home screen displays shortcuts to the different libraries, shows and films that were only half-watched in a previous sitting (so you can quickly continue watching), and new unwatched episodes of a series (‘On Deck’). The UI uses TVML extensively, meaning that the components and grids mirror Apple’s system apps. The app is logically structured, with shows separated by season. You can also just press Play at the show level and it will pick up where you left off. The detail views look good, assuming you have correct metadata for your content. Big, blurred, poster art act as the backdrop for ratings, description info and other details alongside a cast list in the sidebar. Use the navigation bar at the top of the page for a myriad of discovery options including the ability to view your movie collection based on cinema air date, not just when the title was added to the Plex library. Plex also generates related recommendations for other movies in your library, automatically finding films by other actors or directors that you own. The downside to Plex being based on TVML is that it can be slow to load on occasion. For example, after finishing a TV show, the whole page has to visibly reload so that everything is up to date. I think a truly native app would not have these issues. It is also easy to get lost in a deep navigational hierarchy, where the only path of action to get back is to spam-press the Home button to eventually return to the main screen. Overall, these are minor niggles. I love the Plex Apple TV app. It even supports the Apple TV’s Top Shelf feature, so if you put the app on the first row of your Home Screen, it will display dynamic ‘Recently Added’ and ‘Continue Watching’ content in the shelf area. Using Synology with Time Machine With regards to using the Synology as a Time Machine box, there isn’t too much to say as the premise of Time Machine is that it gets out of your way. After doing the aforementioned setup, the Synology appears as a target drive in the Mac Time Machine preferences. It then proceeds to automatically backup at regular intervals. If you disconnect from the network and rejoin, it does the intelligent thing and remounts the drive without user intervention. I have used standard USB network-connected drives with Time Machine before and have always encountered some friction or annoyances. The Synology works flawlessly. I haven’t had to troubleshoot anything since setting it up. The folder rollback feature on the Mac (where you enter the single-window timeline mode) does not seem to work with the Synology Time Machine’s implementation. I don’t really care about that though: for me, Time Machine is used as a straightforward, automatic, backup only. I have tested the restore to another Mac from Synology and it completed successfully, seamlessly. My only criticism is that, whilst a Time Machine backup is happening, the Synology gets noisy as the hard drives spin up. If you store the Synology in a cupboard or basement, then this is a non-issue. If you keep the NAS in your living room, this is something to consider. Outside of Time Machine operations, the machine is barely audible. Conclusion Getting a Synology NAS has dramatically improved my life. I’ve only scratched the surface of what it can do, of course. In the future, I want to experiment with using the Download Station functionality, so it will automatically grab files from RSS feeds whilst I sleep. There’s so much more possible with a home NAS beyond backup and media server. But those two features alone are fantastic and make it worth a purchase for me. The Synology DS-216+, the unit I reviewed, is available to buy for $299. Synology offers many different models, with differing feature sets and number of drives, for respectively more or less money. Compare all the available models on the Synology website.

You could have the Mini HDMI out to whatever you’ve got and then set it in cinema / full screen mode… Either way, if you want control over your media and you don’t mind the initial cost of getting decent hardware to handle the transcoding, a dedicated PLEX server with externals / NAS is ideal! LikeLike Benjamin Mayo - 8 months ago Reply Yeah, using a Mac to transcode will obviously be better than a Synology standalone. However, the newer NAS units (like the one I reviewed) include more capable processors that can handle transcoding pretty well. What you describe is very useful and easy too, though, and a point that I didn’t bring up in my article. That is, to install Plex on multiple locations, like the NAS and your home Mac (the Mac uses the NAS as the file storage). That way you can have the always-on element of the NAS and use the more powerful Mac for transcoding when needed. LikeLike JBDragon - 8 months ago Reply You can use a NAS, but you really need one with a Intel Processor. These are more costly then the cheaper NAS with like a ARM processor. Transcoding on the fly can really come in handy. I use my Windows PC as a PLEX server, but it’s running anyway for other software downloading stuff on it’s own and putting it up on PLEX automatically. I won’t get into that area. Using something like a Mac Mini, they’re pretty cheap, get a used one and use that to handle the transcoding. They are also low power. They can go to sleep like the NAS and then wakeup when needed on it’s own. you get a bit of a delay when trying to access PLEX when it’s bee sitting as the NAS and maybe your computer is waking up. But it’s a good way to save power and some wear and tear. I have a 4 Bay ReadyNas with 4 3TB WD Red HDD, so over 8 TB of space and it’s almost full. I’d like to get another NAS where I could use 6TB drives in, maybe 5-6 bay, but really don’t have that kind of money right now. PLEX is like your own Personal Netflix type service. Except there’s no monthly fee and it’s all content you like. It also doesn’t disappear at some future date. I can watch all my content on all 3 of my HDTV’s in my house. I can also watch on my iPhone and iPad by streaming, though I think I can also dump the content onto my device for local storage if I want to. I can be at my brothers and Airplay to his Apple TV anything on my NAS. Which means yes, PLEX works on even a cheaper AppleTV3. Just use your iPhone or iPad and Airplay to it!!! PLEX will automatically download all the Metadata for the Movie or TV program. Naming is pretty simple. For Movies it’s simple “Name (Year)” Because there’s a number of movies that have Remakes. So you want PLEX to make sure it grabs the correct Metadata. For TV programs, it’s Name S00E00. Which is Season and Eposode #. So Season 8 Eposode 2 would be Name S08E02. One Minor thing. Sometimes shows are Aired on TV in one order, and then put on Disc and some Episodes can be in a different order, and so Descriptions of the Episode will be Off along with other metadata. Now having to get up and hunt for a disc makes having your collection in a Digital format great. I Rip my movies, and then stick the Disc into one of my 300 Disc Binders and then throw the disc case away. Then I can put all my discs into the closet. It takes up a fraction of the space and I have them just in case as a backup!!!! LikeLike auntietroal - 8 months ago Reply No need for Plex on the Synology.

PLEX works great. my PC does the transcoding. The Metadata for the library I have on my Windows PC Locally and on a 250 Gig SSD drive. If you put that stuff on your NAS, it can slow PLEX down quite a bit. It’s also a noticeable difference going from a local HDD, to a local SSD drive. I checked out Infuse. I thought it SUCKED! it couldn’t even do the most basic thing, Show Movie box Art of my Movies because each of my movies are in their own folder. For Infuse to work right, all you movies need to be in the same Folder. That was my #1 problem with it. I’ve thought about buying a used Mac Mini and throwing like a 500 Gig SSD into it. The Database for PLEX can be on that for Fast speed and the Movies on the NAS of course. The Mac Mini can handle Transcoding and it’s low power. PLEX is also far, far more flexible. I’ve been using it for around 4 years now and it just keeps getting better. Infuse works but it has it’s limitations and really can only do a fraction of what PLEX can do. You can get more advanced using other software that’s getting stuff Automatically, Plex automatically processing and it’s just there ready to watch when you startup PLEX on your Apple TV or ROKU or whatver else. In fact my Apple Watch will let me know what and when something is being downloaded using Prowl. I get home and it’s ready to watch on PLEX.

Difference being that the entire enclosure including the hard drives would be warrantied with the same company as vs having to go to two different companies.

In fact I think it’s better to only add HDD’s at you need them. Start with 1, but you’re not protected, so get a second one right away. Then it’s in RAID 1 which is really a direct copy of one HDD to the other. Then when you add a 3rd, the NAS will switch to RAID5. Now you have 2 HDD’s full of Data and any one can fail and you can restore. Then you can add a 4th and get that much more storage. Doing it this way. You don’t a load of money all at once. Also you can end up with a 4 bad HDD in a batch getting them all at once. If you lose 2 HDD’s at once you’re screwed!!! If you lose 1, and waiting for a new HDD to come in and another fails, you’re screwed. If you lose one and in the middle of restoring the Data onto the new HDD, that extra wear and tear on another HDD causes one of them to fail and you lose your Data!!! So if you can space out buying your HDD’s, that would be better. If you can’t, if might be better to get half at Amazon and half at Newegg, just so you don’t have the same group of HDD’s. I’ve also found over the 4 years of using PLEX, it’s BEST to have your Database on your Computer that’s doing the transcoding instead of having to send it over to your computer from the nas and then from the computer to your PC. It also makes it much faster to have it on a SSD and not a HDD. I have 2 SSD’s in my PC. The first one is for Windows, my C drive so Windows boots up fast and all my main apps. Everything else is on a normal HDD. I have a 250 Gig SSD just for the PLEX Database, which can get pretty big in size with all the Metadata, and Movie trailers, and whatnot. your Database will pop on on AppleTV or the ROKU so much faster!!! Searches are far faster, etc. All your movies are on the NAS still, just the Database, you put on the SSD. Look how much your’s is taking up now and double it or whatever depending on how much space you have left on your NAS. LikeLike styreta - 8 months ago You really shouldnt use Raid 5 in an array smaller then 6 HDD’s. There simply isnt enough striping.

According to Apple’s website, the 1 TB Fusion Drives used in the new all-in-ones have seen a significant decrease in the amount of included flash storage. How significant? The new drives ship with less than one-fifth of the previous flash storage. A Fusion Drive, as most readers will likely recall, combines the cheap, vast storage of a traditional hard drive with the speed and efficiency of flash storage, with OS X automatically and intelligently moving files from the hard drive to the flash storage as needed to make those files more easily accessible. In previous versions of the Fusion Drive, Apple has included 128 GB of flash storage—enough to store a lot of large apps and files that you use frequently. In the new iMacs with 1 TB Fusion Drives, however, that number has been cut to an insanely small 24 GB. See for yourself on this excerpt from Apple’s iMac spec page: Apparently Apple somehow thinks this is acceptable. Thankfully, for users who actually care about putting that flash storage to good use, there are two options that include the full 128 GB of flash. You’ll just need to spend a little extra to buy the 2 TB or 3 TB variety if you want to get that—an extra $200 or $300, respectively. Because of this change, Apple is recommending that all machines with 32 GB of RAM be configured with the 2 TB or 3 TB Fusion Drive, or an all-flash drive (which will cost even more) for increased performance. One reason for this? The image that’s used to store your computer’s memory contents when it goes to sleep would be too big to fit on the flash storage. Waking the Mac from sleep would take longer because the contents of that image would have to be read from the slow hard drive rather than the flash storage.

I’m not trying to flame, I’m genuinely curious. To me, the MacBooks are still the best made machines out there all factors considered. MacBook Air is the king “ultrabook” of the industry, the Pro’s are not much bigger but contain better displays, ports, and computational performance. The new MacBook is the smallest “full” computer out there, and unapologetically so. If you don’t need portability you have the iMac line, which are the protoptypical and best all-in-one setups out there with more performance per dollar than a MacBook at the cost of portability. No money for either? Still got the little Mac Mini kicking around. You probably don’t need more than one of these. One or the either usually will get the job done so it’s not surprising that if you like the MacBook Pro’s, this would seem unnecessary. If the problem is the “gaming machine” aspect. Well- that’s hardly new and not really a strength of OSX anyways and never has been. Hell you’ll need to Bootcamp the damn things to get anywhere anyways. For gaming purposes, yes, a custom built desktop tower is still the way to go- and it’s sooo not what a Mac is anyways. Personally, I have a MacBook Pro Retina myself for portable, reliable computing and I don’t see myself buying anything else for the next 5 or so years at least and Apple seems to get that.

They have the nerve to make you pay(a lot) extra to make it functional. Over the last ten years I have been using Apple devices, the bundled accessories are constantly being reduced. MacBooks used to come with remotes, iPhones used to come with docks and prices were trending down. Now, included accessories getting culled or are becoming less functional (e.g. iPhone chargers are no longer able to use the Apple travel adaptor pack) and we a expected to shell out top dollar for not-included accessories because Apple has put their logo on it and made a wanky 5 minute video with Jonny Ive gushing about how amazing he and his latest product is.

Keep the price points of the 21.5s the same, give them 128gb ssd of storage as the standard, and update them immediately to skylake cpu’s with the iris pro 7200 and you’re going to have great machines that will finally be worth the price.

For Mac vs. PC/Windows, I cannot find any reason to get a PC apart from gaming or modularity, but in my honest opinion Windows vs. Mac is at least a bit better than Android vs. iOS. For me, a person that has been an android user for 3 years, over the years Android became less interesting, less attractive and even Windows Phone started looking better than it. For example, during ”iPhone 5 era” Android simply exploded, for the first time of my life, I have seen 3-4 times more Android devices than iPhones and that’s the point actually ”Apple is doomed” argument started. People couldn’t imagine Apple without jobs and Android phones greatly improved, so more and more people bought it because ”they were more interesting and had more features”, but since the 5S, in the environment I live, I observed Androids are disappearing, I see more Android devices, exchanged for iPhones. Also typical ”Apple fanboy” stereotype started to wear-off since Android fans became a lot more annoying. So, in my opinion, it is a great time for Apple lovers. LikeLike Hayley Stevenson - 2 months ago Reply The whole Mac range are luxury items for the technically incompetent, you can’t do anything with the things, once you could buy an entry model, when you had some bucks to spare, then upgrade ram and hdd/ssd when the prices became easier on the wallet. That is not taking into consideration the exorbitant amount of bucks Apple charge to upgrade those older systems, like memory, I can remember buying a 2012 MBP and Apple charging IIRC close to 200 bucks to give it 8GB ram, when I could by BETTER ram for less than half the price and install for nothing. Then of course we have the bizarre situation where Apple’s maximum ram was actually half that the darn machine could take, a 2012 MBP happily runs 16GB ram -I am typing on one right now- yet Apple would only offer 8GB. Why do I need 16GB ram? I use several virtual machines. The fusion drive SSD drop is just another Apple marketing ploy, they can claim to have an entry model, but the darn thing will be so crippled so as to peeve people into selling on eBay and wither getting a proper Mac or leaving Apple altogether (a good move). Look at the bottom-of-the-range crippled Mac Mini 1.4GHz and 4GB ram? LMAO Same with the bottom iMac and all the others, the entry models give the illusion of of an affordable Apple experience, when in fact they are not the Apple experience…unless you want crippled computers. WTF is happening at Apple? One of the greatest innovations -to me- for safety and convenience was the Magsafe adaptor, now the new Macbook doesn’t have one, I have heard of more than one company not adopting the thing just for that reason; it is a trip hazard. Apple notebooks are amongst the most expensive on the planet, yet, other than the still available 2012 MBP 13″, you don’t even get a Kensington lock! Really? An item that has ‘Steal Me’ written all over it, and you can’t secure it? Sure there are some solutions, some requiring GLUEING a device to your $2,500 computer, but should the security of your computer depend solely on after market suppliers? Now when you visit a client’s site and need a dump, you have to put the Mac to sleep and either put it in their safe or carry it to the John, whereas I used to just lock it to the desk. Apple do not listen to customers, they want you to do everything their way, we asked for more ports and they gave us the laughable new Retina Macbook…hopefully Apple will be gone in another generation.

Apples products are brilliant. The best in their respective markets however it appears there is no longer any innovation. They also appear to be taking steps backwards, especially in light of this new information. I have the iPad Air 2 and a 6S Plus. I’m a fan boy. Though it doesn’t mean I can’t be disappointed by Apple this last year. And the only thing I’ve been impressed with is force touch/3D touch which has been implemented well and will take off with App developers but we can all be honest here, pressure sensitive input is hardly new or revolutionary. Apple have a history of taking idea’s or poor products and making them better (smart phone, tablets, mouse, watch). They innovated most of those markets. Showing what should be the standard in said technologies. But they’ve lost it. Updates are so incremental and predictable. Even the iPad Pro was the next “logical” step for Apples tablet. I think it’s about time the do something “unlogical” for lack of a better word. I can’t say what that should be, otherwise I’d be a rich engineer living out of apples HQ. I just know they need to throw the rope out a bit further and soon. There’s only so many times you can intice customers back to your products on incremental upgrades. The news that they’re even going backwards on tech in “new” models is a kick in the face for Apple Users. Apple need to sort themselves out. They need to give customers what they want and they also need more innovation. As mentioned in other comments. Simple things like getting rid of the 16GB model iPhone/iPad as we all know it’s just too small. $100 differences on memory upgrades is ridiculous. iOS needs a proper refresh. So much that customers want can be done by Apple. It allows them to throw a funky, brilliant and innovative piece of technology into the mix knowing that’s yes it may not work but the fact they’ve added what customers want first means they will still sell. Even Samsung added a curved edge screen to their phones. Is it a good idea? Does it work? Maybe but it’s irrelevant anyway, the point is we want apple to try doing stuff like this, not doing the bare minimum and definitely not going backwards like they have with the news on the fusion drives. It’s almost like Apple are testing the faithful. It’s horrible to see. And I can’t imagine it would of happened under Jobs. LikeLike Paul Van Obberghen - 1 year ago Apple _is_ innovating. It’s just not innovating as fast as you’d like or in the areas that are of interest to you, and they are several you did not mention. They can’t revolutionize a market every year, not even every other year, as that is what you seem to believe innovation is. Don’t forget it’s a commercial company: they need to please their customers AND please their stockholders AND make money AND invest in research and development, all at the same time. Apple is the only company in the world to be successful in that endeavour, all of this with a real environmental and labor conditions consciousness, backed with action. Both of which are in themselves true innovations, btw. Surely you don’t notice that when you use your Apple branded products, but these are genuine and important innovations, that more and more people are taking in consideration when buying a product. At least they should. Also, even with the billions they have in cash, Apple can’t afford to miss, not even a single time. They can’t shoot out various kinds of product with different supposedly new ideas just to see which one is gonna work or to please every single possible users. The one they bring out needs to be right the first time, and it usually is. One fail and they are down. They just can afford that. Putting a Fusion Drive with 24GB of SSD in the new iMac 24 is no technological regression, nor is keeping the 16GB iPhone. These are simply economical decisions. It says nothing about Apple capacity for innovation, which you should not measure over a single year anyway (which wasn’t bad at all).

On the 27″ 5K units with Fusion, the 128GB SSD are falling back to 7200rpm 3.5″ “desktop” drives. In the 21″ iMac, Apple has been cheaping out for a while using 5400rpm 2.5″ “laptop” drives, because the enclosure is designed for 2.5″ drives. So when on the 21″ Fusion set up the “hot” data goes out past 24GB (which won’t take long, take look at OS X’s size) and comes down on the spinning platter, it is going to be VERY SLOW. Consider, Apple was putting 5400rpm 2.5″ drives in MacBooks since…well…the beginning of the MacBook. That’s the level of performance you’re looking at. In the older 21″ models, the pricing for Fusion was a bit less expensive; and I don’t remember when they first started using 5400rpm 2.5″ drives, but I remember that performance wasn’t great on the entry-level model for sure. 7200rpm 2.5″ drives aren’t that much more expensive, and their higher power/heat requirements would be more than amply handled in the 21″ chassis. But the biggest issue is quite simply the lack of choice; Apple gives NONE. So once again, as you said, it is a big middle finger for customers. Just no way can anyone allow Apple to get away with the PR bs anymore that they design and build the best machine for their users, it just can’t be held as true in light of this.

The amount of SSD is negligible depending on what Apple has done on the OS level to optimize this space. It would be better to have smaller, but faster SSD than a larger, but slower one.

The most recent models are under powered over priced and impossibly difficult to upgrade. The iMac screen is outstanding, but if you play with one, there are performance issues because Apple has cut corners in the GPU department to get people to buy the Mac Pro for pro applications. I downgraded from a 2013 MacBook Pro 15″ Retina with 1TB of SSD to a 13″ 2015 i5 model as I needed something lighter and smaller. It was too slow, so I returned it and got the slightly faster model. Still too slow when doing 4K video or some graphics. I didn’t understand how a machine two years more recent than my last (15″) machine was much slower, even if the processor was an i5 and not an i7. I only found out when a friend told me Apple only put the decent Nvidia tech in the 15″! Why? Why is the 13″ called a pro if when playing back 4K video on it stutters and so on? This is not honest, even if the GPU specs are shown somewhere on their website. I feel very let down, but can do nothing because there is no 13″ MB Pro with a speedy GPU. So I’m selling it and getting a top spec Surface Pro 4, that will cost £500 more, but I get the stylus, a touch screen and a tablet mode, and can still run all my power user apps.

And so it goes. Moaning about this graphics card, that hard drive configuration etc… just sounds like out of touch whining. Computers are tools. They have a finite life and that’s just the way of things. If you’re working with them then it should be a business write off anyway. Personally I can’t wait for my 21.5″ Retina iMac to arrive at the end of the week. Sure I’m disappointed to hear that the flash portion of the fusion drive is paltry but I know that no matter what’s under the hood I can expect three good years of productivity out of it, a fourth year that I endure, and then I’ll cash it in on the used market and buy another one…. and more importantly live a happy life in between. The only suckas out there are the geeks that have no life past dissecting inanimate objects online… good luck with that.

Trending in Apple How Apple’s stock apps will use the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro [Gallery] June 3, 2014 Apple introduces MFi specs for Lightning cable headphones, support arriving in future iOS update Jordan Kahn - 2 years ago @JordanKahn Apple iOS Beats headphones MFi Comments (73) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit We’ve learned Apple has quietly introduced a new specification for manufacturers in its Made-For-iPhone/iPad/iPod (MFi) program that allows them to create headphones that connect to iOS devices using a Lightning connector instead of the usual 3.5mm headphone jack. Apple has not flipped the switch on the audio input support for Lightning cables and existing iOS devices, but it will release a software update in the future that will enable support in devices running iOS 7.1 or later. The Lightning headphones will be capable of receiving lossless stereo 48 kHz digital audio output from Apple devices and sending mono 48 kHz digital audio input. The input means that the headphones will also support a microphone for audio input following Apple’s upcoming update. Manufacturers will be able to take advantage of Apple Headphone Remote controls like Volume Up/Down/etc, as well as other buttons for launching specific apps such as iTunes Radio or initiating playback controls on iOS. In addition, the headphones can be made to work specifically with a companion iOS app and launch a specific app when connected to an iOS device. There are a few benefits of using the Lightning cable to send audio. Apple says the headphones will be able to draw power from an Apple device (even if the device is asleep), which for some products could eliminate cost associated with an internal battery. It could also work the other way around by providing power to an Apple device from an internal battery or external power source. That enables you to listen to music and also use a passthrough setup so you could charge the device simultaneously, much like you can with an audio dock that uses a Lightning connector. The headphones will also be capable of receiving firmware updates. Apple will allow two configurations for the headphones. Standard Lightning Headphones are described by Apple as using minimum components when paired with a digital-to-analog converter supported by the Lightning Headphone Module. It also has an Advanced Lightning Headphones specification that allows digital audio processing features like active noise cancellation and uses a digital signal processor and digital/analog converter. Manufacturers building the Standard configuration have to use this Wolfson digital-to-analog converter. While everyone has been focusing on what Apple’s purchase of Beats Electronics means for its audio and headphone business down the road, the news Apple is developing some innovative new headphone tech using its own proprietary Lightning connector is significant. If Apple does get partners on board and Lightning headphones prove to be popular with users, it’s easy to see how Apple could push Lightning headphones as a big differentiating feature for iPhone and other Apple devices. A previous report claimed Apple was working on a version of its own in-ear EarPods using a Lightning connector and planned to enable higher-resolution audio playback in iOS 8. I’m guessing we’ll see a Lightning cable eventually make its way to a pair of Beats. Perhaps Apple will even use Beats as the first pair of Lightning cable headphones to help promote the new tech when it finally flips the switch on support.

This lightning equipped pair of beats headphones could come with a year or two of beats music service standard. This would significantly assist in driving the “beats generation” to Apple products. And instead of paying for another year of beats… You just upgrade your headphones. This little tidbit could turn out to be a very lucrative venture for Apple and validate the high price they paid for beats. LikeLike Paul Lancefield - 2 years ago Reply Yep, I previously posted a comment to the effect I suspect Apple have been impressed by the popularity of Neil Young’s PONO ultra HD project. I expect, knowing Apples’ penchant for simplification, they are removing the 3.5mm headphone jack and going all in on ultra HD audio for their iTunes iCloud and Radio services. Overnight the 3.5mm jack will seem old-fashioned. The acquisition of Beats suddenly makes total sense. There will be a swath of upgrade headphone purchases. You will still be able to plug-in using an adaptor, but overnight that will suddenly seem very old tech.

The only people who care about 96Hz 24-bit audio are Audio Producers/ Engineers who believe the highest possible sample rate might enhance their end product, though this is still not proven because human hearing is only 20Hz to 20 kHz which is why the standard became 44.1 in the first place (which means they can reproduce frequencies up to roughly 20 kHz) here is a decent explanation of all this: http://productionadvice.co.uk/high-sample-rates-make-your-music-sound-worse/ LikeLike standardpull - 2 years ago Reply Just recall that the highest end studio headphones available are all analog.

Speaking of bluetooth, why can’t Apple make a new standard for MFI bluetooth? Basically fill the last hole that bluetooth audio has left which is data rate/fidelity.

That’s great, but the news comes with an asterisk: the jailbreak will only work with devices running tvOS 9.0 or 9.0.1. If you’ve updated to tvOS 9.1, 9.1.1 or any of the new betas releases, there’s no way to downgrade back to 9.0 or 9.0.1. Thankfully, there are still plenty of fourth generation Apple TVs available in the wild that come installed with one of the first two versions of tvOS. In fact, in preparation for the upcoming jailbreak, I was able to easily purchase a new Apple TV running tvOS 9.0.  Check your current Apple TV 4 Before running out to buy a new Apple TV, check the one you own first. Go to Settings → General → About and look for the tvOS version. If it’s anything higher than 9.0.1, you’ll need to purchase a new Apple TV in order to jailbreak. Of course, this is only true if you wish to jailbreak on day one. You could opt to be patient and wait for an updated jailbreak that works with newer versions of tvOS, but that takes patience and there’s no guarantee that’ll ever happen. How to decipher an Apple TV 4 serial number I find that going to the store and purchasing an Apple TV 4 is the best option. You could do it online, but if you do it in store, you’ll have the peace of mind of being able to check the serial number of the Apple TV before purchasing. On the back of the fourth generation Apple TV, you’ll notice the 12-digit Serial No. Be sure not to confuse the part number with the serial number. The serial number is at the bottom of the sticker on the back of the Apple TV’s box. Here’s the serial number from my just-purchased Apple TV 4: C1MQ8G79G9RM That may seem like a bunch of gibberish, but there’s lots that can be deciphered from that 12-digit number. The two characters that most interest us are the 4th and 5th characters, which are “Q8″ in the example above. The first character represents the year and the second character represents the week. By deciphering the year and week, we can determine when the Apple TV was manufactured. Fortunately, some smart folks have already created a script so that we don’t have to go about figuring out the manufactured date in our heads. Simply visit the link and enter a valid Apple TV serial number. rehash: if u are shopping for ATV4 pre 9.1 look at back of box, enter serial here https://t.co/2yKHPMv6cS b4 december 8 2015 production 👍 — kb (@nitoTV) March 12, 2016 The script makes it easy, and takes the guess work out of translating weeks to months. Here are the results from my recent query: Family name: MGY52 Group1: AppleTV Group2: Generation: 4 Production week : -34- (August) Production year : -2015- Model introduced: -0- Capacity: 32GB Memory – flavour: xx Factory: C1 As you can see, the Apple TV that I purchased was produced in August of 2015. My new Apple TV 4 will have tvOS 9.0 installed on it out of the box, since tvOS 9.0.1 didn’t release publicly until November of 2015. Here are the release dates for the currently available tvOS software: tvOS 9.0 – 10/29/2015 tvOS 9.0.1 – 11/9/2015 tvOS 9.1 – 12/8/2015 tvOS 9.1.1 – 1/25/2016 This means that you ideally want to purchase an Apple TV made prior to 12/8/2015, although it’s possible that Apple TVs still shipped with tvOS 9.0.x after that date. Obviously, we can make no guarantees either way, but it’s generally best to try to find an earlier produced model. Ready to go! At any rate, the serial number checker worked just as expected. After unboxing and firing up my Apple TV 4, I verified that it was indeed running tvOS 9.0 by going to Settings → General → About. Remember, turn off automatic updates! This should be the first thing you do Please turn off automatic updates as soon as you get your Apple TV. Go to Settings → System → Software Updates and turn off Automatically Update. I was absent-minded and made the mistake of not turning this feature off. Needless to say, I had to purchase yet another Apple TV 4 in order to get back on tvOS 9.0. Purchase a USB-C Cable Chances are that the Apple TV 4 jailbreak will require users to connect to their Macs or PCs via USB. But keep in mind that Apple changed the connector type for its fourth generation efforts. The new Apple TV uses USB-C instead of Micro USB. USB-C cables are inexpensive — you can purchase one for only $6.99 on Amazon. Wait patiently According to a tweet from the @PanguTeam, we should have an Apple TV 4 jailbreak sometime this week. They haven’t provided us with an exact day or time, but rest assured that we will let you know once it’s released. We will release jb for Apple TV4(9.0.x) next week which only has SSH access. It's mainly for security researchers and jailbreak developers. — PanguTeam (@PanguTeam) March 11, 2016 We’ll be back with more Apple TV jailbreak coverage as the week progresses. In the meantime, let us know if you plan on picking up a second Apple TV in order to jailbreak it. It’s out! The Pangu jailbreak has been released for tvOS 9.0 and tvOS 9.0.1. You can find our full Apple TV 4 jailbreak tutorial here, and watch our full step-by-step video walkthrough as well.

What are you supposed to do if it bricks itself during a fw update (not out of realm of possibility, almost happened to my Apple Watch a few OS’s ago). Bah.

LikeLike Jeff Benjamin - 8 months ago Sure thing: Year values are letters C-Z with no vowels. 1st half of 2010 = c, 2nd half = D and so-on. Week values go 1-9 and C-Y (no S and no vowels). Each character can correspond to 1 of two values. i.e. 1 = week 1 or week 27.

Update: The issue appears to have been quietly resolved as of March 18, with Gmail to iCloud emails taking only a minute. Noted in reader tips and confirmed by 9to5Mac, the issue occurs when a message is sent from a Gmail account to an @iCloud.com or @me.com address, resulting in an extended delivery delay and/or this failure message from Apple’s servers: 451 4.5.3 Too many rejections; try again later. According to the discussion forum threats, Apple’s servers have been rejecting Gmail messages since last week, and Apple engineers are continuing to work on a fix for the problem: They are very aware of the issue and working on fixing it. They said that everyone who is having this issue should call and report this. They’ll ask you for some info that will help them. They [sic] tech said specifically that the more people that call, the easier it will be to get a fix. If you’ve been waiting on important Gmail messages and haven’t received them, this is most likely the reason. Apple’s telephone number for reporting iCloud mail issues is 800-275-2273.

Deciding between the two sizes may be difficult if you want to buy one before they begin shipping on April 24th, so the Watch will go on display at Apple Stores two weeks ahead of its launch. You might not be able to visit a crowded Apple Store just to make that decision, and Apple (mostly) has that covered too. Buried inside the Apple Store app for iPhone is an actual size comparison for each case size. The mockup shows the casing of the Apple Watch with the home screen icons displayed, and you can tap to toggle between the smaller and larger cases. The size comparison makes one thing very clear: both Apple Watch sizes are much smaller than what you’re probably used to seeing. If you put your iPhone over your wrist to simulate trying on each Watch size, you’ll likely decide that one either feels too small or too big, helping you make your decision easier. As mentioned above, the Apple Watch size comparison is somewhat buried within the Apple Store app on iPhone. To find it, open the Apple Store app, tap the ‘Learn more’ link under the Apple Watch banner at the top, tap the ‘VIEW PRICING’ button on the top right corner, then tap ‘Compare case sizes’ near the top center. Now can you virtually try on both Apple Watch case sizes. For a more mathematical approach, you can follow Apple’s official sizing guide with band sizes to prepare for your purchase. Like the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the Apple Watch with the larger display will have better battery life, but the smaller display will obviously serve people who do not want a larger watch on their wrist. The smaller Apple Watch is also less expensive in each collection. Guides Apple Watch View THe Guide app View THe Guide size View THe Guide Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

LikeLiked by 2 people Gazoo Bee - 2 years ago Reply I don’t see how a picture of the thing life-size or otherwise actually helps people “try it on.” I would encourage people to download one of the paper templates and try that on though as Apple is being ever so slightly disingenuous about the sizing. If they say a band “fits” from one size to another size, all they mean is that it physically expands to that size. It’s not the same meaning as “does this watch fit?” in the watch world. I have 165mm wrists (6 inches) which isn’t abnormally thin for either gender. The way I figure form my calculations, the ONLY watch that will fit is the 38mm one. On top of that, I’m getting the steel link bracelet which only has six removal links, so the size can only be changed in 10mm increments. If you have to remove an odd number like I do you might have trouble with the clasp placement too. There is no substitute for actually trying one of these things on, but I don’t see how Apple can really accommodate that. It seems to me that lots of folks are going to end up ordering a thousand dollar watch that doesn’t even fit their wrists.

At $400, it's one of the best smartphone values we've ever seen. Good smartphones are getting cheaper; in fact, they are fast becoming a commodity. Little separates a mid-range handset from the flagships in terms of utility. In addition, mid-range handsets are beginning to sport features that were once only found on the priciest and best. The Huawei Honor 8 exemplifies this trend. It starts at $400, and it has a flagship-level 4GB of RAM, USB Type-C input, and a unique dual-camera setup. We had good things to say about the $200 Honor 5X earlier this year, claiming “It isn’t an iPhone or Galaxy as its performance and spec sheet reveal some limitations, but it’s not as far off as its price suggests.” The Honor 8 costs more, and has fewer “limitations” on paper. Can it match up with the name brands? Read this Huawei Honor 8 review to find out. Build & Design The Honor 8 smartphone has a glass build with aluminum alloy bumper. The Honor 8 smartphone is good-looking. It comes in pearl white, midnight black, and sapphire blue, and it sports an all-glass front and back panel, with a rounded aluminum alloy bumper around the edges. The 5.2-inch display is slightly raised, giving what many device makers call a “2.5D” effect. The left and right bezels are extremely thin, while the top and bottom match the sizes found on other devices. It feels solid in hand, and the aluminum and glass combination give a quality impression. But the Honor 8 is too still slick for our liking, even if the aluminium adds much-needed grip. This is an issue inherent in all glass smartphones, and a case is highly recommended. The other issues are fingerprints and smudges. There’s no avoiding either with this Android smartphone. The buttons and ports are laid out logically, with both a single-piece volume rocker and power button on the right side, and the SIM tray/microSD card slot on the left. The bottom houses the USB Type-C input and 3.5mm headphone jack.The top has an IR blaster and pinhole mic. The dual-camera setup, flash, and laser sensor sit on the upper-back panel, just above a round fingerprint sensor. The Honor 8 has a USB-Type C input. There’s nothing to complain about here. The power button and volume rocker are different sizes and easy to identify by touch alone, and the camera lenses (yes, there are two) sit flush with the rest of body. The fingerprint sensor is easy to access during one-handed use (certainly easier than Samsung and Apple’s home-button placement), and it’s also clickable and swipeable, doubling as a quick launcher for access to specific apps, notifications, and navigating through gallery photos. This neat bit of innovation proves very useful in day-to-day operation. Display & Speakers The Huawei Honor 8 has a glass back with a fingerprint sensor. The Huawei Honor 8 has a 5.2-inch LTPC LCD, with a full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. That results in about 423 pixels per inch and a cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio. Most Android flagships have denser displays with PPI counts topping 500, and that’s one of the big differences distinguishing the high-end from the mid-tier. It makes sense for a company like Samsung, which has the Gear VR headset that can take advantage of all those pixels. For anything else a 500+ PPI count is overkill, and it’s hard to see any difference between those smartphones and the Honor 8, even side by side. Besides all that, the Honor 8 display looks great. Colors are rich, with pleasant saturation, and sufficient brightness. It cuts through sun glare as well as any other smartphone we’ve tested. Huawei also provides deeper display controls than any other smartphone maker, letting users adjust the color temperature, and including an “eye comfort” mode that filters blue light in favor or a yellowish tint. We’ve yet to test a smartphone that has “good” speaker output, as the small sizes always results in compromised sound. The Honor 8 is decent when graded on a smartphone curve. It’s fine for personal use, but headphones are preferable. Performance The Honor 8 smartphone runs Android with EMUI 4.1. Crack open the Honor 8 smartphone and you’ll find an octa-core Hisilicon Kirin 950 processor (four Cortex A72 running at 2.3GHz, and four Cortex A53 running at 1.8GHz, plus a Mali-T880 MP4 GPU running at 900MHz) along with 4GB LPDDR4 RAM. This is a potent combo, and it generally bests the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 found inside the flagships and some other $400 smartphones in terms of CPU performance, but lags behind in GPU output… at least in benchmark comparisons. To that end, our Huawei Honor 8 review unit scored 5118 on the Geekbench 4 multi-core test, 1744 on the single-core test, and 2978 on the compute GPU test. The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge scored 3945, 1687, and 6185 on the same tests, respectively. In the real world, the Honor 8 runs like a flagship. It handles its Android 6.0 and Huawei EMUI 4.1 steadily. It’s both stable and swift, and can blast through intensive games as well as any other handset on the market. The Huawei fingerprint sensor bears additional praise. In addition to its quick launch capability and ergonomic placement, it’s also one of the best fingerprint sensors on the market. It’s quick and reliable, much more so than Samsung’s or any other Android fingerprint sensor we’ve tested. In fact, Huawei is neck and neck with Apple in terms of fingerprint sensor performance. Battery Our Huawei Honor 8 review unit lasted 7 hours and 30 minutes streaming Netflix over Wi-Fi with the screen brightness set to max. This torture test give you an idea of the bare minimum life of the Honor 8’s 3000mAh battery. Our dividing line is 8 hours. Anything more than that is good, with the best smartphones lasting 11 and 12 hours. So the Honor 8 is borderline OK here. That said, Huawei packed the Honor 8 full of power management options, so we don’t doubt the Honor 8 could last a full day and then some. It charges fast with the included USB Type-C charger, going from dead to 46% in just 30 minutes plugged in. Software Huawei’s Android is easy to confuse with iOS, at least at a glance. The EMUI 4.1 skin borrows heavily from Apple’s mobile OS, foregoing the familiar Android app drawer, and distinguishing notifications and shortcuts as separate items in the display drop down. So it’s as far from stock Android as any OEM’s version aesthetically, but it works. It’s unique and nothing feels forced for the sake of being different. The knuckle gestures feel like a gimmick (one knuckle double tap to snap a screenshot; two knuckle double tap to record the display; and quick launch apps by knuckle drawing C, E, W, and M), and require too much effort. Thankfully, they are not part of the core experience. Besides, those pining for more traditional Android can always download and install the Google Now launcher from the Google Play Store. Our Huawei Honor 8 review unit came with 32GB, of which about 21GB were available out of the box (around 23GB is typical). Android 6.0 with the EMUI 4.1 skin takes up most of the space, with apps taking up about 2.5GB. There’s some bloatware, like the Shazam, Booking.com, Lyft, and NewsRebublic apps, which can be uninstalled. Huawei bundles a handful of useful apps, including a Smart Controller for the IR blaster. Here you can program the Honor 8 to control TVs, various set-top boxes, and even air conditioners. And yes, it actually works on air conditioners, TVs as well. However, we couldn’t get it to work with our Xfinity set-top cable boxes. We also liked the battery manager, voice controls, glove mode, and Optimizer, which closes out unused apps and ends unnecessary background processes. The Honor 8 notifications resemble iOS. The Honor 8 can double as an AC remote. Software support is always a big concern when dealing with an unfamiliar brand (unfamiliar in the US anyway). Will Huawei provide regular software and security updates for the Honor 8? Huawei has stated it will support the Honor 8 for at least two years, pushing out new features every three months for the first, and keeping up on security and bugs for the second. Other recent Huawei smartphones ship with an FM tuner and companion app. Unfortunately, they are absent on the Honor 8. So the Honor 8 is very likely due for an Android Nougat update. There’s little guarantee beyond that outside of bug fixes and security patches. Connectivity The Honor 8 smartphone supports dual-band Wi-Fi with automatic switching, and LTE/WCDMA/GSM networks. That includes the 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,12,17,20 LTE bands. This means the Honor 8 connects to AT&T and T-Mobile, and many overseas networks, but not Sprint or Verizon. Those customers will want to stay away. It also supports NFC, Bluetooth 4.2 LE, and GPS/Glonass/AGPS. Huawei Honor 8 dual-camera lens Camera Dual cameras are the Huawei Honor 8 differentiator. This kind of high-end feature is typically reserved for flagships, and it expands smartphone camera options with unique and creative shooting modes. The Honor 8 has 12-megapixel dual-camera system with a f/2.2 aperture and laser-assisted autofocus. It consists of one RGB sensor (color) and a separate monochrome sensor (black and white) with 1.2μm pixels. This all combines to produce “more vivid colors and crisper details, even in dim or low light,” according to Huawei. Those numbers line up with other mid-range smartphones. A high-end smartphone like the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge has a an f/1.7 lens (meaning it’s open wider and lets in more light) and its image pixels measure 1.4μm (meaning they are larger and able to absorb more light). Honor 8 extreme “beauty mode” selfie The Honor 8 camera performs like a flagship where it counts. It focuses fast and is quick on the snap. Using the fingerprint sensor fast launch, you can snap a pic from a sleeping Honor 8 in less than a few seconds. The Huawei camera app is robust, with plenty of features and filters, including a decent “Pro photo” mode that enables manual control of the ISO, exposure value, shutter speed, and white balance. We also like the “wide aperture” mode, which creates a shallow depth of field, blurring photo backgrounds, similar to a DSLR or interchangeable lens camera. The Honor 8 has an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, complete with Huawei’s creepy “Beauty Mode.” Mess with the setting enough, and it produces some disturbing results. The Android smartphone also shoots video that tops out at full HD (1080 x 1920), but has some decent features, including video pro mode and slow motion. Some higher-end handsets shoot 4k, and that’s overkill. The Honor 8 is good enough. Sample Photos The sample photos show off the Honor 8’s shooting prowess. Pictures have deep contrast and the colors pop. Details are well captured. Looking at the “Riverside” sign, the Honor 8 captured the chipping white paint around the black “T.” This was taken on a very sunny day, and a lesser camera would have blown it out. The monochrome sensor produces solid results, too. The contrast on the Madball pic shows its strengths. A simple black-and-white filter wouldn’t be able to duplicate that. We also enjoyed playing with the aperture, producing pics with a blurry background. The potential for an excellent photo is there. However, the results can’t match a DSLR, and the Honor 8 sometimes produces odd or inconsistent blurring. It’s not all great though. The low-light photos reveal the limits of a $400 smartphone’s camera. The sleeping dog pic is very noisy, with little color. Compare that to the same picture taken by the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge (the Galaxy S7 and Note 7 have similar camers), which has the best low-light camera, and best overall (even better than the iPhone 7). The difference is stark. Honor 8 Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Value The 32GB Honor 8 costs $399.99, while the 64GB costs $449.99, and Huawei offers three months of screen protection. This is a great price. In fact, $400 is the sweet spot for price-to-performance ratio, with both the ZTE Axon 7 and OnePlus 3 costing about the same. On paper, these two devices are slightly more powerful. The OnePlus 3 has 6GB of RAM and 64GB capacity, but lacks expandable storage, while the ZTE Axon 7 has the same storage capacity, with microSD expansion, and great audio output. In real use, it’s hard to distinguish between the three, and the Honor 8 has a slight edge in camera performance and build quality. Whichever device, you can’t go wrong. And they are all extremely compelling compared against $700 and $800 Samsung Galaxies and Apple iPhones. The traditional flagships may be better devices overall, but they are not $300 or $400 better. Bottom line: If we’re paying, it’s the Honor 8 or one of the other mid-range smartphones listed. If someone else is paying, give us an iPhone 7, Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, or Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Conclusion It’s not necessary to spend $700+ for a good smartphone. The Huawei Honor 8 is a prime example of a mid-range smartphone with near flagship performance and build. It even has high-end features like an excellent fingerprint scanner and dual-lens camera. The Honor 8 should please most Android smartphone users. The EMUI skin does little to detract from operation and navigation, and actually adds some novel features. We otherwise love the fingerprint sensor and quick launch options. It runs very well, and its camera shoots above its class in most instances. Many of its issues are acceptable for the price range, and only apparent when comparing it against more expensive smartphones. It’s not water resistant, and it can be very slick in hand because of its glass panels. The camera is poor in low light, the battery is just ok, and we wish it supported Verizon and Sprint. But by any standard it’s a good smartphone, and a great $400 smartphone. Give it a long look and you might end up saving good money. Pros: Excellent design, well built Stable and swift performance Decent camera with fun features An excellent value Cons: Battery just OK Camera struggles in low light Needs more carrier support LEAVE A COMMENT 0 Comments | Log in to comment All content posted on TechnologyGuide is granted to TechnologyGuide with electronic publishing rights in perpetuity, as all content posted on this site becomes a part of the community.

While businesses can send a variety of information to smartphones in close proximity via Bluetooth, the location-based sharing software can be expensive and difficult to set up. iBeacon’s potential is clearly present, yet many vendors were at a loss in terms of harnessing the technology. The London-based startup Live Beacon wants to make the process easier for businesses, while making information gathering seamless for consumers. Using a small, cloud-controlled device, the beacon connects the physical world with the digital, straight out of the box. The beacon broadcasts information to smartphones up to 30 meters away, and because it doesn’t require complex coding, anyone can do it. Additionally, the Live Beacon App allows smartphones to receive notifications when there’s a nearby beacon and automatically changes content when users move from beacon to beacon. Businesses can deploy Live Beacon in a variety of ways, including multimedia tours for cities and museums, digital brochures and pamphlets, and games. By providing access to real-time information updates, Live Beacon lets businesses easily control the way they interact with customers, creating intimate relations and lightning-fast marketing.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Why the iPhone 7 Plus camera is worth the upgrade Chris Davies - Sep 23, 2016 7 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The improvements Apple has made to the iPhone 7‘s camera are hitting me where it hurts: in my pocket. Although on paper the new handset’s 12-megapixels may look pretty much the same as the 12-megapixels the iPhone 6s offered before it, in reality it’s all-change in the iPhone 7’s top left corner. And, as I discovered while reviewing both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, that has an unexpectedly big impact on the photos you can capture, not to mention which version of Apple’s smartphone that I’d recommend. Both the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus have a 12-megapixel, f/1.8 aperture camera on the rear, with a six-element lens, quad-LED True Tone flash, 4K video recording, and optical image stabilization. In contrast, the iPhone 6s has an f/2.2 aperture, five-element lens. A lower f-stop number means more light is getting to the sensor, which adds up to improvements in low-light photography, among other things. It also has fewer LEDs in its flash, meaning less power and range than that of the iPhone 7. The boost in low-light performance is clear from the start. In the photos below, shot in the so-called “golden hour” just before the sunset, the iPhone 7 captures the honeyed richness of the mellowing light while not succumbing to murkiness or excessive grain. An older iPhone would require a longer exposure to achieve something similar, opening the door to blur if your hand wasn’t sufficiently still. The iPhone 7 Plus also adds a second camera right alongside the first. That offers the same resolution but a different lens: in this case, a “telephoto” f/2.8 aperture lens. In traditional camera terms, the main iPhone 7 Plus camera has a 22mm-equivalent lens, while the telephoto is a 56mm-equivalent; practically, it means the latter is a 2x zoom. For those iPhone users who have traditionally eschewed the larger “Plus” version and stuck with the smaller device, it presents something of a quandary. I’m one of those people: I just prefer how the 4.7-inch iPhone fits in my hand, not to mention in my pocket. Previously, the reason to opt for Plus-sized over regular was the optical image stabilization: the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus had it, but the iPhone 6 and 6s did not. It was an annoying omission, but not – for me, anyway – a deal-breaker. The digital stabilization was sufficient for my occasional use of video recording on the older phones. For 2016, though, Apple has both closed the gap and then increased it again. Optical stabilization is now included on the smaller iPhone 7, which is great, but the iPhone 7 Plus throws in its second rear camera. Today, that gives you 2x optical zoom and a higher-quality digital zoom; soon (if you’re not on the iOS 10 public beta track, at least) you’ll get Apple’s own Portrait mode, with its faux-bokeh effect. 1x 28mm f/1.8 1/1198 3.99mm ISO20 2X Optical Zoom / 56mm f/2.8 1/222 6.6mm ISO20 6X digital zoom f/2.8 1/209 6.6mm ISO20 I’ve been surprised quite how much I used the optical zoom on the iPhone 7 Plus: to the point where, even though I had one of each new iPhone in my pockets, I’d automatically reach for the bigger handset when I wanted to take a photo. Knowing there’s no loss of quality makes all the difference, especially when you just physically can’t get any closer to your subject. Vincent has felt the same way: he was already a Plus-sized iPhone fan, but has now made extensive use of the optical zoom on a number of events. It came in handy for his recent trip to Circuit of Americas for the 2016 FIA WEC race, for instance, helping capture an unexpected pit-stop with an impressive absence of blur. He’s also been putting the microphones through their paces. There are actually four on the iPhone 7, one behind each of the grilles on the bottom of the phone, and two up at the top. Usually Vincent uses a Shure microphone that plugs into the Lightning port, but for the majority of his testing he’s been relying on the iPhone’s own abilities. There’s an impressive directionality to the sound, not to mention the effective noise cancellation. I, meanwhile, recorded the interior shots in this video of the new Bentley Flying Spur V8 S with the iPhone 7 Plus, and its native microphones did a solid job of focusing on my voice rather than road or engine noise. Admittedly, the automaker’s soundproofing efforts didn’t hurt matters either. It’s not entirely perfect, of course. With the iPhone 7 Plus, I’ve found the controls for the zoom and the exposure can get confused: they’re fairly close together, and sometimes I’ve wanted to manually adjust exposure and ended up zooming in instead. Meanwhile, if you want any more control over your shot than exposure, toggling HDR and the flash, and where the focus is set, you’ll have to look beyond Apple’s own camera app. While Android manufacturers have been concentrating on putting “Pro” modes in their software, Apple leaves more granular control up to third-party camera app developers. I’m not saying the iPhone 7 is a bad choice. The standard 12-megapixel camera is capable of some amazing shots, and of course shares the same excellent low-light performance of its bigger sibling. Switching to a f/1.8 aperture means, even if you don’t get the fancy computation Portrait mode, the shallower depth of field flatters subjects more. NOW READ: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Review One of the biggest reasons I’m planning on going Plus this time, however, is the possibilities to third-party developers. Apple is throwing open its dual-camera APIs: not only will apps be able to tap into the RAW output of the sensors, but do all manner of photo-trickery with the twin lenses. I suspect the Cupertino firm’s Portrait mode is only the tip of the iceberg, and while it’s not the first to dabble in the possibilities two cameras present, the sheer scale that the iPhone ecosystem represents means it’s likely to see the most developers weigh in. When those innovative apps hit the App Store, I don’t want to be left out. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Image Gallery Tags AppleCameraiPhoneiPhone 7iPhone 7 PlusPhotography Must Read Bits & Bytes Bucking trends, Acura reveals vision of tomorrow’s dashboard Now Alfa Romeo has an SUV, and we have so many questions 2017 Honda Civic Hatchback First Drive Jaguar I-PACE Concept previews Model X rivaling EV for 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Review (late-2016) Search © 2005-2016 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved.

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear Analyst Says iPhone SE Was a One-Off for Apple View All Editorials → Apple’s Tuplejump Purchase Hints at a Smarter Siri and Echo Competitor Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet Sep 23rd, 2016 11:53 AM EST | Analysis Apple indirectly confirmed it purchased the machine learning company Tuplejump, adding to its collection of artificial intelligence talent. Tuplejump’s technology is designed to process large amounts of data to make it easier to work with, which sounds like a great fit for Siri. Siri could get a serious intelligence boost with Apple’s AI purchases After hearing rumors that Tuplejump had been purchased, TechCrunch asked Apple and was told, “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” That’s Apple-speak for “Yes, we bought the company.” Tuplejump is the company behind the open source project FiloDB, which is a system designed to process analytics and machine learning to large data streams in real time. The project has been pulled from github, which means Apple likely plans to keep FiloDB all to itself. This isn’t Apple’s first artificial intelligence and machine learning purchase. The iPhone and Mac maker bought Perceptio in 2015, and Turi earlier this year. Perceptio was working on a deep learning image recognition system, and Turi focused on distributing machine learning across multiple servers. Putting the pieces together Combining all three purchases, Apple could create an artificial intelligence system that processes massive amounts of data in real time across a server farm to analyze text, spoken words, and images, too. That could make Siri more responsive and much better at accurately anticipating our needs—or simply providing appropriate responses to our questions and requests. That also fits nicely with reports of a prototype Apple-made Echo competitor. Echo is Amazon’s voice-based personal assistant appliance designed to respond to user’s spoken commands and questions. Bloomberg’s sources say Apple is testing a similar device, which would be essentially a stand-alone Siri interface. Apple hasn’t confirmed the project, but has submitted a mystery device to the FCC for approval. The device include Bluetooth and NFC, but little else is know about what it is or does. Still, the timing is interesting because Amazon Echo is already available, and Google’s competing Home device is coming soon. Assuming Apple is jumping into this market as well, it’s about the right time for something to show up waiting for FCC approval. Assuming Apple really is working on an Echo competitor, finding ways to make theirs smarter, faster, and more friendly will take some serious talent—like the engineers Apple picked up from Perceptio, Turi, and now Tuplejump.

Siri can’t even read a complete weather forecast. You know, high and low temp with chance of rain/snow. Maybe winds… “I can only only answer one weather fact at a time. Sorry about that,” She says. Maybe Apple can get that done before we let her drive McLarens on the highway. September 23, 2016 at 2:52 EST PM ibuck September 23, 2016 I just have a suspicion that Siri’s going to get a lot smarter soon. Will Apple roll out improvements bit by bit, or will they secretly reserve improvements until they can wow us? September 23, 2016 at 8:51 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

While the iPhone 7 goes on sale in 30 additional countries around the world today, India is set to kick off iPhone 7 sales on October 7. BGR India reports that Flipkart is Apple’s second online retail partner in the country, joining Infibeam: The partnership will be win-win for both Apple and Flipkart. For Apple, it ensures that the iPhones are sold at its mandated pricing and it doesn’t lead to price erosion as it had happened last year with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus where Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm started discounting iPhones to gain GMV. For Flipkart, it will not only have to bleed money in discounts but will also get marketing support from Apple. Despite the focus on India as a growing market and huge opportunity for Apple, selling iPhones in the region has been far more complex for the company than in other countries around the world which hasn’t helped sales. It was reported earlier this month that Apple could be planning to manufacture some iPhones in India through Foxconn, which has previously been rumored. Doing so could help Apple in the long-term as it continues to struggle with its own retail presence in India. Back in July, it was reported that the local government was planning to give the final go-ahead on allowing Apple to bring its retail stores to the country, although the wind has changed in all directions in recent months as details over where iPhones are manufactured and exceptions to local law have been at issue. For its part, Apple has focused on assisting the app developer economy in India with its app accelerator effort while Tim Cook has met and lobbied government officials in an effort to sway their decision. At any rate, iPhone 7 customers in India next month will have one more official online retail option on October 7 until Apple eventually gets the green light to sell its products directly.

Here’s Why the Water Is So Dangerous TIME Tech apps Google Allo vs. Apple iMessage vs. Facebook Messenger: How They Compare Lisa Eadicicco @lisaeadicicco Sept. 23, 2016 SHARE Which is the best messaging app? + READ ARTICLE The messaging apps you likely use each day, like Apple’s iMessage and Facebook Messenger, have changed dramatically over the past few months. These apps, primarily designed for simple conversation, are gradually evolving into platforms for more complex messaging and outside services. The shift can be compared to the move from mobile webpages to apps that took place once smartphones like the iPhone rose in popularity nearly a decade ago. Google’s new messaging app Allo, for example, integrates the company’s search prowess directly into text conversations. Apple recently launched an entire store just for apps meant to be used within its messaging app, iMessage. And Facebook earlier this year invited companies to design their own chat bots for its Messenger app, which help you shop or book travel plans. Apple, Google, and Facebook’s messaging apps serve similar purposes, but in different ways. Here’s a closer look at how they differ. Google Allo Lisa Eadicicco Allo’s biggest asset is its integration with Google Assistant, the company’s conversational new virtual aid that can answer questions and make suggestions. Allo offers two ways to interact with Google Assistant. In a messaging thread, typing the trigger phrase “@google” will tell the assistant to pay attention to the next string of text you type so that it can answer your query. When making plans with a friend, you might type something like, “@google Show me movie times near me?” to display upcoming showings. You can also chat with Google Assistant one-on-one to ask it questions, set alarms, tell jokes, find news, and remember information like hotel room numbers, among other things. At this point, Google Assistant adds some convenience to texting by making it easier to retrieve information without having to juggle multiple apps. But for now, it’s only helpful for basic tasks. For finding more complicated answers — like public transportation schedules — you’re still better off using a dedicated search app or web browser. A crucial difference between Allo and the messaging apps offered by Apple and Facebook is that it doesn’t yet offer third-party apps, although Google is considering doing so in the future. With Allo, you can hunt for nearby restaurants and browse movie times without leaving a text conversation, but you can’t book a table or buy tickets for now. While many texting apps and keyboards can suggest words as you type, Allo goes a step farther by offering up full replies based on the message you’ve just received. If a sibling sends you a photo of the family dog, Allo might suggest that you say something like “Aww!” or “How cute!” in response. This artificial intelligence-powered feature is part of what makes Allo different than iMessage or Facebook Messenger. These suggestions are on point and natural-sounding for the most part, but I found that in most instances I preferred to type out my own responses unless I was in a rush. Stickers and expression are also an important part of the Allo experience. There are currently around 25 sticker packs available to download in Allo, which is an especially slim selection compared to the 6,000 sticker collections Facebook Messenger offers. Apple hasn’t said how many stickers are currently available for iMessage, but there are dozens upon dozens in the App Store already. These range from recognizable brand-name characters like Mickey Mouse and Mario to cute animals. The stickers in Allo, comparatively, are made by independent artists and studios. Allo also has an Incognito Mode, which, as the name implies, is meant to offer more privacy for sensitive conversations. With Incognito Mode enabled, all chats are encrypted end-to-end. You can also choose to make your messages disappear after a certain amount of time has passed. This is similar to the Secret Conversations feature available in Facebook Messenger’s mobile app. However, many reviewers have criticized Google for not activating this functionality by default, as Apple does with iMessage. Google also stores your Allo conversation history, even though it said it wouldn’t look at your messages when it initially unveiled the app, as The Verge noted. (Google says it does this in order to improve its service, but the company’s advertising-based business model is built around knowing as much about its users as possible.) Unlike Messenger and iMessage, Allo is only available on mobile, for both iOS and Android. This means you can’t continue your chats on your computer while at work or get notifications on your desktop or laptop like you can with Apple and Facebook’s respective apps. Apple iMessage Lisa Eadicicco When Apple unveiled the new Apple TV last year, the company did so with the tagline “The future of TV is apps.” Now it seems the company is taking the same approach to messaging. The new version of iMessage, which recently launched with iOS 10, includes an App Store filled with apps just for Apple’s messaging app. You could, for example, download The Weather Channel’s app for iMessage to look up the forecast and share it with a friend without switching between apps. Or you might have a few friends vote on which restaurant the group should choose for dinner that night through OpenTable. Apple’s approach to messaging differs from those of Google and Facebook in that it doesn’t focus on the “conversational interface.” This idea has been front and center in both Facebook and Google’s respective apps. Part of the appeal behind Allo, for example, is that you can ask Google to answer questions or retrieve information for you in the same way you would type a message to a friend. Similarly, thousands of businesses have launched chatbots for Facebook Messenger with the goal of making it easier to use their services through casual communication. But using apps in iMessage largely feels the same as interacting with other apps on your phone, rather than chatting with a virtual assistant or automated bot. You can choose to open an app within the text field of your message or expand it to run in full screen mode. iMessage has changed in other ways, too. In addition to the new stickers, Apple has added visual effects that Facebook and Google’s apps lack. Some examples include: The ability to send handwritten notes by holding the phone in landscape mode, tapping a word or phrase to replace it with an emoji, and sending a virtual heartbeat to recipient. Another feature unique to iMessage is the ability to send full screen animations with a text, like a barrage of fireworks in the backdrop of a message that says “Congratulations.” iMessage also allows users to send blurred text or photos that unscramble when the recipient swipes over the message. With the new iMessage, it’s possible to make text bubbles larger or smaller, (Allo offers a similar effect), and tap on a specific in a message within a thread to ‘react’ to it, like you would a Facebook status. Plus, iMessage users can now search for animated GIFs and images with the iPhone’s keyboard by default. Apple’s service is only available on Apple products, including iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, and iPod Touch devices. Facebook Messenger Lisa Eadicicco Facebook began integrating third-party services into its chat app before Apple and Google, first introducing Messenger as a Platform in 2015. Facebook took this a step further in April, inviting app makers to create chatbots for its messaging app. There are currently more than 30,000 bots on Facebook Messenger, allowing users to shop, get weather forecasts, and read the news within the app. When done well, using bots in Messenger almost feels like having personal assistants for specific tasks. The Whole Foods bot, for example, serves up recipe ideas. Shopping app Spring’s bot, meanwhile, will ask you what you’re shopping for and pull up relevant items. The experience is different with each bot. Some will proactively ask you what need help with, while others field questions or send news updates. What each bot does is largely in the hands of their developers rather than Facebook, which is why some bots are more responsive and engaging than others. By contrast, the Google Assistant experience is consistent since Google is in full control. In addition to chatbots, Facebook also lets third-party apps plug into Messenger. These are different than chatbots in that they’re not conversational, instead working more like iMessage apps. You can, for instance, request an Uber or Lyft when chatting with a friend or send money through Facebook’s payment service without leaving your conversation. Some of these options appear in your in the tool bar above the text field in Messenger, while a larger selection is accessible in the More section. Many of the app integrations currently available for Messenger include different types of keyboards, games, quizzes, and photo apps. Other than its massive sticker library and selection of third party keyboards, Facebook doesn’t offer many different tools for expression. You can’t, for example, add full-screen animations to a message or tap a word to replace it with an emoji the way you can with iMessage. It did, however, recently gain the ability to start a live video in a conversation and embed polls in group chats. Facebook Messenger is available for iOS and Android and can also be used on the desktop. Conclusion Ultimately, most people will probably opt for the messaging platform that’s most convenient for them. Most often, that’s the app that most of their friends and family members are currently using. This is where Apple and Facebook have a major advantage over Allo. iMessage is baked into every iPhone by default, while Facebook’s Messenger app is among the largest messaging services in the world, boasting 1 billion users. With Allo, Google will have to convince users to download a new app they likely haven’t heard of. Still, there are reasons to like (or dislike) each app. The ability to search for GIFs and stickers alone is a major step forward for iMessage, which has lagged behind apps like Facebook Messenger in this respect until now. The overall app experience in iMessage, from discovering new apps to actually using them, feels very much like installing regular apps on your iPhone, which Apple fans will likely appreciate. Messenger, on the other hand, appears to be focused on building the conversational user interface by pushing developers to create chatbots for its platform. It’s still early days for these bots, and the vast majority of them still have yet to prove their worth. Regardless, it’s clear Facebook is focused on messaging, as the app has seen several significant changes over the past year alone. For now, the app’s ease of use and vast selection of stickers remain its biggest strengths. Allo has potential, but for now it feels more like a testbed for Google Assistant more than anything else. The idea of having a virtual assistant present in chats to help you make plans with friends is helpful and appealing, but it does present some privacy concerns. For now, the lack of third party app integration and desktop compatibility puts Allo behind Messenger and iMessage, although it will be interesting to see how Google Assistant improves over time.

Its popularity has prompted plenty of copycats, and a new Bloomberg report indicates that Apple is stepping up its own efforts to offer a competitor. An Echo-like device, built around Apple’s Siri voice assistant software, is said to have left the R&D stage and entered prototype testing inside Apple’s labs. Apple has already laid much of the groundwork for creating what we might call a Siri speaker, having opened up Siri to third-party developers and also made it available on macOS computers as well as mobile iOS devices. The next logical step is indeed to anchor Siri inside the home, where Bloomberg’s report fleshes out a few more of the details. The device in question is said to serve many of the same purposes as an Echo, controlling appliances, locks, lights, and curtains via voice controls. In order to differentiate itself, Apple will reportedly focus on offering more advanced microphone and speaker technology, though no specifics are as yet known. Some of the prototypes under consideration also include facial recognition, which may be used to perform automatic adjustments based on knowing who is in a room or their emotional state. But Bloomberg cautions that it’s still a project in its early stages that could be scrapped altogether if the results don’t live up to Apple’s expectations. One approach that Apple had considered, but ultimately abandoned, was to build all this Echo-like functionality into the Apple TV. But tacking home controls onto a TV entertainment system doesn’t seem like a natural fit, which is probably why Apple agreed with Amazon’s belief — also echoed by Google and its Google Home speaker — that dedicated hardware is required. With Apple HomeKit already recruiting partners for Apple’s assault on the smart home, the major key missing is the speaker itself, which is evidently making progress through Apple’s internal development program.

Apple is in talks with McLaren for a potential acquisition, report says Posted Sep 21, 2016 by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story Old timey roller coasters and new timey virtual reality Apple, the tech company, is negotiating with McLaren, the car manufacturer, according to the Financial Times. Yes, you’ve read that correctly. These negotiations have been ongoing for months and could lead to an acquisition, or at least a strategic investment. More precisely, Apple is talking with McLaren Technology Group, the parent company of all things McLaren, including McLaren Automotive. While McLaren is a famous name in the world of supercars and Formula One, it isn’t a gigantic car manufacturing company. The company reported $617 million in revenue (£475 million) for the entire year of 2015, representing $27 million in net profit (£20.8 million). The FT thinks this acquisition could cost between $1.3 billion and $2 billion (between £1 billion and £1.5 billion). While this seems like a significant acquisition for Apple, the company has made a bigger acquisition in the past with Beats. In particular, when it comes to automotive, rumor has it that Apple has been working on a secret car project for years. Bob Mansfield recently took over the car division at Apple. The company also recently made a $1 billion investment into Didi Chuxing. While Apple engineers are hard at work on self-driving technology, manufacturing a car is still uncharted territory for the tech company. Acquiring McLaren could be a way to hire many engineers who know how to make cars, engines, chassis and more. This is still an early report and the acquisition talks could still fall through. Either way, it’s interesting to see that Apple wants to be a serious player in the car space. Update: McLaren told the BBC that the company isn’t having any investment discussion with Apple right now. McLaren: "We can confirm McLaren is not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment" — Adam Parsons (@AdamParsons1) September 21, 2016 Independently, the NYT confirmed that Apple and McLaren have been talking about a potential investment. McLaren’s statement could mean that it’s an acquisition (not an investment), it has closed (not in discussion) or the discussion has ended.

Another 'Fair Trade Commission' is about to open an Investigation into Apple's Carrier Contracts   Asia seems to be on the same page in how to attack Apple so that their local manufacturers or services companies could get the leg up on Apple. In Taiwan the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) officially investigated allegations that Apple Inc. has been interfering in the pricing of iPhones sold by Taiwan's telecom operators. That was in 2013. Then in 2014 Korea's Fair Trade Commission was set to investigate Apple's unfair contracts with local carriers that of course would help LG and Samsung. Now it's Japan's Fair Trade Commission that's decided to open an investigation into Apple's contract with carriers.   According to a new Reuters report, "Japanese regulators are considering taking action against Apple Inc over possible antitrust violations that may have helped it dominate the nation's smartphone sales, government sources said, a move that could hit the company's profit margins in one of its most profitable markets.   In a report published last month, Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said that NTT Docomo, KDDI Corp and Softbank Group were refusing to sell older surplus iPhone models to third party retailers, thereby hobbling smaller competitors.   Apple was not named in that report, but two senior government sources told Reuters that regulators were also focusing on Apple's supply agreements with all three carriers.   Under those deals, surplus stock of older iPhones is kept out of the market and sent to overseas markets, such as Hong Kong, according to industry sources.   The carriers, locked in a costly battle to win consumers who covet iPhones, also bulk purchase the Apple smartphones and sell them at a discount, which gives the U.S. company an advantage over rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co, according to the two government officials and an industry source.   The strategy has helped Apple sustain demand for new iPhones, making Japan one of its most profitable markets. The U.S. company accounts for almost one in every two smartphones sold in Japan, its largest share in a major market. It also kept the top three carriers control more than 90 percent of the mobile phone market. For more on this story, read the full Reuters report here.   With the iPhone being in the Japanese market for close to a decade now, isn't it a little strange that out of the blue their Fair Trade Commission is now deciding to move to investigate Apple? Is it because Apple isn't supporting Japan Display open a new OLED plant? Who knows?   Yet no matter how you look at it, it appears that pure politics is at play these days and it's a pattern throughout Asia between the so-called 'Fair Trade Commissions' of Taiwan, Korea and Japan. Add to that the EU's 'Commissioner for Competition' taking an axe to Apple's backside this month, and it sure seems like it's open season on the U.S. premium smartphone leader Apple these days.   You know, all this political talk about it's time to renegotiate free trade deals around the world to get the U.S. back on the winning side of the ledger again is sure sounding better every day.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Then, the reports began to dwindle and we haven’t heard much sense. Now, Bloomberg is reporting that the product is now in early prototyping stages and is being tested outside of Apple’s labs. The report says work on the product began over two years ago. Started more than two years ago, the project has exited the research and development lab and is now in prototype testing, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unannounced Apple projects. Like Amazon Inc.’s Echo, the device is designed to control appliances, locks, lights and curtains via voice activation, the people said. Apple hasn’t finalized plans for the device and could still scrap the project. Facial recognition is also reported to be available. Apple has acquired the facial recognition startups Faceshift and Emotient over the past two years, which may help the device act based on who is in a room or a person’s emotional state. The company also considered building similar functionality into the Apple TV but decided not to follow through on the idea. Before setting its sights on a standalone speaker, Apple attempted to integrate the functionality of an Amazon Echo-like device into the Apple TV, three people said. This would have allowed users to shout commands from the couch to the TV box. Those efforts were abandoned in favor of putting the voice-command features into a remote control when the latest set-top box shipped in October 2015. Apple engineers are said to be testing the device in their own homes, something Apple has done in the past. For example, the fourth-generation Apple TV was reportedly tested in a home for around a year before launching, and Tim Cook tested an iPad six months in advanced. Apple’s end goal is to have Siri available wherever you are, without needing to open an app or reactivate Siri. Apple’s goal is for Siri to be able to control the entire system without having to open an app or reactivate Siri. For example, a user would be able to ask their iPhone to open a web page and then share it with a friend without the need to ever launch the Siri interface. Amazon has been on a roll with its Echo intelligent speaker with now multiple variations available to customers.

According to Apple, this release fixes the Lightning audio issue that would prevent audio playback controls after five minutes of inactivity. Apple also notes that it fixes an issue with iCloud Photo Library force quitting and fixes an issue where it would prevent some app extensions to work.   Those who intend to use Lightning headphones or Apple’s own Lightning to 3.5mm headphone adapter should update now (or any iPhone 7 user for that matter). To do so, hop into Settings > General > Software Update. Tags: iOS, iOS 10, iOS 10.0.2, Public, Software About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand. You can find him on Twitter @iPeterCao.

The device’s model number is A1844 and includes both a Bluetooth and NFC radio. In terms of power, it draws between 100mA and 700mA and between 5.5V and 13.2V. It compares the most with the latest generation Apple TV at 12V at 0.917A or the iPhone 5V at 2.4A. The only physical design we see is two torx screws at the bottom of the chassis. But that doesn’t give us any information. As per typical Apple, they filed with the minimum requirements needed and tried not to give things like dimensions, technical descriptions, antenna locations, etc. away. The report does mention color-coded cables, but that may just be for Apple’s own internal testing. Tags: Bluetooth, FCC, NFC About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand. You can find him on Twitter @iPeterCao.

SUBSCRIBE Report: Apple may be six months from launching an Echo-like Siri assistant Device will need some differentiated features to compete effectively with Amazon and soon Google Home.Device will need some differentiated features to compete effectively with Amazon, and soon, Google Home. Greg Sterling on September 23, 2016 at 1:09 pm More A second report, from Bloomberg, says that Apple is developing an Amazon Echo-like stand alone virtual assistant based on Siri. That rumor was first reported in May by The Information. The project apparently dates from roughly two years ago and is now in the testing phase, according to Bloomberg. “People familiar with the matter” who “asked not to be identified” also indicated that it’s intended to be a smart-home controller like Amazon Alexa. Accordingly, it would tap into Apple’s HomeKit, which enables Siri to control third-party smart home applications, appliances and services. According to the report, Apple seeks to leapfrog the Echo and Google’s recently announced Home device with “more advanced microphone and speaker technology,” as well as facial recognition. The article says prototype devices are currently in Apple employees’ homes and that time to market could be as short as six months or up to a year from now — provided the product actually comes to market. At its WWDC conference in June, Apple introduced an API that enables developers to more deeply integrate with Siri. Those doing so and using the API will also benefit if there’s a stand-alone Siri device, and vice versa. Currently, Amazon Alexa has more than 2,500 “skills,” most of which offer third-party content. (Discovery is a problem, however.) Transactions are already available for selected skills, with more to follow. Transactions (e.g., reservations) are also an announced part of the Google Home road map. The one major company that appears not to have a smart home virtual assistant in the works — but probably should — is Microsoft (Cortana). Echo is one of Amazon’s best-selling products, and a successful Siri device could create a new hardware category for Apple. The challenge is that it would need to be clearly different/better, given Amazon’s momentum and the imminent launch of Google Home, which will have some advanced “conversational search” capabilities.

The company’s hotel brand Aloft in recent weeks started trialing voice-activated hotel rooms in its Boston Seaport and Santa Clara properties. The service, currently enabled in 10 rooms at each property, includes guests being greeted by a personalized welcome letter on the in-room TV when they check in. They quickly learn that a branded iPad is ready to be set up with a “Hey Siri” to learn the sound of their voice so it can go on to control the guest’s room experience. DON'T MISS: 10 hidden gestures in iOS 10 to help you get the most out of your iPhone Once the iPad learns the guest’s voice, says Aloft Hotels general brand manager Eric Marlo, a menu will list all of the functions available - things like personalized streaming for Apple or Android devices, Netflix, mapping for local area attractions and a full integrated TV experience. The iPads present guests with a tutorial to guide them through the setup process, and the voice-activated hotel rooms work with Apple HomeKit to allow guests to control the temperature, the lights via preset lighting options, music, or browsing the Internet. When the guest checks out, a message is sent to the app erasing all data so that the next guest walks into the room with a fresh app and no information stored from the previous occupant. “The world is constantly changing, especially in hospitality, and we need to adapt to it,” Marlo tells BGR. “Guests utilize similar innovations at home and may already be using Apple HomeKit in their personal lives, so we want them to have an integrated experience when they travel and stay at Aloft as well. Our guests want a level of personalization unlike ever before, which includes controlling their guest experience.” This experience is also the foundation of more to come, at both Aloft and elsewhere. This is actually the latest tech-focused offering from Aloft, which has previously introduced a robotic bellhop it calls Botlr (butler, get it?) that could accompany guests to their rooms. The chain rolled out a service that let guests use their smartphones as room keys and a service called RoomCast Powered by Chromecast, which lets guests stream content from their smart devices to guest room TVs minus passwords and logins (currently in the pilot phase at Aloft New Orleans.) Talking to the room, Marlo explained, seemed like the natural next step. Whether these offerings seem gimmicky or point the way forward, they do underscore how much the hotel room experience is changing beyond the expectation of a TV, bed and an assortment of other basic conveniences. Hilton recently rolled out a kind of concierge robot helper of its own — Connie — powered by IBM’s Watson that can do things like make restaurant recommendations for guests in addition to greeting them and answering simple questions. It’s not all high-tech tweaks, to be sure. Hospitality improvements touch everything from healthier food to greener facilities to quality linens for bedding as well as the basic layout of the room itself. But companies like Starwood-Aloft have started to think way beyond that. For example, Marlo said the chain has already gotten “tons of calls” from other properties looking to have the voice-activated offerings installed. Which is why he says he’s confident this will make its way to more Aloft properties as well as across the Starwood portfolio. “In thinking of what’s next for our voice-activated hotel rooms, we’re looking into the idea of room delivery on the app from our Re:Fuel lobby bars,” Marlo says. “This would bring the grab and go options from the main level straight to the guest’s door – and how cool would it be if it was a property with a Botlr delivering it.

Apple characteristically requested permanent confidentiality for most of the documents in the filing, including photos, user manuals, and schematics, so the entry largely remains a mystery. What we do know is the device has a model number of A1844, which does not line up with any existing Apple products. A regulatory label shows the device has two Torx screws on the back plate of the device, which appears to have at least two slightly curved edges. The device has an electrical rating of 5.5V to 13.2V. Test reports completed by UL Verification Services also reveal the wireless device has Bluetooth and NFC, although Wi-Fi is not mentioned. Some websites have speculated the filing could represent a new Apple TV, but the device appears to be smaller based on the artwork -- although there are no exact measurements for scale. The device also has oddly specific regulatory text etched directly on the back of the device, including a wiring guide, which would be uncharacteristic of Apple to include on the exterior of a consumer-facing product. Perhaps, then, the wireless device is for internal use. Back in 2014, an FCC filing revealed Apple's first-party iBeacon hardware, for example, which the company uses in its retail stores. Originally introduced at WWDC 2013, iBeacon technology enables iOS devices to communicate with transmitters via Bluetooth LE in order to deliver relevant information to apps and services when a user is nearby. Without any supplemental information, the FCC filing will likely remain a mystery. At this point, virtually any wild speculation is fair game, ranging from a new AirPort Extreme to Apple's widely rumored Siri-enabled speaker for smart homes, although the latter product is reportedly still being prototyped.

 Apple just released a fix for its annoying Lightning headphones glitch Jeff Dunn Sep. 23, 2016, 12:42 PM 4,047 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple's iPhone 7 and EarPods with Lightning connector. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Apple has released its latest software update for iOS devices, version 10.0.2, which should resolve a glitch that momentarily prevented the physical controls on some Lightning-based audio devices from working after a certain period of time. Apple confirmed to Business Insider’s Steve Kovach that it was aware of the issue and would soon issue a fix earlier this week. Anecdotally, I tested the update on an iPhone SE with a pair of Lightning EarPods, and things appeared to work as normal. (Though it’s worth noting that the initial issue appeared to happen intermittently — some people were able to adjust volume and take calls like normal, others’ buttons simply stopped working. If you still see problems, let us know.) Whatever the case, the bug highlights one of the more annoying bits of listening to audio on a device like the iPhone 7, which, as you’ve likely heard by now, doesn’t include an analog headphone jack. Having to wait on a software update to make your (wired) headphones work as normal isn’t anyone’s idea of fun. That said, Apple's response was relatively swift. In addition to the headphone control patch, Apple says the update fixes an issue that’d cause the Photos app to close when activating your iCloud Photo Library, as well as an issue that “prevented enabling some app extensions.” SEE ALSO: Sorry, Apple: The Lightning port doesn't magically make EarPods sound better More: Tech Gadgets Apple iOS 10 Software iOS iPhones Lightning EarPods Lightning Headphone jack facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple just released a fix for its annoying Lightning headphones glitch Apple just released a fix for its annoying Lightning headphones glitch Apple has released its latest software update...

 This is a big sign Apple Music is thinking like a record label Kif Leswing Sep. 23, 2016, 12:49 PM 3,081 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook, right, hugs Beats by Dre co-founder and Apple employee Jimmy Iovine at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, Monday, June 8, 2015. AP Photo/Jeff Chiu Apple just hired a former Epic Records executive who could help Apple Music double down on streaming exclusives.  Scott Seviour, a former senior vice president at Epic Records, is joining Apple in Los Angeles to work on original content. At Epic, which he left in 2014, he worked with LA Reid, the CEO of Epic and a veteran music executive most famous for appearing on "The X Factor."  Apple confirmed the hire but declined to comment on Seviour's specific role beyond that he will be working on Apple Music. Seviour did not respond to a request for comment. Seviour has a big background in A&R, like Larry Jackson, Apple Music's head of original content. A&R is the part of the music business that looks to sign and develop new artists. Seviour also handled video production at Epic.  The hire signals a continued emphasis in securing streaming exclusives — the primary way Apple Music has distinguished its service so far.  Scott Seviour. Linkedin In the past year, albums from Frank Ocean, Future, Travis Scott, Chance the Rapper, Britney Spears, Drake, and others have appeared on Apple Music before becoming available on rival streaming services like Spotify and Tidal.  In many ways, Apple Music is functioning like a record label — and a radio station, and an investor or producer too. Apple is coaxing big-name stars to release their music on Apple Music, and promoting those records while also funding their music videos. Apple also gives artists a platform to make announcements through its internet radio station, Beats 1.  "We'd like to be a home where artists can do their thing," Jimmy Iovine, head of Apple Music, told Rolling Stone in June. Jackson says the goal for Apple Music is to put the service "at the intersection of all things relevant in pop culture."

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured Apple enters into an exclusive partnership with Flipkart to sell iPhone 7 in India By Meenakshi Rawat - 23/09/2016 Flipkart will soon add the recently launched Apple flagships to its kitty, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Indian e-commerce platform has entered into an exclusive partnership with Apple to sell iPhone 7 series on its platform. The front page of Flipkart read “iPhone 7 coming soon.’’ It seems like both iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will arrive on the launch date itself i.e. October 7. The front page advertisement lands to a page which elaborates the specifications and features of the phone. For now, there is no option of pre-ordering the phones. Apple dealers accepting iPhone 7 pre-orders A few days back, we informed you about the authorized dealers in the Northern part of India accepting iPhone 7 and 7 Plus pre-orders. iWorld is one of them where you can select the color and storage capacity of the phone you want to reserve. Other than that, Apple’s Premium Partner Unicorn is also accepting pre-bookings where you have to pay Rs. 5000 for the same. Meanwhile, Apple has dropped the price of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in India by up to Rs. 22,000. On the other hand, there is no change in the pricing of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in India. You can expect the final declaration about the prices of these smartphones ahead of the iPhone 7 launch in India. Apple iPhone 7 Specifications Talking about the latest iPhone 7, Apple has ditched the 3.5mm jack and also the 16GB storage variant. The iPhone 7 comes with a base model of 32GB; the other two variants are 128GB and 256GB. Besides, a new wireless AirPods have also been launched which comes in a wireless design. The iPhone 7 and its Plus version pack A10 Fusion chipset, bigger battery, Retina HD display, and stereo speakers at both sides of the phone. It comes in two new color options – matte black and jet black. The sale of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is expected to boost in India after the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 battery issue. Samsung has been the top selling brands in India for some time now, but now it has to regain the customers’ confidence alongside betting the sales of iPhone 7 in India.

And as it’s significantly cheaper in the so-called ‘off season’, you should seriously think about a winter visit to New York. The chilly wind is a perfect excuse to explore Manhattan beyond Times Square. A tour of Grand Central Terminal is a fascinating way to spend an hour, taking in its striking architecture and history – from the birth of the American railway, through its post-war decline to its 1990s renovation and the glimmering glory it enjoys today. If you’re in the mood for culture, the Whitney Museum of American Art boasts five floors of contemporary paintings and sculpture, including a striking series of outdoor galleries where the artworks do their best to compete with an incredible view of the Lower West Side. A walk through Manhattan’s newest park – the High Line – is a great way to see the city. It is built on an elevated railway track disused since the 1980s and runs for a mile and a half along the island’s west side. Grand Central Terminal main clock at information booth in main Hall The High Line If you’re after a night out to remember, New York’s Lincoln Centre hosts the ­Metropolitan Opera, one of the most ­celebrated companies in the world with a reputation for eye-popping productions featuring lavish sets and costumes. There’s no need to worry that you’ll get lost in the Italian language, as the optional subtitles screened on the seat backs will keep you up to speed with what’s happening. And why not make a night of it with a dinner and performance ticket package? Fine food is served in the theatre’s Grand Tier Restaurant which boasts stunning views of the Plaza outside. Courses are perfectly timed so you won’t miss the curtain, and they even serve dessert in the interval. Top off your night with a drink at one of the countless rooftop bars popping up across the city. The St Cloud bar at the Knickerbocker Hotel offers a unique, top-down view of Times Square – if you can handle the chill. If it’s your first time in NYC, you’ll no doubt want to see a few of the traditional sights and a CityPASS is great value. It gets you access to six of a choice of nine top sights, including Top of the Rock and the Empire State Building. A trip up the Empire State is absolutely unmissable, but if time is at a premium go as early as possible on a Sunday morning – you’ll save hours by getting ahead of the queues. Lincoln Center for Performing Arts Fans of craft ales should venture a few stops on the subway – which is incredibly cheap compared to London’s Tube – under the East River to the Brooklyn Brewery, the greatest hipster brewing facility in the world. Tours are available on weekends, led by the bearded and flannel-clad experts who make the range of very tasty beers. The tasting room is just yards away from where it’s brewed but be warned, queues for the bar get very long, which is as good an excuse as any to start drinking early. They don’t have a kitchen in the brewery, but you can order in food from nearby takeaways to line your stomach. Alternatively, there’s usually a van parked outside which cooks very fine Sicilian pizza for $3 a slice. Top off your boozy day in Brooklyn with a meal at MP Taverna, a newish restaurant serving excellent Greek-inspired food. Don’t miss their dips, served with a huge plate of warm flatbreads. Obviously in a cold New York winter, indoor attractions appeal, and the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, is a great place for kids and adults alike. It takes visitors on an interactive journey through the history and art of film-making, and displays props and costumes from Star Wars, Mrs Doubtfire, The Mask and dozens more classic movies. A new permanent exhibit ­dedicated to Muppets creator Jim Henson opens soon. If you’re looking for a New York experience on a Magaluf budget, Norwegian airline is your friend. Its flights to JFK from Gatwick can cost as little as £149 each way, but the transatlantic service feels anything but low cost. Its fleet of jetlag-busting Boeing 787 Dreamliners are shiny, new and filled with gadgets. Drinks and snacks can be ordered through the touchscreen tablet which also shows a decent selection of movies. The seats are comfortable, even in economy, with a little more legroom than you’d expect on a budget flight. The premium economy section isn’t quite business class, but it’s got all the vital stuff – more legroom, seats that recline enough to get some sleep, with food and drink included. New York has hundreds of hotels, but it’s well worth straying beyond the usual chains for something a little more interesting. At one end of the scale is the Roger Smith Hotel, a quirky boutique property in the heart of Manhattan. The friendly staff give it a really personal touch – and that even extends to the rooms. They are all decorated in a different style, and feature a hand-picked library of books on the shelves. The Yotel's rooms are hi-tech and comfortable The Yotel's rooftop terrace The Yotel is just a few blocks from Times Square and couldn’t be more different. It’s simple, no-nonsense and modern, and while it may be missing some of the fineries of traditional hotels – like room service – it has the important things. The beds are comfortable, and complimentary fresh coffee and muffins are available in the lobby as you head out. The small ‘pod’ rooms are designed with efficiency in mind, and feature plenty of plug sockets, placed where you’d want them to charge your cameras and phones for a day out in the city.

The bug was reported soon after the iPhone 7's launch last week as customers began getting acclimated to life without a headphone jack. Apple said it would address the problem with a software update, and to the company's credit, that happened very, very fast. Any physical controls that are part of your Lightning-connected headphones or earbuds should now keep working even after you've stopped listening to anything for awhile. It's yet another example of the benefits of Apple's total control over iOS. Annoying bug gets discovered; annoying bug is resolved within a week for all users on iOS 10. Not bad, Apple. Not bad. iOS 10.0.2 also addresses two other bugs: the first caused Photos to quit when some users switched on iCloud Photo Library, and the other fixes "an issue that prevented enabling some app extensions."

Yep, it's all been going on for that long. Image: Bloomberg Google Is Trying to Get Oracle in Trouble for a $1 Billion Open Secret Written by Sarah Jeong Contributing Editor September 23, 2016 // 11:35 AM EST Copy This URL Another day, another trip down the swirling spite-tornado that is Oracle v. Google. Last month, Oracle asked for a new trial, claiming that Google failed to disclose key information prior to the most recent trial. Judge William Alsup has yet to rule on Oracle’s request, but meanwhile, Google’s lawyers are asking Alsup to find Oracle’s lawyers in civil contempt of court. For all of the non-lawyers out there, it’s basically just being in huge trouble with a judge, which is legitimately scary because judges can do all kinds of things like hold you in prison indefinitely. Back in January, the two parties were in front of Magistrate Judge Ryu, hashing out a discovery dispute. While in open court, in what Oracle calls the “heat of argument,” Oracle attorney Annette Hurst blurted out two numbers, two numbers so very secret that in the contempt hearing on Thursday, Judge Alsup threatened to clear out the courtroom in order to prevent reporters from hearing Google’s confidential information. Previously in #Googacle: Why the Very Silly Google V. Oracle Trial Actually Matters One number is how much Google paid Apple to put Google search bar on the iPhone. The other number is how much revenue Android generates per year. This is top secret information subject to a protective order. Unfortunately for Google, those two numbers can be readily found via a website known as Google dot com: In the hearing, both sides performed a weird, coy dance around all mentions of the “Google Information” and “Apple Information,” which is still subject to a protective order that binds the attorneys who are in receipt of the confidential information, on pain of sanctions and contempt. Despite having been turned into what Google calls “widespread global headline news,” Google is still very insistent that Oracle redact such information in its briefs: “There were articles all over the internet quoting the disclosure and quoting Oracle’s counsel,” said Bruce Baber, attorney for Google, in the contempt hearing. He tapped on his podium repeatedly as he spoke. “They said, ‘We always wanted to know the numbers around this Google/Apple deal. And now we know.’” Oracle's lawyers tried to explain themselves by providing a timeline of events. The confidential information was blurted out during a hotly contested hearing on January 14, 2016. Google attorney Robert Van Nest objected to the disclosure of the Google/Apple information, but didn’t say anything when Hurst mentioned Android revenue numbers. Four days later, on January 19, Google’s attorneys tried to get Oracle to sign onto a letter asking the court to redact those portions of the transcript. Before anyone from Oracle could reply, the magistrate judge denied Google’s motion to seal portions of the transcript. Google filed a motion to reconsider on January 20, then due to a mistake, had to refile on January 21. Around 1 PM that day, Bloomberg broke the news that Android generated $31 billion in revenues, and then a few hours later, that Google was paying Apple $1 billion to use the Google search bar. “The transcript vanished without a trace from electronic court records at about 3 PM Pacific standard time with no indication that the court ruled on Google’s request to seal it,” Bloomberg reported at the time. (The request to seal the transcript was officially granted the next day). In other words, life comes at you fast, and Oracle made a mistake—but nothing worthy of sanctions, according to Oracle attorney Melinda Haag. Judge Alsup was extremely skeptical of Haag’s position. “Every good lawyer in this district with her experience knows, you could hand the document to the judge, you could ask to clear the courtroom, you could ask to submit under seal," he said. “I think it’s important for you to own up and admit that it’s a violation [of the protective order],” he told Oracle’s counsel. “Even assuming it’s a violation of the protective order...” Haag began to say, when Alsup interrupted her with an exasperated noise. “Your firm is one of the biggest litigators in America,” said the judge. “Next time you go into a court somewhere and you ask for confidential documents, I hope someone raises this and says, ‘Your firm violated that order, and why should we give your firm access?’” According to Oracle, because Hurst was not in bad faith, she and her firm, Orrick, should not be subject to contempt and sanctions. “She just blurted out the two numbers that mattered. She just blurted it out,” said Judge Alsup. “If she had had the recipe for Coca-Cola she could have blurted it out in this court right now.” Google’s Bruce Baber said that it wasn’t just about the disclosure. Hurst made an understandable mistake. “There, but for the grace of God, go I,” he said. But, “The answer is not to dispute that there was a problem, to refuse to cooperate, to not take very simple steps to address it.” Google says that when its lawyers first objected during that January hearing, Hurst “quibbled and engaged in misdirection about the information” instead of just agreeing to redact the transcript. Then, when she left the courtroom, she recognized a reporter, but didn’t mention it to Google or the judge. (Google thinks she should have told someone, or even stopped the reporter and asked him not to report the story.) And later, when Google raised a fuss, Oracle attorneys kept filing “no opinion” replies, instead of doing what Google thinks they should have done—just go ahead and agree with Google, so that the judge would seal it quickly. If Google’s motion is granted, Oracle and its lawyers will have to pay Google attorney’s fees for the various motions that were filed in the aftermath of the leak. In a $9 billion case, that’s not really a big deal. The big deal is that an experienced trial attorney and her prestigious law firm might be held in civil contempt. Imagine the most popular girls in your high school having to serve detention, or Robin Thicke being forced to plunge his own toilet. It’ll be a big shock if it actually happens. But to make things even sadder for Oracle, the timing around the Bloomberg article doesn’t suggest that a reporter heard Hurst drop confidential information in court, and then ran back to the office to break the news. The Bloomberg article was published on January 21, a full week after the hearing, and the day after the transcript became available. Maybe that’s just the day that a reporter happened to read through the transcript. But maybe it was Google flailing around on the 20th and 21st, trying to seal the transcript, that actually tipped the press off. (Adam Satariano, who cowrote the article, says he doesn’t remember what it was.) Whatever the case, Google is probably right that sealing the transcript faster would have stopped the news story from ever breaking. But the cat’s out of the bag now, and Google’s private information is out there for everyone to see, on Google. Maybe it should try using the right to be forgotten? Topics: Google v.

Google's about to get one. And now it looks like Apple might have one in the late stages of development, too. The product that all of Silicon Valley seems to be focusing on is a voice-controlled speaker that's capable of carrying out tasks based on your voice command. Amazon's the leader in this space with its Echo speaker, which uses the Alexa assistant to handle everything from order pizzas to telling you about the weather. Google will soon follow suit with Google Home, an Echo-esque rival slated for release before the end of the year. Now, Bloomberg is reporting that Apple has a speaker of its own in development. Powered by the Siri assistant, Apple's speaker has reached prototype testing, Bloomberg reports, though there's no word on a timetable for when Apple's speaker will join its rivals on retail shelves. Rumors of an Apple-built speaker along the lines of Echo have been bubbling since a report surfaced in The Information earlier this year. MORE: Siri vs. Alexa: Why Amazon Won Our 300-Question Showdown When it does arrive, Apple's take on the voice-powered speaker sounds like it will have a decided focus on the smart home. Bloomberg's report says you'll be able to tell Siri to lock doors, dim or turn on lights and take control over other connected devices in your home. The Bloomberg report also suggests the things you can do with Siri on your iPhone — reading emails, sending texts and controlling Apple Music, for instance — will find their way to the speaker, too. It's not difficult to see why having a speaker of its own would interest Apple. A Siri-powered speaker would expand the iOS ecosystem, giving all those iPhone users yet another device that can expand what their phones can do and tie them further into Apple's growing portfolio of software and services. The product's reported emphasis on connected devices in the home is also interesting in light of Apple's ever increasing emphasis on the smart home. The company unveiled its HomeKit platform for smart devices two years ago, and this month's iOS 10 update introduced a new Home app for controlling connected devices from your phone. One of Home's highlights is the ability to program in scenarios like dimming the lights, locking the doors and turning down the thermostat when you say goodnight to Siri on your phone — it's not hard to imagine that feature becoming a key component with Apple's rumored home speaker. MORE: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Review - Great Upgrades, But One is ... Bloomberg says Apple hopes to differentiate its speaker from others on the market by using more advanced speaker and microphone technology. There's also the possibility that Apple could use facial recognition technology it's snapped in recent acquisitions to give its speaker the ability to recognize who's in the room and what their mood may be. Even so, the longer Apple takes to bring this rumored speaker to the market, the bigger the risk that it comes across as a me-to product. The Echo already enjoys a healthy lead over its competition, with more than 3,000 skills to the Alexa voice assistant. Apple has recently made more of an effort to open up Siri to outside developers, but it's limiting that access in iOS 10 to specific tasks like ordering rides on Lyft and Uber, sending mobile payments or interacting with chat apps. There's a big gap between Siri and Alexa that Apple will have to close if it makes a competing product to the Echo. Still, Apple's biggest products — the iPhone, the iPad and even the Mac — weren't the first of their kind, either. Rather, they took existing products and made them more appealing to a broader audience. It will be interesting to see if a Siri-powered speaker can fit that pattern or if rival products have already grabbed too much of an audience for Apple to make an impact.

Register for an Exam Today> What the iPhone 7 Reveals about Apple's Augmented-Reality Plans By Tom Mainelli PUBLISHED: SEPTEMBER 23 2016 I believe that Apple's next big iPhone release is going to feature augmented-reality technology. Obviously, nobody at Apple has said anything about such a product. But the now-shipping iPhone 7 Plus, complete with dual-camera technology, is the latest hint Apple is moving in that direction. This, along with several high-profile company purchases (Metaio in 2015 and PrimeSense in 2013), points to this technology eventually appearing in products. One more thing: Apple CEO Tim Cook can't stop talking about how big an opportunity augmented reality represents. Dual-Camera Technology Apple executives spent a great deal of time during the recent iPhone 7 launch event talking about the current and future capabilities of the two 12-megapixel cameras integrated into the iPhone 7 Plus. The first camera is a 28mm-equivalent lens that most would consider wide angle (the iPhone 7 has the same camera). The second is a 56mm equivalent and, while Apple's Phil Schiller kept calling it a telephoto lens, the reality is that it's actually more of a portrait lens. Here's my bet: When Apple heads toward its next big hardware revision, we'll see an iPhone (and maybe an iPad Pro) with AR capabilities. In addition to giving the phone an effective 2x optical zoom, the dual cameras enable a long list of software capabilities that should result in notably better photos for most users. That's interesting (and very useful), but what interests me more about this hardware is the fact that Apple could use the dual cameras to capture information about the objects and space in front of the cameras. Two cameras allow the device to capture and create depth-mapping information. Earlier this year, I wrote about Lenovo's Phab Pro 2, the first Tango-enabled smartphone. Tango is Google's handheld augmented-reality platform. The Lenovo phone actually uses three cameras and a host of other sensors to capture motion, depth and local area information about the phone's surroundings. The result is a device that knows where it is in space, which lets you do many fascinating things in augmented reality. To vastly oversimplify, think about what Pokémon Go does on your current smartphone, but many times smarter and more powerful. Two Key Apple Acquisitions Apple's recent purchase of Metaio and PrimeSense makes me think it's moving toward this handheld augmented-reality future. Apple bought Metaio in May, 2015. It was a German company, started in 2003, that sold software that pulled together camera images and computer-generated objects. Before the purchase, numerous companies used the technology to create applications for use in different vertical markets including retail, industrial and automotive. After completing the purchase, Apple took the product off the market. Many assume that Apple is working to create custom silicon in conjunction with this software for future products. PrimeSense was an Israeli 3-D sensor company that Apple purchased for $345 million in 2013. The company had a mobile-sized 3-D sensor (code-named Capri) that worked with its software technology to scan and capture three-dimensional objects. The company was also a founding member of the open source framework called OpenNI (Natural Interaction) designed to capture body motion and hand tracking. Stories at the time of the acquisition noted that the Capri sensor was relatively expensive to produce, which kept it from gaining the attention of other device manufacturers. This is the type of tech Apple loves to integrate into its hardware to drive additional differentiation from the rest of the market. Tim Cook on Augmented Reality Finally, there are Tim Cook's comments. In the most recent Apple earnings call, Cook pointed out that, while he thinks both virtual and augmented reality are interesting, he sees a much bigger opportunity in augmented reality, especially regarding commercial use cases (I strongly agree). More recently, in an interview on "Good Morning America," Cook once again spelled out his enthusiasm for augmented reality. He noted that by using AR, two people can share a common experience, which is hard to do in the heavily isolated world of VR. Now, it may well be that Cook's recent comments around AR versus VR are meant to throw people off Apple's trail. In fact, I think it's highly likely that Apple is working on both technologies and, eventually, we may well see some eyewear that utilizes not only the technologies above but a future version of the company's new W1 chip currently shipping in the AirPods. But here's my bet: When Apple heads toward its next big hardware revision, we'll see an iPhone (and maybe an iPad Pro) with AR capabilities. © 2016 Re/Code under contract with NewsEdge.

By Jason Cipriani | September 23, 2016 -- 16:13 GMT (09:13 PDT) | Topic: Cloud Image: Jason Cipriani/ZDNet "Hey Siri, make me some coffee," may not be as far off as you think. Apple's smart home platform, similar to that of the Amazon Echo, has moved out of research and development and is in now in testing in the homes of Apple engineers, according to Bloomberg. Amazon Echo users can currently control appliances, lights, ask questions, set reminders, and purchase items through voice interaction with the speaker. Apple's platform would provide similar functionality through Siri, the company's personal assistant found across Apple devices, including the Mac with the recent release of macOS Sierra. Naturally, Apple's HomeKit platform and its expanding integration -- ranging from smart locks and thermostats to wireless security cameras -- would integrate nicely with such a platform. In addition to familiar voice commands, Bloomberg claims Apple is testing prototype devices with facial recognition and the ability to identify a person's emotional state. The added functionality will help Apple tailor the experience based on who is in a given room. This isn't the first time Apple has been rumored to included facial recognition in a smart home device. In May, CNET reported the unannounced device would react to who was in a given room by changing preferences through facial recognition. ZDNet asked Apple for comment and will update the story if it receives one. If Siri is going to end up being the centerpiece of our living room, Apple needs to vastly improve upon the digital assistant. Despite iOS 10 adding the ability for developers to integrate with Siri, it's still far too limited. For example, Siri is unable to set a timer on a Mac, asking me to create a reminder instead. According to Bloomberg, Apple is also working on a project called "Invisible Hand". Through this project, Apple aims to provide full control over an iOS device through Siri. Tasks such as printing a PDF or sharing a web page strictly through voice commands are given as examples by Bloomberg. see also Amazon Echo: It sucks. It's awesome. It sucks.

Home Videos Images Science Space Health Technology Toggle navigation Popular Team finds rare underwater Stone Age… Brain-computer interface lets ALS patient communicate… Automation is coming: 60 percent of… Leaked report shows 'lawbreaking' EmDrive engine… Technology September 21, 2016 Apple patents a paper bag: meet the iBag by Brett Smith In a move that’s likely to inspire more internet snark than wait lines around its stores, Apple has filed a patent for a white paper bag. Actually, there’s a very good reason the tech giant has filed the patent. The paper bag will be made from 60 percent recycled materials. White paper bags created from recycled material tend to have a particularly poor constitution caused by bleaching, so Apple has developed several alterations that ought to help its bags stay brilliantly white and kind to the environment. The innovation worth patenting is how the company plans to support the bag as well as such a higher percentage of recycled material. Those improvements include elegant reinforcements at the folds and seams of the bag, an additional one at the bottom that adheres to the sides, and a handle “formed entirely of paper fiber yarn knitted in an 8-stitch circular knit pattern." Another Strange Event at Apple Of course, Apple’s more disruptive design choice, the decision to eliminate the headphone jack from the latest iPhone model, was officially unveiled last week.  The decision was alternately praised and criticized, with some saying it was time to eliminate an unnecessary component and others saying the company was forcing expensive wireless ear buds on its loyal fanbase. Those who still want to use conventional headphones with the new iPhone can do so – they just have to use an adapter connected to the Lightning port on the bottom of the device. However, a recent investigation by a German magazine concluded the sound quality through the port adapter is inferior to the sound coming out of the 3.5 mm headphone jack on the iPhone 6s. “The results are clear: with an iPhone 6S, the dynamic range worsens by 4.5 dB(A) for 24-bit music files. For the iPad Air, it worsens by 3.8 dB(A),” the article said via translation. “The signal also gets worse for 16-bit music files, even if they aren’t that drastic: the dynamic range worsens by 1.8 dB(A) and 3.1 dB(A) for the iPhone and iPad, respectively.” The difference, it should be noted, is essentially imperceptible to the human ear. ----- Image credit: US Patent Office/Apple Advertising About Us Contact Us Privacy Statement Terms of Service Abuse Reporting Jobs © 2002-2016 redOrbit.com.

By Zach Epstein on Sep 23, 2016 at 9:30 AM Email @zacharye Review Share This Story Tweet Like Share Submit Shop ▾ Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR When I reviewed Apple’s iPhone 6 two years ago, I wrote about how different reviewing an iPhone is compared to reviewing any other smartphone — or any other product at all, for that matter. A reviewer’s job is generally to present an overview of a product’s user experience, as well as to discuss strengths and shortcomings. The goal in doing this is to assist the reader in making a purchase decision. But with iPhones, this hasn’t been the case since the first-generation model. Either someone is going to buy an iPhone or he or she is not; reviews have almost no bearing on anyone’s decision. Interestingly, while Apple’s new iPhone 7 is the first new number-generation iPhones to resemble their predecessors so closely in terms of design, they are also the first new iPhones to differ so dramatically in this way: reviews actually do matter. Apple’s new iPhones look so similar to last year’s models and to 2014’s models that people aren’t quite sure what to make of them. Are they really “boring,” like many gadget blogs have been saying for months? Or are they truly as impressive as Apple’s marketing rhetoric and Apple bloggers’ reviews would lead you to believe? In this review, we’ll cut through the noise and see just how impressive or disappointing Apple’s new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are. View the full iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus gallery See all 8 photos First, let’s work our way through the narrative that guided coverage ahead of the new iPhones’ debut. Yes, they feature a design that is strikingly similar to Apple’s iPhone lineup for the past two years. Is that a bad thing? It depends on who you ask. Apple strayed far from convention in 2016 and released two new phones that do not feature a dramatically different outward facing design. iPhone users are accustomed to seeing a brand new iPhone one year and an updated “S” version in the same housing the following year. Then, a fresh new iPhone is due to follow each new “S.” This year, Apple didn’t exactly build an iPhone 6ss, but the new design of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus really isn’t that new at all. The antenna lines on the back are a bit different, the cameras are new, the color scheme has been updated, there’s no 3.5mm headphone jack, and the regular home button has been replaced by a capacitive button. Beyond that, it’s the same design. There are good arguments for Apple’s decision to keep the same design this year, and there are also good arguments for changing it. In the end, it obviously doesn’t matter. These are the new iPhones. Many people were left wondering why Apple chose to reuse the iPhone 6 design again though, and it’s absolutely a valid question. Nothing is confirmed at this point, of course, but multiple reliable sources have reported that next year’s new iPhone — Apple’s tenth-anniversary iPhone — will feature a dramatic redesign. Rather than deal with the expense and logistical challenges that would be presented by launching a redesigned iPhone lineup in two consecutive years, Apple chose to tweak its earlier design. The real question is, does it matter? Of course, there’s no wrong answer to that question. If you want a new iPhone but the idea of upgrading to a phone that looks just like your current smartphone gives you pause, then yes, it matters. If you want a new iPhone and performance and features are your biggest concerns, then it doesn’t matter. Or does it? As I noted in an earlier article, I decided to switch from the smaller iPhone 6s to the larger iPhone 7 Plus this year. I did get a 4.7-inch iPhone 7 to review though, and I received it a day before my new iPhone 7 Plus. As my personal phone, I found that the shine wore off within just a few hours. I was already bored. Now, there’s precious little question that the iPhone 7 is faster than the iPhone 6s, though the performance boost is nowhere near as noticeable as it was from the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 6s. The camera is also dramatically improved, as is the display. But it really doesn’t feel like a brand new phone, when you upgrade from the iPhone 6s. Instead, it feels like a better iPhone 6s. If you have an iPhone 6, an iPhone 5s or an older model, the iPhone 7 is a tremendous upgrade that will blow you away. If you have an Android phone and you make the switch to the iPhone 7, you’ll love the sleek design and snappy performance. But after a few weeks, days or even hours, I think a lot of people are going to find that the upgrade from last year’s iPhone 6s or 6s Plus to a comparable iPhone 7 model just doesn’t feel like a big jump. Is this going to be a problem for Apple? In the long run, I don’t think so. Bored iPhone users could sway purchase decisions toward the end of the iPhone 7 cycle and negatively impact sales to an extent, but next year’s massive redesign will instantly erase any memory of boredom among iPhone fans. Also, the iPhone 7 Plus is a more significant upgrade thanks to its new dual camera, so this problem will likely have less of an impact on phablet users. And if you jumped from the smaller model to the Plus like I did, you’re in for a great upgrade. Since we’re all familiar with the hardware design at this point, let’s focus briefly on what has changed. Beginning with the face of the phone, Apple’s updated displays on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are noticeably improved from last year’s models. They’re still LCD screens and they still feature the same resolutions — 720p for the iPhone 7, 1080p for the iPhone 7 Plus — but the quality of the screens is far more impressive. Colors are more vibrant and contrast is improved as well. In fact, a review from a display expert recently called Apple’s new iPhone 7 displays the best LCD displays in the world, adding that they are “visually indistinguishable from perfect.” If that’s not high praise, I’m not sure what is. Beneath the screen you’ll find a completely redesigned home button that is no longer a conventional button. Instead, it’s a recessed surface that remains stationary when you press it. It feels like a normal button though, because Apple has introduced an advanced Taptic Engine that uses haptic feedback to simulate the sensation of a button press. And it’s pretty scary how good a job Apple has done. I’ve handed the phone to a number of people and had them play with the home button for a few moments before telling them that it’s not actually a button. When I do, they all have the same puzzled look on their faces. Then I have them try to press the home button with a fingernail and it sets in that it is not actually a button that can be depressed. It’s pretty scary how close the haptic feedback feels to an actual button press. Features like raise-to-wake and the new 3D Touch home button are stepping-stones for next year’s new iPhone, which won’t have a home button at all. As we’ve seen described in patents and then again in recent reports, the Touch ID fingerprint scanner will be embedded beneath the display and the Taptic Engine will provide haptic feedback to simulate button presses. Also new on the face of the phone is a second loudspeaker to create a stereo listening experience for the first time on an iPhone. You won’t notice it while looking at the phone, but it’s where the ear speaker has always been. Just like the HTC 10, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus now have one front-facing speaker and one downward-facing speaker on the bottom of the phone. The result is a much better audio experience when watching video or playing music without connected headphones, though the sound quality isn’t quite as good as it is on the HTC 10. And speaking of audio experiences and connected headphones… As has been covered very, very extensively online and by the mainstream media, Apple’s new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus do not have standard 3.5mm audio jacks like most smartphones do. Apple had some very good reasons for removing the headphone jack, though Phil Schiller’s “courage” explanation certainly isn’t one of them. Instead, Apple removed the standard plug in order to free up space that was being occupied by a single-purpose legacy connector. Love it or hate it, the deed is done and we’ll likely never see another flagship iPhone ship with a 3.5mm audio port. Is this really such a huge deal? For some people, this is a big deal. Yes, Apple included an adapter in the box so that standard headphones with a 3.5mm plug can still connect to the phone. But people accustomed to listening to music through wired headphones while charging their handset are out of luck… unless they switch to wireless headphones or purchase a ridiculous third-party adapter. Just plug this into your iPhone 7, Apple's 3.5mm adapter into this, and your old headphones into that. Courage! pic.twitter.com/GiE6wJBGu1 — Zach Epstein (@zacharye) September 8, 2016 Personally, I don’t think the loss of the headphone jack is a very big deal. In a few months the complaints will have vanished and a year or three from now, we won’t even remember the old days when smartphones had 3.5mm audio ports. What’s a bit aggravating in this case though, is that Apple’s solution is half-baked and incomplete. An adapter solves the issue of compatibility with older headphones, but what about charging while listening? The inclusion of wireless charging support will resolve this problem to an extent — wireless charging isn’t always available or convenient yet — but Apple’s iPhone lineup won’t support wireless charging until next year at the earliest. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus do support one new wireless technology, however. Apple introduced a new “W1” chip in the iPhone 7 series and in the innovative though hideous new AirPods that use Apple’s smart wireless technology to pair and the latest Bluetooth protocol to stream. Apple says its new tech is powerful enough to carry high-quality audio but also incredibly energy-efficient. Also of note, there is some good news to come out of the headphone jack debacle: removing the port was one of several major changes Apple made in order to achieve an IP67 dust- and water-resistance rating. That means the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus can be submerged under several feet of water for up to 30 minutes and still work just fine. They’re actually far more water-resistant than that, and we’ve already seen dunk tests in up to 35 feet of water. We’ve also seen people snap photos while their iPhones were submerged. Should you plan on using your new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus underwater? It’ll probably survive if you do, but it would be best to avoid making a habit of it. The phone was designed to withstand rain, splashes, sprays and quick accidental dunks, but that doesn’t mean you should tempt fate. The other main hardware changes are found around back, where Apple has redesigned the iPhone’s antennas so that only two “antenna lines” are needed, one near the bottom of the phone and a second that runs across the top. Apple also included new cameras on the front and back of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and they represent one of the biggest upgrades the iPhones received in 2016. Both new models share the same upgraded 7-megapixel front-facing camera. Around back, Apple’s iPhone 7 gets a new 12-megapixel sensor that captures images 60% faster and is 30% more energy-efficient than the rear camera on the iPhone 6s. It has a 6-element lens, an f/1.8 aperture and a new image signal processor with twice the throughput of Apple’s previous-generation ISP. It’s also supported by what Apple is calling a Quad-LED True Tone flash, which includes four different LED bulbs to improve brightness and tone. Thankfully, the iPhone 7 camera also gets optical image stabilization this year. In 2014 and 2015, only the larger Plus model iPhones had OIS. The bigger iPhone 7 Plus gets a new dual-lens setup that includes two separate cameras positioned side by side on the back of the phone. One is the same 28mm camera as the rear camera in the iPhone 7, while the second has a 56mm telephoto lens. The new setup provides two main features that most smartphone cameras do not support. First, the iPhone 7 Plus has 2x optical zoom. A tap on the screen switches the main camera from the 28mm lens to the 56mm lens, allowing the shooter to zoom in without any loss of image quality. Both the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 have 10x digital zoom as well, and zooming can now be done either by pinching or by tapping the new zoom button on the 7 Plus and then spinning the dial that pops up either to the right to zoom in, or to the left to zoom out. Second, the telephoto lens captures depth information when taking a standard photo. Along with Apple’s upcoming iOS 10.1 update, the Plus camera will be able to produce a “bokeh” effect that blurs the background and simulates a photo captured by a DSLR camera. The dual-camera setup isn’t just for zoom and bokeh, however. Every press of the shutter button on the iPhone 7 Plus actually captures two images, one with the 28mm lens and one with the 56mm lens. Data from both images is then fused behind the scenes to create a single photo. Of note, the wide-angle lens has OIS while the telephoto lens does not. You can read more about the cameras and see photo samples in this post. The bottom line is this: there have never been better cameras on an iPhone than these cameras. In fact, they’re at least as good as the camera Samsung uses on its Galaxy S7 and Galaxy Note 7 phones, which has been the best smartphone camera in the world since March of this year. Personally, I can’t pick a clear winner between Samsung and Apple. Photos captured by the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus in some lighting conditions look better than the same photos snapped on a Galaxy S7 or Note 7, while the S7 and Note 7 clearly have the edge in other lighting conditions. All four of these phones feature cameras capable of capturing breathtaking photos and stunning video, making all of them fantastic choices for anyone who counts camera quality among their priorities when choosing a smartphone. The final big change regarding the iPhone 7’s design is the two new colors Apple introduced this year. Just one year after adding rose gold to its palette, Apple has added a pair of darker color options on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The first is black, which replaces space gray. The black iPhone 7 models feature a smooth finish that is similar to the other three available colors (silver, gold and rose gold), but obviously much deeper. Next up is Apple’s new “Jet Black” color, which has been a topic of much debate. Some people are upset that it’s next to impossible to buy a jet black iPhone right now. Others are angry because the new color is only available on the more expensive 128GB and 256GB iPhone models. Of course like most complaints, these will quickly fade as we move further from launch. But one issue will remain: Jet Black was built to fail. The iPhone 7's stunning jet black finish goes through a nine-step process of anodization and polishing before being slathered with courage pic.twitter.com/7iaH86fi9T — Zach Epstein (@zacharye) September 20, 2016 Apple’s new Jet Black iPhones are stunning. The smooth high-gloss finish reflects light and captures different colors as it does, but it also captures some things that are far less desirable like scratches, scuffs, grease and grime. In fact, the problem is so serious that Apple had to include a disclaimer on its website: The high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process. Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use. If you are concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iPhone. If you buy a Jet Black iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, it will get scratched up. Period. If you put a case on it, it will still get scratched up as dust and dirt inevitably works their way in between the case and the phone. There’s simply no way to avoid it. So if the idea of buying a phone that will begin showing scuffs and scratches within a few hours of your purchase is off-putting, definitely purchase a different color. Moving inside the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple made some serious internal improvements. The new iPhones have twice as much storage as last year’s models. The 16GB iPhone is no more, having been replaced at the entry-level by a new 32GB storage option. The mid-tier models include 128GB of storage, and the top-tier iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus ship with 256GB of internal storage. Where the smaller iPhone 7 is concerned, the storage bump comes at no additional expense. Pricing remains $649 for the entry-level model, while the 128GB and 256GB versions cost $749 and $849, respectively. The larger iPhone 7 Plus models are more expensive than the 2015 iPhones they replace, however. Pricing at each tier has been increased by $20, so the phones cost either $769, $869 or $969 instead of $749, $849 and $949, which is where pricing has been for the past two years. Why the extra $20 when prices haven’t increased for smaller iPhone 7 units? The answer likely lies in the new camera modules as well as the additional RAM in the Plus model compared to the smaller version. Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone 7 has 2GB of RAM just like the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but the iPhone 7 Plus has 3GB. Don’t expect any huge all-around performance benefit from that extra gig of RAM, though. Instead, the additional RAM is there to assist with photo processing since the dual camera setup captures so much more data than a single-lens camera. Running the show inside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is a new A10 Fusion chipset designed by Apple. The 64-bit chip features two high-performance processor cores that are 40% faster than the A9 chip that powers the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, and two high-efficiency cores that consume one-fifth as much power as last year’s A9. The result is blinding speed when the phones need to do some heavy lifting, and improved battery life during normal operation. The A10 Fusion chip also packs a six-core GPU that is 50% faster than the A9’s GPU and yet consumes only two-thirds as much power. Thanks to the new chipset and larger batteries in both iPhone 7 models, this year’s new iPhones are faster than last year’s models while also offering better battery life. Apple says the iPhone 7 lasts an average of 2 hours longer per charge than the iPhone 6s, while the iPhone 7 Plus outlasts the iPhone 6s plus during typical use by an average of one hour. Those are big improvements in terms of percentages, but in reality the user experience is largely unchanged. The Plus model will still go well past a full 24 hours without needing to be recharged, while the smaller model absolutely will not. iOS 10 is the rest of the story, though Apple’s latest major iOS update obviously isn’t unique to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Unlike Android, Apple has managed to create a system that allows it to push operating system updates directly to end users. As a result, iOS 10 was available the very same day it was released on all compatible devices, including ten different iPhone models, eight different iPad models and the most recent iPod touch. For those keeping score, the oldest iOS device that received Apple’s iOS 10 update was released just over four years ago. Do any four-year-old Android phones have Nougat yet? Marshmallow? Apple’s new iOS 10 software brings with it a host of new features that further enhance the iOS experience. As has been the case for the past few years, Apple focused on refining and enhancing existing features with iOS 10. The resulting operating system is dramatically improved and enhanced, but don’t expect much in the way of innovative new features. Highlights in iOS 10 include a new Messages app that’s packed full of features and now supports its own App Store, a new lock screen, redesigned widgets, a revamped notification system that lets you respond to messages right from within a notification on any screen, a new Photos app, big Maps updates, bigger Siri updates, a dramatically improved Apple Music experience, Quick Type enhancements including emoji recommendations, and plenty more. And of course, iOS 10 continues to be supported by the world’s leading third-party app ecosystem. Apple’s new iPhones are the best iPhones the company has ever made. Obviously. The same can be said of every new iPhones that are released. But what separates this year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus from their predecessors is where things get interesting. Whittled down to its simplest terms, Apple’s new iPhones are an “S” update, making this the first time Apple has ever released S updates in two consecutive years. iPhones get big performance boosts and nifty new features each and every year, but the external design is what separates number updates from S updates. Yes, there are some subtle design changes on the iPhone 7 series compared to last year’s models. But as far as most people are concerned, the iPhone 7 sports the same housing Apple used last year and the year before. Even the dimensions are identical, down to the millimeter. So the question becomes, are you willing to purchase another S update? If you currently have an iPhone 6, an iPhone 6 Plus or any earlier iPhone model, or if you’re switching from Android to an iPhone, this is truly a no-brainer. The performance boost when jumping to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will blow your mind — they’re the fastest phones in the world. Add in the incredible new cameras, the gorgeous new displays, twice as much storage and all the other new features Apple mixed in, and you’ve got yourself the best all-around smartphones on the planet. The real question for many users will be whether or not they should upgrade from an iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. If you use an annual upgrade plan through your wireless carrier or through Apple, again, you should obviously upgrade. These phones are amazing. If you’re buying them outright though, you have a difficult decision to make. These are not “boring” iPhones by any stretch of the imagination but as I mentioned before, I did get bored very quickly when moving from an iPhone 6s to an iPhone 7. It’s an S upgrade. Again. Another S upgrade?! Is Apple doomed?! Should Tim Cook be fired?!? No. The iPhone 6/6 Plus cycle was the biggest smartphone cycle in history, and tens of millions of people now have 2-year-old phones that need to be upgraded. In the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, they’ll find an upgrade that will absolutely knock their socks off. The same goes for people coming over from a different manufacturer and switching to an iPhone. Then, next year, you get the massive design overhaul you’ve been waiting for. You get a gorgeous new OLED display that takes up more of the phone’s face. You get an innovative new all-ceramic housing in sleek new colors, perhaps. You get a slimmer design with wireless charging and no home button.

That game goes by the name Super Mario Run, a game which is a mobile-friendly edition of the first several Mario games mixed into one future-ready package. Today we find out why it was Apple, not Google and Android, that got to get the game first. Mario inventor and creator Shigeru Miyamoto appeared onstage at Apple’s latest event to announce something magnificent. The iPhone would be the first place anyone would be able to play Super Mario Run, the first mobile game which would feature one of Nintendo’s most famous characters. “It started when we were working on Miitomo, or before that when Mr. Iwata was still with the company,” said Miyamoto in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “Apple invited him to have a conversation about how the two companies could work together and they started working on Miitomo and then this opportunity came up.” But it wasn’t just that Apple spoke to Nintendo first. According to Miyamoto, “One of the reasons we focused on iPhone first was the stability of the platform and being able to get the level of response that we want out of the games.” “And that’s not to say that Android devices don’t have the same level of responsiveness. But because there are so many Android devices, trying to engineer the game to work across them all requires quite a lot of time.” Of course, the game is eventually coming to Android, too. It’ll just be a bit more time before it’s ready. But what if there was a single set of smartphones that Nintendo could start with? Maybe if Google had their own hero phones? Wouldn’t that be great?

Not only did Apple make the somewhat inexplicable decision to remove the headphone jack, but the company also introduced a set of wireless earbuds that look utterly ridiculous. Nevertheless, diehard fans continue to eat up everything Apple puts out, which is why Conan has been having such a good time lampooning the company of late. SEE ALSO: A new Pokemon Go update is about to be released, but don’t expect any trading support Just last week, Conan ran a fake ad for Apple's new AirPods, joking about how easy it's going to be to lose the tiny accessories. This week, he's taken another shot at Apple. But rather than goof on an existing product, he and his team decided to follow through on an Apple patent published this month: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnsrDIUWhTg As ridiculous as it sounds, Apple actually did file a patent for a paper bag back in March. According to the patent: "Embodiments of the present invention include a paper bag that includes a bag container formed of white paper with at least 60% post-consumer content. The white paper may be formed of solid bleached sulfate. The bag may have a reinforcement insert adhered to its interior, which may extend across and strengthen a fold of the bag container." No wireless chips or motion sensors, but Apple really did patent a bag. Don't be surprised if you see one for sale in an Apple Store for $11.99 next year.

It’s designated by the model number “A1844”, includes both Bluetooth wireless functionality and built-in NFC and is rated at between 100mA and 700mA (from 5.5V to 13.2V). The bottom plate shows a regulatory label with FCC markings, but other details like the device’s dimensions, purpose and marketing name are kept confidential in the filing. Although the device has built-in NFC, that doesn’t necessarily signify Apple Pay support because NFC could also be used to help it establish a secure ad-hoc wireless connection with nearby devices. Some watchers think that because there’s NFC circuitry involved that this could be a next-generation Apple Watch but I don’t think that’s the case due to a pair of torx screws on the bottom plate. It’s also unlikely to be an iBeacon device due to power requirements. Besides, iBeacons use Bluetooth, not NFC. Others have suspected that the mystery device could be some sort of payment hardware, like a standalone iOS-enabled POS, but Apple Pay does not require any special hardware as it works with most contactless payment terminals. Is this Apple’s rumored Amazon Echo-like wireless speaker with built-in Siri that Bloomberg said is now in a prototype testing phase, do you think? I don’t think so because the FCC filing doesn’t mention built-in Wi-Fi. Could this perhaps be a next-generation Apple TV? Or a filing for the AirPods Charging Case? Maybe a new version of an AirPort Time Capsule appliance? A payment device for Apple Store employees? Or something entirely new? Let us know what you think down in the comments. Whatever this device is, the FCC has approved it for sale in the United States so it shouldn’t be long before we find out what it’s for. For what it’s worth, Apple filed the documents with the FCC on September 13, six days after it announced the iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 2 and other new products.

The Apple Watch I’ve been using for the past year or so has a patchy record on my wrist. I absolutely love it, but when I’ve had to remove it – because I’ve been testing an Android phone or smartwatch – I haven’t always automatically put it back on afterwards. This is nothing to do with its quality as a smartwatch. The Apple Watch has been, comfortably, the best smartwatch on the market since it launched, and had it not been for the appearance of the Apple Watch Series 2, it would still reign supreme. Apple did a great job back in 2015 in producing a wearable that was intuitive to use and looked great. It also achieved that tricky task of establishing a workable platform for wrist-based software, and encouraging developers to produce great apps for it. READ NEXT: The best smartphones of 2016 - our favourite mobiles But I wanted more. I wanted a smartwatch that could track my running, swimming, cycling and sleep as proficiently as my favourite fitness trackers. That’s something the original Watch didn’t quite offer. Fortunately, Apple has become rather good at steadily improving its products over the years, and the Apple Watch Series 2 benefits from that vast experience – and then some. In fact, it’s close to being my ideal smartwatch. Image 6 of 12 © Provided by Dennis Publishing Limited Apple Watch Series 2 review: Out with the old... So what’s actually new with the Apple Watch Series 2? You won’t be able to tell by just looking at it, unless you’ve splashed out on the beautiful ceramic version (this year’s iteration of the Apple Watch “Edition”), or plumped for the black-and-neon-yellow Nike+ model, but the changes are there nonetheless. The differences start out small. Although the squared-off watch face and gorgeously rounded glass screen edges are still there, with the clickable digital crown and narrow button on the right edge, it’s actually fractionally taller and thicker than the original. The left edge is adorned by two small slots for the watch’s speaker, as before, but there are now two pinprick holes instead of one, for the Watch’s new noise-cancelling microphones. You won’t see a sharper display, this time, either. As with the first Apple Watch, the technology used is AMOLED, and the resolutions are the same too. The 38mm model has a 272 x 340 display, delivering 290ppi, while the 42mm model has a 312 x 390 screen, delivering 302ppi. It’s inside that the bigger changes begin to emerge. First up, there’s a new processor, the dual-core Apple S2, which Apple says offers 50% faster processing performance and double the graphics speed. Then there’s a brighter display, twice as bright as the original, reaching a peak brightness of 1,000cd/m2. Both these upgrades are welcome, and both make a difference Image 3 of 12 © Provided by Dennis Publishing Limited Navigating around the confines of watchOS 3 feels more fluid than before, although there are still places where it isn’t 100% smooth, while the screen is noticeably more readable outdoors. I’ll be interested to see how it fares in full, bright sunshine, but since we haven’t seen an awful lot of that in the UK recently, this will have to wait for a later update. Elsewhere, there’s a bigger Taptic Engine, which gives a slightly stronger buzz than before, and a larger battery. There’s a 273mAh battery in the 38mm model versus the 205mAh one in the previous edition, and although no-one has yet dismantled the 42mm version, it’s safe to say the battery will be similarly improved in that model. In the time I’ve had the watch for testing, I’ve found it performs at a similar level to the previous model, which is impressive given how much more it’s doing. Even including a 47-minute swim and several short bursts of GPS use, the 42mm Apple Watch Series 2 I tested lasted almost two full days. Apple Watch Series 2 review: Waterproof, swim-proof and built-in GPS Read the subheading. That tells you all you need to know about the Apple Watch Series 2’s big selling points. Because as nice as it is to have a faster processor, brighter screen and bigger battery, new features are even better. The new Apple Watch is waterproof to 50 metres, which means you can swim with it, and it will track your pool sessions as well. In fact, the Apple Watch is as good as many dedicated fitness trackers I’ve used for tracking swimming. It has both open-water and pool-based modes; with the latter, it will count your laps, track your heart rate (surprisingly accurately) and give you a time per 100m as well. Image 11 of 12 © Provided by Dennis Publishing Limited There are some quirks to be ironed out here. I found that, for the first few laps, the distance travelled and number of laps didn’t quite tally up, and although Apple says the Watch will detect your stroke type, it doesn’t surface this data in any kind of depth. After my 1,500m swim, it was content to state I’d used “mixed” strokes during my workout. Not very helpful. Having said that, what the Series 2 did track was accurate. When I threw in a stroke change halfway through a lap, it managed to cope where my Moov Now, which I was wearing as a control, became confused and added an extra 50m. Image 12 of 12 © Provided by Dennis Publishing Limited If that was all the Series 2 added, it would be enough, but Apple has gone one step further and added built-in GPS. Now you can take the Apple Watch Series 2 out running or hiking without having to cart your phone around, and it will still be able to track your speed and location. Great stuff, and once again, it’s pretty good at it. Because it uses assisted GPS (A-GPS), you won’t have to wait for minutes at a time while it scans the sky for available satellites, and I found it rarely lost satellite contact even around medium- and low-rise areas of central London. I haven’t had the chance to test it in high-rise areas yet, though, so your mileage may vary. The best thing about the GPS in the Apple Watch, though, is that it’s completely transparent. There’s no external indication that the Watch is using its own internal GPS or your iPhone’s, and when it loses contact with your phone it simply switches over. The only evidence you get that it’s ever lost satellite contact is a dotted line along the route map in the summary it shows you at the end of your run or walk. Overall, the Apple Watch Series 2 is a great improvement on the fitness front, but it’s not the perfect tracker just yet. Fitness nerds will point out that it lacks support for ANT+ accessories, and that it doesn’t have an altimeter and won’t track elevation. A more surprising omission, perhaps, is that there’s still no sleep tracking function built in as standard. However, it’s almost there, and in conjunction with watchOS 3’s new fitness-sharing facilities, the GPS and waterproofing mean that the Apple Watch is now a serious contender in the fitness-tracker stakes. Indeed, for most people it will be the only wearable they ever need. Image 5 of 12 © Provided by Dennis Publishing Limited Apple Watch Series 2 review: watchOS 3 One thing we knew would arrive with the Apple Watch Series 2 was watchOS 3. We’ve already taken a look at what’s in watchOS 3 (and you can click here to check our overview of all the new features), but to recap, its primary focus is on speeding up app performance and streamlining the UI. Gone is the rarely used favourite friends feature, which used to be activated by pressing the side button, and in its place is a “Dock” where you can put your most commonly used apps. Apps in the dock are also kept in the Watch’s memory so that they open significantly faster when you need them, and if they’ve been coded for watchOS 3, apps can pull data from your phone in the background. The old Glances view has now made way for the Control Centre, giving quick access to common settings such as Do Not Disturb and Flight mode with a drag up from the bottom of the display. It’s now possible to respond to messages by using handwriting recognition, too, as well as a selection of pre-canned responses. With updates to many core apps, and the new Breathe app to help you relax when things get stressful, watchOS 3 represents a dramatic change to the way the Apple Watch works. Image 4 of 12 © Provided by Dennis Publishing Limited Apple Watch Series 2 review: Verdict and prices It may not look it, then, but the second Apple Watch is a serious overhaul, and a successful one at that. Where the first watch was merely okay as an occasional fitness tracker, it’s now a fully fledged multi-sport fitness device with very few gaps in its armoury. Combined with improved usability and performance, the Apple Watch Series 2 holds an even bigger lead over the rest of the smartwatch crowd, and while that won’t mean much to you if you’re an Android smartphone user, it gives iPhone users even more of a reason to buy one. Perhaps the only issue here is that, due to the weakness of the pound against the dollar, the Apple Watch Series 2 is now more expensive than the original when it launched. The smaller 38mm model starts at £369, while the 42mm watch starts at £399, up from £299 and £339. That’s disappointing, but Apple has also slightly overhauled the original, keeping it on sale and boosting its speed, while dropping the price to £269 for the 38mm and £299 for the 42mm. The fact remains, though: the Apple Watch in either of its guises is the best smartwatch on the market, and the Series 2 can now claim to be among the best fitness trackers too. 399 2.

Since the review went live, I have found a fix for the issue and have made a note on page two to explain what I did. What is mac OS Sierra? Over the past few years, OS X updates have been used by Apple to blend features from its desktop and mobile operating systems. With this year's release, the company cements the deal – OS X is dead, replaced by a more iOS-style name: macOS Sierra. It's a change that makes sense, as it's a name that's been used informally for years. A significant name change implies that bigger things are happening under the surface, although this year's free update is one of the most modest. Sure, there's the headline feature of Siri coming to the desktop (finally), but it's the less flashy and in-your-face features that will provide the real benefit. In particular, the new cloud features, including a Dropbox competitor and a Universal Clipboard, are the features that I've found the most useful. Video: How to choose a laptop in 2016 The downside, once again, is that, for some new features, you'll need to have an iOS device as well. Without one, you won't be able to use Auto Unlock or pay for goods using Apple Pay. This reliance on mobile is both one of the operating system's strengths and annoyances, making it harder for anyone that wants to mix and match their hardware. mac OS Sierra – How do I get it? As with the most recent updates, macOS Sierra is a free upgrade, provided you have a compatible computer. The short story is that it supports all 2009-and-beyond MacBooks and iMacs, but you'll need a 2010-or-newer computer if you have a MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac Mini or Mac Pro. Related: macOS Sierra system requirements – Will my Mac run Sierra? mac OS Sierra – Siri Finally, Siri has made it to the desktop after being trapped in mobile devices since launch. A fancy new icon sits at the top-right of the desktop in the Menu Bar. You can click it to bring up Siri or press and hold Command+Space. This shortcut uses the same keys for Spotlight search, which is handy, as you don't need to remember another command. If you do want to use something different, you can change the shortcut in System Preferences. As on the iPhone or iPad, you then just ask Siri questions or give it commands. That means that you can do all of the standard stuff that you're used to doing with Siri: set a reminder, launch an application, search online or ask what the weather's going to be like. Siri is also capable of more complex tasks, such as composing an email, showing a preview in its pop-up window as you go. You can send messages directly from Siri, but clicking the preview to make a final edit to cut out dictation errors is a wise idea. Fortunately, clicking the preview opens your default email client, not the built-in Mail app. For macOS, Apple has also added some new features. Siri can tell you how much storage you've got left, or find all files that you've edited in the last week, for example. There are several limitations, though. Unlike with iOS, macOS's Siri can't integrate with third-party applications, so you can't search for music in Spotify, for example. There's also no HomeKit integration, so you'll have to control your smart home from your mobile device instead. Then there's the general problem that, smart as Siri is, you soon learn its foibles and realise that you have to adjust the way you phrase to be understood. For simple tasks, such as setting a reminder, this is fine, but if you want to do anything more complicated, it's easier to use the traditional manual methods. Related: iOS 10 review mac OS Sierra – iCloud Documents and Desktop I didn't like the way that iCloud initially worked, with each cloud-enabled app automatically choosing where to save its files. With the introduction of iCloud Drive, Apple let you manually access your cloud storage, but it still wasn't that flexible, and you couldn't use it to organise your regular documents. In macOS Sierra, Apple's finally introduced a more Dropbox-style way of using the service. Now, iCloud will automatically backup and share files saved in your Documents or Desktop folders. It means that the folder structure that I'm used to just gets replicated to all of my devices. In particular, I love the Desktop iCloud integration. I'm terrible for saving files to my Desktop and then switching machines. Now, everything I put on my Desktop is available on all of my Macs. The only downside with the new system is that you can't exclude individual files or folders; it's an all-or-nothing option. If you've got a Mac packed with Documents, it can mean that you run out of iCloud storage fast. Fortunately, competitively priced iCloud storage plans let you expand your cloud storage cheaply – 50GB for 0.79p per month, 200GB for £2.49, 1TB for £6.99 and a massive 2TB for £13.99. mac OS Sierra – Optimized Storage Older Macs, in particular, don't have a lot of local storage space, so macOS Sierra is here to help with Optimized Storage. Available through the iCloud System Preferences panel, Optimized Storage automatically moves files that you don't use very often to the cloud. It can only do this for files in certain folders or apps that already use iCloud, such as Documents and Mail. Crucially, macOS only starts moving files to the cloud when you start to run out of disk space. Data stored in the cloud is still available on your Mac, and individual files are downloaded when you want to open or edit them. Optimized Storage is an elegant feature that can help anyone who's got a Mac with little space left on it. Feedback from people using the service has seen them reclaim 20GB-plus of disk space, although each computer is different, and the exact amount depends on where your files are stored.

It integrates so nicely with iOS that it's bound to be the image app of choice for anyone with a Mac and an iPhone or iPad." Yes, and what about the fact that People tab in Photos, when set up on iOS device, don't work on MacOS, I mean, you have to do it all over again? Completely useless feature because of that. Who in the hell will go through the hideous process of tagging and sorting all of their friends/faces, just to find out that the whole process needs to be done again on other device, weather you have iCloud Photo library enabled or not... As for the MacOS Sierra in general, this is by far the lamest OS upgrade in years... Tim Shaw September 25, 2016, 7:15 am Slowed my 2 year old 27 inch Mac to a crawl. Managed to revert back to El Capitan via Time Machine. LeeTronix September 27, 2016, 6:36 am How is a new OS that has been fully redesigned under neath that incoorporates many important features from the previous OS (elcapitan) and works seemless with IOS a "modest upgrade". Come on that is plane stupid to put that phrase in a sentence. I agree there will be issues that will cause issues with many other users, whether it is sluggish performance or buggy software conflicts etc, it does happen but will get fixed over a short period of time. I have had some issues on the software side that conflicts with existing software but you have to ride it out. Siri is a nice add on and the IOS integration is marvellous, something Windows 10 just seems to consistently fail on and missed out on doing with their own phones / OS. It just works but better. LeeTronix September 27, 2016, 6:37 am I can get that, they will iron out these issues over a short period of time for sure. Cory Pickerign October 7, 2016, 9:04 pm macOS Sierra is horse shit.... i updated to that platform and updates on it would not install then would freeze whole computer, but then i got it fixed from apple support. after that it appeared to work fine, then when i tried to full screen on youtube or any other site or game, it would freeze completely(not registering the force quit commands) and then go straight to sleep mode.... the support said to hold some keys down at computer start up and when the menu comes up to click the re-install OS X, so i did that with the keys and OS X was no where to be found, the next option was a diff set of keys upon start up, and there was OS X, but it would not let me reinstall it because i already had a newer version.... the only way i could fix my computer was to do a factory reset... thanks to apples rushed production of the new platform, they resulted in me losing years of data not to mention over 50 steam games because of their new faulty platform. moshelevzvei October 25, 2016, 11:26 pm Updated yesterday (10-26-16) Not impressed. I thought El Capitan was wonderful. There are few features in this OS I'll use. Not Siri, and several others. Meanwhile, installation, unlike with Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite, ElCapitan, was like a "MS Nightmare." Kudos to Apple Support for helping me dig out of the problems, but I lost a day. I lost some recent files, recoverable fortunately because I'd moved them to a different Mac before starting the install. The genius of of the late SJ was simplicity of interface and ease of use. I'm not sure I see either in Sierra or in IOS 10. I'll never go back to MS, but right now I'm feeling just a bit irritated with Apple. Some of the problem was of my own doing, and yet, not. Whatever you do, ditch Bitdefender before attempting the install. Its presence will give you many headaches even if you only have the version that doesn't run in the background.

(Photo: Reviewed.com / Keith Barry) Amazon's Echo smart speaker may soon have some new competition — from Siri. Apple is reportedly in the prototype stage of developing its answer to Amazon's popular device, according to a new report from Bloomberg. Similar to Echo, the device would allow users to use Siri to control their home through voice, issuing commands to control everything from lights to locks to thermostats, something referred to as home automation. Apple has dabbled in this space the past few years through its HomeKit program, allowing appliance manufacturers to create Internet-connected products that can be controlled from an iPhone, iPad or Apple TV through Siri. USA TODAY Why the new Siri is still maddening in so many ways While similar in overall functionality to Echo, one of the ways Apple's smart device may attempt to differentiate itself is with more "advanced microphone and speaker technology," two unnamed people told Bloomberg, though what this exactly would mean is unclear. Apple also has reportedly been experimenting with putting cameras on its devices to allow for the product to do facial recognition. Since making Echo widely available in 2015, Amazon has surged to an early lead in the race to control the home. The $179.99 Echo is the top selling home automation product on the company's website with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating on more than 43,000 reviews. USA TODAY Uber to use driver selfies to enhance security But it's not just Amazon that Apple has to worry about. Earlier this year Google announced it would be coming out with its own rival smart-speaker called Google Home. Not much is known about the device beyond that it will launch this year, but the company is expected to provide more details when it hosts its next big event on Oct. 4. On Friday, Android Police reported Google plans to price Google Home at $129 and its 4K 'Chromecast Ultra' at $69.

(Amazon) Share Written by Mike Murphy September 23, 2016 Siri may soon be making the jump from your pocket to your end table. Apple has been working on a standalone product to control internet-of-things devices for a while, but a new report from Bloomberg suggests that the company has moved the project from a research phase to prototyping. It would theoretically be pitted against other smart-home devices, including Amazon’s sleeper hit, the Echo, and Google’s forthcoming Home Hub. According to the report, Apple’s device would be controlled using its Siri voice assistant technology. It would be able to perform the same functions that it can complete now on iPhones, Macs, and other Apple products, such as being able to tell you when the San Francisco Giants are next playing, or possibly send a poorly transcribed text message. The device would also be able to control other internet-connected devices in the home, such as lights, door locks, and web-enabled appliances, as Google and Amazon’s products can. It would also have the same ability to play music through built-in speakers. Apple first hinted that it was interested in smart-home technology when it introduced HomeKit to developers in 2014, as a way of standardizing how internet-of-things devices would talk to Apple products. And at the company’s developer conference this summer, it unveiled a new app for its iOS mobile operating system, called Home. It’s essentially a consumer-facing version of the framework that it opened to developers two years ago, allowing iPhone owners to control any smart devices they have in their homes through one app, instead of having to fish around their phones for each company’s individual app. Apple as of yet has not produced any of its own hardware to accompany the app, and as Bloomberg points out, a new device like this would be the most significant new product line that the company will have released since the Apple Watch, and arguably only the third entirely new product released under current CEO Tim Cook’s tenure, after the watch and the forthcoming AirPod wireless headphones. Sales of Apple’s most profitable product, the iPhone, have been falling in recent quarters, as the company has struggled to reach the heights it has in years past. The Apple Watch has also seen underwhelming sales, especially when compared to the iPhone, and the company is still searching for additional revenue streams, as sales of its computers and iPads have also been stagnant. It’s unclear whether a new device like this would be the thing Apple needs to kickstart growth, but the Echo has sold better than even Amazon had expected, which could have emboldened Apple to continue pursuing this product line. Apple released its newest iPhones and Apple Watches at event earlier this month, and is expected to announce a refresh to its computers at an event possibly in October. Given that this product is still in the prototyping phase, it seems unlikely that we’ll be seeing it at Apple’s next event, but it could well be part of what many are predicting to be a banner year for new Apple products in 2017. The company wasn’t immediately available to comment on Bloomberg’s report. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Trending in Apple How Apple’s stock apps will use the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro [Gallery] September 23 AAPL: 112.71 -1.91 Apple Watch Diary: Transforming the user-interface in watchOS 3 was Apple’s real act of courage Ben Lovejoy - 2 months ago @benlovejoy Feature Apple Watch View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple used the word ‘courage’ recently to describe its decision to remove the headphone socket from the iPhone 7, and much fun was poked at the company by those who missed the reference. But what I personally found far more courageous was Apple effectively admitting that it got the original Apple Watch user-interface badly wrong, and completely revamping it in watchOS 3. Glances never worked. They were supposed to be a fast way to see information from your favorite apps, and to go on to quickly open those apps when required. In reality, neither objective was achieved: data was slow to load, and so were the apps. And the side-button for immediate access to contacts was simply the waste of a button. Using the Watch Dick Tracy-style for phone calls was never more than a novelty, and sending scribbles and the like to contacts was even more of a gimmick. So Apple had the courage to abandon both. Glances are gone, replaced by the app Dock, and the side button has been repurposed to access it. These two changes have transformed my use of my Watch … I said recently that I literally couldn’t remember the last time I actually opened an app on the Watch as it was so tediously slow to do so. Instead, I used my Watch for just four things: Glancing at Complications on the Modular watch face Notifications Replying to text messages Apple Pay Those four things were enough for the Watch to earn its keep, but I could see no benefit to me in upgrading to Apple’s shiny new hardware. What I do love, though, is Apple’s even shinier new software. By keeping the most-used apps in memory, and providing instant access to them via the newly-repurposed side button, using apps has gone from a frustrating act of last resort to a quick and easy way to get stuff done. The result? I’m now frequently using eight different apps. Effectively, a free upgrade to my Watch has added eight ‘new’ features – features that were always there in theory but were previously too slow to use in practice. I listen to a lot of podcasts (This American Life, Freakonomics Radio and a whole bunch of Radio 4 shows, in the main), so keep Now Playing in my dock. The Watch now makes it really easy to skip back 15 seconds if I missed something or my mind was wandering, and while pause/play is very easy on the B&W P5 wireless headphones I was assimilated into using, sometimes it’s even more convenient to pause on the Watch. That would never have been true before. The Music app itself now comes into its own. It’s a more convenient way to start a playlist while out and about, and I frequently use the Quick Play button as an instant way to start some music. Still on the music front, I love the convenience of being able to quickly Shazam a music track in a bar or coffee shop. I previously used to use Siri on my iPhone, but this is much easier. Siri is unfortunately useless for identifying music on the Watch. I also love that Shazam can display lyrics on the Watch. I’m not usually a fan of using small screens to display more than a glance’s worth of info, but it’s nice when Shazamming a song to also be able to quickly skim the lyrics. I’m not much of a selfie guy, but it’s always better to prop the iPhone up to avoid motion-blur when taking photos in low light, and using the Watch as a remote-control is much more convenient than using the self-timer. I love the convenience of navigating by wrist-taps. It’s much more pleasant than walking along staring at your phone screen, and a lot safer in sketchy areas. You can look like you know exactly where you’re going while keeping your attention on your surroundings. I know London well, so most places I can get to within a few streets without navigational assistance, then just use Apple Maps for the last few blocks. I tend to set the destination on my iPhone, as it’s easier on the larger screen, and to do that in advance. When I get close enough to need the help, I then set it going on my Watch. Dark Sky is my preferred short-range weather app. I generally use it to decide whether or not I’ll need a cycling jacket, and to see whether I might be better off leaving a little earlier than planned to avoid a rain shower. Here the benefit of having the info on my wrist rather than my phone is more marginal, but interestingly it’s been one of the things that has most sold friends on an Apple Watch when they see it in action. I have a lot of friends in other countries, and Skype is my default way of keeping in touch with them. Mostly I just keep the app in the dock to ensure it’s open so I’ll receive call alerts on my Watch. I find that otherwise it can fall out of RAM. Finally – and this is a big one for me – I now use my Watch as a remote control when listening to music on the hifi. My MacBook Pro is my music repository, AirPlaying music to a variety of speakers in different rooms. In the living-room, I control music directly from the Mac (where it lives in the evening), but in other rooms it’s great to have the Watch as a remote control. Around 90% of my listening is from Apple Music’s For You playlists, which has two implications. First, I won’t always know the name of the artist or track, and the Watch will show it to me. Second, if I don’t like a track, I can use the Watch to skip to the next one. The only thing missing for me is Love and Dislike buttons for Apple Music. I do try to religiously like/dislike tracks, as that’s why Apple’s For You recommendations are so good for me, but I can’t do it from the Watch. One small criticism: I never change watch faces, so for me the ‘swipe left/right’ UI is completely wasted. A friend (thanks, Greg!) observed that, even if you do, it’s unlikely to be something you do so often that a ‘top level’ gesture is justified. I’d prefer to see the swipe gesture used for something more useful – perhaps swipe right to access your most-used app and left for the one you used most recently? Oh, and a kind of combined compliment and complaint, I guess: now I’m actively using the Watch so much more, I’m finding that I burn through a lot more battery power. International travel excepted, the Watch always used to comfortably make it through a day for me, but I’ve twice run out of power since watchOS 3. But that aside, I’m blown away by how much difference watchOS 3 has made. I really feel like Apple just gave me a free upgrade to a whole new model.

Referred to in the filings as simply a wireless device with model number A1844, what we do know is that the product includes Bluetooth and NFC functionality. It’s also a low-powered device rated to draw between 100mA and 700mA and between 5.5V and 13.2V. Compare that with the current Apple TV rated at 12V at 0.917A or the iPhone 5 V at 2.4A. In addition, we see only two torx screws visible on the bottom plate of the device where the regulatory markings are shown (pictured below), the positioning of which seem to hint at a rather small Apple TV-size device, although exact dimensions aren’t shown.  Apple made sure that the filing leaked minimal details with its usual permanent confidentiality request that removed documents showing block diagrams, electrical schematic diagrams, technical descriptions, antenna gain and antenna locations. The report also notes references to color-coded cables, which doesn’t seem very Apple-like for a consumer facing product, but likely related to Apple’s testing procedures only. With Apple’s iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 debut behind us, the next rumored product that seems like could line up with this mystery wireless device is the Siri-powered Amazon Echo competitor. Interestingly, this morning Bloomberg reported that the in-development device is now in prototype testing. The rumored device is expected to compete with Amazon Echo and Google’s recently unveiled Home platform that offers dedicated hardware for controlling home accessories and more via voice commands. Apple’s product is expected to offer a similar experience using Siri, but it’s unclear exactly how it plans to implement the hardware. The report from Bloomberg claimed Apple had considered integrating it with Apple TV, but later opted for a different approach with a standalone speaker device more like Amazon and Google’s offerings.  blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Apple’s iMessage App Store already has over 1,650 apps, majority are sticker packs Posted Sep 23, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Extra early-bird ticket deadline for Disrupt London extended to Sept. 30 In just over a week, Apple’s iMessage App Store has grown to over 1,650 applications and sticker packs – more than the original iPhone had at launch as well as the 1,000 total that were ready for iPad at the time of its debut, but far less than the 3,500+ the Watch App Store arrived with last year. According to a new report from Sensor Tower, the most popular type of mini mobile application is the “sticker pack” – the store includes 1,251 of these, the firm says, alongside 402 other, non-sticker iMessage apps. The iMessage App Store is Apple’s latest attempt at building a platform that allows third-party developers to market their software to the sizable iPhone user base. It arrives at a time when the original iOS App Store has become so cluttered with out-of-date and abandoned applications – so much so, that Apple has implemented a store-wide cleanup process that could impact hundreds of thousands of apps. Meanwhile, iMessage App Store reflects a shift in the way users are finding and using applications. Instead of seeking out standalone apps to stick on homescreens, where they are often forgotten, many people are looking for add-ons that enhance their mobile messaging experience. To date, that has included everything from custom keyboards to apps that help you more easily add flavor and humor to your messages, like apps for sharing GIFs, emoji, stickers, and more. In addition, some of the most popular applications on the App Store today are those that offer a richer messaging experience from within their own walls, such as Facebook Messenger (the #3 free app), Snapchat (#5), or WhatsApp (#15), for example. Apple hopes to better cater to this messaging audience with the revamped iMessage app which launched last week along with iOS 10. The new iMessage turns the texting app into a platform, and introduces a number of new features, like effects which let you decorate the screen with animation and sound, pixelate messages with “invisible ink,” link previews, handwritten notes, quick responses via tapbacks, emoji suggestions, and more. Its biggest feature, though, is that it opens up the platform to apps. But despite being a new way to interact with apps, the new App Store is already mirroring the trends we see in the wider app marketplace – that is, games are still dominating. According to Sensor Tower’s data, of the 402 non-sticker apps on the new storefront, the largest category is games. There are already 92 games available for download, which almost 2.5 times the number of apps in the second-largest category, Entertainment (39). Rounding out the top 10 categories are Utilities (31), Productivity (26), Social Networking (25), Photo & Video (23), Travel (21), Education (18), Health & Fitness (17), and Food & Drink (15). What’s interesting is that there are very few News apps – only 6 are currently live. That’s very different from Facebook Messenger, for example. According to Messenger head David Marcus, speaking recently at TechCrunch Disrupt, news bots were one of the categories it found did very well on its chat platform. There are already dozens of these available, according to the bot-tracking site Botlist. Stickers, however, are far more popular than apps – and the most surefire way to generate revenue for developers. Of the 1,251 sticker packs, 944 are premium (paid) downloads, while 307 are free. The majority (86%) are $0.99, while some are $1.99 (12%), and fewer still are priced higher at $2.99 (1%). The most expensive pack – and there’s just one – is priced at $3.99. While this early look into the iMessage App Store helps paint a picture of what developers are building, it doesn’t yet indicate which apps consumers are actually downloading. That data will come in time as more people upgrade to new iPhones, update their current devices with the new OS, and discover the world of iMessage apps.

Apple Reportedly Looking To Create Competitor To Amazon Echo Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Reportedly Looking To Create Competitor To Amazon Echo September 23, 2016 10:13 am EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave siri v. alexa apple amazon amazon echo google Google Home siri Alexa With the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, Apple led the charge to make new personal digital products accessible, popular, and now all but necessary. But the electronics giant may now be playing catch-up to Amazon in the connected-home market, as the e-tailer’s Echo device and its various spinoffs become more affordable and functional. Now comes news that Apple is looking to build a connected-home speaker/assistant of its own to go head-to-head with Echo. This is according to Bloomberg, citing the ever-chatty but ever-shy “people familiar with the matter.” They say that Apple has been tinkering with an Echo-like product for around two years. Like the Echo, this in-development Apple product would allow users to control an array of other connected home devices and systems, like lights and door locks. Bloomberg reports that Apple has also tested new functionalities like facial recognition that could help differentiate the eventual product from Echo. If this Apple device ever becomes a reality, it could face a crowded marketplace. Earlier this year, Google pulled back the curtains on Google Home, its take on the connected-home hub, which may have the added advantage of being under the same corporate umbrella as Nest — makers of connected thermostats, smoke alarms, and security cameras — and Google’s Chromecast line of audio and video connectors. One advantage an Apple hub might have is better integration across multiple devices. Amazon has Fire tablets that work with Echo’s Alexa voice-operated assistant, but these low-cost devices do not have the same market penetration or app support that the iPad or iPhone does. Likewise, while Google’s Android mobile operating system is wildly popular, its deployment varies from one phone manufacturer to the next, and can also depend on the device’s wireless provider. Since Apple’s iOS is only on Apple devices, the company may be able to offer a home hub with more seamless integration. Of course, until Apple unveils a device (or until dozens of leaked photos and videos of it are posted online), this is all speculation.

Details are scarce, but from what we can work out, it could be a new Apple TV set for release. The device has the model number A1844, which is not currently in use by any Apple device. The power supply and screw placement are in line with the existing Apple TV, although not perfectly identical. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 review The timing would make sense, as Apple has traditionally held a second event in the fall, post-iPhone, to release a few new devices. This year, we'd expect to see new MacBooks as the cornerstone of that event, but an update to the Apple TV is very possible. Along with a few technical details for the device, Apple also submitted documentation for testing Bluetooth and NFC radios in the device. The inclusion of NFC is a little puzzling, as Apple has so far ignored the technology, only using it for Apple Pay in iPhones. There's no Wi-Fi radio mentioned, but that doesn't mean much. Assuming this is an incremental update to the Apple TV (a safe bet, as Apple doesn't normally let brand-new products leak through the FCC), it would use the same Wi-Fi chip as the previous version, and not require re-testing. So what new features can we expect to see? Well, 4K HDR video is a notable omission from the current Apple TV, and with new Playstations and Xboxs emerging with 4K capabilities, adding that in would be a smart move by Apple. Less likely is the addition of more smart home technology. Some kind of Apple competitor to the Amazon Echo has been rumored for a while, and the Apple TV may well have a role to play in Apple's quest to take over your home. But a small, incremental upgrade to the Apple TV -- which is what this looks like -- probably won't be the cornerstone of Apple's smart home plans.

Apple is still working on its Echo competitor, say sources speaking to Bloomberg. The device will be able to control appliances, locks, lights, and curtains around your home using your voice. It will also be able to perform various Siri functions, like reading your email, sending text messages, and streaming Apple Music. One way that Apple is trying to help its device compete against Amazon’s Echo and Google’s upcoming Home is with better hardware. That includes better microphone and speaker tech. Apple is also reportedly testing facial recognition sensors in its device. There’s no word on when Apple’s Echo competitor might launch, and it’s possible that the project could be scrapped altogether. However, one source says that the device is now in the prototype stage and that some Apple engineers are testing it inside of their homes. With the Amazon Echo seemingly growing in popularity and Google prepping its Home device, it makes sense that Apple would at least be investigating a similar product of its own. Now we just have to wait and see if Apple can get the device to where the company is happy enough with it to actually release it to the public.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Echoes of Amazon as Apple reportedly pursues standalone Siri device It could also have built-in facial recognition technology to see who's home. by Valentina Palladino - Sep 23, 2016 2:33 pm UTC Login to bookmark 52 Same for Siri. Apple may be planning to introduce Siri to a new home, one that doesn't live in your pocket or on your wrist. A Bloomberg report suggests that Apple may be developing a smart home device akin to Amazon's Echo that uses Siri to control other devices around the home, including smart lights and locks. Individuals "familiar with the matter" claim that the project has already gone through research and development, and it has now entered the prototype testing phase. According to the report, Apple will try to set its product apart from Echo and Google's new Home device by incorporating "more advanced" microphones and speakers as well as facial recognition sensors that could help the device identify who is in the room. Apple has acquired the startups Faceshift and Emotient over the past couple years, both of which have experience in facial-recognition technology. Since the device is assumed to be controlled by Siri, it could potentially be used for many existing Siri commands; for example, you might be able to ask the device to read your e-mail, stream Apple Music tracks, or send a text message. Apple reportedly first tried to integrate Siri into the Apple TV, which would have let users speak commands to the set-top box. However, project was never completed, and Apple instead decided to integrate voice-commands into the TV's controller. But Apple has set its sights on the smart home space, evident by its release of HomeKit in 2014 and the refining of the Home app in iOS 10. Third-party manufacturers use HomeKit to incorporate Siri voice controls into their devices, allowing users to control all HomeKit-compatible devices with their voice. However, HomeKit requires companies to build new hardware that complies with Apple's MFi licensing program, so many manufacturers are still working on HomeKit-enabled versions of their existing products. If Apple does develop an Echo-like device, it could potentially be a hub for all HomeKit devices in a household. Infiltrating the smart home sphere is just another way to encourage people to use Siri as much as possible. Bloomberg suggests Apple wants users to be able to control all of their devices (iPhones, iPads, smart home products, etc) by using a seamless Siri command system within the next three years. Siri can already do a lot, but Apple apparently wants to remove the necessity of starting up the Siri interface in order for it to recognize a command. That means, if Siri is activated for one user's account, it would be always on and listening. As with all unconfirmed Apple initiatives, the project could be scrapped before ever hitting the market.

But many readers have expressed concern over the lack of a headphone jack in the iPhone 7. In a post-announcement poll taken by Toluna Quicksurveys that included TidBITS-specific questions, 44 percent of respondents said the absence of a headphone jack would require them to change their habits. (For more on that, see “iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Say “Hit the Road, Jack.”,” 7 September 2016.) Apple claims the future is wireless, even though it bundles wired Lightning EarPods with the iPhone 7. However, Apple would be more than happy to sell you a $159 pair of wireless AirPods when they debut in late October, or a pair of the new W1-equipped Beats wireless headphones. (See “W1-powered AirPods Usher in a New Era of Wireless Audio,” 7 September 2016). Wireless headphones are nothing new, and The Wirecutter offers well-vetted suggestions for nearly every situation. For now, though, I’d like to focus on three specific use cases that new iPhone 7 users may be wondering about: converting existing headphones to wireless, affordable wireless adapters for the car, and an inexpensive solution for fitness buffs. Make Any Headphones Wireless -- By far my favorite gadget in this roundup is the Antec AMP SmartBean, a Bluetooth receiver with a headphone jack that works with any audio device that connects via a 3.5mm headphone plug, such as headphones, speakers, and car stereos. It sells for around $25 on Amazon. The SmartBean is not much bigger than a quarter, and it’s about the weight of two quarters. It sports a clip you can use to attach it to your belt, handbag, or car visor. The SmartBean features a built-in lithium-ion battery, recharged via a Micro-USB connection, which lasts for 6 hours on a single charge. The reported standby time is 130 hours, so it’s easy to keep it with you at all times. If that’s not enough battery life, you can use the SmartBean while it’s charging, but the SmartBean turns itself off when you plug it in, so you’ll have to turn it back on. It takes 2.5 hours to recharge fully. It includes a built-in microphone for phone calls, as well as buttons for Play/Pause, volume, and Previous/Next track. However, if you keep the SmartBean on your belt, the microphone probably won’t do much good. Its volume controls are a bit different than most Bluetooth volume controls in that they don’t adjust the volume on the transmitting device, but instead on the SmartBean itself. I like having this level of control, but you might want to set your iPhone’s volume to maximum and then turn it down on the SmartBean. I didn’t test the built-in microphone, because there’s no way to initiate calls from the SmartBean. The in-line remote control on Apple’s EarPods doesn’t work with the SmartBean, and the controls on the SmartBean can’t activate Siri. Holding down the Play/Pause button on the SmartBean dials the last-dialed number, a quirk that also apparently happens on Android phones. I tested the SmartBean with three pairs of headphones: standard Apple EarPods, the professional-grade Sony MDR-V6, and the Beats Solo 2. I switched between wired and wireless connections with these headphones and couldn’t discern a difference in audio quality. I did hear a slight delay in audio transmission while monitoring my voice for a TidBITS podcast recording, but I didn’t notice it while listening to music or watching movies. I also used the SmartBean with my Sony MDR-V6 headphones for a couple of podcast appearances with no problems. The SmartBean supports multipoint pairing so you can pair two devices to it at the same time. However, as with all multipoint Bluetooth devices, doing this often causes more problems than it solves, so I recommend repairing with each device with which you use the SmartBean. Thankfully, pairing is as painless as possible for a standard Bluetooth device. Despite the usual quirks that seem to come with every Bluetooth device, the SmartBean is a valuable companion for the dawn of the wireless era. Go Wireless in the Car -- The SmartBean is a flexible solution if your car has an auxiliary input jack, but what if it doesn’t? If your car has a tape deck, you could connect a SmartBean to a common cassette adapter, or you could opt for a solution recommended by our pal Peter Cohen: the ION Bluetooth cassette adapter, which sells for about $22. Yes, that’s right, just pop this cassette adapter into your stereo and you’ll have a wireless connection. It runs off a rechargeable battery that offers about 4 hours of battery life. I haven’t tried it myself, but it’s a neat hack. Many of us drive cars produced after the cassette era, but before auxiliary jacks and Bluetooth were standard. The easiest solution for folks like us is an FM transmitter, which hijacks a radio station to send audio to the car stereo. I’ve owned many FM transmitters, most of which were garbage, but I like the $35 Bluetooth-enabled GOgroove FlexSMART x2 so much that I bought one for my wife’s car and one for mine. It also features an aux-in port for people whose devices do still have headphone jacks. I like the GOgroove FlexSMART x2 for a variety of reasons. It plugs directly into your car’s cigarette lighter socket, so there are no batteries to worry about. The FM transmitter is powerful. Most FM transmitters suffer from interference even in unused portions of the radio spectrum, but the GOgroove FlexSMART x2 can block out even the most powerful stations in my area. The GOgroove FlexSMART x2’s flexible neck enables it to fit in just about any car. It also features a USB charging port. Just plug in an available Lightning cable and you’re all set. (I like the Anker PowerLine+, which is Apple-certified, cheaper and more durable than Apple’s cables, and comes in many colors and lengths.) The one potential downside of the GOgroove FlexSMART x2 is that it can’t automatically scan for open frequencies. However, I’ve never found this to be a reliable feature in other FM transmitters. You’re better off using an online tool like Radio-Locator to find an open frequency in your area. Like the SmartBean, the GOgroove FlexSMART x2 supports multipoint pairing, letting you connect two devices at once. This feature works better on the GOgroove FlexSMART x2 than on the SmartBean and enables you and your significant other to share a car with little friction. Inexpensive Exercise Earbuds -- A lot of people need music to work out and prefer wireless headphones to eliminate snagging problems. But you may not want to spend much on fancy headphones that could be smashed, lost, or stolen at the gym. TidBITS reader Floyd Bloom first pointed me toward the SoundPeats QY7 headphones, which go for $19.99 on Amazon. However, reader Dennis Swaney suggested a cheaper alternative (I’m hesitant to say “knockoff,” because a lot of companies make QY7 headphones, and I’m not entirely sure if there even is an original) on eBay, the generic QY7 Bluetooth Headset, which sells for $9.49, including shipping. I had to try it. (From now on, when I refer to the QY7, I mean the generic pair I bought on eBay.) The sound quality is lousy. Listening to the QY7, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the lead singer of your favorite band had fallen down a well. However, when you’re working out, audio quality is often the least of your concerns. Let’s look at the QY7’s virtues outside of price. They’re extremely lightweight. The battery is rated for 2–3 hours of music, 175 hours of standby, and a charge time of 2 hours. Unlike the AirPods, the two buds are connected via a wire, and the QY7 comes with several different tips and ear loops so you can adjust the fit. The QY7 aren’t audiophile-grade earbuds, but for less than $10, there’s minimal risk to tossing a pair in your gym bag. We totally understand if the disappearance of the headphone jack is making you anxious, but there are good wireless solutions out there, and they don’t have to be expensive — you could buy all the products I’ve reviewed here for under $100.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment JohnB (SciFiOne)   2016-09-22 16:02 Good article. I'm glad you mentioned the QY7. I had seen them but music quality is important so now I can honestly reject them. I have a Hinbox in my car connected via a cassette adapter. I can receive and make calls from it. Music also sounds good. Rather a lot of wires but I just twist tied them together. Hinbox received the top rating in a review of Bluetooth car adapters. For music when I am working I use LG HBS-730 Tone bluetooth headphones. Reply Michael Eisenman  2016-09-22 17:31 I have a pair of SoundPEATS QY7s, and I had a hard time getting a decent sound with the included silicone ear rubbers (a common problem for me). I got much better sound after I fashioned a pair of adapters from some foam earplugs (which I do with all of my earbuds), and I found them to be usable once I got them pointing properly down the ear canals. The controls are a bit fiddly to operate, though. For the price, they're okay when you need wireless, but I mostly use my wired pair of RHA buds. Reply Hamilton Richards   2016-09-23 08:50 My two favorite Bluetooth audio devices: 1. LG Tone Pro HBS-750 Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headphones. 2. VW Golf Mk 7. Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2016-09-23 11:30 Laugh. I don't think 2 is in the affordable class. Reply Dan Daranciang  2016-09-26 10:46 I'm hoping still for a Y-cable with a male Lightning plug, a female 2.5 mm jack, and a female Lightning socket. These look like neat solutions (especially the Antec adapter) but I'd rather have something that doesn't itself need charging. Reply Josh Centers   2016-09-26 11:27 Well, there's this: http://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F8J198/ Reply Mark Geary  2016-10-04 00:27 There are many wired<->Bluetooth adapters on Amazon. How did you choose the SmartBean? Why do you like it better than the others? Reply Gustavo Domínguez  2016-10-04 02:09 I bought the Sony SBH52 headset when I got my first giant iPhone, it's actually a tiny handset although I seldom use it for that. Volume control is sent to the transmitting device and I've recently learned that if you let it on but with nothing playing, battery won't get discharged (as fast), I can't say the same for my Beats StudioWireless. I use it all the time with Apple EarPods since I have tons of spare pairs to watch stuff on Apple TV without making noise, not that I need to, it just got confortable. You can control volumen from the Apple TV's remote, playback with the headset, and viceversa. The EarPods remote won't work, of course, but I guess that's fine since the device itself is a remote.

I hardly ever do much phone in the car except for streaming music so it's great. Sony BT audio not bad for extremely affordable (this was 20$ three years ago) Reply Hans Solmssen   2016-10-04 04:56 So to talk on my iPhone wirelessly in the car, I'll need to buy a separate cable with male on both ends, and plug one end into the Smart Bean and the other into the GOgroove FlexSMART x2? Then my voice will be transmitted through the Smart Bean and I'll hear the conversation through my car speakers? Reply Josh Centers   2016-10-04 05:20 No, just one or the other, as they both have microphones. The x2 does a decent job with phone calls. Reply Jolin Warren   2016-10-05 04:54 Wow, I'm surprised there is still a market for cassette adapters! I remember them from when I was a teenager (probably still have one somewhere). Are there that many people driving 20+ year-old cars around? Reply JohnB (SciFiOne)   2016-10-05 12:25 18 year old but only 42K. No good reason to abandon it.

There’s a ton of research going on, but while we wait for huge leaps in battery technology here are a few tips to help you stay in control of battery life on your Apple MacBook. What this is This isn’t a collection of tips for battery life – things like decreasing screen brightness, turning off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, decreasing the number of apps you are running and/or not playing music and video will always be the best ways to try to tweak that extra ten minutes you need to finish a project off before you reach the next power socket. (As is using the Energy Saver preferences panel). Instead, this will help you keep an eye on how healthy your battery is, which will give you better insight into how much usable time you can expect from each battery charge. What state’s it in? Do you know what state your battery is in? Why does it matter? The batteries used inside your Apple notebook degrade over time and after a certain number of “charge cycles” they begin to hold less charge until they eventually need to be replaced. So how can you tell what state your battery is in? Hold down the Option key and click the battery indicator and you’ll see battery ‘Condition’ noted at the top of the drop down menu. The four conditions it sees are Normal, Replace Soon, Replace Now and Service Battery, in all three of the last scenarios it is probably time to replace the battery. How often have I used it? The battery inside your Mac is designed to run at optimal levels of efficiency for a number of charge cycles, based on a unit of 100 percent of battery capacity. The number of cycles supported by the battery isn’t fixed – current models support over 1,000, older ones as few as 200, but once the limit is reached you can expect some degradation in battery efficiency. They won’t hold as much charge, won’t last as long between each charge and won’t give you as much usable time. You can check how many cycles your battery has gone through in About this Mac>System Report. In the long list that appears you should see Power, choose this and in the next section look for Health Information. There you should be able to see how many cycles your Mac has run and what condition the battery is in. You may want to use a dedicated battery monitoring utility to get better information about your Mac’s battery life, such as Battery Health 2. Among its other features the app lets you compare the original maximum capacity of your battery with the maximum capacity you currently enjoy. Treat it properly Treated properly a battery should last for years. Apple suggests charging and discharging your MacBook’s battery at least once a month to keep it calibrated. One of the best ways to preserve battery life when you are going on vacation is to charge it to about 50 percent charge and switch it off – don’t let it sleep, just shut it down. MacBook batteries are much happier left this way. If you leave it to sleep it may enter a deep discharge state in which it cannot hold any charge at all. The Tech Specs site provides Apple's battery life expectations for battery usage. Apple Diagnostics One final way to assess battery condition is to run Apple Diagnostics (available in Macs introduced since June 2013). With the Mac plugged into power and all peripherals disconnected you should shut down your Mac and then turn it on again while pressing the D key. The diagnostic session should take 2-3 minutes after which you’ll be told if any issues have been identified and given reference codes for those problems (if any). If Apple Diagnostics tells you that your battery requires service and cites reference code PPT004 you should run the test again, but this time run Option-D, which runs the same tests over the Internet. If the problem is identified once again, contact Apple Support. I hope this short report helps you get better insight into your MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro’s battery life. Google+?

It has allegedly been working on the project for more than two years, which explains why we've heard similar rumours previously, but it is now said to have exited the research and development phase and is now in prototype testing. People familiar with the matter told Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, who often gets Apple speculation bang on the money, that the new device will be able to control appliances, locks, lights and curtains via voice activation. Now Apple is thought to be making an Amazon Echo-like speaker with Siri Amazon Echo: What can Alexa do and what services are compatible? New Apple TV surfaces in FCC filing, has Bluetooth and, er, NFC? Gurman does point out, however, that as the plans are yet to be finalised, there's a chance Apple could scrap the project before it ever sees the light of day. That'd be a shame as the sources claimed the Apple speaker could trump the Amazon Echo considerably. It will feature more advanced microphone and speaker technologies, they said. Early prototypes even included facial recognition sensors, using tech Apple acquired when it bought both Faceshift and Emotient in the last couple of years. Apple has naturally declined to comment, but considering Amazon has had great success with its Echo speaker, which will be released in the UK at the end of September, we can see why the Cupertino firm is so keen to nab a slice of the smarthome assistant market.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Google Set to Shake Up the Market by Challenging Apple's Premium iPhone Directly | Main | What's New? Another 'Fair Trade Commission' is about to open an Investigation into Apple's Carrier Contracts » September 23, 2016 Rumors Persist that Apple is Prototype Testing an All-New Siri-Centric Home Automation Device   Way back in mid-May Patently Apple posted a report titled "Google Home: Advanced Home Automation for Android Users Introduced at Google I/O." In that report we had noted that the upcoming Google Home device was very much like Amazon's Echo meets Apple TV. Just a week earlier we had posted a patent report titled "Future Apple Devices will Automate Home Automation Processes According to User Behavior Patterns," wherein we presented an overview of Apple's intellectual property relating to home automation coming to Apple TV and beyond as illustrated below (just enlarge to see the overview in detail).   Although we didn't focus on voice activation in the patent filing, it was clearly a key component noted several times throughout Apple's filing in context with a 'Cordinator Device.' We also posted a patent report specifically focused on Siri for Home Automation in late 2015.     In our mid-May report I further noted that "With Amazon and now Google catching up to and surpassing Apple's Siri in some ways, we can only hope that Apple is going to finally deliver on this kind of service for Apple TV.   One week later and 'The Information' webstie is claimed just that. The report noted that Apple was upping its game in the field of intelligent assistants. After years of internal debate and discussion about how to do so, the company is preparing to open up Siri to apps made by others. And it is working on an Amazon Echo-like device with a speaker and microphone that people can use to turn on music, get news headlines or set a timer.   Flash forward to today and Bloomberg is now reporting that "Apple Inc. is pressing ahead with the development of an Echo-like smart-home device based on the Siri voice assistant, according to people familiar with the matter.   Started more than two years ago, the project has exited the research and development lab and is now in prototype testing, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unannounced Apple projects. Like Amazon Inc.'s Echo, the device is designed to control appliances, locks, lights and curtains via voice activation, the people said. Apple hasn't finalized plans for the device and could still scrap the project."   Bloomberg further noted that 'If such a product reaches the market, it would be Apple's most significant piece of new hardware since the company announced the Apple Watch in 2014. Echo has been a surprise hit, even to Apple engineers working on their competing project, and is already being baked into smart-home systems made by a range of companies. Meanwhile, Alphabet Inc. is working on its own device, Google Home. Besides taking on the competition, Apple is looking for a new hot seller to augment the iPhone.   The company is attempting to differentiate itself from Echo and Google Home with more advanced microphone and speaker technology, two people said. Some of the prototypes in testing include facial recognition sensors, another person said. Apple has acquired the facial recognition startups Faceshift and Emotient over the past two years, which may help the device act based on who is in a room or a person's emotional state.   Besides serving as a controller for other smart-home devices, the speaker would theoretically be able to process many of the Siri commands available on the iPhone. For example, users may be able to ask the device to read e-mails, send text messages and Tweets, and stream content from Apple Music.   Apple has also considered integrating mapping information into the speaker, another person said, potentially allowing the device to notify a user when it's time to leave the house for an appointment." For more, read the full Bloomberg's report here.   Just as Google is ramping up their own hardware division to deliver devices like Google Home and a premium smartphone to take on Apple's iPhone in October, Apple is likely to introduce a Google Home competitor that's now in the works. It's not a device that was 'rushed' to market because of competing products, but rather one that's been in development for many years and covered by several patents to prove that fact.   So once again, when the tech press say that Apple is copying Google or Amazon, and you know that they'll frame it like that, you'll know that's a blatant falsehood because Apple's patents predate any of these competitor's products. So in reality it will be a device that fulfills their intellectual property, plain and simple.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | September 23, 2016 -- 13:11 GMT (06:11 PDT) | Topic: iOS Uncover some of the cool new features hidden in iOS 10. Here is a quick rundown of some of the new features contained in the new iOS 10 update that you might have missed. While most of these should be available on all devices that support iOS 10, some will only be available on newer devices. Allow selected contacts to bypass Do Not Disturb more iphone news iPhone 7 Plus hands-on: A weekend full of adjustments iPhone 7: Best LCD display ever tested CR: iPhone 7 camera does not outperform iPhone 6s Scratch test raises serious durability concerns Apple's supply pinch: Smart marketing or forecasting? iPhone 7 sales may reach 100m in 2016 due to Note 7 recal l The VIP system for allowing selected contacts to still call you have been improved dramatically in iOS 10. Now you can pick out contacts that can make your phone ring individually. Go into Contacts, find the contact you want to be able to get through to you no matter what, click Edit and then you can set the ringtone and text tone to Emergency Bypass On. Dude, where's my car? Fire up Apple Maps to find where you parked your car. If it's not immediately obvious from the little car icon on the map, you can search for Parked car. Send smaller photos in iMessage Go to Settings > Messages and enable Low Quality Image Mode. If you send a lot of photos and you're either having poor signal or you're not on an unlimited data plan, this can be really helpful. Time for bed This is a weird feature that people will either love or hate. If you're the sort of person who likes to have a certain number of hours of sleep before your alarm goes off, you can now have your iPhone remind you to go to bed. (I know, how did we manage before such things?). To enable this feature open the Clock app and tap Bedtime. Prioritize app installations If you're recovering your iPhone or installing multiple apps, you can control which are installed first by doing a long press on any app waiting to be downloaded on the home screen and tapping the Prioritize Download option. This requires a device with 3D Touch. Better iMessage read receipts Now you can set your read receipt preferences by clicking on the I found at the top-right of iMessage window, then turn read receipts on or off. This setting syncs across all your devices. Find your Apple Watch I know a lot of people requested this feature, and now it's present as part of Find My iPhone. Make Unlock work the way it used to Apple's tweaked the way you unlock you iPhone with the Touch ID sensor, but if this new feature annoys you there is a way to make it work like it did in iOS 9. Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Home Button and enable Rest Finger to Open. Delete those undeletable apps Apple's own apps used to be a fixed feature, and the best you could do was hide them from view. But now you can delete apps such as Main, Stocks and Weather just like you'd delete any other app (and if you change your mind, they're in the App Store). Bright lights! You can now alter the brightness of the flashlight by using a long press on the flashlight icon in Control Center to choose between Bright Light, Medium Light, and Low Light. This requires a device with 3D Touch. Get to the camera - Fast! The icon might be gone, but you can still get to the camera from the lock screen. All you need to do is swipe left. Search your photos From Memories in the Photos app you can search for photos containing particular objects. This is also quite spookily accurate. Emojify everything! The Messages app now highlights words that you can turn into emojis. Handy, but if overused it can make a message almost impossible to understand. Easy unsubscribe Mail automatically floats unsubscribe links from mailing list emails to the top, so you can find them easily. Save on storage space If you're low on space you can get iOS 10 to remove music you've not listened to in a while by going Settings > Music > Optimize Storage and enabling Optimize Storage.

The report, which cites sources familiar with the matter, also says that the device includes built-in cameras capable of distinguishing between users and even detecting their emotions, which would corroborate a CNET report from​ earlier this year. The device is reportedly designed to function similarly to the Amazon Echo, a voice-activated smart home speaker that showcases the online retailer's virtual assistant, Alexa. With simple voice commands, Alexa and the Echo can stream music, answer questions, run optional voice apps called "skills," and control smart home devices. Apple's device would obviously feature Siri, and Bloomberg reports that the Cupertino company is hard at work on improving her conversational intelligence to fill a larger role in the home. Dedicated voice controls for Apple Music and for devices designed to work with HomeKit, Apple's smart home platform, both seem like very safe bets. Phone-based interactions that would let the speaker read off things like emails, text messages and tweets are also reportedly in the works. As for the inclusion of cameras that can recognize your face and read your emotions, Bloomberg reports that they're featured in "some" of the prototypes currently being tested, and points to Apple's recent acquisitions of companies that specialize in facial recognition. If the cameras end up making the final cut, they could help to differentiate the device from the Echo and from the Google Home, another smart home speaker currently making its way to retail. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter. 41 Here's everything the Amazon Echo can do Tags CNET Smart Home Smart Home Speakers Alexa Apple HomeKit 9 Features 8 Usability 9 Design 7 Performance CNET Review Amazon Echo Amazon's smart speaker was arguably the breakout product of 2015.

It's working on a fully voice-controlled iPhone Buried in Bloomberg’s report Friday morning about Apple moving ahead with its Amazon Echo competitor is a far more interesting nugget: Apple believes it’s just three years away from a fully voice-controlled iPhone, according to an unnamed source. From Bloomberg: Beyond the home device, Apple is researching new ways to improve Siri on iPhones and iPads, two people said. With an initiative code-named “Invisible Hand,” Apple hopes to give users the ability to fully control their devices through a Siri command system within three years, one of the people added. Currently, the voice assistant is able to respond to commands within its application, but Apple’s goal is for Siri to be able to control the entire system without having to open an app or reactivate Siri. A few thoughts on that… Siri’s gotten so much better than it was when it first launched. But it has very far to go before it’s able to effectively emulate the computer on the Enterprise. Still, it’s in the realm of the possible. Maybe this’ll feel retrograde in a decade, but how many people really want to control everything with their voice? It’s handy for some stuff, but not everything—especially not gaming. And I personally still feel self-conscious when I’m using Siri in public, as I suspect lots of folks do as well. (My colleagues Lisa Eadicicco and John Patrick Pullen have more on the future of voice control here and here, respectively.) On the flip side, a fully voice-controlled phone/tablet/computer that works well would be wonderful for users with various accessibility needs. Clearly Apple’s convinced that voice control is the future—along with Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others, all of whom are investing heavily in the area. Given the surprise success of the Echo, maybe they’re on to something. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Cunningham • 09/23/16 10:14am The feds say they can secretly read all your email. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Fear of hackers reading private emails in cloud-based systems like Microsoft Outlook, Gmail or Yahoo has recently sent regular people and public officials scrambling to delete entire accounts full of messages dating back years. What we don’t expect is our own government to hack our email – but it’s happening. Federal court cases going on right now are revealing that federal officials can read all your email without your knowledge. As a scholar and lawyer who started researching and writing about the history and meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution more than 30 years ago, I immediately saw how the FBI versus Apple controversy earlier this year was bringing the founders’ fight for liberty into the 21st century. My study of that legal battle caused me to dig into the federal government’s actual practices for getting email from cloud accounts and cellphones, causing me to worry that our basic liberties are threatened. A new type of government search The federal government is getting access to the contents of entire email accounts by using an ancient procedure – the search warrant – with a new, sinister twist: secret court proceedings. The earliest search warrants had a very limited purpose – authorizing entry to private premises to find and recover stolen goods. During the era of the American Revolution, British authorities abused this power to conduct dragnet searches of colonial homes and to seize people’s private papers looking for evidence of political resistance. To prevent the new federal government from engaging in that sort of tyranny, special controls over search warrants were written into the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. But these constitutional provisions are failing to protect our personal documents if they are stored in the cloud or on our smartphones. Fortunately, the government’s efforts are finally being made public, thanks to legal battles taken up by Apple, Microsoft and other major companies. But the feds are fighting back, using even more subversive legal tactics. Searching in secret To get these warrants in the first place, the feds are using the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, passed in 1986 – long before widespread use of cloud-based email and smartphones. That law allows the government to use a warrant to get electronic communications from the company providing the service – rather than the true owner of the email account, the person who uses it. And the government then usually asks that the warrant be “sealed,” which means it won’t appear in public court records and will be hidden from you. Even worse, the law lets the government get what is called a “gag order,” a court ruling preventing the company from telling you it got a warrant for your email. You might never know that the government has been reading all of your email – or you might find out when you get charged with a crime based on your messages. Microsoft steps up Much was written about Apple’s successful fight earlier this year to prevent the FBI from forcing the company to break the iPhone’s security system. But relatively little notice has come to a similar Microsoft effort on behalf of customers that began in April 2016. The company’s suit argued that search warrants delivered to Microsoft for customers’ emails are violating regular people’s constitutional rights. (It also argued that being gagged violates Microsoft’s own First Amendment rights.) Microsoft’s suit, filed in Seattle, says that over the course of 20 months in 2015 and 2016, it received more than 3,000 gag orders – and that more than two-thirds of the gag orders were effectively permanent, because they did not include end dates. Court documents supporting Microsoft describe thousands more gag orders issued against Google, Yahoo, Twitter and other companies. Remarkably, three former chief federal prosecutors, who collectively had authority for the Seattle region for every year from 1989 to 2009, and the retired head of the FBI’s Seattle office have also joined forces to support Microsoft’s position. The feds get everything This search warrant clearly spells out who the government thinks controls email accounts – the provider, not the user. Image: U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York On the first page of the warrant, the cloud-based email account is clearly treated as “premises” controlled by Microsoft, not by the email account’s owner:It’s very difficult to get a copy of one of these search warrants, thanks to orders sealing files and gagging companies. But in another Microsoft lawsuit against the government a redacted warrant was made part of the court record. It shows how the government asks for – and receives – the power to look at all of a person’s email. “An application by a federal law enforcement officer or an attorney for the government requests the search of the following … property located in the Western District of Washington, the premises known and described as the email account [REDACTED]@MSN.COM, which is controlled by Microsoft Corporation.” The Fourth Amendment requires that a search warrant must “particularly describe the things to be seized” and there must be “probable cause” based on sworn testimony that those particular things are evidence of a crime. But this warrant orders Microsoft to turn over “the contents of all e-mails stored in the account, including copies of e-mails sent from the account.” From the day the account was opened to the date of the warrant, everything must be handed over to the feds. Reading all of it The warrant orders Microsoft to turn over every email in an account – including every sent message. Image: U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York In warrants like this, the government is deliberately not limiting itself to the constitutionally required “particular description” of the messages it’s looking for. To get away with this, it tells judges that incriminating emails can be hard to find – maybe even hidden with misleading names, dates and file attachments – so their computer forensic experts need access to the whole data base to work their magic. If the government were serious about obeying the Constitution, when it asks for an entire email account, at least it would write into the warrant limits on its forensic analysis so only emails that are evidence of a crime could be viewed. But this Microsoft warrant says an unspecified “variety of techniques may be employed to search the seized emails,“ including “email by email review.” As I explain in a forthcoming paper, there is good reason to suspect this type of warrant is the government’s usual approach, not an exception. The right to read every email. Image: U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York Former federal computer-crimes prosecutor Paul Ohm says almost every federal computer search warrant lacks the required particularity. Another former prosecutor, Orin Kerr, who wrote the first edition of the federal manual on searching computers, agrees: “Everything can be seized. Everything can be searched.” Even some federal judges are calling attention to the problem, putting into print their objections to signing such warrants – but unfortunately most judges seem all too willing to go along. What happens next If Microsoft wins, then citizens will have the chance to see these search warrants and challenge the ways they violate the Constitution. But the government has come up with a clever – and sinister – argument for throwing the case out of court before it even gets started. The government has asked the judge in the case to rule that Microsoft has no legal right to raise the Constitutional rights of its customers. Anticipating this move, the American Civil Liberties Union asked to join the lawsuit, saying it uses Outlook and wants notice if Microsoft were served with a warrant for its email. The government’s response? The ACLU has no right to sue because it can’t prove that there has been or will be a search warrant for its email. Of course the point of the lawsuit is to protect citizens who can’t prove they are subject to a search warrant because of the secrecy of the whole process. The government’s position is that no one in America has the legal right to challenge the way prosecutors are using this law. Far from the only risk The government is taking a similar approach to smartphone data. For example, in the case of U.S. v. Ravelo, pending in Newark, New Jersey, the government used a search warrant to download the entire contents of a lawyer’s personal cellphone – more than 90,000 items including text messages, emails, contact lists and photos. When the phone’s owner complained to a judge, the government argued it could look at everything (except for privileged lawyer-client communications) before the court even issued a ruling. The federal prosecutor for New Jersey, Paul Fishman, has gone even farther, telling the judge that once the government has cloned the cellphone it gets to keep the copies it has of all 90,000 items even if the judge rules that the cellphone search violated the Constitution. Where does this all leave us now? The judge in Ravelo is expected to issue a preliminary ruling on the feds’ arguments sometime in October. The government will be filing a final brief on its motion to dismiss the Microsoft case September 23. All Americans should be watching carefully to what happens next in these cases – the government may be already watching you without your knowledge. Clark D. Cunningham is the W.

We first heard about Apple working on such a product back in May, but the Siri-infused device still hasn't been made official. According to the latest rumor, that's not because the company has discontinued its efforts in the space - it's apparently just taking it a while to have it ready for the masses. The speaker has reportedly left Apple's R&D lab and is now in the phase of prototype testing, some unnamed "people familiar with the matter" said. Amazon Echo The project has been in development for two years already, so this is certainly one product with which Apple is taking its sweet time. The device will control appliances, locks, and lights through Siri, which will be voice activated. One thing to note is that Apple allegedly hasn't finalized plans for this speaker, so in it could still get scrapped in the end. On the other hand, that's probably rather unlikely, given the Echo line's success, and also the fact that Google is working on such a device of its own - called Google Home and expected to be fully unveiled at the October 4 event. Apple wants to differentiate its offering through the use of facial recognition, as well as "more advanced microphone and speaker technology", whatever that may mean.

On Friday, we got our first update on the device in months when Bloomberg published a report claiming that the product has now moved out of the research and development lab and into prototype testing. DON'T MISS: 10 hidden gestures in iOS 10 to help you get the most out of your iPhone According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, sources familiar with the matter say that development on the device started over two years ago. Similar to Amazon's Echo, the smart home accessory would be able to control lights, appliances and other connected devices around the house with voice commands. Aside from simply keeping pace with Amazon and Google, both of which have voice-controlled assistants either currently available for purchase or coming soon, Apple is also looking to bring another device to market to help bolster sales. The Apple Watch has been a success, but it's the only non-iterative product Apple has launched in the past several years. Apple needs something new on store shelves. Speaking of competing, two sources tell Bloomberg that Apple's device will differentiate itself from Echo and Home by featuring "more advanced microphone and speaker technology." Another source says that Apple has even included facial recognition sensors on some of its prototypes, which could allow the device to react or respond to a specific individual in the room with it. The report also reveals that Apple was considering turning its latest Apple TV set-top box into a smart home assistant, but those plans were scrapped when the company decided to focus on voice commands with the remote. There's still no telling whether or not Apple will actually launch this device, but at least one source says that Apple engineers have begun testing the prototypes in their homes. If Apple does end up deciding that the device is worth launching, there's a good chance we'll see an official unveiling within the next year.

In a report published last month, the Fair Trade Commission said NTT Docomo, KDDI Corp. and SoftBank Group were refusing to sell older surplus iPhone models to third-party retailers, thereby hobbling smaller competitors. Apple was not named in that report, but two senior government sources said regulators were also focusing on Apple’s supply agreements with all three carriers. Under those deals, surplus stock of older iPhones is kept out of the market and sent to overseas markets, such as Hong Kong, according to industry sources. The carriers, locked in a costly battle to win consumers who covet iPhones, also bulk-purchase the Apple smartphones and sell them at a discount, which gives the U.S. company an advantage over rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co., according to the two government officials and an industry source. Both iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7 edge model sell for ¥93,960 under Docomo’s main service package without any contract, but the cost for the iPhone drops sharply to ¥38,232 with a two-year contract, while the Galaxy falls to ¥54,432. When asked about the antitrust concerns, Apple forwarded a link to a web page published at the time of the Aug. 2 FTC report that says it has created or supports 715,000 jobs in Japan, with Japanese-based developers raking in more than $9 billion in revenue from Apple apps since 2008. It did not comment further. The strategy has helped Apple sustain demand for new iPhones, making Japan one of its most profitable markets. The U.S. company accounts for almost one in every two smartphones sold in Japan, its largest share in a major market. It also kept upstart mobile service providers such as messaging app firm Line Corp. and online retailer Rakuten Inc. from selling iPhones, and helped the top three carriers control more than 90 percent of the mobile phone market. Any government order for corrective measures may crimp demand for more profitable new iPhone models that compete against well-reviewed Android phones such as the Galaxy S7. “The actions of the three operators alone do not account for the state of the market,” said one of the officials, who confirmed that the August report was also directed at Apple. “We are getting closer to taking action.” The officials said the watchdog hoped pressing the carriers would get them to solve the antitrust issue, which could include renegotiating contracts with Apple. They asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media. The FTC did not give a deadline or say what penalties, such as fines, it would impose if the companies did not act. In the past, FTC has issued cease and desist orders, and imposed a “surplus charge” to recoup profits resulting from antitrust violations. The biggest surplus charge to date for a case, which involved five companies, is ¥27 billion. Fines on companies judged to be operating cartels or monopolies, however, can be higher. NTT Docomo said it did not believe it was blocking new entrants. “We have always strived to conduct sales and services appropriately and we will take the FTC’s report on board and consider our response,” a spokesman said. A spokeswoman for KDDI said her company had operated its business in an appropriate manner and followed guidelines. A Softbank spokesman also said it would work with regulators. “Up to now we have never had any issues with competition laws over our sales practices and pricing,” he said. Samsung declined to comment.

CNN hires director of mobile and off-platform Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) By Benjamin Mullin • September 23, 2016 In further evidence of the growing importance of platforms like Facebook, Apple News, Twitter and Snapchat, CNN has added a director of mobile and off-platform to its growing programming team. Marcus Mabry, who ran Twitter Moments for U.S. and Canadian audiences, will oversee CNN's mobile and off-platform efforts, including those on Apple News and Amazon Echo. Christina Cuesta Kline, deputy editor on The Wall Street Journal's mobile editorial team, will also join CNN, as senior editor for mobile. Both additions are part of an effort on CNN's part to coordinate its coverage on a variety of mediums untethered from its broadcast operation. The team, which was recently profiled in Digiday, has dozens of members and reports to Mitra Kalita, CNN's vice president of digital programming and a former managing editor at the Los Angeles Times. The creation of the team is part of an industry-wide shift toward distributed media, the creation of journalism published natively on many platforms. Here's the memo, which Kalita sent to colleagues at CNN: Colleagues, I am so pleased to announce the new leadership of CNN’s mobile and off-platform team. Marcus Mabry is our new director and starts Sept. 29. Christina Cuesta Kline will be our senior editor for mobile, joining us Oct. 4. Both will be based in New York City. Having a director of mobile and off-platform is a bit like having a director of everything. Thankfully, Marcus Mabry has done everything. He comes to us after a year at Twitter (@MarcusMabry), where he ran the Moments product for U.S. and Canadian audiences. Prior, he launched The New York Times’ Watching section, which highlighted noteworthy stories from around the internet. His other roles at the Times included video anchor, business editor and national editor. Before joining The Times,Marcus worked at Newsweek in a number of roles, including stints in Paris, London and Johannesburg. Marcus graduated from Stanford and speaks fluent French. He’s past president of the Overseas Press Club of America, on the board of the Lawrenceville School and the author of two books, one on Condoleezza Rice, and another on black America. Christina (@CuestaKline) joins us from The Wall Street Journal, where she served as deputy editor on the mobile editorial team. She managed standards for mobile, oversaw app launches and relaunches, and worked with editors and developers across the newsroom to improve mobile storytelling. It is common knowledge in the Journal newsroom that if you want something done, you go to Christina. This is a banner year for CNN, and mobile is already a huge part of that. Mobile makes up a growing majority of weekday traffic and can reach 80% on weekends. We are in the enviable position of offering audiences both first and second-screen experiences; our app and news alerts reach 50 million people every day; countless more find us via social media and off-platform products such as Apple News and Amazon Echo (aka “Alexa, tell me the news”). We’re off to a strong start -- with lots more to do. We are so lucky to have Marcus and Christina to lead our efforts in this vital, growing, innovative space. In coming weeks, we will outline more additions to our programming team and ways we can collaborate to help our stories reach more people, have more impact and, together, commit better and smarter journalism. Thank you for your support and a warm welcome to our new colleagues. Best, Mitra Correction: A previous version of this story said CNN's digital programming team is slated to have 18 employees. In fact, it has dozens of staffers. What to read next AUTHOR INFORMATION Benjamin Mullin Benjamin Mullin is the managing editor of Poynter.org.

You're obviously not the target consumer for the product. I can not wait to receive mine.

The hardware and software is identical to the regular apple watch; you want access to that, just buy one of those. For a certain clientele who will be frequenting a store like Barney's, Bergdorf's, or the Hermes store, a few thousand dollars is milk money. And that's okay; it's not your money, so it's not your place to judge who gets to buy what. If that were a thing, couture, art, high end dining, niche fashion, luxury housing, boutique hotel, etc. would not be viable markets, but they are. I'm not planning on buying one of these Hermes watches, but a normal human reaction is to understand that there are people for whom 1) they are aethetically pleasing (which they are, 2) offer them a functionality they appreciate (i.e. the same that the cheaper watches offer, and 3) a small bump in price is reasonable to them. These straps are iconic Hermes designs dating back many decades, and to be able to offer that in CONJUNCTION with modern technology is a beautiful synthesis of aesthetic, fashion tradition, brand, and tech. As for Hermes as a brand, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but their classic designs are iconic (watch straps, Birkin bag, scarves) and of high quality. Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, Ralph Lauren, Coach, Michael Kors it is not. Materials, stitching, handiwork, and legacy are vital to their brand, and yes, the price reflects that.

Rating: 7 Votes macduke 8 weeks ago So people spend the extra money for the custom watch face? Because you'd be better off just buying the Watch Series 2 for $549 + Hermes Band for $339 on the Apple Store website. That's only $888 vs the $1199 Apple charges for them bundled together with the watch face. Is the watch face worth $311? Rating: 6 Votes Steve121178 8 weeks ago A rip off for what they are.

The report, which cites sources familiar with the matter, also says that the device includes built-in cameras capable of distinguishing between users and even detecting their emotions, which would corroborate a CNET report from​ earlier this year. The device is reportedly designed to function similarly to the Amazon Echo, a voice-activated smart home speaker that showcases the online retailer's virtual assistant, Alexa. With simple voice commands, Alexa and the Echo can stream music, answer questions, run optional voice apps called "skills," and control smart home devices. Apple's device would obviously feature Siri, and Bloomberg reports that the Cupertino company is hard at work on improving her conversational intelligence to fill a larger role in the home. Dedicated voice controls for Apple Music and for devices designed to work with HomeKit, Apple's smart home platform, both seem like very safe bets. Phone-based interactions that would let the speaker read off things like emails, text messages and tweets are also reportedly in the works. As for the inclusion of cameras that can recognize your face and read your emotions, Bloomberg reports that they're featured in "some" of the prototypes currently being tested, and points to Apple's recent acquisitions of companies that specialize in facial recognition. If the cameras end up making the final cut, they could help to differentiate the device from the Echo and from the Google Home, another smart home speaker currently making its way to retail.

Follow TechnoBuffalo A report from Bloomberg this morning discussed a few of Apple’s current projects, including its Amazon Echo competitor and a new “Invisible Hand” initiative. Invisible Hand, Bloomberg explained, is Apple’s Minority Report plan to try to allow users to fully control their mobile devices, such as iPads and the iPhone, using voice commands. There would be no need for touch, it seems, and the goal is to get this project off the ground and rolled out to users within 3 years. This is some pretty futuristic stuff. “For example, a user would be able to ask their phone to open a web page and then share it with a friend without the need to ever launch the Siri interface.” Bloomberg discusses a few other scenarios, but the idea is that you’ll be able to have complete control over your device. As it stands, Siri can understand a lot of commands, but it still feels very much like a voice-powered search engine/assistant rather than a voice-controlled computer. Siri received a lot of improvements in iOS 10 but, as we know, she still has a long way to go. Bloomberg didn’t mention if Apple will try to build this functionality into macOS on its laptops, either. Siri made her Mac debut in the macOS Sierra release earlier this week.

After two years of research and development, the Apple device is said to be in prototype testing, but because Apple hasn't officially finalized any plans it "could still scrap the project." Similar to Echo, the Siri device is said to be able to control smart home accessories like lights, locks, and curtains all through voice activation, and would most notably be the first new piece of Apple hardware introduced since the Apple Watch, and the iPad before that. To compete with Amazon -- and Google's own similar device called "Google Home" -- Apple will introduce "more advanced microphone and speaker technology," according to people close to the project. This could potentially include an ecosystem-wide upgrade to Siri's current functionality. Beyond the home device, Apple is researching new ways to improve Siri on iPhones and iPads, two people said. With an initiative code-named “Invisible Hand,” Apple hopes to give users the ability to fully control their devices through a Siri command system within three years, one of the people added. Currently, the voice assistant is able to respond to commands within its application, but Apple’s goal is for Siri to be able to control the entire system without having to open an app or reactivate Siri. For example, a user would be able to ask their iPhone to open a web page and then share it with a friend without the need to ever launch the Siri interface. Other examples from Apple’s current research include being able to print a PDF by speaking “print” while reading it or saying “help” in order for the system to help the user navigate a particular task or application. Apple has also been researching opening this ability to third-party apps, the person said. A few prototypes in testing are said to include technology related to facial recognition, potentially fueled by Apple's acquisition of Faceshift and Emotient, "which may help the device act based on who is in a room or a person’s emotional state." Otherwise, the device will be able to perform all of the Siri actions expected of the personal assistant, including responding to text messages, playing music, searching the internet, and more. Apple Maps integration is a possibility, which Apple is considering so Siri could alert you exactly when to leave the house for an appointment. Before it moved to a standalone speaker unit, Apple considered introducing Siri into a voice-activated feature on the new Apple TV, but the company decided on a more reliable button addition to the Apple TV remote over shouting commands across a room to activate Siri. In its original testing in 2014, Apple crafted a small and a large version of the Siri speaker, said to be like the Amazon Echo and Amazon Echo Dot, "but those early efforts may not translate into a final product." The prototype phase has advanced to the point of Apple engineers testing the device in their own homes, according to the individuals with knowledge of the project. As Bloomberg pointed out, while this is not an exact measure of when the Siri speaker might launch, Apple CEO Tim Cook was known to test out the original iPad at his home "for roughly six months before its introduction." Apple employees also tested out the fourth-generation Apple TV about a year before its launch in 2015. Ultimately, the Siri speaker is described as a way for Apple to "augment the iPhone," and drive sales for the company's devices following a year where it faced dwindling returns for its iPhone line. Its most recent device launches for the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and Apple Watch Series 2 have all faced the expected initial shortages most Apple products encounter in their first few weeks on the market, but Apple has chosen not to reveal first weekend sales numbers for the iPhone 7 because it feels the results are "no longer a representative metric" due to demand outweighing supply.

As for the quote: "Ultimately, the Siri speaker is described as a way for Apple to "augment the iPhone," and drive sales for the company's devices following a year where it faced dwindling returns for its iPhone line." The best way to face dwindling returns on the iPhone line could easily be resolved by introducing an ALL-NEW iPhone, in all three sizes 4-inch, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes, dropping the protruding camera and finally dropping the antenna lines.

People aren't buying phones as often because the phones now are really good and the leaps in technology improvements are less and less. Also a lot of Apple's iPhone growth was due to new markets, new carriers coming on board. That also is slowing down. None of that has to do with aesthetics.

My iPhone already has always on "hey siri" and I barely ever use it (mainly becasue siri requires me to look at the screen) With my Echo I don't have to think about "hey where is my iPhone" or pull it out of my pocket where it is located 90% of the time, it is just there, in the same spot, waiting for commands (And responding to them with complete voice replies - ask for the weather and you hear the forecast, not "It looks nice today! - Look at the screen" Having no screen sounds like a downside to echo, but it is actually the biggest upside. I don't have to look at anything, I can just keep to what I am doing while I add things to my todo list or tell it to turn on the TV or lights. Siri will need a major upgrade to actually be useful in this context.

So it's a bit of a buzz-kill when no one notices you've got one. The iPhone 7 is a joy to use. Apple's hardware and software work in harmony, meaning switching between apps is a breeze - and it doesn't feel "glitchy" in the way some Android phones can. It also has several nice enhancements like water-resistance , a faster processor, a more powerful "Taptic" engine, and a better camera. But when it comes down to it, does the iPhone 7 give Apple fans enough of an incentive to upgrade? Here's my verdict on the new iPhone 7. Design From a design point of view, it really is hard to tell the difference between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 6s, which launched in 2015. They are almost identical in size and shape - the iPhone 7 is actually 5 grams lighter than the 6s, but it's not enough to make a noticeable difference in your hand. Read More iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6s specs: Which of Apple's smartphones should you buy? The plastic antenna lines on the back of the phone have been redesigned, so there is only a single line along the top and bottom of the rear case, rather than a double line. On the black and jet black models, these are almost invisible against the aluminium case, but the white lines still stand out on the silver, gold and rose gold models. The rear camera lens is slightly enlarged, and the aluminium slopes up slightly to meet the glass. This is a change from the shiny rim around the iPhone 6s camera - but you would probably have to have the two handsets side-by-side to notice it. Finally, the headphone port has been removed from the bottom of the phone and replaced with an extra speaker grill. Read More Surge in sales of second-hand iPhone models following iPhone 7 launch Given that most iPhone owners keep their devices in a case to prevent them from getting scratched, the likelihood of anyone noticing you have an iPhone 7 rather than a 6s - or even a 6 - is pretty low. Having said that, the slim frame and curved edges are still as attractive as ever, and many would argue that if something ain't broke, don't fix it. Buy the iPhone 7 now from Apple No headphone socket Yes, it's true. The 3.5mm headphone socket is gone - meaning you either have to use wireless headphones to listen to music and podcasts, or plug your wired headphones into the iPhone 7's charging port. This is undoubtedly Apple's most controversial update - the headphone socket that has been around since the days of the Sony Walkman. However, it's not actually as terrible as it sounds. The biggest disadvantage is that you can't charge your iPhone 7 and listen to music at the same time - at least not without buying a £35 adapter. That is irritating. Read More How much does the iPhone 7 cost to make? Tech teardown reveals real price of costly gadget However, Apple does include a pair of headphones in the box, with a Lightning connector that plugs straight into the charging port. There is also a headphone-jack-to-Lightning-port adaptor, so you can still use your old headphones with the iPhone 7 if you're particularly attached to them. Many have pointed out that the adaptor is small and easy to lose, which is true. But I found that, by leaving the adaptor attached to my headphone cable, you can avoid losing it. There is no noticeable degradation in quality from using the adaptor, so if you've forked out for expensive audio equipment, you shouldn't notice a difference. While the loss of the headphone jack isn't as awful as it first appears, you've got to ask what has been gained. Read More iPhone 7 Plus review: It feels like an iterative update While Apple claims that it has freed up extra space inside the device, the iPhone 7 isn't any smaller or thinner as a result, and there is still only one speaker along the bottom of the device. The Taptic engine, which provides haptic feedback, is slightly bigger in the iPhone 7 according to Apple, but I'm not convinced it's worthwhile exchange. Buy the iPhone 7 now from Carphone Warehouse Home button One thing that does take a bit of getting used to on the iPhone 7 is the new Home button. Unlike previous models, which have clickable buttons, the iPhone 7 has what Apple calls a "solid state" Home button, which means it doesn't actually move when you press it. However, it is pressure sensitive, and the Taptic engine inside the phone provides haptic feedback when you press it, so it feels almost like a real button. Part of the reason for this change is to improve the water-resistance of the phone. Sealing off the tiny gap between the button and the front panel of the phone prevents water getting inside and frying the electrical components. However, it's worth noting that the new button is capacitive, like the touchscreen, so it requires skin contact to work. That means, if you try to press it with a nail, or when you are wearing gloves, it simply won't respond . Read More iPhone 7 colours: Apple adds new 'Jet Black' shade to iPhone lineup Apple has also added haptic feedback to a number of its applications, so if you want to set an alarm, for example, it will create a clicking sensation as you scroll through numbers and minutes. Water-resistance There's been a lot of debate about whether the iPhone 7 is waterproof or water-resistant. Technically, the device is only water-resistant, but it can withstand a lot more water than most people seem to think. The iPhone 7 has a classification known as IP67, which means it can be submerged in water to a depth of roughly 1 metre for up to 30 minutes. So it will survive a dip in the sink or down the loo, and it won't break if you pour a drink over it, but you probably don't want to take it swimming. In my tests, the iPhone 7 was completely unfazed by having tea spilt on it, being run under the tap, and even being submerged in a jug of water. Of course, smartphone rivals like Samsung have been making waterproof phones for years, but for Apple fans - especially those prone to clumsiness - this could be one of the biggest selling points of the iPhone 7. Camera Apple has made a lot of noise about the dual camera on the iPhone 7 Plus, which offers optical zoom and will eventually let you create a bokah effect, where the foreground is in focus and the background is blurry. Sadly the smaller iPhone 7 only has the one camera on the rear - and it's got a 12 megapixel lens, just like the iPhone 6s' camera. However, there are some background enhancements that allow the iPhone 7 to capture slightly better photos - particularly in low light conditions. These include optical image stabilisation, which was previously only a feature of the plus-size iPhone 6s, a larger ƒ/1.8 aperture, which lets 50% more light onto the sensor, a six-element lens and a quad-LED flash. Read More The best time to buy the iPhone 7 is SIX weeks after launch - and here's why These should theoretically result in brighter, more detailed photos and videos, and a wide colour capture for more vibrant colours in photos with more detail. In my tests, there was a noticeable difference between photos taken with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7. While the colours in the 6s actually appeared to be more vibrant, the iPhone 7 captured a lot more detail in the darker areas of the picture: iPhone 6s (L) and iPhone 7 (R) iPhone 6s (L) and iPhone 7 (R) In low light conditions, the the iPhone 7 undoubtedly performed better, with colours and details appearing much more clearly: iPhone 6s (L) and iPhone 7 (R) The differences may seem small, but if you take most of your pictures on nights out or in the evenings, you will appreciate the iPhone 7's ability to capture more detail. Of course, the iPhone 7 also has a 7 megapixel selfie camera - an upgrade from 5 megapixels on the iPhone 6s - with auto image stabilisation, wide colour capture and Full HD video recording. That means your Snapchats will be sharper and more colourful than ever. Display and speakers Another thing that hasn't changed is the screen size and resolution. Just like the iPhone 6s, the iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch display with a 1,334 x 750 resolution. The iPhone 7's a display supposedly has a 25% brighter display, and a wider colour gamut for greater colour saturation. However, you'd be hard pushed to notice much difference. If anything, the iPhone 6s screen appeared slightly brighter to me. Suffice to say, you won't be disappointed by the display on the iPhone 7. It's bright and clear and just what you'd expect from a high-end smartphone. The speaker system is slightly more impressive. The iPhone 7 features stereo speakers - one at the top of the device and one at the bottom. This means it is twice as loud as the iPhone 6s, and also offers an increased "dynamic range" of sound - in other words the two speakers can play slightly different things to give a more rounded effect. The uses of this are fairly limited. Most people will use headphones or connect their phone to speakers if they want to listen to music. But if blasting music out in the park or at the back of the bus is your thing, then the iPhone 7 will certainly do the trick. Power and battery life Apple claims its A10 Fusion chip is the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone, and it certainly is zippy. Opening and closing apps is almost instantaneous, and the iPhone 7 has no problem at all rendering graphics-intensive mobile games. It's efficient too, according to Apple. The chip has twice the number of cores as the A9 chip in the iPhone 6s - two "high-performance" cores and two "high-efficiency" cores. That means that all the little tasks that run in the background, such as music playback, message updates and file synchronisation, can run on the "high-efficiency" cores without compromising peak performance. This has a knock-on effect on battery life, which Apple claims last up to two hours longer than iPhone 6s. I didn't attempt to test this scientifically, but the iPhone 7 has no problem getting through a 16-hour day of steady use. Other reviewers have claimed that the iPhone 7's battery lasts about an hour and a half longer than the iPhone 6s. iOS 10 If you've used iPhones before, iOS 10 won't come as too much of a shock. It's laid out in pretty much the same way as previous versions of iOS, with just a few minor changes. However, there are a couple of new features worth mentioning. The biggest visual change is the new notifications and quick reply features. These mean you no longer have to open an app to view videos, photos and reply - all you have to do is tap on a notification or "force press" it to bring up a preview. The lockscreen has been made more useful, allowing you to view your latest notifications by swiping down, or Siri suggestions by swiping right, without unlocking the phone. Read More iPhone users are loving iOS 10 for one new feature they've 'waited whole lives for' The new "raise to wake" feature means your iPhone 7 will light up when you pick it up, making accessing notifications easier without accidentally unlocking your phone with a home button press. There are some fun new features in the Messages app - such as invisible ink, emoji predictions and handwritten notes, which may just entice you away from WhatsApp - although they only work in messages to other iPhone users. Photos and Maps have also been given a revamp, and 3D touch has been built into more apps, allowing you to force press on an app icon to bring up shortcut options. Verdict The iPhone 7 is undoubtedly an evolution rather than a revolution. It represents two years of refinements and tweaks, building on the design first unveiled by Apple in 2014. If you already have an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, it could be hard to justify the upgrade. You could download iOS 10 onto one of these phones and have an almost identical user experience. Having said that, the addition of water-resistance is a very attractive feature, and for those who want to be able to capture the best possible photos with a smartphone, this is certainly a top contender.

The big question is whether you want to fork out £599 or more for the iPhone 7, or hold out for next year's model, thought to be called the iPhone 8, which by all accounts will see a major redesign of Apple's iconic smartphone.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | September 23, 2016 -- 13:11 GMT (06:11 PDT) | Topic: iOS Uncover some of the cool new features hidden in iOS 10. Here is a quick rundown of some of the new features contained in the new iOS 10 update that you might have missed. While most of these should be available on all devices that support iOS 10, some will only be available on newer devices. Allow selected contacts to bypass Do Not Disturb more iphone news iPhone 7 Plus hands-on: A weekend full of adjustments iPhone 7: Best LCD display ever tested CR: iPhone 7 camera does not outperform iPhone 6s Scratch test raises serious durability concerns Apple's supply pinch: Smart marketing or forecasting? iPhone 7 sales may reach 100m in 2016 due to Note 7 recal l The VIP system for allowing selected contacts to still call you have been improved dramatically in iOS 10. Now you can pick out contacts that can make your phone ring individually. Go into Contacts, find the contact you want to be able to get through to you no matter what, click Edit and then you can set the ringtone and text tone to Emergency Bypass On. Dude, where's my car? Fire up Apple Maps to find where you parked your car. If it's not immediately obvious from the little car icon on the map, you can search for Parked car. Send smaller photos in iMessage Go to Settings > Messages and enable Low Quality Image Mode. If you send a lot of photos and you're either having poor signal or you're not on an unlimited data plan, this can be really helpful. Time for bed This is a weird feature that people will either love or hate. If you're the sort of person who likes to have a certain number of hours of sleep before your alarm goes off, you can now have your iPhone remind you to go to bed. (I know, how did we manage before such things?). To enable this feature open the Clock app and tap Bedtime. Prioritize app installations If you're recovering your iPhone or installing multiple apps, you can control which are installed first by doing a long press on any app waiting to be downloaded on the home screen and tapping the Prioritize Download option. This requires a device with 3D Touch. Better iMessage read receipts Now you can set your read receipt preferences by clicking on the I found at the top-right of iMessage window, then turn read receipts on or off. This setting syncs across all your devices. Find your Apple Watch I know a lot of people requested this feature, and now it's present as part of Find My iPhone. Make Unlock work the way it used to Apple's tweaked the way you unlock you iPhone with the Touch ID sensor, but if this new feature annoys you there is a way to make it work like it did in iOS 9. Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Home Button and enable Rest Finger to Open. Delete those undeletable apps Apple's own apps used to be a fixed feature, and the best you could do was hide them from view. But now you can delete apps such as Main, Stocks and Weather just like you'd delete any other app (and if you change your mind, they're in the App Store). Bright lights! You can now alter the brightness of the flashlight by using a long press on the flashlight icon in Control Center to choose between Bright Light, Medium Light, and Low Light. This requires a device with 3D Touch. Get to the camera - Fast! The icon might be gone, but you can still get to the camera from the lock screen. All you need to do is swipe left. Search your photos From Memories in the Photos app you can search for photos containing particular objects. This is also quite spookily accurate. Emojify everything! The Messages app now highlights words that you can turn into emojis. Handy, but if overused it can make a message almost impossible to understand. Easy unsubscribe Mail automatically floats unsubscribe links from mailing list emails to the top, so you can find them easily. Save on storage space If you're low on space you can get iOS 10 to remove music you've not listened to in a while by going Settings > Music > Optimize Storage and enabling Optimize Storage.

Apple caused controversy when announcing the iPhone 7 when it revealed the new devices would no longer have a headphone jack, instead asking customers to connect headphones via the Lightning connector, or use wireless headsets. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Now YouTuber TeckRax has uploaded a video with the title 'Secret Hack to Get Headphone Jack on the iPhone 7'. It has almost 8 million views so far. The description says: "This video is for those who don't want to get $159 wireless airpods or have to insert your headphones into an adapter every time you listen to music. " And while many of the comments are from users trolling or playing along with the gag it appears that some YouTube users may have fallen for the prank. Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller said ditching the 50-year-old jack came down to "courage to move on to something new". Whether or not removing the jack is courageous on Apple's part is open to debate but trying to add one by drilling a hole in the smartphone is anything but.  Some YouTube users have claimed they tried the drilling 'upgrade' with miserable results Online Editors Related Content iPhone 'effective power' bug: iPads, Macs and Apple Watches also at risk of crashing Your Comments COMMENT RULES: Comments that are judged to be defamatory, abusive or in bad taste are not acceptable and contributors who consistently fall below certain criteria will be permanently blacklisted.

Examples mentioned were controversial, and, in hindsight, all have proven sound judgments, but none of those decisions have caused the sort of uproar that’s surrounded the firm’s move to ditch 3.5mm headphone sockets from its new iPhone range. Read More How much does the iPhone 7 cost to make? Tech teardown reveals real price of costly gadget During the unveiling earlier this month, Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller, declared the move as “brave”, citing the rise in use and improvements of Bluetooth headphones as a prime factor. While a fair point – even hardened audiophiles have started to accept wireless as being the way to go – had Apple talked up some more of the gains of losing the socket, they might not have perhaps copped so much “if ain’t broke”-flavoured flak.

Alongside a regular sensor, a new second telephoto lens allows for true optical zoom. Read More Apple's iPhone 8 logo revealed? Trademark filing shows possible symbol for next gadget It’s not the first time we’ve seen this – the most notable examples being Huawei’s recent P9 and the LG G5. But the execution and results delivered here place Apple’s attempts above the competition. Clicking the onscreen 2x button in the camera app deftly switches between the two lenses, bringing you closer to your subject without the noise you’d normally get with a digital zoom. While the telephoto does deliver ever so slightly softer images than the regular lens, it’s still impressive and a feature I found myself using for framing regular shots time and time again.

Phil Schiller discusses the depth of field and bokeh effects in the iPhone 7 Plus (Photo: REUTERS) Probably the biggest criticism of its predecessor’s camera was its low light performance. While the improved f/1.8 aperture on the regular lens does make for better nighttime shots, to my eyes it’s not as dramatic a leap to put it on a par with Samsung’s S7 Edge.

The force feedback engine has also been overhauled throughout, with little clicks and buzzes registering more noticeably when making menu selections, resulting in a much more tactile feel. Despite the internal space saving, the 7 Plus has an almost identical footprint to its predecessor. The body design also remains very similar, with its large bezel framing around the top and bottom of the 5.5in screen, ensuring it remains one of the biggest devices of its type.

Read More Apple's iPhone 7 has one major drawback if you live in a cold climate While it’s a surprise to still not see a 4K resolution screen on a flagship device, there’s a very noticeable boost to brightness and a much wider colour gamut that arguably has more of a positive impact on the overall viewing experience. Elsewhere, there’s a small, but not insignificant improvement in battery life, with a few extra hours eked out, something I would have been used to with the 6S Plus. The extra horsepower of the new A10 Fusion processor was less noticeable with day-to-day tasks, apart from a palpable, much nippier response from the camera. The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 5Se running iOS 10 (Photo: Apple) For those still wishing to remain wired, a Lightning port to headphone jack dongle is provided.

No longer are we confined to the limited emotional range of emoji (I still love you, thinking face emoji), when we now have a dabbing Binky or retro pixel pokémon to express ourselves with. Inspired by all the wacky sticker packs available on the Messages App Store, I decided I wanted to make my own. How hard could it be? After about three days of confusion and minimal crying, I'm thrilled to announce that my first app ever is now available on the iMessage App Store! You can use the As Per Usual sticker pack to express that relatable feeling when you're listening to music on a train pretending to be in a music video, or to bully your friends by slapping multiple stickers on top of their messages. I'm here to share the process of how a joker like me with no coding experience got an app on the App Store. It took a lot of gumption and Googling but I persevered, and you can, too! 1. Make a developer account You'll have to pay Apple $100 / year for this, but just cough up the money with the naive yet optimistic hopes that you'll break even! 2. Download Xcode 8 Honestly, the hardest part of this whole ordeal was making room for enough storage to download Xcode. Also, make sure your OS is updated to at least El Capitan or higher to run Xcode 8. 3. Make your stickers This is the fun part! For sticker sizes, you have a choice of three different image dimensions, as shown below from Apple's iOS Guidelines. The guidelines suggest things like adding "vitality through animations" that you "consider using vibrant colors and transparency." Just make sure the images don't exceed 500KB, aren't depicting anything you wouldn't want your mother to see or contain anything you could possibly be sued for, and you're good! Developer.apple.com 5. Upload your stickers to Xcode Apple has a nice step-by-step video tutorial for getting set up in Xcode and adding your stickers. It's really just as simple as dragging your folder of stickers into the interface. 6. Create your App icon This is definitely the most time-consuming and annoying part. Once you've designed the App Store icon you want to represent your app, you have to resize it into a bunch of different size requirements. Apple has icon templates available for download here, but I have no idea how to use layer masks so I just made my own. That's about the exact skill level you need to get stickers on to the App Store! 7. Sign into iTunes Connect and fill out all the administrative stuff because you need to get money, get paid iTunes Connect is where you'll write your app description, upload preview images, and decide how much to charge for your app. This is also where you'll put down your bank and tax information, if you're making a paid application. 8. Upload your build to iTunes Connect and submit your app! You can do this through Xcode or Application Launcher. Once you've uploaded the build, check to make sure all the app information is ready, and send it off for review! 9. Test your app While your app is undergoing review for approval, you can send out test invitations through TestFlight. Just add your testers' iTunes email to iTunes Connect and they'll receive an invitation to try out your stickers for 60 days. And that's it! It took me a weekend to make and exactly 5 days after submission to get my sticker pack approved, but the satisfaction of feeling like a hackerman will last a lifetime.

(AAPL) Hissgate, Home button woes and now reports of poor audio on phone calls: The list of iPhone 7 issues keeps growing Sep 23, 2016, 8:52 am EST  |  By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor     Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have been in stores for one week now, and it has been a roller-coaster ride — for the phones’ reputation and Apple stock alike — ever since. First the iPhone 7s were dismissed as being dull incremental updates. Then they were surprisingly good. But as consumers got their hands on them, iPhone 7 issues started popping up, and now the list keeps growing. The latest is a complaint that phone-call sound quality is distorted. Source: Apple Is the iPhone 7 losing its unexpected shine already? iPhone 7 Surprised Many The early expectations for the iPhone 7 weren’t great. The new iPhone looked almost identical to the old one and the one before that. All the cool stuff — a curved OLED screen and no buttons at all on the front — was on hold for the iPhone 8. And there was considerable anger over the decision to ax the headphone jack. But as reviewers got their hands on the new iPhone, the narrative began to change. Facebook Overestimated a Critical Video Metric for Years (FB) Subtle tweaks Apple made to the iPhone 7, like re-routing the antenna band to make it less obvious, added up. The new Jet Black finish option was gorgeous. And with the Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxy Note exploding battery crisis, maybe Apple was right to have kept a proven design rather than to take risks by pushing the envelope. The water resistance worked even better than expected. The display was a work of art even if it was just LCD. The A10 Fusion CPU was a performance monster, and the dual-camera optical zoom of the iPhone 7 Plus was pushing out some incredible images when given to pro photographers. Add in the boosted base storage — 32GB up from 16GB — and the iPhone 7 was turning into a sleeper hit. The List of iPhone 7 Issues is Adding Up However, in the week since actual consumers got their hands on the new iPhone, the list of complaints has been growing. Most are minor issues, but many are the sort of thing you simply wouldn’t expect from Apple. Among the iPhone 7 issues currently being tracked: Extreme and excessive scratching of the Jet Black version. New solid state Home button complaints that “Taptic Engine” feels unnatural, and the button doesn’t work with many touch-enabled winter gloves and protective cases. Consumer Reports releases test results of iPhone 7 camera, says “So far, we’ve found no major leap in camera performance from the iPhone 6s models.” Lightning EarPods remote failing with the iPhone 7. Reports that some iPhone 7 Plus owners are experiencing loud hissing noises from their smartphone — also known as “Hissgate.” And the latest, which started popping up on user forums over the past few days: Some iPhone 7 users are experiencing poor or distorted audio when taking voice calls. Yes, people do still use smartphones for making calls, so this is a problem. Did Apple Drop the Ball Despite Playing It Safe? None of these iPhone 7 issues is anywhere near the severity of those exploding Galaxy Notes. Most of the technical issues like the hissing affect a relatively small number of users and only under specific circumstances. The scratchy finish? Apple did warn buyers up front that the Jet Black scratches easily. The camera testing is refuted by many professional photographers, and even Consumer Reports admitted the iPhone 7 Plus scored a noticeable zoom improvement with that second lens. The reality is what looks like playing it safe with the iPhone 7 actually involved some very significant technical leaps by Apple. The A10 Fusion CPU is the company’s first move to a quad-core processor in an iPhone. The Home button is step one in eliminating the button altogether. The dual-camera system is expected to kickstart the feature in smartphones in general. Overall, though, there’s a growing sense that AAPL is slipping when it comes to quality control. The “old” Apple probably wouldn’t have released an iPhone that can become very noticeably and permanently marred after one day of use. It would have caught the EarPods that keep crapping out, especially given the sensitivity over forcing people to go the Lighting route instead of the headphone jack. Perhaps worse, the growing list of issues has the potential to take the shine off the iPhone 7 and even slow its sales. Bottom Line There are two major takeaways for the company and Apple stock holders out of this past week: First, Apple needs to get on top of the issues. Replace any defective iPhones, nail the cause and fix any related components or production issues.  Second, it needs to learn from the iPhone 7 launch and double down on quality control for the iPhone 8. Apple Inc. (AAPL): McClaren Would Be a Good Fit for Apple Car This year, with low expectations and a flailing rival in the background, Apple got a break. But if the iPhone 8 has a similar list of woes, 2017 will be an iPhone 10th anniversary that Apple won’t much enjoy celebrating. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. More From InvestorPlace 10 Stocks That Should Be in Your Portfolio Right Now Apple Inc.

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear Analyst Says iPhone SE Was a One-Off for Apple View All Editorials → Apple Hates Music Lovers Who Want to Own Their Music John Kheit Sep 23rd, 2016 9:00 AM EST | Devil's Advocate So Apple upgraded the Music App in iOS 10. It still sucks. And a lot. Apparently Apple feels that changing the font size to be bigger qualifies as UI redesign. Another ‘upgrade’ is that Apple removed the star ratings on your music. You know, the ratings that you’ve spent years and years adding. Just gone. You can still ask Siri to set a rating by saying “Siri rate this song three stars.” But you can no longer see them. Tapping on the album art to show the star rating now does a sum total of nothing. So they actually had to work to remove that code. And why not add star ratings to the ellipsis “…” option? iOS 10 Music Rating Mockup iCloud Music Turned Off Why do these things? Because Apple hates you and your carefully curated music collection and wants to end it. What else explains Apple letting iTunes become a serial murdering music library terrorist? Apple tries to kill your music at every turn to sell its crapfest Apple Music service. The company prefers that you all comply and rent the same music rather than owning and having different music. And you know it’s only a matter of time. You’ll spend years curating your own music playlists on Apple Music, and at some point Apple will randomly pull music tracks from your playlists. For those who disagree that can happen, give me a holler via Ping. It’s certainly happened on other services getting Zoom’d, and considering Apple’s constant attack on my music collection, I don’t put it above the company. For example, I do not have Apple Music. I’ve turned off iCloud Music Library (see the first image below). Yet, I still have mysterious download cloud icons in my music collection (see the second image below). It’s constantly downloading crap I don’t want into my library. iCloud Music Turned Off iOS 10 Music Cloud Downloads Crimes Against UI Which gets to the bigger problem of Apple UI design going into the toilet. It’s gone down hill since Jonny Ive took over. Perhaps it’s coincidence and correlation. Perhaps it’s causative. But regardless, it’s gone into the toilet. Here’s a hint, changing font types and sizes is not UI design. What’s worse, it’s clear Apple gave the job of maintaining iTunes.app to just one dude, probably stuck in a closet clutching a red stapler. And Apple is so busy patting itself on the back for the moribund purchase of Beats and integrating that crap show virus into iTunes that it didn’t bother to notice it’s destroyed iTunes in the process. Does Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre have some blackmail on Tim Cook and Eddy Cue? They’re acting like a couple of geeks wanting to get in with the jock/cool crew in high school. I cannot explain their fawning blindness to the crapshow that Beats has created with iTunes and management’s inability to call a horrid product out to the shed and do what’s needed. You know that’s what Steve Jobs would have done. What Would Steve Do? And F’ everyone that has a problem with talking about what Steve Jobs would do. People at Apple need to start seriously thinking about what Steve would have done. Yeah yeah, I know he told Tim Cook not to, but he also told us we wouldn’t have an iPod with video. Not to mention, Apple set up an entire university internally to basically teach what Steve did. So stop with the cognitive dissidence already. Wise up. Be more like Jobs. Pay attention to details and the big picture. They are often related.

September 23, 2016 at 9:32 EST AM Jamie September 23, 2016 No, John has been wtiting here for many, many years, before there was Apple Music or even an iPhone. It’s a shame that we live in an era when having an opinion is viewed as something negative. I weep for society in the 21st century. I also happen to agree, though for different reasons. We can’t live in a world where corporations own everything and just grant us occasional and temporary access. If you want to see where that road leads, look no further than Mao, Pol Pot, or Kim Jong Un or Hitler or Communist Russia or China. Thinking that these companies are your ‘friend’ or ‘on your side’ is going to be one of the biggest mistakes our younger generation ever makes. September 23, 2016 at 9:40 EST AM dlstarr7 September 23, 2016 –rolls eyes– September 23, 2016 at 10:40 EST AM geoduck September 23, 2016 I may not agree with his taste in music, but I agree with his opinion. iTunes is the biggest reason I use OTHER streaming services, OTHER music sources, OTHER music players. Actually iTunes is also the reason I’ve been renting less movies from Apple too. September 23, 2016 at 10:48 EST AM SupriseSalad September 23, 2016 Why on earth do you still use iTunes? You have good observations and points but reading that through all the venom you are spiting is insane. For most people apple music is good enough. And apple makes money from people using it. Why are you surprised that they optimise their software for apple music and making money? isn’t that what company’s do? September 23, 2016 at 10:55 EST AM NotTellingYou September 23, 2016 Ok…please understand my view here…I’m a software product manager and have worked on software you have or do use and at companies you are likely a customer of, so my lens on this is different. First let me say these types of articles are important and there’s for sure valid issues and concerns that can and perhaps should be addressed in future releases. That said what really grinds my drive heads is the arrogance and hubris many authors display especially in the areas of UI/UX. These opinions are like…everyone has one. In this case the “larger text”, and some other changes, were added to address user concerns with the small touch points previously when operating the app in the car or during some other activity. Do Iike the result? Meh! I think I could have advocated for something more Car Play like as an optional UI but I don’t have to deal with everything it takes nor do I understand the deeper foundational things that can prevent or slow things. Instead of complaining in a rant where I make wild assumptions and false representations and claims I wrote, what I hope, was a thoughtful note to the apps Product Manager at Apple expressing some thoughts and suggestions. I don’t expect him to act on it but I do hope he keeps them in mind. My ideas and my UI/UX desires are mine alone and no more valid than anyone else’s. It’s easy to rant get get others, who are also frustrated in some way, to jump on your bandwagon! Problem is when you get passed all that and start to talk specifics you’ll likely find your agreement is no more and you’re again standing alone. Something more people should keep in mind! For me the solution to all this silliness was to LEARN how everything worked and retrain myself. I started this new iTunes Match and Apple Music adventure with 24,000 + carefully ripped and cataloged and curated songs in my library. I use all of Apple’s music services and because my music is important I learned how they worked individually and together. Is it perfect? No! But I know that and when there is some outlier issue, because I understand, I’m able to ALWAYS overcome and move on. Now…if you’re still reading…while I do agree that there is a lot of crud and legacy stuff here that can and should be done away with. No argument! I want so many changes I can’t possibly list them all. But it’s not that easy! I wish it was but I know it’s not. Given the challenges, and acknowledging that your opinion is just that, I would love to see author’s like this to step back, take the emotional stuff out, and write clearly and thoughtfully so at the end of the article we come away smarter not further apart. September 23, 2016 at 11:16 EST AM NotTellingYou September 23, 2016 BTW: geoduck…Why, if you’re steaming from Apple Music, would you ever need to use iTunes? Other than local backups, and hardware restore, there is absolutely NO REASON to use or ever open iTunes. It’s a non-issue! I also don’t get your movie comment as it’s even less of a factor there! September 23, 2016 at 11:20 EST AM CCardona September 23, 2016 C’mon John, tell us what you REALLY think! 😉 I enjoy the venom (I’m from Cuba!), but I’ve learned in therapy that it just turns most people off! “mysterious download cloud icons in my music collection”: Those are from like that free U2 album that I deleted (crap), and all of those tracks downloaded by my wife and kids (more crap) under our Family Sharing plan. I don’t want today’s crappy pop on my iPhone. Apple Music, as I’ve said here before, is for musicians and kids, who need to be up on the latest music. Those of us grownups (35+, -Rudolf Steiner), already have all the best music in our iTunes Library (40s-80s). Knowing Apple’s track record with cloud services, i avoided Music Match like a virus, but kudos to those brave souls at TMO who try it out for us. You’re not going to make friends with Dave Hamilton and other TMO writers by suggesting that they are fools to pay for Apple Music! Dave is a musician WITH kids, so it works double for him! September 23, 2016 at 11:32 EST AM Lee Dronick September 23, 2016 Apple Music, as I’ve said here before, is for musicians and kids, who need to be up on the latest music. Those of us grownups (35+, -Rudolf Steiner), already have all the best music in our iTunes Library Spot on! September 23, 2016 at 11:50 EST AM Lee Dronick September 23, 2016 There is new music that I like, and not everything from the good old days was listenable. Generally I buy jazz, R&B, classical, folk, world, and stuff that I put into a playlist titled “Good Rock. I even buy some of the pop stuff. September 23, 2016 at 12:25 EST PM Go_Robot_Go September 23, 2016 I’m not sure I understand the problem. I have been using iTunes since 2004. I have amassed a rather large music library (60k+ songs) over the years, between ripping my existing CD library and mp3 purchases. I am now an Apple Music subscriber, and I still have all of that music. I have everything Apple Music offers, plus my library. So they removed star ratings. I’ll admit, that was a surprise and a fairly confusing change, considering that I — like, I imagine, a lot of people — used star ratings to create smart playlists. But ultimately, I was only using those star ratings to put songs into one of three boxes: songs I didn’t like (one or two stars), songs I liked (four or five stars), and songs I was neutral on (three stars). Considering that I had no hard and fast rule for rating something four stars vs. five, and most songs that I disliked got the one-star rating (what is two stars, anyway? I don’t like this, but it also doesn’t make me want to plug my ears?), the current like/dislike system effectively gives me the same thing. Sure, I had to go back into iTunes to bulk-like songs in those playlists, but that took no effort and little time. Oh, and now? Now Apple Music looks at what I’ve liked and disliked, and builds me a personalized playlist of music every week that it thinks I might like. It brings music discovery directly to me. I still have all of my music. And now I have practically all of the additional music I could ever want. In fact, my whole family has all of that, for the cost of one CD per month. What’s the problem? September 23, 2016 at 12:29 EST PM Lee Dronick September 23, 2016 What does this mean in a playlist on my iPhone: This playlist has been downloaded to this iPhone. Do you want to to delete it from your Library, or remove the downloads from this iPhone? Remove Downloads Delete from Library Cancel And how do get rid of Mr. Obvious’ alert that I downloaded a playlist from my Mac? A playlist that I deliberately put there because I personally curated it. September 23, 2016 at 12:58 EST PM geoduck September 23, 2016 BTW: geoduck…Why, if you’re steaming from Apple Music, would you ever need to use iTunes? I don’t use AppleMusic September 23, 2016 at 1:10 EST PM Lee Dronick September 23, 2016 Well there is a new version of iOS out, 10.0.2, which hopefully means that there has been a coup d’état at Apple and certain designers have been sent back to Facebook. September 23, 2016 at 1:20 EST PM Bregalad September 23, 2016 I’ve never used star ratings because tastes change over time. I get sick of anything I hear too often, even the greatest songs of all time. Over longer time frames tastes change even more. I’m shocked at some of the stuff I spent good money on and equally shocked at stuff I used to hate that now appears in great quantity in my library. All music database applications like iTunes suck. They don’t have nearly enough fields and only have a single view. Real databases permit an infinite number of views that can be easily cloned so you don’t have to start from scratch every time. Being able to set up a rock/pop view and a classical view would be a good start because I don’t want those two types of music sorted the same way nor do I want them played back the same way. With most (not all) rock I enjoy a random shuffle, but I certainly don’t need Gould playing a Chopin piano solo (or worse) the third movement of a Brahms symphony being thrown into the mix. iTunes manages to keep music, apps, movies and TV shows in the same database without confusing them so it should be easy to create multiple music categories. Of course all the tracks need more metadata because having a single date associated with a piece of music is too limiting and sorting an album based on the date associated with the first track is just plain wrong. I have a 1992 album of a 1986 concert during which music from the mid 1960’s through 1984 was played. So each track needs a 1986 performance date and an original composition date. The album itself needs its own metadata so the 1992 publication date can be applied along with the 1986 performance date. When sorted by date the album and all the tracks should appear in 1986. I have some re-issued recordings that are essentially the same as the originals. iTunes places them in the year of release instead of the year of original release where I want them. I also have some re-mastered recordings that are quite different from the originals. Those should be sorted by the newer date because the sound has been noticeably modified. It should be my choice to use either date without having to delete the other date. I have two albums from 1974 that always appear in the wrong order when sorted by date because the one recorded in October is alphabetically ahead of the one recorded in February. I can store the CDs on a shelf in the correct order, but iTunes won’t display them that way. September 23, 2016 at 2:40 EST PM RonMacGuy September 23, 2016 Wow, lots of emotion. I will add my 2 cents. I love Apple music. Sure, I have a ton of CDs already in iTunes, but I have three daughters that love the latest and greatest stuff they hear on the radio, a wife who likes a variety of music, a mother who loves 50s and 60s music, and I like a wider variety than my wife. For the cost of two albums a month, all 6 of us can listen to whatever we want, wherever we want. Cost of 3 caramel machiatos. Cost of two McDonald’s Big Mac meals. This is a no brainer for me. The other day I hopped into my car for a 1.5 hour drive. I asked Siri to play me some Queen. I heard all the popular songs that I and everyone else owns, but I also heard some songs that I hadn’t heard for a very long time, and even a couple of songs that I’d never heard from Queen. Really enjoyable experience, and so simple to kick off. Love it. I really only use iTunes anymore for local iPhone/iPad backups and occasional movement of home videos of daughters’ sports/instrument/singing performances. September 23, 2016 at 3:01 EST PM RonMacGuy September 23, 2016 I also kind of have to agree with dlstarr7. I don’t care how many years someone has written here or anywhere, when an article is titled like click-bait and reads like click-bait, it’s kind click-bait, or at least click-bait-ish. Apple doesn’t hate music lovers who want to own their music. Total click-bait title. Apple is indifferent to music lovers who want their own music. If they hated those who want their own music, they would not offer import capability of CDs into iTunes and they certainly wouldn’t offer iTunes Match. Apple is very tolerant of music lovers who want their own music, and simply offers for those music lovers to import their vast libraries and also to stop buying future stuff if they so choose, and for a monthly fee offers tens of millions of past/current/future songs with a simple request to Siri. Or, to continue to buy their own music through iTunes for pricing comparable to other ways of purchasing their own music. The idea of Apple hating music lovers who want to own their own music is completely ludicrous. So yes, the click-bait comment on this article is completely sound. September 23, 2016 at 3:10 EST PM Lancashire-Witch September 23, 2016 I manage all the household’s music (about 12,000 tracks) on a G5 with iTunes 10 – works well. Home sharing and Airplay ensure that all the family can access and play the music they want. Quality ripping (and re-ripping!) and iTunes purchases mean I don’t need iCloud music library (iTunes Match) or Apple Music. From a UI perspective iTunes 12 on newer macs is not as easy or intuitive as iTunes 10. Apple’s penchant for removing features (and applications!) often causes disappointment and frustration. Do they think we don’t mind seeing hours of work just vanish, sometimes without warning? I’ve completely given up with Podcasts. Losing star ratings would be a disaster (her word) for SWMBO who often creates smart playlists using ratings. September 23, 2016 at 7:07 EST PM Lee Dronick September 23, 2016 I’ve completely given up with Podcasts. I recently renewed my interest in them, I listen to them during my Apple Watch inspired fitness program. One of the things I like about iOS 10 is that when listening to podcasts raising the iPhone shows a the Podcast player and I can quickly hit the 15 second rewind to hear something that bears repeating or pause when I need it to. September 23, 2016 at 9:05 EST PM Paul Goodwin September 23, 2016 @NotTellingYou Where did you get an address to send a note to a Product Manager? I’ve never seen anything but the general feedback to Apple in their contact info. September 23, 2016 at 11:52 EST PM Paul Goodwin September 23, 2016 Lancashire-Witch. I agree on iTunes 10. The best one ever for music organization and playlist creation was 10.6.8 (if I remember the version right). September 23, 2016 at 11:56 EST PM Paul Goodwin September 24, 2016 I personally think taking star ratings out of iOS shows a ridiculous lack of vision of what their own products are capable of. Maybe an iPhone is too small of a device too be a creation tool. But an iPad isn’t. Why can I have similar smart playlist creation capability (using star ratings) on the iPad that I have on the Mac. It’s like they’re thinking of the iPad as a consumption only device. I want to sit on my deck with the iPad to do that work instead of having to go back inside on the iMac. And a heart to love and a strikethrough heart for dislike is just a horrid useless waste for managing and organizing. And the comment above about not using star ratings because tastes (and hence star ratings) change with time doesn’t get it for me. That’s the beauty of star ratings while a song is playing; you can up-rate or down-rate as your taste changes. It’s just silly to me to not have that capability. It’s not because Apple doesn’t want music owners. It’s because they don’t view music players/organizers as important as they used to, and Apple just isn’t putting the great effort into it that they used to. I fail to see though how the deletion of the star rating capability of the music app got through any reasonable design review process. The iTunes and Music app team at Apple ain’t what it used to be. I don’t know if there’s anything better out there now. When iTunes 11 came out, I looked long and hard at other music management/player apps and nothing was anywhere close to iTunes (even itunes 11). September 24, 2016 at 12:11 EST AM furbies September 24, 2016 In large part I agree with the article author. iOS 10’s Music app UI is a step backwards. I too don’t want my music purchases that I’ve decided not to “download” to my iPhone showing up in the Music App. Is it impossible for Apple to get with the plan and let ME choose what’s shown/playable ? And while I didn’t “manically” star rate my music, it was a handy way to build a playlist of lesser played songs that I could either “prune” or play as a seperate group to “refresh” my appreciation of an artist/group. September 24, 2016 at 1:28 EST AM Lee Dronick September 24, 2016 “Is it impossible for Apple to get with the plan and let ME choose what’s shown/playable?” It is not impossible, but maybe it is not as profitable. September 24, 2016 at 8:27 EST AM ibuck September 24, 2016 I’m pretty disappointed with iTunes 12, and haven’t upgraded to iOS 10 or Sierra. I’ve stopped buying iTunes music because it’s hard to find the songs or artists I want. Is there a way to go back to iTunes 10? September 24, 2016 at 11:42 EST AM brainiikit September 25, 2016 Would people pay a monthly fee (or Any fee for that matter) to listen to the music they already own by using Apple Music? Did I miss something? Are people so involved with their daily lives that they don’t care they are being financially raped?! Yes, I said ‘raped’. First, (not just Apple) you MUST upgrade because the reliable equipment you had suddenly becomes obsolete. I am all for technology marching on, in fact I embrace it; I am a big sci-fi fan who enjoys when imagined invention becomes reality and continues to improve. BUUUT, when you are FOrCed to upgrade ($$$$$) then you gotta pay for something that you already own/had/love/paid for or created, like your music???!! WTF I gotta pay for listening to my own music?! and what happens to your music AFTER the free 3-month trial ends? I like a lot of World music. I have a lot of foreign music, Pow-Wow music, artist created indigenous music that is NOT on iTunes. The current music is fine and I can get it from Apple Music but what about the other stuff. The voice recordings? The improv jam-sessions that were so fun, but will never be produced? Where will they go? Its still on your iTunes on Mac/Windows right? Well thanks to the new OS, my computer is now incompatible. So I am ForCed to spend more $$$$$ to get a current OS; so I can use iTunes, so I can have my music; so I can fully enjoy the new iPhone 7 (it could have been the 6/6s/6+/6s+) I was ForCed to upgrade to from the 4S (its ok to laugh…its funny) I had it so long and it worked so well #sturdy (and no, I didn’t have to get the 7 but what was I going to do get the 5? and be in the same boat next year and maybe have to pay more?!) so… For now, I will be carrying around 2 phones….the new 7 and the 4S for my music listening…good thing I was gifted some great blue tooth headphones for my birthday. and I don’t plan to give Apple one DIME to hear The Silvercloud Singers (a Native American Drum Group), my jam sessions, gifted CDs from performers that were given to me BEFORE being sold anywhere (many times the copy you can buy is slightly different)…I NEED my music, chants, drums, etc… Apple needs to understand, iTunes is not just for listening to The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Jermaine Dupri and Da Brat, Daddy Yankee, Enrique Iglesias, or Wisin with or without Yandel… it is a music storage library, its personal, and you may not get what you need from the cloud #ecclecticMusicLover Keep iTunes as it was #free…and let those who want to pay, pay…Apple won’t lose a cent. September 25, 2016 at 11:32 EST PM archimedes September 27, 2016 It’s such an un-Apple-like user experience. There is no sane reason for breaking iTunes syncing, but it seems nearly impossible to get it to peacefully coexist with Apple Music and with iCloud Music Library. Damaged playlists, deleted music, damaged metadata… it’s a complete and total nightmare, and it feels so awful to have a piece of software ride roughshod over your carefully selected music. When long-term Apple fans like John Kheit say “Apple hates you” – well, that might be a sign that something is rotten in the state of iTunes/Apple Music. September 27, 2016 at 12:32 EST AM archimedes September 27, 2016 Actually even if you avoid Apple Music and iCloud Music Library like the plague… iTunes still messes things up. Awful rubbish. September 27, 2016 at 12:33 EST AM iSoul September 27, 2016 Thank you John Kheit! Totally with your opinion. And I´m also with you furbies, Lancashire-Witch, Paul Goodwin, archimedes.. Finally someone from the writing folks writes about it. I was wondering a long time, if I´m the only one (or the last user remaining) to be deeply worried and upset about, what has been done to iTunes over the last years. Especially on macOS (“Music” or former “iPod” on iOS has never been that capable as its parent app on macOS, but has been pretty good – but, by the way, where the heck has this “recently played” list gone in iOS 10??). Since version 11 things went worse with iTunes on the Mac. And when I hear Tim Cook saying all over again, that music ist “deep in Apples DNA”, I want to yell at him: “Did you look at iTunes in the near past. Did you ever used it?”. The UI degraded in usability by becoming much less intuitive and more ugly in look and feel. There was a time, when there has been a team which put much love into the iTunes App. As they have built it for themselves – one could see it and feel it on using. For me, the Mac meant iTunes in a big part. Today I doubt, that the the people who are responsible are even using it. It seems, that every once in a version some other morons are messing around with the design and functionality – just for the sake of change, not for making it better. Who let´s that happen- Is that you Eddy Cue? Maybe you should spend some more time at Apple and less at Ferrari. I fell in love with iTunes instantly on one of the first iMacs – the time we had brushed metal in the windows finish ;-)) .. I loved it. That was the tool,., I dreamed of. I like to earn my music. I have ripped all my CDs and bought a lot music on iTunes. And I curated some nice playlists. Some by hand, a lot with automated/intelligent playlist, which fill themselves by relating to f.e. the rating (which may change on time – so do related lists), interprets, genre, and a bunch of keywords I´m putting into the comments field. I´ve put months of work into it and still do. And of course I love to sync them to my iPhone and iPad. Thats why I am forced to upgrade iTunes with new iPhone gadgets. In former times I was happily curious about new versions of iTunes. Nowadays, on every new version, that is announced to come out, I fall on my knees praying for not being destroyed so much, that it will render unusable (same with the design of macOS btw). I´m just trying iTunes Music. I like it somehow, but its not to substitute owning music. I still want to buy what I´have discovered and like and I want to integrate it to my personal playlists and I want it to be there, when I maybe quit iTunes Music subscription someday. So.. why is there no “buy” button behind a playing title? It´s ridiculous. Where ist the historylist of titles, I previewed in the store? Where is the genius-playlist function? That function created very good playlists within my mediathek – vanished. Beside my iMac, I have a MacBook Pro from 2009 which I kept on Snowleopard and iTunes 11 (which is much better and more beautiful, than this mess of disgusting grey in El Capitan). To say one good thing: my most used shortcut in iTunes “command-L” to jump to the actually playing track now finds also the right track, when it is embedded in a playlist nested within a folder. That didn´t work a long time after implementing the Folders for playlist functionality. So.. maybe someone still cares over there at Apple, deep down in the iTunes labs. iTunes with the iPod was once an important element fur the success of Apple on it´s way to become al hot, hip mainstream company. And it may be still important for more people, Apple thinks. I keep hoping, it will gain back some love. (this was a short and incomplete version of all my thoughts an worries I made myself over the recent years on iTunes) September 27, 2016 at 7:21 EST PM facebook_user October 3, 2016 “Apple letting iTunes become a serial murdering music library terrorist”. Beautifully described. I am still hurting from boldly buying my first Mac in 2012, starting up iTunes, pointing it to my extensive music collection on a server, and watching a chaotic disaster unfold that I had no say in (as it happened) and no warning it would happen, and if you want to say that I should have reasonably expected it to happen, you are kidding.

News By Mathieu St-Pierre September 23, 2016 Apple Looking to Buy McLaren? Photo: Mathieu St-Pierre McLaren 570S « » Email this to a friend Print The last few days have been abuzz with one particular piece of news: Apple was in talks with McLaren for a complete takeover. We all know that Apple has toyed with the idea of making their own cars for a while. Usually, the best way to get into such a big game is to buy one of the players. It thus made sense that these rumours could have had some validity to them. A MacLaren in our future? A day or so into the furious reports, the people from Woking, Surrey in the UK put an end to the rumours. It is clear though that Apple is interested in McLaren for its technology and outright brilliance, but a complete takeover is not in anyone’s plans. We also all know that Apple has stockpiles of cash all over the place (roughly $232 billion USD) so purchasing Mount Everest is not entirely out of the question. McLaren is evaluated at between 1 billion and 1.5 billion pounds ($1.3 billion and $1.95 billion), pocket change in other words. Some analysts figured that an Apple purchase of Tesla would be a good fit. However, it would seem that the creator of the Macintosh will take a longer road to making mobile vehicles. They are currently in talks with Lit Motors, a company that makes an electric self-balancing motorcycle.

Reuters Founded in 2013, Tuplejump's two co-founders Rohit Rai and Satyaprakash Buddhavarapu have already joined Apple while third co-founder, Deepak Alur, joined Anaplan -- a Cloud-based business modelling and planning platform for sales, operations and finance. According to a Tech Crunch report, Apple is on a machine learning company buying spree and recently bought two well-known startups Perceptio and Turi. "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans," a company spokesperson told Tech Crunch. Apple was particularly interested in "FiloDB" -- an opensource project that Tuplejump was building to efficiently apply machine learning concepts and analytics to complex data. AFP The Tuplejump team was well acquainted with open source big data tools such as the Apache Spark processing engine, the Apache Cassandra NoSQL database, and the Apache Kafka distributed high-throughput publish-subscribe messaging system, Venturebeat reported. "Tuplejump also built an open source search indexing system called Stargate that works with data stored in Cassandra and relies on the fundamentals of the Apache Lucene full-text search software," the report added. AFP Tuplejump's website has been shut down following the acquisition, the details of which are yet to be disclosed. In May, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the company's first development centre in Hyderabad to work on Apple Maps during his visit to the country.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: Apple purchases TupleJump, expands machine learning resources Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, September 23rd, 2016, 05:03 Category: Rumor, Software Tweet Machine learning is the hip new thing and Apple wants to be as large a part of it as humanly possible. Adding to its collection of machine learning acquisitions, following a buyout of Perceptio at the end of 2015 and Turi just a few months ago, Apple has now acquired an India/US-based machine learning team, Tuplejump. While Apple has yet to confirm the purchase and offered the standard line about occasionally buying other outfits without discussing its purposes or plans, the company offered the previous description of itself on its web site a while back: A few years ago people realised that the volume of data that businesses generate was becoming unwieldy. A new set of technologies to handle this huge amounts of data cropped up. We were one of the early adopters of these ‘big-data’ technologies. Having helped Fortune 500 companies adopt these technologies we quickly realised how complicated they were and how much simpler they could get. Thus started our quest to simplify data management technologies and make them extremely simple to use. We are building technology that is simple to use, scalable and will allow people to ask difficult questions on huge datasets. Terms of the deal are not yet known. Apple had also apparently become interested in “FiloDB”, an opensource project that Tuplejump was building to efficiently apply machine learning concepts and analytics to massive amounts of complex data right as it streamed in. FiloDB was apparently headed up by Evan Chan since August of 2015. In short, Apple looks to have a new machine learning gem in its possession. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Many of us probably think of SEO as something which is done after the fact: you create your copy, then you think about how to optimise it. But at the Content Marketing Association’s Digital Breakfast last week, Kevin Gibbons from BlueGlass proposed a radically different approach. To make your content work for SEO, Gibbons’ advice is to “start with the end in mind”. You need to be thinking about promotion from the word go, he said; so that when it comes to publishing your content, you already have a distribution and promotion strategy in mind, and have crafted your content towards that goal. So how can you carry this out in practice? Here are twelve tips from Kevin Gibbons’ presentation that will ensure your content works for search from beginning to end. Break down ‘silos’ when creating your team I’m not the biggest fan of the word ‘silos’; in fact, in seven months of writing about digital marketing and search, I’ve become heartily sick of it. But essentially what it means in this context is bringing people together across different departments – SEO, content strategy, creativity, PR and social media – to work on content. Content marketing is a team effort, and your team should combine a variety of talents; in Gibbons’ words, “Get the right people on the bus!” He warned against doing too many different things, and trying to spread yourself too thin. Ideally, you want to put together a team of people who specialise in their different areas, rather than trying to have one or two people be good at everything. Know your goals Once you’ve got your awesome team assembled, it’s time to set some goals. First off, understand your brand: what is your purpose and the story you want to tell? What are your core values, and how can you communicate them? As an example of this, Gibbons cited Apple’s 1997 ‘Think Different’ slogan and the adverts that Apple put together to communicate this message: Second, know your audience and understand who you are targeting. As John Romero, video game entrepreneur, once said: “Market to your best customers first, your best prospects second and the rest of the world last.” Thirdly, what’s the aim of your content marketing, and how can you measure and prove it? Success looks different depending on what you’re trying to achieve, and different metrics can be important to measuring different kinds of success. Are you tracking conversions, traffic, social engagement, equivalent media spend? Are you looking for an improvement in customer support or sales? Finally, Gibbons recommends creating clear content guidelines to work out what you should and shouldn’t be publishing. “Don’t be afraid to say no – being selective is good to keep focused on what’s really important.” Image: BlueGlass Do a content audit Before you strike out and create new content, take stock of what you already have with an audit. Can you improve on it? What worked, and what didn’t go over so well? What has generated the most traffic, or social engagement and links? Knowing what content you have is also hugely useful in developing a good internal linking strategy, which is key for SEO. And if customers are going to be finding your brand through this content, even just occasionally, it’s important to make sure it’s up to date and relevant! Don’t create content for content’s sake They say that every minute on the internet, there are 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube, 3.3 million Facebook posts, over 400,000 Tweets, and over 1,200 WordPress blog posts published. So how can you differentiate your content amongst so much noise? Make your content is quality, necessary and worthwhile – don’t just create content for the sake of publishing content. Google’s algorithms prioritise quality content, so publishing less and publishing well, rather than churning out generic content, will help the content that you do have rank better. In the words of copyblogger: “SEO can’t, by itself, make a popular blog. First, you need remarkable content, and then you optimize it for search engines. Skip the remarkable part, and all the optimization in the world won’t help you.” Create data-driven content – and make it newsworthy When putting together your quality, well-crafted content, one thing that Gibbons recommends doing is incorporating data. Find out what data your client has, and look at how you can use that in your content. More data increases your credibility, and data can also be a great hook when pitching to journalists, especially if you can find a good news angle. Get exclusives for your content (but make sure you’re the source) This is a tactic that works well if you have data-driven content and/or content with a good news angle. Agreeing an exclusive with a publisher in advance can help to get their buy-in on covering it, plus it helps with additional outreach to other publishers afterwards. The coverage helps both to amplify your brand and to boost your SEO with backlinks; just make sure that you’re credited as the source!

First of all, by researching your audience and understanding their pain points, you better understand the people who your content is targeted at. Secondly (if done well), it allows you to create evergreen, quality content that your audience can come back to repeatedly as a valuable resource. How-to guides and ‘tutorial’ style content are always a good bet for both audience value and SEO, as people often search with a specific question in mind. This is particularly true for voice search, where people tend to phrase their searches in the form of a whole question – so Q&A style content is especially well-suited to ranking for voice searches. A useful tip that Gibbons gave is to start by answering people’s questions on sites like Quora and community forums, which will give you an insight into what they want to know. Then turn your most popular answers into more in-depth content! Understand what triggers Quick Answers, and play to it Also known as ‘rich answers’ and ‘featured snippets’, Quick Answers are those informative boxouts at the top of Google search results which quickly supply the information you’re searching for. Rather than being drawn from the top ranking result on the SERP, they’re drawn from the content that Google thinks best answers the query. So if you gear your content towards these boxes, they can be a fantastic way to ‘leapfrog’ to the top of search results and get your branding – and content – up there at the top. Happily, ‘how to’ style content, which we mentioned in the last point, is ideal for this, along with Q&A style content and bullet point lists. For more on how to hack Google’s Quick Answers, read Jim Yu’s guide to the ABC of Google Quick Answers. Make the customer the hero Involve your audience! If you think your content is about you, says Gibbons, you’re missing the point – when people share content, they share it about themselves, not you. And by involving your audience, you have an in-built reason for people to share and talk about your content. Another speaker at CMA’s Digital Breakfast, Scott Davies, CEO of social TV and advertising company never.no, gave some great ideas as to how this can be used to jazz up a marketing campaign. For example, when tasked with promoting a fairly boring household item – a mop – never.no asked people to submit their own videos on Vine and Instagram of doing different things with the mop. The result was a plethora of hilarious short videos that made for a great ad. Another piece of advice that Gibbons gave was to play on people’s egos. Your audience loves to talk about themselves and where they’re from. Play on rivalries between cities, between countries, between areas. Buzzfeed is a pro at this kind of content, because it’s so shareable – just look at 45 Reasons The North Of England Is Better Than The South, or 31 Reasons To Avoid South London. Remember that you’re building an audience – not just traffic or links People like to consume content in different ways, so think about how you can recycle the same content into multiple formats. You could turn an in-depth study into a series of short-form articles, or build up a long article into a downloadable guide or whitepaper. You could create interactive content, infographics or data visualisations, email newsletters, video. You can use these additional pieces to create “content upgrades” – offering a resource that’s unique to each blog post, or other piece of content, that readers need to submit an email address or share on social media in order to receive. The result is more value for your audience, more mileage for your content, and a huge boost to your email subscribers or social backlinks. Backlinko has a more detailed guide on how to make and use content upgrades. Explore relevant syndication partners Think about where you can cross-post your content both to amplify its signal and to create backlinks. Outlets like LinkedIn and Medium can be great for attracting an audience that your site might not get otherwise. Just remember two things: one, don’t spread yourself too thin by trying to cover every platform – work out where your audience is, and concentrate on those outlets. And two, remember that you’re still publishing to someone else’s platform, with their brand and their rules. And even though the traffic is going to your content, it’s still going to their site. Walled gardens make up so much of the internet that it’s all but impossible to avoid them, but you can be savvy about publishing to them. For example, post the first half of a blog post on LinkedIn, and then once you’ve got your reader hooked, invite them to read the rest of the content on your site. Hopefully they’ll take the bait and follow the link to where you want them. (This tip comes courtesy of my colleague Ben Rabinovich, editor of PaymentEye – thanks, Ben!) Just do it! Don’t second-guess yourself with questions like, “What if everyone knows this already?” or “Why would I share all of this information if people can just copy it?” What people don’t get, says Gibbons, is the biggest risk is not doing it at all. Take a gamble on that adventurous content idea, and it might just pay off – but it won’t if you don’t!

Three Japanese carriers are the main focus of the investigation, but it appears that Apple may also be implicated. Japan’s Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said that NTT Docomo, KDDI Corp and Softbank Group were refusing to sell older surplus iPhone models to third party retailers, thereby hobbling smaller competitors. Apple was not named in that report, but two senior government sources told Reuters that regulators were also focusing on Apple’s supply agreements with all three carriers. It’s reported that it is Apple’s contract terms that ultimately prevents older model iPhones being made available for sale within Japan … Apple’s contract is said to require surplus stock of older iPhones to be sent to other markets, such as Hong Kong, while other contract terms are said to result in carriers favoring iPhones over phones from Samsung and other rivals. The report notes that while the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 both sell for the exact same price without a contract, the iPhone price on contract is much lower than that of the Samsung flagship. Apple did not respond directly to a Reuters request for comment, simply noting the economic benefit the company brings to the country. When asked about the antitrust concerns, Apple forwarded a link to a webpage published at the time of the Aug. 2 FTC report that says it has created or supports 715,000 jobs in Japan with Japanese-based developers raking in more than $9 billion in revenue from Apple apps since 2008. It did not comment further. The investigation may end up being concluded informally, the regulator stating that it hoped that applying pressure to the carriers would result in them renegotiating their contracts with Apple. It’s not long since Apple settled a high-profile antitrust case in the USA by paying out $400M to customers as settlement for an ebook price-fixing case. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.
