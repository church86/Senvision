Touch Disease is the annoying phenomenon that plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against the Cupertino tech giant have been saying is messing up their iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones, leaving a flickering bar at the top of the display and creating all kinds of multi-touch issues. (You all remember "multi-touch," right? All those cool things you can do with your iPhone by touching it in different ways and with different amounts of pressure? And you saw that Apple how-to a while back that said, among other things, "if the Home button doesn't respond as you expect, make sure that your hands are clean and dry..."?) I wrote about the issue back in August, when the lawsuit first became known. "The iPhones are not fit for the purpose of use as smartphones because of the touch-screen defect," said the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose. At that time, Apple declined comment. Now Apple has officially recognized the problem and announced a new worldwide program where it will fix any affected iPhone 6 Plus devices -- for a $149 service fee. So just how bad is it to have an iPhone beset with problems caused by Touch Disease? Listen: Elizabeth Jackson, having lunch with her husband, told WCPO Cincinnati that using her iPhone 6 Plus has become increasingly frustrating. "There's sometimes when it won't respond when I go to text or open an app. It takes a while to open up." WCPO also got an earful from Brianna Booker, whose iPhone 6 Plus would flash a light gray band at the top of the phone -- and then simply stop responding to her touch. It was, as it were, unswipable: "I wasn't able to swipe. I had notifications coming in, but I wasn't able to answer any text messages or phone calls." It gets worse. Commenting online about my colleague's story this morning on Apple's acknowledgement of the problem, a guy named John Smith complained that he had hit a wall when he tried to get Apple to fix his diseased phone: "I was told 'tough' by the Apple store employees when I brought it in even though they admitted it was also a problem with the 6." Over in Europe, where they were already wide awake and ready to share their tales of woe, "Süddeutsche Zeitung" tweeted "#TouchDisease: @Apple räumt beim iPhone 6 Plus Reparaturrabatte ein, weist aber die Schuld von sich. via @golem" which translates roughly to: "#TouchDisease: @Apple admits iPhone 6 plus repair discounts, but assigns the blame from itself via @golem." The morning was just getting started here in Silicon Valley when a steady chorus of TD complainers began to grow louder. In responses to a story in TechCrunch, readers unloaded: "I have never dropped my 6," said Tommy Ray Pabst at Cornell University, "but it does a LOT of weird things on its own." Bill Thompson wrote that he had a iPhone 6 Plus "until the recent trade in offer on the iPhone 7. I never had an issue with it, but I promptly put it in a tough case that protected against drops and bending. It was tougher to slip in an out of my pocket, but I had little fears about easily breaking it." And a reader named Anono Mouser said Touch Disease was symptomatic of a larger problem: Apple's incessant software updates and the problems they often cause: "Seems like every few days my 6plus wants to update it's OS to something new. It'd be nice if one of those updates made the smartphone smart enough to actually answer a phone call. I mean it is a phone, right? Instead it mocks me to swipe to answer, and then ignores every swipe, push, and curseword that's thrown at it." But if you want to hit the mother lode of Touch Disease-caused agony, go read Jason Koebler's piece at Motherboard. He said his inbox was flooded with TD complaints after he wrote about the problem in September. "In the last 24 hours, I've gotten emails from 27 separate iPhone 6 Plus owners who have encountered this problem and were unaware that Apple internally considers it a known issue," he wrote. " Many of them have been put through lengthy tech support protocols on obviously broken phones only to be told that they would have to pay $329 for a refurbished phone that is still fundamentally flawed. Others have had to put up with months of forcefully bending or twisting the phone in order to get its Touch IC connectors to intermittently work for a few minutes, hours, or days before the problem inevitably resurfaces." Here are just a few of the tales Koebler heard: From Cherish: "Missed a lot of great photos during a friend's wedding weekend because I unfortunately relied on my iPhone to be my camera. Apple called me on August 17, but when they called my screen was frozen and I could not answer the phone. They left a message saying they would call back. I went to my rental car, connected the Bluetooth and used that to answer. I gave them my alternate cell number so that solved the calling issue. I was on the phone with them for an hour after that and they insisted for most of the call that this is a normal occurrence and is often resolved by restoring the OS." From Paul: "I've lived with this problem on and off for almost two years now. It started happening almost as soon as I got it. I got a screen change under warranty, and had to get a refurbished phone the day after because the screen change did nothing. A few months later it started showing the signs again, and now I can't use it." Wait, there's more from Paul: "As a kicker just a couple weeks ago, the phone stopped connecting to my cellular network and AT&T said it was a phone problem, not carrier. I had to order an iPhone 7 Plus but I feel cheated out of my money as I paid full price for my 6 Plus and could've used it at least another year or even two, if it worked properly." And from Katasha: "The top grey bar would almost flicker all the time, and that's when I knew my phone wouldn't respond to my touch. So, after dealing with this for a couple weeks, I ended up at the Apple Store, where I was told yes, it was a problem, but not something that could be fixed, nor was it covered, and I exchanged my phone for $329, to get a new one, because what else was I to do?" © 2016 San Jose Mercury News under contract with NewsEdge.

Pay Apple $149 Philip Michaels Senior Editor Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)November 19, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share If your iPhone 6 Plus suffers from a flickering screen that's become unresponsive to your touch, Apple has a fix for you. But it'll cost you $149. Apple today (Nov. 17) launched a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models that have flickering displays or problems registering multi-touch inputs. If your phone is otherwise in working order without a cracked or broken screen, Apple says it will repair affect iPhone 6 Pluses for $149. This iFixit image shows the gray flicker that's a sympton of Touch Disease.The problem with flickering screens has been a source of internet speculation for some time now. Back in August, iFixit reported that it was seeing a rise in the number of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices suffering from a gray flicker at the top of the display and an unresponsive tuouchscreen. This iFixit image shows the gray flicker that's a sympton of Touch Disease.More MORE: 23 Essential iPhone 7 Tips and Tricks At the time, iFixit blamed what it called the "Touch Disease" problem on pair of touchscreen controller chips found on the logic board of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. As you may recall, those models were prone to bending, and iPhone repair specialists suggested that the added stress on the logic board was causing problems with the affected sensors. Apple, it seems, does not entirely agree with that diagnosis. In its notice announcing the Multi-Touch repair program, the company said the iPhone 6 Plus might exhibit these problems "after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device." In other words, Apple thinks wear-and-tear is the culprit and not a design flaw, which is probably why you'll have to pay that $149 repair cost. The repair program only covers the iPhone 6 Plus, though some users have reported problems with the smaller iPhone 6 as well. (In its August report on the problem, iFixit said the problem occured more frequently in Plus models, since it was more prone to bending.) If you already paid to have your iPhone 6 Plus fixed, Apple says it will reimburse you for any costs you incurred above $149. Apple says affected iPhone 6 Plus owners should contact an authorized Apple service provider or go to the Apple Store for the repair. Three iPhone owners filed a class-action suit against Apple over their phone's touchscreens in August.

The answer is a streaming box, a valuable addition to your entertainment shelf designed to support the most popular streaming options and channels. So if you are looking for a Netflix box for TV, check out the best on the market – and everything else they have to offer. Note: These boxes assume that you have HDMI ports in your TV or receiver. If your devices are particularly old, you may want to upgrade them before searching for boxes. Read: How much does Netflix cost per month? Best Netflix Boxes 1. Google Chromecast Google Chromecast isn’t exactly a box – which is why it’s one of the best streaming device options around. This little HDMI stick can fit nearly anywhere as long as your TV has an extra HDMI port for you to stick it in. It’s powered via USB tech or AC adapter, and once in and running it can do most of what the big set-top boxes can do, including give you popular streamers like Netflix, YouTube, HBO Go, Hulu Plus, and other important members of the family. The other unique feature of Chromecast is how well it plays with Android and developers in general, giving it access to a very broad selection of apps to tweak your entertainment in all kinds of ways. You can buy Google Chromecast here for $35. 2. Roku 3 Roku was one of the early entrants in the set-top box market, and has had plenty of time to perfect its craft. The Roku 3 is simply one of the best streaming box choices currently available. It offers around 2,000 possible channels, excellent search options that allow you to search content through multiple platforms and devices, and of course access to streamers like Netflix. It comes with its own remote complete with motion controls for games, has a headphone jack for private listening, and has Ethernet, USB, and MicroSD slots. All in all, it makes for a great family box. You can buy the Roku 3 for $99.99. 3. Apple TV Apple has a simpler box than the Roku, but offers many of the same services and more compatibility with other Apple products. This Netflix TV box can handle all the popular streaming apps, as well as high definition iTunes content. However, it’s the interactions with iPhones and iPads that make this streaming box unique. You can flick video or photos up onto your TV at a moment’s notice if you want, thanks to AirPlay features, or used your iPad as a controller for many of the games in the Apple app store. In other words, this is made for Apple fans from the ground up. You can get the Apple TV for $99 4. Google Nexus Player The Nexus Player uses the Android TV OS, and while it will give easy access to Netflix streaming and much more, it will go down easier for those who have experience with Android platforms. Much like Apple TV and Apple software, the Nexus is meant for Android games, Google Play content, and similar features. With an extra gamepad accessory and a voice search function, the Player may be more suited for video game apps than many other boxes…as long as you get your apps from Android. You can also use Google Cast on the Player in conjunction with any other device that also has the Cast app to send content over to your TV. You can pick up the Nexus Player for $99. 5. Amazon Fire TV Amazon Fire TV has several features to recommend it. First, much like Apple TV and the Nexus Player, Fire TV is designed to work well with one specific brand – if you love Amazon and already subscribe to plenty of Amazon content, this device will fit in perfectly with your habits. Second, this Netflix streaming box includes an extra focus on unique features. It lets parents create personal profiles for kids and their favorite cartoons, it has smart buffering to prepare shows ahead of time, and it offers more gaming options than most boxes, with titles that Apple TV and Nexus Player don’t have access to. You can get the Amazon Fire TV for $84 6. Xbox One The Xbox One is a console, not a small set-top box, and so is significantly more expensive. However, it’s the best Netflix streamer if you’re a fan of Microsoft and Windows, and includes, of course, options for all Xbox One games and downloads. The voice search, gesture control, and automatic control of your TV and receiver than come with the Kinect accessory also make this box one of the most advanced: streaming content and finding your shows has never been more fun. The Blu-ray player and 500GB hard drive let you watch the latest hard copy or store video content on the Xbox One for later viewing. You can buy the Xbox One for $349 Tweet It Like It Google + Linkedin Pin it Stumble Tyler Lacoma When he isn't enjoying the beautiful Northwest outdoors, you can find Tyler on business and tech sites, writing about the latest news, analyzing trends, and generally making the Internet a more interesting place.

Toggle navigation Insanely Great Contact Advertising Submit Apple puts out $300 design book November 15th 2016 By Mike Flaminio Titled Designed by Apple in California, the new art book chronicles 20 years of Apple design starting with Steve Jobs' return to the company. The book itself is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. Designed by Apple in California's forward by Jony Ive: While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. Like many of its products, there are two versions of the book. A small 10.20-inch x 12.75-inch size and large 13-inch x 16.25-inch size that sells for $199 and $299, respectively. At that price, the book appears geared more towards design and art fans than every-day Apple customers, although certainly, Apple's biggest fans likely will shell out the cash. The book will be available online and at select flagship retail stores, where it will also be on display. Apple appeared to go all out in this monument to itself. The book is described as "printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink. This linen-bound, hardcover volume was developed over an eight-year period." On one hand, I get they want to do something really special that will be appreciated by their design peers, but it comes across as an elitist effort. Like the $18,000 gold Apple Watch, Designed by Apple in California is hardly something for the rest of us, which is where the Mac started.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     This Is How An Apple Mirror Would Look Posted: Nov 19 2016, 1:28pm CST | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Nov 19 2016, 3:04pm CST, in News | Apple     If Apple would make a mirror it could work like this. Apple has a long history of being innovative. Apple always aims to enter new markets and this is very evident from the rumors we hear every other day regarding the work being done on a variety of products. Moving on, there is specifically one product some companies are working on and which is also good enough to enter the market. Don't Miss: Hatchimals Deals on Amazon.com That wonderful product is ‘Mirror’. As bewildering as the name may sound, Apple Mirror will be the next thing to look forward to though it is not developed by Apple. It is a new interactive mirror by Rafael Dymek . It has been built closely to resemble the iOS 10 which makes it look like a big reflective iPad. The operating system details are not known much. It has been skinned enough to look like iOS. It does have desktop-class tropes which also hint a Linux presence. Whatever the details may be one thing is for sure there is much functionality to play around with. You can order Uber, watch movies, browse the internet, text message and much more. This device will not be dedicated for work and play solely but it will be a perfect device to send a text message in the morning too. The Apple Mirror has been designed by Rafael Dymek. It will certainly fit into the background of a modern technological home. However don’t get so excited so soon. This product might not just find its way under production at least for the time being.

Clarissa Partosa 20 November 2016 Email Print More Sharing Services Share Tweet Phil Schiller, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing at Apple Inc, speaks about the new iPad Pro during an Apple media event.Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today A new iPad Pro 2 model is expected to be unveiled by Apple in 2017. Meanwhile, photos of what appears to be the iPad Pro 2 were leaked on the Internet by someone from its supplier. Apple first introduced the iPad Pro with a 12.9-inch screen in the market back in September 2015. By March 2016, an improved version of the iPad Pro was released with a smaller frame of only 9.7 inches. The latter had a lot of positive reviews, which made Apple users anticipate when the next iPad Pro will be released. Macworld reports that an iPad Pro 2 might be released next year. Apple had two events this year showcasing the iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 2, and MacBook Pro. However, with no mention of the iPad at the events, speculations state that its unveiling will happen at the nearest Apple event next year. Meanwhile, Appleinsider received a pair of photos from an anonymous source that appears to be a new iPad Pro model. The photos have allegedly come from a Chinese supplier working on the iPad Pro who claims that these models have gone into production last September. But there has been no confirmation that the photos and the attached information are true. A market analyst named Ming-Chi Kuo recently tried to predict what Apple will be doing in the market over the years to come. According to Macrumors, Kuo suggests that in terms of the iPad Pro, Apple will be releasing a new model available in three sizes: 12.9-inch, 9.7-inch, and 10.5-inch. He adds that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro will be the low-cost option, equipped with the smallest screen and the least updated processor. Kuo indicated that the 10.5-inch iPad Pro will be the model that will cater to the education and business sectors. "If the iPad comes in a larger size, such as a 10.5-inch model, we believe it will be helpful to bid for tenders within the commercial and education markets. As a result, we expect Apple to launch a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in 2017," said Kuo. The iPad Pro is expected to be released in 2017.

Those dollars are roll forward dollars that were unspent last year. We do not foresee any issues receiving those. By the end of this month we should have that in black and white that we have it. We ask that you approve that today, contingent on us receiving that, so that we can get rolling before Christmas,” Williams said. The proposal is to purchase 1,000 32Gb iPad Air 2s from Apple Inc. Education for $359 each for a total of $359,000. The district would then purchase from CDW-G through Region 8 Educational Co-Op 1,000 Griffin All-Terrain Protective Cases for $33 each for a total of $33,000 and 59 Ergotron YES40 charging carts for $1,200 each for a total of $70,800. Overall, that’ll cost SSISD $462,800 to provide enough iPads and cases for each pre-k through second grade student to use in the classroom during school hours, plus one charging cart per classroom.  “Essentially, what this will allow, along with the High Quality Pre-k Grant, most stuff will be Title 1 Part A funded. All students pre-k through second grade will be able to have an iPad with proper protection, and then the cabinet and case to protect  them,” said Williams. “These are supplementary devices in addition to what the districts normally provide. The notion is that it will improve their learning experience. All of these have, this decision has, been approved by campus site-based decision making committees as well, based on the needs assessments.” Overall, the district expects to receive $392,000 in federal Title I funding (pending approval) to apply toward the purchase of 850 iPads, 850 cases and 49 carts. The district has applied for an additional $69,232 in state funding from a High Quality Pre-K Grant to apply toward purchase of 146 additional iPads and cases and 10 additional carts. An additional $784 each would come from budgeted Head Start funding and state/local funding approved by campus site-based decision-making committees for purchase of 2 iPads and 2 cases each, to complete the order. Carts will be used to charge, update and store the iPads. Williams explained that SSISD is part of the Region 8 Co-op, which includes a list of approved vendors the district can use to purchase certain services at co-op rates. The district would purchase the cases and carts through the co-op, but would purchase the iPads themselves from Apple Inc. Education, considere a sole source vendor. “So the net impact or the net that the district would pay is this total minus the $106,000 roll forward amount?” trustee John Prickette asked. “The total district will pay is that $462,800. The Title I portion there —” Williams explained, pointing to a memo with the proposal, including break-down of funding sources, “We have received our entire notice of grant award for this year. We expect that $106,000 to roll over amount from last year. We just want to make sure we receive that as we’re supposed to before we buy these machines.” “So that would actually be more than what the total package is, once we receive the roll forward?” Prickette asked. “Once we receive the roll forward, we’ll be able fund this entire $359,000 Title I  amount as posted,” Williams clarified. “We do have hard cases for these?” queried SSISD Board of Trustees President Leesa Toliver. “Yes, we do have Griffin Survivor all-terrain protective cases, so they should be pre-k proof,” Williams replied. “What are benefit of the iPad Air update as opposed to the basic iPad?” asked trustee Robbin Vaughn. “It’s just the newest generation of iPad,” noted Assistant Superintendent Kristin Monk. “I think that is the basic iPad now,” Prickette noted. “It is the basic. It’s just the newest generation,” Monk affirmed. Lamb noted that over the last few years, while the district has rolled out its technology initiative in stages at the various campuses, is that Apple put out updates regularly. However, as technology advances, updates are no longer available for older devices because they can’t support the new technology after a certain number of years. “We have to get them as modern as we can and hope it lasts for four or five years,” Lamb said. “We have several of the originals. You base them on the charge, or the wide or the narrow,” Monk said of the iPads purchased a few years back when the technology program was piloted. “They are still in use if they will work. We tried to base it on what they already have with the narrow and then add to with this order. So keeping what we have that’s still in good condition and build on that,” Monk said. “Two or three years ago we set out to do a three year plan to be one [computer or device] to one [child from grades] 3-12. This actually makes us one to one pre-k through 12. The high school is in place this year. So once this purchase is made, and those are in hand, we are 1:1 with a device per kid, which has really brought us a long way in three years’ time. It’s pretty phenomenal how they’ve found the money through federal programs and what have you. We’ve taken a dream and made it even bigger than we imagined. It’s exciting,” Lamb noted. The iPads were recommended following local and state assessments, as well as Performance-Based Monitoring Analysis System data, as a means to “improve reading and mathematics instructing” in pre-k through second grade classrooms. The technology will be used as an extension of their learning to access applications such as Reading A-Z, Istation and Brain Pop. It will also allow SSISD to more successfully meet pre-k digital technology guidelines as well as digital technology Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills curriculum. Trustees unanimously approved $462,800 in funding, pending notification of the Title I award, for purchase of 1,000 iPad and cases, and 59 charging carts. Trustees after much discussion approved purchase of a new security vehicle for SSISD security use on a 4-0 vote — two board members absent and Toliver abstaining from voting.

Apple design guru Jony Ive designed a Christmas tree without any decorations Rob Price Nov. 19, 2016, 2:07 PM 152,383 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jony Ive.Kimberly White/Getty Images for Vanity Fair In the autumn of 2015, Apple design guru Jony Ive said that if he wasn't working for Apple, he might create Christmas decorations. "If I wasn't doing this, I think I would just be drawing or making stuff for friends," he told interviewer Charlie Rose. "Maybe it would just be Christmas tree ornaments, I don't know."  Ive, if you're not familiar with him, is the head honcho of design at the Cupertino technology company. He frequently appears as an ethereal, disembodied voiceover on Apple's promotional videos talking about its iconic design. Today, 49-year-old British knight continues to work for Apple. But he's gone and decorated a Christmas tree anyway. Keep scrolling for photos of the tree... View As: One Page Slides This is Claridge's. It's a posh hotel in central London. Rob Price/BI Every year, it gets famous designers to design Christmas trees for its lobby. In 2015, it was Christopher Bailey for Burberry. Claridge's Dolce & Gabanna, Kally Ellis of McQueens, and John Galliano for Dior have also had a go. This is Dalliano's 2010 creation. Claridge's But in 2016, it's Jony Ive's turn! He designed it together with frequent partner-in-crime Marc Newson, as well as set designer Michael Howells. So how does it look? Sir Jonathan Ive, Senior Vice President, Industrial Design, Apple Inc poses with his Honour of Knighthood and designer Mark Newson (right) poses with his Commander of the British Empire (CBE) medal following an Investiture ceremony hosted by the Princess Royal, at Buckingham Palace, on May 23, 2012 in London.Rebecca Naden/Getty Well ... it's a tree. There's nothing on it. Rob Price/BI "Is it finished?" I cautiously asked a Claridge's staff member. The answer: Yes. Rob Price/BI There are smaller trees dotted about too — also without any decorations on. Rob Price/BI But then, what do you expect? Apple is famous for its ultra-minimalist design. Rob Price/BI The unfurnished firs are accompanied by a lobby bedecked to look like a winter wonderland. Fake snow lines the floor alongside real tree trunks, under a leafy canopy and shifting light-scheme. Rob Price/BI "Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognising our excitement about the future and things to come," Ive and Newson said to design mag Wallpaper.

Rob Price/BI It is very pretty. And the birdsong and forest noises are a nice touch. Rob Price/BI But the closest thing to a traditional Christmas tree is this little one in the corner with some fake snow on. No decorations to be seen anywhere! Rob Price/BI Visitors seemed to like it, happily posing for photos in the installation room. Rob Price/BI At one point, a choir even turned up (though they're not an official part of the installation). It was positively idyllic. Rob Price/BI But yes — the tree is just a tree. Rob Price/BI There's no headphone jack, wifi, USB-C ports or HDMI output either, which is a bummer. Rob Price/BI Ive's tree comes off the back of another unconventional project — a $300 book containing nothing but photos of Apple products. It was developed over an eight-year period, and Ive said Apple had to invent new kinds of ink and paper to do it justice. Apple Source: Wallpaper So what's next for Jony Ive?

An order from the European Commission states Ireland charge Apple $14.5 billion in back taxes.More >>    By Kris Wouk Provided by If you’ve ever seen the 1984 family-friendly horror-comedy Gremlins, you know that there are a few rules about keeping the said critters. Don’t get them wet, don’t expose them to bright light, and never feed them after midnight. You won’t want to shove a donut into the sleeve of Mondo’s upcoming vinyl Gremlins soundtrack, no matter what time of day it is, but the other two rules can and absolutely should be broken. Later in November, Mondo will release the two-LP set, which features a gatefold sleeve designed by Phantom City Creative that changes when exposed to sunlight (or any UV light), Entertainment Weekly reports. Normally, the artwork shows a lone evil gremlin — Stripe, to be specific — holding a set of colored lights. When exposed to light, a number of hidden messages like “no bright light” appear, along with additional images, presumably scrawled by one of the creatures. More: ‘Jessica Jones’ and ‘Daredevil’ get to get gorgeous vinyl releases Phantom City Creative also designed the two-disc sleeves, but these are sensitive to water instead of light. One shows the film’s furry hero Gizmo, while the other shows Stripe yet again. Both are alone normally, but exposing the sleeves to water causes them to be surround by other gremlins, something Gizmo does not seem too happy about. To be safe, you will probably want to make sure the records are not in the sleeves when applying water, or in the sleeve when exposing it to sunlight, unless you prefer your records melted. While Mondo sells a number of pop culture items like posters, T-shirts, and other collectibles, it has released a number of vinyl soundtracks to both popular films and cult hits. Recent soundtrack releases include Fight Club, the Back to the Future trilogy, Black Sunday, and The Boxtrolls. The Gremlins soundtrack goes on sale on November 30. No pricing has been announced, but based on the price of other Mondo double album releases, it will likely be around $35.

The book, which features 450 photographs of new and old Apple products, is available now from Apple for $199/$299 depending on the size you choose. Popular YouTuber-er DetroitBorg got his hands on a copy of the book and has shared a video of the experience, showing an in-depth look at what the book has to offer… DetroitBorg purchased both the small and large sizes of the ‘Designed by Apple in California’ book, noting that the price is high but not unreasonable in the grand scheme of design books from architecture firms and the like. He also points out that there’s a considerable amount of attention to detail with the book, such as how the pages going all the way to the edge, the detail of the images, and the quality of the cover. The book covers the last 20 years of Apple design, starting at about the time Jony Ive and Steve Jobs started working together. The book itself is incredibly simplistic. There are several blank pages before you get to the first actual words, which are simply ‘Designed by Apple in California’ in small and out-of-the-way text. The next page is the book’s dedication to Steve Jobs, while the page after that is an intro written by Jony Ive. In terms of product images, the first product featured is the first-gem iMac and its bright vivid color options. From there, we continue with the iBook, the Cinema Display, the G4 Cube, the Power Mac G4, and then the PowerBook G4. The book then delves into the original iPod and the production that went into it. From there, the book continues to focus on the various different Macs introduced during the early 2000s. One product that gets a notable amount of attention in the book is the iPod Hi-Fi. The speaker system gets multiple pages in the book, which seems interesting considering it never really took off in terms of popularity. The book continues by delving into the MacBook, the continued evolution of the iPod line, the iPhone, and eventually the Apple Watch and Apple Pencil. The Apple Watch is shown in great detail, with the book offering a glimpse at some internal parts as well as all of that effort that went into the design in the first place. At the very back of the book is a removable glossary that you can use as a guide as you move through the book, in case you’re not able to recognize all of the products on your own. You can watch DetroitBorg’s full video below.

A potential acquisition was valued at between $1.3 billion and $1.9 billion though McLaren later said it was “not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment.” Saturday, McLaren CEO Mike Flewitt confirmed in an interview with Reuters that his company did hold talks with Apple after all, but said the discussions never progressed towards a definitive proposition. Here’s what Flewitt told Reuters: There wasn’t a bid from Apple. They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition. The very fact that the luxury sports car maker held a meeting with executives from Apple is a confirmation that the two companies were exploring at least some sort of partnership, if not a full takeover bid from Apple. McLaren is best known as a Formula One constructor, competing as McLaren Honda. The McLaren Formula One team, a wholly owned subsidiary of McLaren Technology Group based at the McLaren Technology Centre in UK’s Woking, Surrey, is the second oldest active team after Ferrari and one of the most successful teams in F1 history, having won 182 races, 12 drivers’ championships and 8 constructors’ championships. Apple’s secretive Project Titan hit a snag when Bob Mansfield, its retired hardware chief, was unretired to oversee the initiative amid a series of executive departures and internal delays. After reportedly shutting down various Project Titan initiatives, the project is understood to have since morphed into autonomous driving software. Apple’s Canadian team is reportedly working on a car OS. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks Apple’s augmented reality solutions it’s been reportedly working on for quite some time now could be part of an autonomous driving system from Apple. For the sake of completeness, Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services at Apple, Eddy Cue, joined Ferrari’s board of directors in November 2012.

As soon as the iPhone 7 was released users began notice a difference in download speeds between the Verizon iPhone 7 which features a Qualcomm MDM9645M LTE modem and the AT&T version which has an Intel XMM7360 modem. Cellular Insights performed tests which concluded that the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm variant. Recently, Bloomberg reported on testing by Twin Prime which determined that although the Verizon model is faster than the Intel model, it still is not as fast as it could be. The Samsung Galaxy S7 which also uses the Qualcomm X12 was about twice as fast as the iPhone 7 running on the same network with the same modem chip. “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” Now, sources tell Re/code that it's true, Apple has limited the speed of the Qualcomm modem in the Verizon iPhone 7 to make it perform at about the same speed as the Intel modem. Apple supposedly did this for a simple reason: It wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having two chip sources but also wanted the different versions of the phone to be as similar as possible (to avoid angering AT&T and T-Mobile and their customers in the U.S., for example). Apple's official comment on the matter: “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models."

Try out a new MBP, iPhone 7, or newer iteration of any Apple product and compare it to other devices in the same genre now on the market. The MBP used to lead the way for powerhouse computers. Not any more. Also, check out the Facebook page "FireTimCook". It's a chronological record of how Apple is dying under the helm of this exceedingly boring, dull and small-minded idiot. Reply · Like · Mark as Spam The iDevice Pro - 1 hour ago Just like he took the "Pro" out of the MacBook Pro this year, Tim Cook is also destroying the iPhone. It's both sad and disgusting at the same time. If he isn't stopped, the MacBook will become no better than the PC and the iPhone will become no better than an Android. Or maybe it's already to that point, but as an avid Apple supporter for so many years, I just don't want to see or believe it. What's next, Tim? Bastardize OS X (macOS) as well? Make it installable on all platforms just so you can get more money? He is destroying the brand that was once so great. Something needs to be done to stop him before it's too late, if it isn't already. I have never disliked anyone as much as I dislike Tim Cook. To destroy something that was so wonderful, beautiful and cherished by so many for the sake of revenue...no....GREED is atrocious.

But Apple will still have to push hard to reach supply-demand balance by the end of December. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Nov 19, 2016 at 11:35AM Since launching its latest generation of iPhones two months ago, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen solid but not spectacular demand for the smaller iPhone 7. Adoption has been somewhat slower than for the iPhone 6s, but not dramatically so. iPhone 7 shipments have probably peaked already, according to respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. By contrast, iPhone 7 Plus demand has been off the charts, catching Apple off guard. The iPhone maker has been working hard to ramp up iPhone 7 Plus production. These efforts are starting to yield results, but Apple still has a long way to go to meet demand during the key holiday season. iPhone 7 Plus demand still exceeds supply by a wide margin. Image source: The Motley Fool. Supply shortages are common It's not unusual for Apple to face long-running supply shortages for its most popular products. For example, in late 2014, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus demand significantly outpaced Apple's expectations. In the U.S. Apple's online store was quoting a wait of three to four weeks for the iPhone 6 Plus as late as mid-November. Apple ultimately sold 74.5 million iPhones during that quarter, up a stunning 46% year over year. It did so despite supply lagging demand right through the end of the quarter. For the iPhone 7 Plus, 2016 is shaping up to be a repeat of 2014. On Apple's earnings call last month, CEO Tim Cook candidly told analysts that he wasn't sure Apple would be able to meet all of the demand for the iPhone 7 Plus by year-end. To some extent, conservatism in Apple's initial planning may be to blame for the iPhone 7 Plus shortage. Earlier this year, Apple ended up with too much iPhone inventory. In trying to avoid a repeat of that problem, it may have gone too far in the other direction. However, the recall and discontinuation of Samsung's competing Galaxy Note 7 has probably also boosted iPhone 7 Plus demand. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7's demise may be boosting iPhone 7 Plus demand. Image source: Apple. Adoption rises steadily Since the iPhone 7 Plus went on sale two months ago, adoption has been rising steadily. During the first month of availability, iPhone 7 Plus sales easily outpaced the sales pace set by the iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 6 Plus in the last two years. If anything, the second month of sales was even better. iPhone 7 Plus adoption has sped up somewhat in the last month, according to both Fiksu and Mixpanel. The change is small enough that it could just be the result of measurement error. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that Apple's attempts to increase iPhone production are working. For the iPhone 7, supply has more or less caught up to demand, with good availability both in stores and online. For the iPhone 7 Plus, both the weekly sales rate and retail inventories appear to be rising modestly. A massive iPhone 7 Plus backlog remains Despite some improvements in the past month, iPhone 7 Plus demand still outstrips supply by a wide margin. As of the middle of this week, Apple was still quoting a three- to four-week wait for all iPhone 7 Plus models in its online store. It has since reduced that estimate to two to three weeks. This is almost exactly the same timing as 2014, when the iPhone 6 Plus lead time was quoted as three to four weeks until the week before Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, retail availability appears to be very thin, at least at the Apple Store. A handful of U.S. Apple Stores didn't have a single iPhone 7 Plus in stock as of Friday morning. In general, most Apple Stores are out of stock on most iPhone 7 Plus configurations, especially for the more popular wireless carriers. Will supply catch up to demand by year-end? With less than a week left to Black Friday, iPhone 7 Plus retail inventories are still thin and the wait time for online orders remains quite long. This looks very similar to the situation two years ago, when Apple couldn't fully meet demand during the holiday quarter but caught up during January. Two years ago, iPhone 6 supply didn't catch up to demand until January. Image source: Apple. One potential wrinkle is that several major U.S. retailers are including the iPhone 7 Plus in their Black Friday promotions. For example, both Target and Best Buy are offering $250 gift cards with the purchase of an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus on an installment billing program. Perhaps these third-party retailers have secured more of Apple's scarce iPhone 7 Plus shipments recently to support their Black Friday marketing plans. If so, it's possible that supply at the Apple Store could quickly improve in late November and early December. However, even if that's true, Apple will have to race to catch up to demand by the end of the quarter. Apple is clearly benefiting from strong iPhone 7 Plus demand. This should bolster its gross margin, as well as the iPhone average selling price. But it's still a toss-up as to whether Apple will reap the full benefit this quarter or if some sales will be pushed into January.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Touch Disease Class Action Lawsuit to Continue as the Lead Plaintiff Calls Apple's Latest Offer 'Pitiful' | Main November 19, 2016 Taiwan's Largest Industrial Conglomerate now Considering Opening Plants in America if Trump Reintroduces Tariffs   On Thursday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Reportedly Preparing a Responsible U.S. iPhone Plant Back-Up Business Plan." With President Elect Trump in office he'll be able to reduce business taxes from 35% to 15% because Congress and the Senate have Republican majorities. This will be great for investors, businesses and specifically Apple's bottom line. It would also allow Apple to bring their foreign profits home that are currently parked overseas because of the currently high tax rate that Apple is refusing to accept. The catch, if you will for reducing corporate taxes, is to encourage companies to manufacture their products now being made in Mexico, China, Vietnam and elsewhere where they can tap into slave labor. Trump's win is now sinking in and businesses fear a possible future 35-40% tariff on foreign products. While Apple is at least investigating a U.S. plant with Foxconn, others like Samsung and LG are thinking of moving their plants in Mexico to the U.S. This week we also heard from other Taiwanese businesses considering plant openings in the U.S. instead of Vietnam. This certainly proves that it was always possible but that previous U.S. Presidents supported lobbyist driven one-way trade agreements that killed U.S. jobs. In a flash we see that America's market is so big that no company wants to be left on the outside. America still holds the cards and a negotiator like Trump knows that all too well. America could be back in the driver's seat and bring back jobs for all Americans, not just Silicon Valley.   Now we're learning that instead of investing in Vietnam, some Taiwanese companies who don't want to lose their biggest customers in America are willing to open plants in the U.S. They don't whine like so many in Silicon Valley, because business is business and you change with the reality you're dealt with.   Case in point, a new Asian report on Friday pointed out that "Taiwanese companies across the petrochemical, textile and footwear industries are assessing whether they need to move some production to the U.S., as President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to impose a stiff tariff on imports.   Sandy Wang, a senior executive at Formosa Plastics Group, said Taiwan's largest industrial company is evaluating whether it would be worthwhile to invest more in the world's biggest economy.   Wang told the Asian publication that "We have already created 6,000 job opportunities in the U.S., and we would consider investing more in the U.S. if the environment for investment is welcoming."   The report further noted that "Sandy Wang, daughter of the Taiwanese conglomerate's late founder Wang Yung-ching, described Trump as practical and intelligent."   Wang's words came after her group said earlier this year that it would spend as much as $9.4 billion to build a new ethane cracker in the U.S. state of Louisiana, looking to maximizing the benefits of cheap shale gas. The project is pending approval by local environmental regulators. The plant will process ethane, a component of natural gas found in shale, and extract ethylene, used in the production of plastics.   The Taiwanese group has two similar facilities in Texas that produce 1.66 million tons of ethylene yearly. The company also is building a third manufacturing site in Texas that is set to yield 1.2 million tons of ethylene as of 2018.   Formosa Plastics Group holds a number of local stock market heavyweights under its umbrella, including Formosa Plastics, Formosa Petrochemical and Nanya Technology.   However, the U.S. president-elect's protectionist views and pledge to slap a 45% import duty on goods from China have some Taiwanese textile and footwear manufacturers worried, as their production costs could rise dramatically if Trump fulfills his campaign promise.   As the market closed Friday, shares of major Taiwanese apparel maker Eclat Textile were down almost 10% since Trump's victory Nov. 8. Stock prices also have fallen 5.5% for Pou Chen, the world's largest contract footwear maker, and 11.4% for smaller rival Feng Tay Enterprises over the same period.   Eclat, Pou Chen and Feng Tay all have big manufacturing bases in Vietnam and are expanding operations in the Southeast Asian nation, possibly hoping to benefit from Vietnam's status as a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that aims to create the world's largest free trade block.   However, under a Trump presidency the U.S. is unlikely to ratify the TPP, which was championed by President Barack Obama.   Roger Lo, vice president and spokesperson for Eclat, told the Asian publication that his company is watching whether Trump follows through on campaign pledges and forces more goods to be made at home, carrying the "Made in America" label.   Eclat is a supplier to Nike, Under Armour, Costco, JCPenney and other global retailing brands.   "If the Trump administration does raise tariffs, it's inevitable for almost every textile maker including us to think about it and to conduct a thorough evaluation whether the company should move some plants to the U.S.," Lo said.   Lo said he would not exclude any possibilities as long as business opportunities exist. Instead of investing in Vietnam, the investment would be made in the U.S.   "Nothing is impossible," said an executive with a contract footwear maker. "If it's a trend and if some major clients want us to make more products in the U.S., we would have to move there."   Of course prices would rise if products were to be made in the U.S. to maintain profits, but if it means bringing back jobs to the U.S. the compromise will be worth it to working families. If you don't have a job, you don't buy anything other than basics.   At the end of the day, I find it mind boggling to see how foreign companies are already making it clear in local publications that they will seriously consider opening plants in the U.S. if conditions are right so as to not lose American business.   Just the mere thought of being locked out of America has real and responsible business people in Taiwan and around the world switch on a dime to bringing plants to America. That alone is amazing that Donald Trump could instill this reaction so quickly.   It's a trump-card that America has always held but greedy U.S. companies just couldn't resist returning to the days of slave labor without unions. To move their plants to these slave labor rich countries and sell their products back to Americans tax free was a dream come true.   So it was great to hear that foreign companies see it differently. They don't want to lose the American consumer and they'll put people to work in America to keep that business. What a refreshing story it was to read this week and I'm sure many of you have enjoyed hearing about it too.   Here's to hoping that President-Elect Trump ends these one-way trade deals so that America can bring jobs home and begin paying off its drowning debt.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « California Builder Creates Community Homes with Slick HomeKit Smart Home Packages Available | Main | Taiwan's Largest Industrial Conglomerate now Considering Opening Plants in America if Trump Reintroduces Tariffs » November 19, 2016 The Touch Disease Class Action Lawsuit to Continue as the Lead Plaintiff Calls Apple's Latest Offer 'Pitiful'   Late on Thursday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Formally Acknowledges the iPhone 6 Plus 'Touch Disease' Issue and Offers Customers with this Problem Some Relief." While Apple opened a new program to deal with the issue this week that would provide some Apple customers a bit of financial relief, I questioned whether that would be enough relief for the law firms handling the class action lawsuits to back off. The answer, at least involving one class action, is clearly no.   A Canadian report published today reacts to Apple's newly announced touch disease program. According to the report, "Apple is finally offering a cure for its iPhone 6 Plus models plagued by so-called "touch disease." The affliction causes the phone's screen to freeze up and no longer respond to touch commands.   The fix will cost American customers $149 US. Canadians will have to shell out $189.   The move follows months of customer complaints about touch disease and multiple proposed class action lawsuits filed against Apple over the issue.   But while Apple is offering a fix, some customers are dismayed to discover the company is charging a fee and placing the blame on them.   According to Apple arises after the phone has been dropped "multiple times on a hard surface" and then is subjected to "further stress."   'Pitiful' Offer   iPhone owner Trina Rae Wiegers from Prince Albert, Sask responded to Apple's offer by saying "I think it's pitiful." She claims that many smartphones get dropped, so if that's the culprit, lots of different iPhone models should be suffering from the same problem – but aren't. "You can't just pick one and say apparently people are just dropping the 6 Pluses."   Wiegers owns an iPhone 6, which she believes also suffers from touch disease. She says it periodically freezes up and becomes useless. "You miss calls, you can't text, it's a horrible piece of crap."   Even if she could get the fix, Wiegers claims she would never pay $189. "It's ridiculous," she says. "It's their problem and they need to own up to it." $189 fee for show?   Wiegers is the lead plaintiff in a proposed Canadian class action lawsuit launched against Apple over touch disease.   A total of four proposed class-actions have been filed, two in Canada and two in the U.S. involving both iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners.   "It's a design defect, so to charge $189 to fix their problem is simply atrocious," claims Regina lawyer Tony Merchant, who's heading up the Canadian lawsuits.   He alleges both the 6 and 6 Plus were designed in a way that even the slightest bend results in a disconnect in the phone, causing the screen to no longer respond to touch.   Merchant claims Apple came up with a fee for the fix not because it needed the cash but to create the impression touch disease is not its fault.   "Their motive is to maintain the pretense that they didn't design a defective phone," he alleges.   "What they ought to be doing is fixing all of [them] without charge and pay compensation to people who've lost the use of their phone."   In order to proceed, all four class actions must first be certified in court. Apple would not comment on the proposed suits.

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Nov 19, 2016 at 9:27AM Image Source: Fitbit The demand for simple wearables, such as most of Fitbit's (NYSE:FIT) fitness trackers, soared through the first half of the year, as high-end smartwatches from companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell out of favor. But the tide is turning, as Fitbit forecast "softness in overall demand" for the fourth quarter. The timing of Fitbit's lower-than-expected sales forecast coincides with the release of Apple's updated Apple Watch. Apple's wearable sales fell 57% in the second quarter after lapping the launch of the original Apple Watch, and sales fell 72% in the third quarter as customers waited for an update, according to data from IDC. But with the update arriving in September, it could have had a meaningful impact on Fitbit's demand as they compete for similar customers. The problem actually started last quarter While Fitbit in early November reported third-quarter results in line with analysts' expectations, it benefited from pulling forward sales of its Charge 2 device. Fitbit was able to ramp up production of the successor to its best-selling device faster than anticipated, allowing it to ship more units to stores ahead of schedule. At the end of September, Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson noted that Charge 2 units were piling up on the shelves. The faster ramp-up in production explains that trend, somewhat countering his conclusion that it was the result of low demand. But Fitbit's fourth-quarter outlook indicates that Erickson was at least partially correct. Although the pull-forward of Charge 2 units offset poor sales of other devices in the third quarter, management's outlook for the fourth quarter shows significantly slowing growth in consumer demand from the year before. CFO Bill Zerellal told analysts, "Our guidance basically assumes 15% to 20% growth -- in dollar growth -- in consumer demand in Q4, year on year." In the fourth quarter of 2015, Fitbit's revenue nearly doubled. Due to the pull-forward of Charge 2 sales, revenue growth will lag consumer demand. Analysts are currently projecting just 4% revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Is Apple to blame? Apple released the update to its Apple Watch in mid-September, and it had much more of a fitness focus than its predecessor. But Apple's device has a much higher starting price than any of Fitbit's products. The Fitbit Blaze, its highest-priced product, starts at just $200, while the Apple Watch Series 2 starts at $369. Fitbit's average selling price was just $93 last quarter. Still, Apple has generally broad appeal and strong brand recognition compared to Fitbit. And it's looking to take advantage of the same market opportunity Fitbit's management was keen to point out during its earnings call. "Sixty-six percent of people in the U.S. care about health and fitness and have a smartphone or computer tablet," CEO James Park told analysts. "However, only 20% of U.S. adults in a recent independent survey indicated that they own a connected health and fitness device." Apple, with U.S. smartphone market share over 40%, is in a much better position than Fitbit to take advantage of that gap. The increased overlap in utility between the Series 2 and Fitbit's products could be dampening demand. Additionally, Park noted, "We believe Fitbit has a key role to play in the healthcare ecosystem in how healthcare is practiced." To that end, Apple is also making progress. On the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Tim Cook pointed out that Aetna "announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch for individual customers and select large employers." While Apple Watch sales have generally been disappointing to most analysts, that doesn't mean they can't have an impact on Fitbit's sales. Regardless, the outlook from Fitbit is rather bleak, and the stock market responded in kind. Even with the depressed stock price, Fitbit's bleak outlook on demand and vagueness around its ability to compete with Apple and other high-end devices makes its stock unappealing.

 Apple should buy Snap Kif Leswing Nov. 19, 2016, 9:00 AM 8,143 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook has said several times in the last year that his company is willing to look at and consider billion-dollar acquisitions with its $237 billion war chest. Most of the possibilities floated by analysts and the press don't make a lot of sense: Time Warner, Disney, Tesla Motors. Some are saying Apple needs to think differently, and make one big, crazy acquisition, before it's too late. An acquisition that would change the company forever. I think Apple should buy Snap, Snapchat's parent company.  The timing is now Why not? REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Why would Snap founder Evan Spiegel want to sell his company to Apple? Money.  Snap filed for a confidential IPO earlier this week, Business Insider learned, that could value the company between $20 billion and $25 billion. The actual paperwork, including Snap's revenue, profit (or lack thereof), and assets has yet to surface.  But the fact that Snap filed confidentially reveals one fact: Snap's revenue is less than $1 billion. Even assuming big league revenue growth for the disappearing photo messenger, that's a surprisingly large valuation.  That doesn't matter to Apple, and the company could afford a nice premium over the $25 billion the public market could value Snap at. Apple could afford Snap even if it were valued at $50 billion.  Spiegel has expressed doubt that advertising is the growth engine that will propel Snap to become a massive technology company. "Feed based advertising units will plummet in value ... similar to earlier devaluing of Internet display advertising," he wrote in an email stolen during the Sony hack.  If Snapchat's advertising strategy doesn't work out, it could destroy much of the worth currently locked into Snap shares held by Spiegel and other founders. That's why Spiegel seems to be pivoting his company towards becoming a hardware provider, even going so far as to call Snap a "camera company" on its own website. It's also why Snap has started to sell Spectacles, a surprising new product that combines stylish sunglasses with a camera.  There's no company that understands making and selling premium hardware better than Apple.  First glass Spectacles. Hollis Johnson The hype around Spectacles, Snapchat's first real hardware product, reminds me of the hype that used to surround Apple product launches.  Every time Snap's custom-built, Minion-looking vending machine touches down somewhere — three times in California so far, and once in Oklahoma — a line immediately forms, full of people waiting to buy the $129 glasses.  Apple used to have a following like that, and to some extent still does, but there is an excitement to the Spectacles launch that Apple has not had in a long time. Just look at the lines. That's because Spiegel carefully planned this launch. He understands the importance of marketing, and limited rollouts, and how important it is to make something cool that people want.  And that's the key — Spectacles are the first piece of tech worn on the face that is actually cool.  "From the first moment of opening the lid to pairing the Spectacles with my phone, they were everything I hoped they'd be: well-designed, stylish, fun, and easy to use. Walking around New York City with them, I felt like part of an exclusive club," my colleague Avery Hartmans wrote earlier this week. "Regardless of how you feel about Snapchat's new camera-equipped glasses, one thing is certain: Snapchat's marketing team is genius," she wrote.  News broke this week that Apple is working on a pair of stylish smart glasses that could launch as soon as 2018. It's still early, but it seems like Snap has already solved the biggest problem with wearable computers on the face: getting people to want to wear them. Snapchat's glasses are only a camera for now, but it's not hard to see where the company is going with them — a fully functional AR device that could be competing with Apple Glasses in a few years.  Apple could eliminate a major competitor and gain a great head start to its glasses project at the same time. Why Apple would want Snap  Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel speaks onstage during 'Disrupting Information and Communication' at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California. Getty/Michael Kovac The fact that Snap doesn't have much revenue yet actually makes the company attractive to Apple.  Cook says all the time that Apple doesn't buy companies for their cash flow — Apple has plenty of that itself. Instead, Cook says, Apple is looking for "great talent and great intellectual property." Snap has both.  Snap is growing quickly and now has a varied and eclectic pool of talented engineers, especially in the fields of computer vision and AI, two fields which Apple is investing heavily in.  Some of Snap's top employees even used to work at Apple. Snap also has some great intellectual property. People in the augmented reality industry say its in-house developed emoji tracking feature is genuinely impressive, and could be a building block for future applications. Snap's face-transforming Snapchat "Lens" filters are probably the most widely used example of computer vision-powered augmented reality at the moment. via GIPHY That's pretty attractive intellectual property for a company that is is getting into augmented reality in a big way. Plus, it's undeniable that Snap is tapped into young people in a way that Apple, led by its team of mostly older men, is not.   Plus, Apple is reportedly developing a Snapchat-like video app. Why clone, when you can have the original?  Spiegel might not sell — but he does emulate Apple founder Steve Jobs Evan Spiegel/Twitter There are a few issues with this proposal. First, Snap is an LA-based company, so Apple couldn't buy it with overseas cash at a discount — one of the main factors driving the company's M&A strategy at the moment.  But the bigger problem is that Spiegel probably doesn't want to sell. He famously turned down an offer from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to buy his company for billions of dollars in 2013. (He also previously blew off Zuck with a surprisingly cold email.)  If Speigel, who is 26, sold Snap to Apple, Apple should make him the CEO. After all, Apple has had a 26-year old CEO before: Steve Jobs.  The key to Spiegel is that he is a product "Picasso," as people who know him have said. He studied product design at Stanford, and Business Insider has been told that Snap's office vibe is like "a movie director starting a company, with artists flowing in and out" — similar to how Apple's famously secretive industrial design studio operates.  Apple would do well with a product-focused guru at its helm. Cook is fantastic at running the company, but Apple was built around the whims and taste of one man — Jobs — who was intensely focused on building products. A file photo of Steve Jobs with the Snapchat Spectacles filter applied. Reuters/Business Insider Today, with chief design officer Jony Ive increasingly looking backwards and working on side projects, there's a sense that there isn't anyone at Apple who's in charge of the product anymore.  Speigel — who resembles Steve Jobs in his showmanship, his obsession with secrecy, and his focus on products and experience — would be able to give Apple some clarity when it comes to its AR and glasses strategy, and probably has an idea or two about how to make the next iPhone better beyond giving it faster chips and taking away the headphone jack.  But Apple should hurry. Snap could list as soon as March — and in a few years, it could be one of Apple's fiercest competitors.  SEE ALSO: REVIEW: Snapchat's Spectacles AND: Tim Cook laid out the playbook for Apple's next big thing CAN'T MISS: If you think it's crazy that Snapchat might go public at a $40 billion valuation, here's something to consider AND: Meet the power players who run Snapchat DON'T MISS: Apple has a secret team working to make the iPhone's camera a portal to augmented reality PLUS: What it’s like to work at Snapchat, one of the most secretive companies in tech NOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone Loading video...

The Perfect Stock For Uncertain Times (AAPL) AAPL stock is an undervalued giant investors should consider today By , Street Authority  |  Nov 19, 2016, 9:00 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Apple Inc. The Perfect Stock For Uncertain Times (AAPL) Recent Posts: Apple Inc. The Perfect Stock For Uncertain Times (AAPL) The Hidden Upside In The Coming Mexican Crisis (HPQ, GE, GSK) Trump’s Policies May Mean A Reversal For This Threatened Industry (CXW) View All Posts While most polls got the outcome of the presidential election wrong, one prominent analyst called it exactly right. On Oct. 31, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, told CNBC that the S&P 500′s 2.2% decline from the end of July through the end of October indicated that Trump should win. Historically, a decline in stock prices over those three months has forecast a win for the candidate from the party that is not in the White House. Stovall noted this indicator was correct in seven of the eight past instances, a win rate of more than 87%. Statistically, you could argue the sample size is too small to be meaningful, but the logic behind the indicator is simple. A rising stock market reflects a public that is most likely happy with the economy. Because they are generally satisfied with the way things are, they vote for more of the same. On the other hand, a declining stock market reflects pessimism. People are either selling or not buying stocks because they’re worried about the future. When they vote, they want a change. This indicator proved to be right once again, and even though we now know Donald Trump will be our next president, there is still plenty of uncertainty about our future. In times of such uncertainty, our best bet is healthy stocks that the market seems to be undervaluing. And that’s exactly the case with Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple’s products are well known, and the company is widely followed on Wall Street, with 41 of the 48 analysts publishing opinions on the stock rating it a “buy” or better. Yet, AAPL appears to be undervalued on a number of fundamental metrics, most likely because the company’s performance is easy to interpret different ways. When it comes to Apple, bad news and good news are often mixed together. Take this CNET headline about Apple’s recent earnings report for example: “iPhone sales slump. Apple still raking in billions.” The company reported its third successive quarter of declining iPhone sales (bad news), but the 45.5 million iPhones sold in the quarter beat analysts’ estimates of 44.8 million (good news). However, this represented a 13% year-over-year decline (bad news again). The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World Total revenue for the quarter was $46.9 billion, and the company’s net profit was $9 billion, or $1.67 per share, all of which was down year over year, but still indicative of strong financial health. Analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) of $9.04 for fiscal 2017 (ending in September) and $10.07 for fiscal 2018. Earnings growth is expected to average 8.7% a year over the next five years, which is an attractive growth rate for a stable, mature company in the current environment.

According to offer documents obtained by Gadgets360, Citibank customers can get up to Rs. 23,000 cashback on purchasing an iPhone and an iPad together. The offer is available in select offline Apple-authorised stores in India, a move to strengthen its presence in the second largest smartphone market.

Customers can avail the offer to a maximum of four times, and only two of which can be carried out in a month. This means, customers buying an iPhone and an iPad with Rs. 23,000 discount twice this month will be able to replicate the same next month. But they cannot avail the offer four times in December alone. Since the offer is a combo deal, the iPhone and iPad must be purchased from the same store on the same day, using the same card. The cashback will be credited to the buyer's credit card within 90 days of purchase. If the customer purchases an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, cashbacks on iPads are as follows: iPad mini 2: Rs. 17,000 cashback iPad mini 4: Rs. 17,000 cashback iPad Pro: Rs. 23,000 cashback iPad Air 2: Rs. 18,000 cashback The cashbacks also work in reverse, which means if customers buy an iPad, the corresponding cashback will be applied for iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus purchase.

Jahns @adamjahns | email Sign-Up for our Sports Newsletter  Sign-Up Adam L. Jahns’ “Inside the Huddle” column appears in game-day editions of the Sun-Times. Rookie outside linebacker Leonard Floyd still remembers what he felt when the Bears traded up to select him in the draft. He was elated but stressed. “It’s a good thing,” Floyd said. “But it’s also a lot of pressure. I mean, they traded up to get you for a reason.” Bears OLB Leonard Floyd celebrates vs. the Vikings. (Getty) That trade takes center stage this week. It’s widely thought that Floyd was a top target for the New York Giants, who owned the 10th pick. In a bold draft-day move, the Bears jumped ahead of the Giants, acquiring the No. 9 pick from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the 11th pick and a fourth-round selection. Coach John Fox downplayed the significance of the decision, referring to all the “bogus” information involved in the draft. But it might go down as one of general manager Ryan Pace’s best moves. Floyd has been that impressive. After some early struggles attributable to minor injuries, Floyd has blossomed into an every-down difference-maker. He’s the main reason to believe in what the Bears are building. In the last three games, Floyd has 4½ sacks and three tackles for loss. He also a forced fumble by Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and recovered it for a touchdown. “He’s obviously a very talented young man,” Giants coach Bob McAdoo said during a conference call with the Chicago media. The story in New York was that the Bears’ trade left the Giants spinning. It was reported that the Giants had Floyd and offensive tackle Jack Conklin in mind for the No. 10 pick. The Tennessee Titans drafted Conklin with the eighth selection after they also traded up. The Giants selected cornerback Eli Apple — a move that was heavily criticized at the time. Apple has had typical growing pains. He responded from a Week  9 benching against the Philadelphia Eagles with a more complete performance in a 21-20 victory last week against the Cincinnati Bengals. “Eli’s done a nice job,” McAdoo said. “He had some bumps in the road a couple of weeks ago. But we dusted him off. We threw him back out there last week, and he played at a high level. He had some production, covered well.” But Apple’s story also includes his mother, Annie, a writer for SI.com, who has criticized the Giants this season. “I try to handle my own messaging with the team and not necessarily worry about the noise,” McAdoo said when asked about Apple and his mother. “But he seems like he’s handling it just fine.” It’s a recurring distraction the Bears don’t have, though. And they also have Floyd’s surging production. The Giants’ defense only has 14 sacks, the second-fewest in the league. Safety Landon Collins is tied with defensive end Olivier Vernon — the Giants’ free-agent prize who received a five-year, $85 million deal — for the team lead with three sacks. Floyd still is improving in one-on-one pass-rush situations. But defensive coordinator Vic Fangio has tapped into his skills through designed pressures and stunts. Overall, Floyd has emerged as a unique and versatile weapon for Fangio, who’s not afraid to have him cover a slot receiver, rush him over a guard or loop him around two teammates on a stunt. “This is probably the longest stretch of practice and the subsequent games that he’s had since he’s been here [because of injuries],” Fangio said, “so you’re seeing progress on the field.” But it’s progress highlighted by the production the Bears envisioned since draft day. “I’ve said all along that there’s an uncoachable skill set that he has, that it’s just a matter of time until he gets comfortable,” Fox said. “He’s going to be a very, very good young player.” EXTRA POINTS Go and get it With Alshon Jeffery suspended, Cameron Meredith is the Bears’ No. 1 receiver, but can he make No. 1-like receiver plays? Quarterback Jay Cutler said he can and that includes 50/50 jump balls. “He’s a long guy in one-on-ones,” Cutler said. “His favorite route is a go route, so he can definitely do it. “We’re going to be in a position going forward in these next four games where we’re going to have to take some shots at some point, and he’s definitely a candidate for that.” Even though he’s 6-3 and has long arms, Meredith really hasn’t shown it yet. When Kevin White was placed on injured reserve, Meredith slid into the No. 2 role and the offense didn’t change. But it will with Jeffery out. Meredith excelled in plays that were typically designed for White. Before his 50-yard Hail Mary touchdown, Meredith’s longest receptions went for 30 and 36 yards, respectively, against the Colts and Jaguars. But both were short completions, not jump balls. The 30-yarder was the result of short curl route and broken tackles. The 36-yarder was a well-executed screen. This rookie will play Rookie defensive lineman Jonathan Bullard will start his second consecutive game with Mitch Unrein sidelined by a back injury. Bullard has improved over time, but he’s still not reacting to plays and his reads as quickly as the Bears want. His coveted fast first-step has been slower because he’s over-thinking. “It’s getting better,” Bullard said. “I still think sometimes about taking certain chances and stuff where they’re telling me to just ahead and play. “I try to just play now. I still think about certain things that I shouldn’t and that they don’t want me thinking about. But that’s just going to come with time.” Let this rookie play Rookie safety Deon Bush’s development has lagged behind other rookies since he injured his hamstring in the preseason. But the Bears are starting to phase in the fourth-round pick, getting him snaps in the dime package. It’s only amounted to eight plays over the past four games, but it’s a start. “He’s doing better, taking baby steps,” defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said. “Maybe he’ll warrant some more action as we move forward.” NUMBERS GAME 75.7 – The average passer rating of opposing quarterbacks have against the Giants.

November 19, 2016 5:28 AM   Subscribe Trying to set up Apple Pay on a new iPhone SE has been a huge and aggravating and unsuccessful time sink. It "Just Fails". If you use Apple Pay, do you like it? How often do you use it? In what circumstances do you still pull out a credit card? After 9+ hours of phone time with Apple support and card issuer support, turns out the card I use daily is not eligible for Apple Pay because it was issued to me several years ago to replace a "partner" card. Apple does not support "partner" cards. Obtained new, the card is fine with Apple Pay. But, my card, in effect, was grandfathered back to the "partner" card. The card issuer has no solution other than applying for a new card. A second card with a different card issuer can't be activated because the card issuer is texting a verification code to the wrong number. They "don't know" why, so they've opened ticket. posted by justcorbly to Computers & Internet (27 answers total)   Apple Pay saves me those annoying seconds waiting for the chip cards to do their thing, and I like having my purchase amount showing up on my phone screen to remind me what I've spent. I use it at the pharmacy and the grocery store. I would have to use it for decades, though, for it to add up to hours of time savings! Sounds like maybe you should wait until you happen to get a new credit card, for other reasons, and then try again. posted by wyzewoman at 6:38 AM on November 19 I do use Apple Pay, started making a point of using it when available. I'd say it works better than a physical card 3/4 of the time. I find it's easier to take my phone out of my pocket than fish my card out of the wallet. I also like that many Apple Pay POS systems have no printed receipt and no signature required. Although that's not consistent. The only thing I don't like is the spooky magic UI for activating the card payment; I'm still not sure what hand gesture is required on the iPhone to bring it up. Double tap the home screen? Unlock the phone? Just hold it close to an Apple Pay device? No idea. I like it, but I wouldn't have jumped through a lot of hoops to set it up. I never had any trouble with the setup, my Visa card just worked. posted by Nelson at 6:39 AM on November 19 I find Apple Pay to be a convenience, but not one that I would go through the inconvenience you're going through to have. The thing I like most is that I don't have to fumble around in my purse to take out/replace my card when I'm also dealing with packages/bags, and it's quick so there's no awkward waiting for the chip to go through. posted by DoubleLune at 7:31 AM on November 19 [1 favorite] I use it fairly often and like it a lot. It does depend a lot on the specific places you shop, though. For example, my main grocery store takes Apple Pay but none of the other grocery stores nearby do. Would I apply for a brand new card just to use Apple Pay? Probably not. But I think it's a good idea in general to have more than just one card, if for no other reason than that it gives you a backup if the main one won't work. So, if I were in your shoes, I'd kill two birds with one stone -- apply for another card that will both serve as a backup, and work with Apple Pay. FWIW, I have six cards in Apple Pay from basically all of the major US issuers, and none took more than a minute or so to set up. posted by primethyme at 7:34 AM on November 19 [3 favorites] Sorry, one other thing. If something is causing the Apple Pay verifications to go to the wrong phone number, I'd be more worried about that than about getting a card that works. I've never heard of that happening, and it would make me worry that something is deeply wrong with the configuration of your device or account somewhere, which may have other implications. Was this a used device? Was the number ported between carriers? Are you using a non-standard SIM card? I don't know what would cause this, but I'd like to revise my "if I were in your shoes." I would prioritize figuring out what is going on there, and getting it fixed, even if you decide you don't care about Apple Pay. If someone else is receiving verification notifications that should be going to you, there are a lot of potentially bad scenarios... posted by primethyme at 7:41 AM on November 19 [3 favorites] primethyme: the bank is (allegedly) sending the verification messages. The Apple device, or Apple itself, is not involved in rhthe verification process. posted by sideshow at 8:04 AM on November 19 I like having a payment method set up on my phone in case I lose or forget my wallet. posted by Candleman at 8:15 AM on November 19 [1 favorite] the bank is (allegedly) sending the verification messages. Yes, sorry, I misread the OP. Disregard that part (though I'd still be wanting to know why one of my banks is sending my info to someone else's number). posted by primethyme at 8:16 AM on November 19 [1 favorite] I use it all the time - all the grocery stores and drug stores I use have it. I use my card instead...when a place doesn't have ApplePay. My phone is quicker than the chip verification process, I don't have to take out my wallet and fumble around, there's no risk I'll forget/drop/lose my card. I had no trouble setting it up. I don't know what a "partner" card is but it sounds like your troubles aren't really about ApplePay. You need to fix whatever is wrong with that 2nd card anyway, so once that's done, just set up ApplePay there. posted by donnagirl at 8:26 AM on November 19 [5 favorites] I use it but only on the Apple Watch. It has never let me down and is probably the best thing about the watch, especially for going on public transport. Recommend. posted by Coda Tronca at 8:33 AM on November 19 [2 favorites] I like it for stuff like uber, hoteltonight, dunkin donuts, starbucks, etc- many of these apps can hit apple pay directly, and the app vendors don't get my CC#, so I can control when the card reloads, etc. posted by jenkinsEar at 8:44 AM on November 19 [2 favorites] I have never had a single problem adding cards to Apple Pay and the only problem using it is that most stores around here don't accept it. Your experience is atypical. Forget that card and try another one. posted by w0mbat at 8:46 AM on November 19 [2 favorites] I like and use Apple Pay. You can use it anywhere the contactless payment symbol appears on the credit card terminal. It's much more convenient than digging in my bag for a wallet, and then waiting for the chip and pin dance. And the retailer doesn't receive you actual card number, so you're not hit by security breaches. Someone above mentioned not being sure how to trigger it. To trigger Apple Pay, from the lock screen double tap the home button to bring up Apple Pay, and then rest your finger on the button to allow Touch ID to validate your fingerprint. Hope that helps! posted by bluloo at 8:53 AM on November 19 Yeah I have Apple Pay on my watch and phone and really love it. It took me less than 5 minutes to set up on both devices. I use it anywhere I can find Apple Pay at a store. I use it because it's faster, more convenient, and from what I've read, more secure. In my experience, the folks I know who had trouble setting it up are using cards from banks that don't support it. My husband can't use his card for example because it's issued from a small bank and they aren't set up for something like this. posted by FireFountain at 9:10 AM on November 19 I love Apple Pay. I would not go through the aggravation you're going through to make it work. posted by Slarty Bartfast at 9:15 AM on November 19 It's nice, but it's no faster than just tapping with your card. I will often have my phone out if I'm waiting in a line, so it's nice to be able to use it to pay, but it's not quicker than regular tap. posted by Nightman at 10:39 AM on November 19 I love Apple pay for the speed it offers for a transaction. What I don't like about it is the reactions some cashiers will have if they are unfamiliar with the technology. A pet peeve of mine is having to explain how it works over and over again. I honestly think Apple needs to do a better job explaining how it works. posted by 81818181818181818181 at 11:56 AM on November 19 What I don't like about it is the reactions some cashiers will have if they are unfamiliar with the technology. I'm in my 40s and I like using Apple Watch to pay in pubs because the London hipster bar staff all think it's pretty silly (Apple Watch is deeply uncool from start to finish). In one pub they even call me 'Iron Man'. posted by Coda Tronca at 12:00 PM on November 19 [4 favorites] It's handy where it works, but it's less than a third of my transactions. posted by wotsac at 12:33 PM on November 19 It's nice, but it's no faster than just tapping with your card. I will often have my phone out if I'm waiting in a line, so it's nice to be able to use it to pay, but it's not quicker than regular tap. If OP is in the US it's unlikely they have the tap chip; which is one of the reasons Apple/Android Pay, etc, are so easily marketed here. Chiming in with "It's great." I use it everywhere that supports it, which in the US should be everyone by the end of 2016, because they'll need the new terminals that support chip & pin, which almost all support NFC pay. posted by sixfootaxolotl at 12:39 PM on November 19 @PrimeThyme: It's an old number of mine that the card issuer wants to text that verification code. Likely the number I had years ago when I got that card. Why that's happening when the only number anyone can find there is my current number is the thing they don't know. posted by justcorbly at 12:45 PM on November 19 I live in the US, and have never even SEEN the "just tap the card to pay" situation. Here, it's all: 1. Swipe the card, using the mag stripe (legacy only) 2. Use the new time-eating chipreader, which leaks all your info to the merchant in addition to taking longer; or 3. ApplePay, which is both crazy fast AND secure, and leaks very little info to the merchant. Of these options, I take ApplePay every damn time. Since I got an Apple Watch, it's even MORE cool -- especially when I'm off cycling somewhere and want to buy a water or an energy bar. I know which convenience stores take it now. :) posted by uberchet at 12:50 PM on November 19 [1 favorite] I assume you also have an Apple ID? Might that old phone number be attached to that account? posted by Thorzdad at 12:54 PM on November 19 I assume you also have an Apple ID? Might that old phone number be attached to that account? The number comes from the card issuer and not Apple, so that wouldn't be it, unfortunately. posted by sixfootaxolotl at 1:08 PM on November 19 Here in NZ, there's only one bank that uses Apple Pay as the rest are an Australian consortium who are holding out. Needless to say, I opened an account with that bank even though they're hopeless at customer service. Took days to open the account, but now I have I do well over half my transactions through Apple Watch. If they don't have contactless payment then I have to use a card, but I try to avoid those shops that don't accept it. Apple Pay is the way to go for sure. posted by tillsbury at 7:16 PM on November 19 I love Apple Pay as a consumer, and I love customers who use Apple Pay when I am at work. It has made such a difference for me time/convenience wise. Hope you're able to get yours to work! posted by Hermione Granger at 7:51 PM on November 19 I only ever use Apple Pay as a novelty at Whole Foods. It's kind of convenient. The difference between "get phone out and press button" and "get wallet out, remove card, insert into terminal, wait, sign terminal, take card back, and place in wallet" is not that big a deal. Not what I would call "life transforming", but nice. posted by theorique at 9:21 AM on November 20 « Older How strict are antibiotics frequency times?   |   Dyeing hair for the first time ever with ombré -...

Which is progress. However, it’s not accepting the blame for this fault that’s out there right now killing iPhones. What’s more, it’s charging customers to repair the problem. Which is the opposite of progress. In August of this year, a rather serious flaw with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus reared its ugly head.

Read More , this flaw turns your iPhone into a rather expensive brick. What starts out as a flickering gray bar at the top of your touchscreen eventually renders your phone unusable. The clever bods over at iFixit quickly identified the problem, and others have since confirmed the ultimate cause of Touch Disease. It’s claimed it all leads back to the integrated circuit chips which power and control the touchscreen, and the way they’re soldered to the logic board. If this is true, then Touch Disease is caused by a design flaw. Apple changed something, and it may have directly led to iPhones stopping working.

Apple Will Fix Touch Disease… For a Price Apple has stayed silent on this issue for months. If a customer complained that their iPhone had stopped working they were advised to simply buy a new iPhone. So people turned to third-party iPhone repairers instead, who were able to fix Touch Disease without too much hassle. Now, however, Apple has launched its “Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus”. Which sees Apple offering to fix your iPhone for just $149. Unfortunately this only applies to iPhone 6 Plus owners, with Apple still refusing to even admit the iPhone 6 is adversely affected. So why is Apple charging you to fix a problem it caused in the first place? Because Apple is refusing to take the blame, claiming that iPhones are suffering catastrophic failure “after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device”. In other words it’s all your fault. So pay up or else.

In 2007, Nokia recalled 46 million phone batteries, and there have been more than forty other such recalls since 2002. In this article, we’ll explore just what the heck is going on and whether or not you need to worry about this with your own smartphone. Why Do We Use Batteries That Explode? All of our portable electronic devices (i.e. phones, tablets, laptops) use Lithium-ion batteries. Pound for pound, Lithium-ion batteries provide far more energy than other types of batteries — around twice as much as Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries and around six-times as much as the lead-acid batteries used in cars. This is important in an industry where weight (or lack thereof) is a huge selling point. We all want our phones to be as light as possible yet still last at least a full day without recharging — and at the moment, Lithium-ion is the best technology we have that lets us do that. Image Credit: Coprid via Shutterstock But Lithium-ion batteries have a few disadvantages, too. They have a short shelf life, only lasting about 2–3 years from the date of manufacture, and that’s regardless of whether they’re actively used or not. If they fully discharge, they’ll never work again. And occasionally they explode. To understand why this happens, it’s necessary to know a little about how Lithium-ion batteries work internally. Like all modern batteries How a Battery Works and 3 Ways You Can Ruin It How a Battery Works and 3 Ways You Can Ruin It The modern battery is featured in so many of our favourite technologies that you could almost be forgiven for not spending time learning about their workings. Read More , they store and release energy through controlled chemical reactions. A current flows between two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) through chemicals called electrolytes. Lithium is highly reactive, which is what gives these batteries such a high energy density — but it also means that if something goes wrong, the results can be catastrophic. So, What Can Go Wrong? There are a few things that can go wrong with a Lithium-ion battery and they all involve overheating. If one part of the battery gets too hot, then it can lead to a chain reaction known as “thermal runaway” — the whole battery gets hotter and hotter until it ignites or explodes. Because of this, Lithium-ion batteries have an on-board computer to ensure they don’t overheat. If this fails then overheating can occur, especially on a hot day or when the device is being heavily used. Overcharging can also lead to overheating, but again, the battery’s internal computer should prevent this. Unfortunately it may fail to do so, whether due to a manufacturing error or because the computer itself has sustained damage. Image Credit: wk1003mike via Shutterstock The anode and cathode also need to be kept separate or the battery will short circuit, redirecting energy to the electrolytes. In a Lithium-ion battery the electrolytes are highly flammable, and fire or explosion is all but inevitable if this occurs. Why would the electrodes ever touch? Again, maybe because the battery sustained physical damage or because of a manufacturing error (e.g. a defect in the material that separates the electrodes, the introduction of a foreign conducting material, etc). Misusing or abusing the battery can also cause an explosion. Piercing the battery with a sharp object can cause a short circuit, while connecting it to an incorrect charger can cause it to overcharge or charge too quickly, which can lead to a build up of lithium on the electrodes, a short circuit, and ultimately an explosion. What Went Wrong for Samsung? It’s not yet clear exactly what the issue was with the Galaxy Note 7. The company has blamed “a very rare manufacturing process error” which caused the anode and cathode to come into contact. Further investigations are underway. Samsung has stated that none of its other products are affected by this issue, and there have not been a significant number of incidents involving their other products. Remarkably, some people have decided that the Galaxy Note 7 is such a good phone, they’re going to hold onto theirs Some Idiots Are Keeping Their Exploding Samsung Phones Some Idiots Are Keeping Their Exploding Samsung Phones In case you missed the news, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is dead.

Read More on the market, including some of Samsung’s other products. Should You Be Worried? Although the consequences of an exploding battery can be catastrophic, it’s an extremely rare event.  You’re more likely to be struck by lightning  — which would probably also cause your phone to explode! But there are some steps you can take to reduce the odds even further: Only use the original battery, or one from the manufacturer, or a reputable brand. Don’t leave your device in hot areas, particularly while charging. Keep it out of direct sunlight, and make sure it can dissipate heat effectively. Have a protective case for your phone to avoid puncture damage if you drop it. But take the case off if the phone gets too hot. The phone will almost certainly shut down before the battery gets hot enough to ignite, but the heat can still shorten the life of the battery. Do not use a cracked or swollen battery. Remove it from any device and do not attempt to charge it. Dispose of old or damaged batteries responsibly. Take them to a recycling center, or to a electronics retailer who will be able to dispose of them properly.

NEW YORK  Your streaming TV options have gotten better and cheaper. Features that once required a $100 device can now be had for as little as $30. A cheap device is fine for getting TV shows and movies from most popular services onto a big-screen TV  as long as its a regular, high-definition set. Of course, its possible to simply watch video on a phone or tablet, but its not as satisfying from a living-room couch. Heres a holiday buying guide for the TV-streamers in your life. Streaming built-in Smart TVs, game consoles and the TiVo digital video recorder all have streaming apps, and if all you watch is Netflix and Hulu, youll be fine with those. But apps for individual channels such as The CW and FX wont work with every device. The exceptions are TVs running Roku software or that have Googles Chromecast technology built in; they tend to have wider app selections. Getting around Devices vary in how easy it is to access apps and video. While many devices are getting voice features that let you search multiple services at once, youll still need to navigate on-screen menus with a remote. The exception is Chromecast, which has no menu or remote at all. Instead, you start video on an iPhone or Android phone and send it to the big screen with a tap of a cast button. With some video services, the phone is freed up for other things, though youll need to use the phone as a remote for pausing and rewinding. Devices running Googles Android TV come with Chromecast features and pack their menus with video from Googles YouTube service. Amazons Fire TV device has traditionally favored Amazon video over others, though thats changing as Netflix, HBO and other leading services get prominence on the home screen. Roku is the most service-agnostic of the bunch. Apple TV ships with Apple services, but its easy to replace those with your favorites. App selection Roku has one of the most complete app libraries, though Apples iTunes service is notably missing. Youll need an Apple TV to access iTunes. Apple TV also has a good app selection, though out of 25 leading services The Associated Press checked, its missing direct access to Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and PlayStation Vue. You can get the first three indirectly with a Chromecast-like feature called AirPlay if you have a companion iPhone or other Apple device. Amazons Fire TV device is missing iTunes, Google Play, Vudu, ABC, Freeform and the NFL (though some games are shown through Twitters app). The selection on Android TV is also limited, but you can supplement that with apps for Chromecast. With an Android phone, you can get all but iTunes, though getting Amazon video is tough, as it requires getting Amazons Underground app store first. With an iPhone, youre missing iTunes, Amazon and USA Network, even with AirPlay. If you just have a Chromecast device with an iPhone, youre also missing Freeform (formerly ABC Family) and CNN. Youll still need individual subscriptions to these services. The streaming device merely enables playback on the big screen. Entry-level devices Amazons Fire TV Stick stands out as a speedy, capable device for $40. It now comes with a voice remote for searches and Alexa assistant queries on weather, sports scores and other information. The Roku Express is cheaper at $30, though theres no voice remote, and the interface is slower (which doesnt matter as much once you sit back and watch the video). Its a great choice considering its wider app selection, notwithstanding the lack of iTunes. Googles entry-level Chromecast costs $35  affordable, though the gadget is clunky without its own remote. Its slightly better with Android than iPhones. Mid-range devices Xiaomis Mi Box is a speedy Android TV device with a nice price tag, $69. It supports higher-resolution video known as 4K, an option that once required more expensive devices. But you need a 4K TV and services that offer 4K video  so far, Netflix and YouTube do so for just some of their offerings. Mi Box also supports HDR picture quality. HDR, or high dynamic range, promises brighter whites, darker blacks and a richer range of colors  but you need an HDR TV and HDR video. Googles new Chromecast Ultra also has 4K and HDR support for $69. Because Mi Box also does Chromecast, you get more overall for the same price. Mi Box also has a voice remote. The Roku Premiere also offers 4K for $80, but its remote lacks voice support. Amazons regular Fire TV has 4K and a voice remote for $90. Neither has HDR. For now, HDR sets are rarer than 4K, and even 4K sets arent that common. Why pay more? The $100 Roku Premiere Plus and the $130 Roku Ultra offer both 4K and HDR. The remote for both also has a headphone jack for listening when everyone else is asleep. The Ultra also has a voice remote, something many cheaper devices offer. That remote also has gaming buttons and emits a sound when you lose it in a couch. For hard-core gamers, consider the $200 Nvidia Shield TV, an Android TV with both 4K and HDR support, plus faster processors for games with intensive graphics. Another premium choice is Apple TV, which starts at $149. You dont get 4K or HDR, which wont matter for regular sets. Instead, you get plenty of apps that do more than play video. You can browse Ikeas catalog, order food from Grubhub and get the AccuWeather forecasts. For video, an upcoming app simply called TV promises to bring together all your viewing from various channels and services. An iPhone isnt required, but helps. Sorry, no Android. And for iTunes, Apple TV is the only choice.

Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Nov 19, 2016 at 6:41AM Image source: Fitbit. Wearables companies like Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with its Apple Watch have long talked about the ability for their devices to play a key role in the healthcare system. Fitness wearable users should be happy to hear that more and more companies and insurers are including wearables as part of an overall health and wellness initiative to keep employees healthy -- often giving perks such as reduced health insurance costs to those that participate.  Wearables could mean lower insurance costs Health insurance can be expensive for companies. Total health benefit costs were nearly $12,000 per employee so far in 2016, according to Mercer. Anything that shows signs of significantly reducing that cost is likely to be welcomed, such as a relatively inexpensive fitness tracker that may reduce health benefit claims.  Image source: Fitbit. That's the goal behind programs like Fitbit's group health initiative that partners with companies to try to get their workforce more active. The company released a report in October in which researchers studied employees for two years and found that those who took part in Fitbit's corporate wellness program had on average $1,300, nearly 25%, less in annual healthcare costs.  Insurers seem to like the sound of that, too, and many are willing to pass some of those savings on to the insured. UnitedHealthcare Group (NYSE:UNH) announced "UnitedHealthcare Motion" in March, a program that provides employees with wearable devices at no charge and makes it possible -- if they meet certain activity and fitness goals such as average daily steps -- to earn up to $1,460 in health reimbursement account (HRA) credits. Aetna (NYSE:AET) is another health insurance provider that is not only working with the companies it services to try to get their employees a subsidized or free tracker, but has also offered to give an Apple Watch at no cost to all of its thousands of employees. Aetna's wellness reimbursement plan will offer employees credits based on activity levels, and it has also announced various new iOS apps to help streamline users' tracking and healthcare management.  Accessorized Fitbit tracker. Image source: Fitbit. Investors should be happy, too For wearables users, the benefits are obvious in that you might save on your health insurance or get reimbursement credits for completing activity goals. Better health and cost savings are a win-win. Investors interested in this space should be happy about this trend, too. As more companies see these benefits in action, they're likely to join, which should contribute to rising wearable sales in the months and years to come. Fitbit, Apple, and others have even accessorized their devices to be more appropriate for professional work environments to make this transition easier.  There are some roadblocks to this being a slam-dunk for wearables companies. A big one is privacy: Not everyone will feel comfortable having their employer seeing so much personal information, and there's also the potential for some employees to feel left out -- particularly those with disabilities or elderly employees, both of which are protected classes under the law. The AARP recently sued the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over similar discount programs in October for what they claimed was a bias against elderly employees. To combat that concern, Fitbit claims that results are based on individuals increasing their own fitness level from wherever they start, not compared to an average or base model. Also, a recent case study highlights one employee with spina bifida who was able to use an upper body fitness machine to get similar activity and tracking results.   There is another large caveat to all of this. Over the last few years, healthcare has been transformed by the Affordable Care Act and other regulations, some of which encouraged more action in getting employees more involved in their own healthcare management. President-elect Trump has signaled throughout his campaign that there will be massive changes to the current healthcare system. Still, healthcare will almost certainly continue to be a large expense for companies under the next administration, so wearables' attractiveness in this market shouldn't change. But, just like with every segment of the market in the coming government transition, investors will be wise to follow what's happening and update their investment plans accordingly.  Seth McNew owns shares of Apple.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version November 19, 2016 - 15:47 AMT SHARE Apple could move iPhone production to U.S. - sources iPhones might one day soon carry "Made in America" labels. Key Apple assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the U.S., the Nikkei Asian Review cited sources as saying on Friday, November 18. "Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.," a source said. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." Foxconn, based in the gritty, industrial Tucheng district in suburban Taipei, and its smaller Taiwanese rival churn out more than 200 million iPhones annually from their massive Chinese campuses. Another source said that while Foxconn had been working on the request from Apple Inc., its biggest customer that accounts for more than 50% of its sales, Chairman Terry Gou had been less enthusiastic due to an inevitable rise in production costs. "Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double," the source said. The person added that one view among the Apple supply chain in Taiwan is that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may push the Cupertino, California-based tech titan to make a certain number of iPhone components at home, Nikkei said. According to research company IHS Markit, it costs about $225 for Apple to make an iPhone 7 with a 32GB memory, while the unsubsidized price for such a handset is $649. Apple, Foxconn and Pegatron all declined to comment. SHARE PanARMENIAN.Net © 2000—2016

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple’s throttling the Verizon iPhone 7’s speed Apple Apple’s throttling the Verizon iPhone 7’s speed By Bertila Helena - Nov 19, 2016 Last month saw the arrival of news that iPhone 7 units with Qualcomm modems were found to be faster than models packing Intel chipsets. Now a report claims that Apple may have intentionally throttled the former variant so that it was on-par with the latter. According to Bloomberg, researchers at Twin Prime and Cellular Insights evaluated the Qualcomm-powered Verizon and Intel-carrying AT&T versions of the iPhone 7. The firms found that the two were mostly equal in terms of speed even though the former is technically able to download data faster. This leads us to the theory of the hour, which is that Apple isn’t taking full advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities. The X12 Qualcomm modem found inside the carrier’s iPhone 7 model is capable of pushing up to 600Mbps, while the AT&T Intel one boasts of a lower 450Mbps. Also See: iPhone 7 severely burns pregnant woman’s arm If the throttling allegations prove true, it would be a highly unusual step for Apple to take since companies usually aim to have the fastest phones. Analysts think the brand may have done this so that everyone has a uniform iPhone 7 experience. This conclusion is backed by insider sources who told Recode that Apple wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having multiple suppliers for its chips, while also wanting the two models to be as similar as possible. The latter may have been done to avoid making AT&T and T-Mobile angry. This makes sense, since it would be unfair for Verizon customers to have better speeds. However, the apparent throttling may still make many consumers angry given that their iPhone 7 is possibly not living up to its full potential. To make matters worse, Twin Prime pitted the iPhone 7 against the Samsung Galaxy S7 and found that the second was two times faster than the first. Both were utilizing Qualcomm’s X12 modem and run on Verizon’s network.

Apple wants to put Siri in your messages Written by Ananya Bhattacharya November 19, 2016 Better late than never. (Reuters/Robert Galbraith) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya November 19, 2016 You may someday have another participant in your group messaging chats: Siri. An Apple patent application published Nov. 17 describes how Siri could be pulled into iMessage chats to help with scheduling and making payments. Any of the participants in a conversation can choose to bring in Siri to assist people with tasks, the filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office says. When summoned to a message thread, the AI assistant uses semantic analysis to decipher which messages are meant for it. Once users direct a message toward Siri, it will be able to carry out tasks like checking people’s availability on their respective calendars or estimate how far people are from each other by using their locations. In one instance, a user asks, “Siri, when are we all free to grab lunch?” and Siri responds by scouring their calendars for matching availabilities and presenting a poll of possible times. Siri iMessage integration patent. (USPTO) With iOS 10, Apple announced Siri would support a myriad of third-party apps, including payment apps like Venmo, Paypal and Square Cash. In renderings included with the application, the outlined technology appears to allow for peer-to-peer payments from within the conversation. In an example, a participant says, “Siri, can you send Brett 10 bucks?” The assistant then pulls up a range of payment apps to choose from, and asks for fingerprint authorization before making the transfer. At any given time, participants can choose to deny Siri access to their personal information. Apple’s latest patent filing echoes functions already available in Google Assistant, which makes similar in-conversation contributions within Google’s text chat-only app Allo. Google Assistant’s functionality is more extensive than what’s described in the Apple patent, which only gives examples of scheduling and payments. Google Assistant can scour for addresses, movie showtimes, restaurants, flights, and hotels from within the app, as well as report on news, weather, traffic, sports, and more. That said, it’s worth noting that Apple filed for this patent in April 2015, well before Google’s Assistant made its debut last month. And the trend toward using machine learning to help virtual assistants better serve users is on the upswing across the board: consider Amazon’s Alexa, Facebook Messenger bots, and Samsung’s acquisition of a Siri-like assistant called Viv. Apple’s concept is still just a patent application, which is not an indication that the technology will be deployed—now or ever. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Touchscreens on smartphones that have this problem gradually become unresponsive. The fault was highlighted by gadget sites which said it was caused by a manufacturing issue that meant some screen controller chips became loose. Apple was criticised by one expert who said it was the phonemaker’s responsibility to fix it. Apple is charging $149 in the USA for the service that will only be available on phones that are “in working order”. Loose chips In a statement on its website, Apple said it had “determined” that displays on some iPhone 6 Plus handsets flickered or became unresponsive if the device was dropped several times on a hard surface and was then subjected to “further stress”. An iPhone 6 Plus suffering this problem, which worked and did not have a cracked or broken screen, was eligible for the repair programme, it said. The service is available worldwide and costs £146.44 in the UK. Apple said that customers who had already paid to get their phone cured of “touch disease” should get in touch to be repaid for the amount they spent beyond the programme fee. The repair programme will run for five years beyond the initial date on which the iPhone 6 Plus went on sale, said Apple. Stuart Miles, founder of gadget news site Pocket-lint, said: “I think if it’s a known defect that isn’t caused by the user then it should be the responsibility of Apple to fix the phone free of charge regardless of the age.” The manufacturing problem with the iPhone 6 Plus was first highlighted by gadget site iFixit which said it had seen an “influx of faulty iPhones”. In a blogpost about the problem posted in August, iFixit said there were “pages and pages” of messages from aggrieved iPhone 6 Plus owners on the Apple support site complaining about the fault. An investigation by iFixit and specialist repair shops found the cause of the fault was the placement of the touchscreen controller chip. Several rough knocks could dislodge this chip making phones unresponsive, it said. – Source: BBC Delali Adogla-Bessa More on citifmonline.com Facebook considering ways to combat fake news – Mark Zuckerberg November 19, 2016 Volkswagen to cut 30,000 jobs in huge post-dieselgate revamp November 18, 2016 SpaceX aims to launch internet from space November 18, 2016 Twitter suspends alt-right figureheads November 17, 2016 Snapchat ‘files for stock market float’ November 16, 2016 WhatsApp finally launches video calling November 15, 2016 General News GSE lobbies for patronage of the Ghana Fixed Income Market November 20, 2016 NDC deserves another term – Amissah-Arthur November 20, 2016 Create jobs; any gov’t can construct flyover – Alan November 20, 2016 Ketu South: Ghanaians in Togo welcome Nana Addo with protests November 20, 2016 53% of students unable to complete secondary education – Report November 20, 2016 Advertisement Recent Posts GSE lobbies for patronage of the Ghana Fixed Income Market NDC deserves another term – Amissah-Arthur Create jobs; any gov’t can construct flyover – Alan ECG recovers GHc 450,000 from illegal connections in Eastern Region Nana Addo not hospitalized; he’s campaigning vigorously- Hamid Ketu South: Ghanaians in Togo welcome Nana Addo with protests Murray v Djokovic: Top two fight to be number one at ATP Finals finale India train crash: Scores killed in derailment near Kanpur 53% of students unable to complete secondary education – Report Takoradi Technical university launches 5-year strategic plan Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2016 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Apple Working on Digital Glasses with AR Prowess November 19, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts iOS 10.2: Top Anticipated Features Facebook Revving up Public Chatrooms via Messenger App Augmented Reality is still a blooming field relatively. But many companies have already set its eyes on this lucrative domain. And now, Apple has got its name registered as one among them. The word now is that the Cupertino Company has set its eye for an expansion on to augmented reality, and its initial venture will be something similar to what Google have previously experimented with. The company is reportedly working on a digital glass that will be incorporated with augmented reality capabilities. By picture, Apple’s glasses stays close to Google Glasses, working on a modus operandi that will have data collected through the glass and synced with the iPhone devices. The augmented reality data processed will be then overlaid onto the glass screen, either through a projector or by some other means. That means it’s never as complicated like the other ambitious AR headsets the rivals are working upon at present. Apple’s new AR glasses won’t be coming out before 2018 to the least, and this should give some breathing space for the company to experiment more; something which Google failed to materialize with Google Glasses. The longer dateline also raises the possibility of the project being scrapped, given that Apple is already nourishing its interest in the automobile field. But previous words from Apple CEO Tim Cook had already exposed the interests of the company in working with AR. Tim Cook is also someone who believes more in the potential of AR than that of virtual reality. However, recent reports have suggested that Apple is still continuing the hiring process of AR as well as VR experts, which could suggest that Apple might just blend some VR technologies in its due course.

Image Credit: AP Apple recognizes persistant problem with iPhone 6 Plus, will charge users to get it fixed By Aric Suber-Jenkins November 18, 2016 SHARE TWEET PIN Apple has finally recognized a well-documented issue with the iPhone 6 Plus — sort of. The company acknowledged the presence of "Multi-Touch issues," perhaps better known as "touch disease," and wants to help iPhone owners fix it — for the price of $149.  "Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device," Apple said on a post on the company's support page.  Most consumers are more interested in linking "touch disease" to the infamous Bendgate, which plagued both iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners shortly after its launch. BGR reported that several independent technicians associated the defects with a controller chip design flaw in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Apple isn't prepared to acknowledge that, though — there's no mention of any liability on the Apple's behalf, and the company won't even make this deal for standard iPhone 6s.  "The repair program covers affected iPhone 6 Plus devices for five years after the first retail sale of the unit," Apple's statement continues. That should grant most 6 Plus owners with three or so years of warranty. Apple added that buyers who already repaired iPhone 6 Plus' suffering from "touch disease" symptoms qualify for reimbursement. "The reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price you paid for the original service to your iPhone 6 Plus and the $149 service price."

Sunday 20 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 21:19 / GMT - 17:49 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Sat Nov 19, 2016 11:14 Apple to Fix 'Touch Disease' on iPhone 6 plus, but Not for Free Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Apple officially acknowledged the Touch Disease issues, and is now offering iPhone 6 Plus users half-price repairs at $149. For the past few months, reports have covered the ‘touch disease‘ that renders Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus nonfunctional. Investigation into the problem revealed that Apple removed the underfill from the controller chips that govern touchscreen functionality. The underfill typically fills the gaps between solder balls that attach a chip to its motherboard and prevents the solder from cracking under normal wear and tear. Removing the underfill means that the solder itself is responsible for holding up under flexion — and when the chips start failing as a result, touch screens stop working. Up until this point, Apple has steadfastly refused to acknowledge the problem, even as independent analysis showed it was easily the largest issue causing device failures. Now, Apple has announced that it will offer a $149 repair option, but only for the iPhone 6 Plus. The company has published a webpage to alert customers to the issue, but continues to pretend the flaw is entirely its own users’ fault. Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149. Apple will contact customers who may have paid for a service repair related to this issue either through Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to arrange reimbursement. If you have not been contacted but paid for a repair that you believe was related to this issue, please contact Apple. The reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price you paid for the original service to your iPhone 6 Plus and the $149 service price. While we’re glad to see Apple formally offering repair and refunding the difference consumers may have already spent on the issue, it affects both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and not just the 6 Plus. It’s been known to occur even to devices that are kept in hard cases, and it isn’t the result of consumers mistreating their hardware. If Apple had used underfill or a metal plate to strengthen the phone, this issue wouldn’t happen — and given that Apple added such a plate in the iPhone 6s Plus, moved the touch ICs off the logic board, and went back to using underfill, it’s clear the company was fully aware that the original device had issues and simply chose not to address them. Ultimately, we’d prefer this program be free — similar repair programs in previous years have been. Apple really screwed this up.         LATEST STORIES (45) Holy Karbala: World Shiite Muslims Commemorate Arbaeen Iran Extends Condolences to New Delhi on Death of Nearly 100 Indians Iran, Morocco Keen to Bolster Mutual Cooperation Civilians Risk Their Lives to Flee Terrorist-Controlled Areas in Eastern Aleppo Iran, Japan Ink MoU on Inspectorate Cooperation German Company Mulls Investment in Iran's Projects Terrorists Agree to Hand over West Ghouta Stronghold to Syrian Army 7 Schoolchildren Killed in Militant Shelling of Government-Held West Aleppo Syrian Soldiers Engage in Tough Clashes with ISIL Invaders in Deir Ezzur Slovenian President Due in Tehran on Tuesday ISIL Fails to Prevail Over Gov't Forces' Positions East of Syria's Homs Iran, Armenia Opt for Boosting Economic Ties Syria: Hundreds of Army Soldiers Arrive in Eastern Part of Aleppo City Syrian Army, Air Force Hold Massive Military Operations in Lattakia, Hama Provinces Nusra Centers across Dara'a Province Receive Sever Blow in Syrian Army Attacks Holy Karbala: World Shiite Muslims Commemorate Arbaeen TEHRAN (FNA)- Millions of Shiite Muslim Pilgrims from across the world, including Iran, congregated in Iraq's Western city of Karbala to mourn the 40th day after the martyrdom of Shiite Islam's third Imam and his 72 companions over 13 centuries ago.

Photo / File A setting on Apple smartphones has users alarmed their personal mobile data is being used when they're supposed to be connected to a Wi-Fi network. The feature added in iOS 9 and later updates of the Apple operating system includes a feature called 'Wi-fi Assist'. The setting, which has been available since September 2015, is intended to make users stay connected to the Internet even through a poor Wi-Fi connection by using their cellular data. The setting is automatically enabled when updating software to iOS 9 and later versions, and if left activated an iPhone will use mobile data whenever a Wi-Fi signal is weak - catching unaware consumers out world-wide. West Auckland woman Kelly Burns told the Herald "I realised my data usage was higher than normal after I bought a new iPhone 7 which had the latest iOS and I kept having to top up with extra data packs. "I wasn't aware of the iPhone 'Wi-fi Assist' setting until I called my provider 2degrees to ask why I was suddenly using so much data." After turning the function off, Burns' data usage returned to her normal rate. The Avondale resident said "I don't think the Wi-Fi Assist setting should be on by default, I understand the premise behind it is to ensure optimal service however since having the setting off there has been no noticeable degradation to the speed of my connection." She says the first month before she realised the setting was on she probably spent an extra $80 on four data packs. Continued below.

Craig Young from TUANZ (Telecommunications Users Association of New Zealand) told the Herald "It's an example where the maker of the phone has made a decision that isn't overly user friendly. "It's okay in countries where you might be able to get unlimited data to your mobile device and it doesn't matter how much data you're chewing through but particularly users in New Zealand who might be on prepay or on smaller plans and are carefully managing data may find it's actually being sucked up." He said his advice is that users should be looking at that and turning the setting off. The Herald spoke with representatives of ISP's (Internet Service Providers) to find out how the software update has impacted customers. A representative from Vodafone said the telecommunications provider was first made aware of the 'Wi-fi Assist' feature in September last year. She said "At the time we alerted customers through our online forums and social media and we responded to several media enquiries. This affected iPhone users globally. As part of our response, we pointed customers to a page on our website which offers a step by step guide to switching the feature off. Our customer care teams are aware of the feature and proactively support our customers to switch it off." A Spark representative told the Herald they don't have any control over third party apps or operating systems, many of which use data. He said "We want to encourage people to use the tools that can protect them from accidental over data use or a feature or an app consuming more data than they were expecting." He urged any Spark users suffering from data usage issues to get in touch. 2degrees spokeswoman Lenska Papich said "If contacted by customers about data use we work through a range of possibilities with them, one of which for iOS 9 users is to turn off the Wi-Fi assist option." Apple responded to the Herald's enquiries to find more information through their support page, which can be found here.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:07PM For about a decade, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has used processors designed and manufactured by microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in its iMac desktop and MacBook laptop computer families.  Apple iMac and MacBook computers. Image source: author.  However, as Apple's chip design prowess has grown, primarily to support its non-Mac products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, speculation has run rampant that Apple would eventually build processors to replace Intel's in the Mac.  Were that to happen, Intel's personal computer processor business would be negatively impacted, but Intel's business would be able to weather it (sales to Apple comprised less than 10% of Intel's total revenue in 2015).  It still hasn't happened, though.   Nevertheless, a new report from investment company Exane BNP Paribas (via The Street) suggests that Apple might be hiring engineers to build chips that will finally allow Apple to boot Intel out of the Mac. Let's take a closer look at what the analysts had to say.  Apple is hiring graphics engineers? You don't say! The analysts reportedly point out that Apple's looking to fill 87 hardware engineering positions related to graphics processing technology. Based on this, the analysts said that "the graphics job vacancies suggest that Apple is building a completely new chip design team, which in our experience points to a new application." The analysts further went on to say that "the need for computing, CPU and/or GPU skills could point to a custom Apple chip for the Apple MacBook." "It is entirely plausible that Apple could produce a beefed up 7 [nanometer] apps processor... capable of powering a MacBook in 2018," the analysts concluded. I'm not buying it. What else requires CPU and/or GPU technology? Inside of every Apple iPhone and iPad is an Apple-designed applications processor. These chips integrate a whole host of technologies, including CPUs, graphics processors, image processing units, memory controllers, and more. Microprocessor expert David Kanter recently revealed in an article published on website Real World Technologies that Apple has been using custom-designed graphics processors in its iPhone and iPad chips since the A8/A8X chips. Previous Apple chips incorporated graphics processor designs licensed from graphics specialist Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). It is far more likely that the job listings indicate that Apple is trying to bolster the graphics processor teams that build technologies for Apple's iPhone and iPad devices rather than for its Mac products.  So, about the Intel thing... Only Apple knows if its long-term plan is to replace Intel's processors with its own chips.  That said, a transition away from Intel processors and toward Apple-designed ARM processors across Apple's Mac lineup is unlikely to happen in the near-future, if it's going to happen at all.  Indeed, all of the software that runs on the Mac -- both first-party and third-party -- would need to be reworked in order to properly function on ARM processors, as it is all designed around Intel's technology. Yes, Apple has done such architecture transitions on the Mac before, but the last time that the company did one (moving from PowerPC to Intel), Apple gave developers ample notice so that they could get their software ready (the PowerPC to Intel transition was announced at World Wide Developers Conference 2005; the first Intel-based Macs didn't ship until WWDC 2006).   To my knowledge, Apple hasn't given developers such a heads-up about a transition of the Mac from Intel to ARM.  Nevertheless, the point here isn't whether or not Apple is ultimately planning to kick Intel out of the Mac; the point is that the fact that Apple is hiring experts to work on graphics processor technology is hardly evidence that Apple is planning to replace Intel in the Mac.

Trump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had “worked hard” with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. In letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favorable policy changes in Congress. “Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis,” said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. “They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that’s great,” she said. The No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump’s crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington. Apple Inc, criticised by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday. Apple did not reply to a request for comment yesterday. Trump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged center of the country. Ford gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no US jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models. The Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 per cent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. Ford went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new US$195 million (RM861 million) investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan. On Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky. As such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved US jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer. “Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry,” said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. It was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider. According to Cole, Ford’s olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency. Cole said Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy. Ford nodded to those wider issues in a statement yesterday, saying it was encouraged that Trump’s economic policies “will help improve US competitiveness.” Ford, like other global US corporations, agrees with key aspects of Trump’s economic plans. It has called for US tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Trump’s concerns about currency manipulation. — Reuters                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Five ways Indians are dodging ‘black money’ crackdown Asia to narrow trade focus as protectionism rises, say analysts Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Palm oil celebrates centennial, output doubles every 10 years TPP, RCEP, FTAAP: A user’s guide to alphabet soup of trade deals Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Tensions’ likely under President-elect Trump, Obama says Reuters Video: Trump says ‘you will hear some things tomorrow’ MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Related Articles Trump set to announce new cabinet picks (VIDEO) Ibrahim Ali: If Trump can be president, I can be PM Turning other cheek, Mexican president vows Trump talks Turns out, everything is negotiable ― Paula Dwyer Dancing in a hurricane ― Thomas L.

Your streaming TV options just got better and cheaper. Features that once required a $100 device can now be had for as little as $30. A cheap device is fine for getting TV shows and movies from most popular services onto a big-screen TV, as long as it’s a regular, high-definition set. (AP Photo) NEW YORK — Your streaming TV options have gotten better and cheaper. Features that once required a $100 device can now be had for as little as $30. A cheap device is fine for getting TV shows and movies from most popular services onto a big-screen TV — as long as it’s a regular, high-definition set. Of course, it’s possible to simply watch video on a phone or tablet, but it’s not as satisfying from a living-room couch. Here’s a holiday buying guide for the TV-streamers in your life. Built-in streaming Smart TVs, game consoles and the TiVo digital video recorder all have streaming apps, and if all you watch is Netflix and Hulu, you’ll be fine with those. But apps for individual channels such as The CW and FX won’t work with every device. The exceptions are TVs running Roku software or that have Google’s Chromecast technology built in; they tend to have wider app selections. Getting around Devices vary in how easy it is to access apps and video. While many devices are getting voice features that let you search multiple services at once, you’ll still need to navigate on-screen menus with a remote. The exception is Chromecast, which has no menu or remote at all. Instead, you start video on an iPhone or Android phone and send it to the big screen with a tap of a cast button. With some video services, the phone is freed up for other things, though you’ll need to use the phone as a remote for pausing and rewinding. Devices running Google’s Android TV come with Chromecast features and pack their menus with video from Google’s YouTube service. Amazon’s Fire TV device traditionally has favored Amazon video over others, though that’s changing as Netflix, HBO and other leading services get prominence on the home screen. Roku is the most service-agnostic of the bunch. Apple TV ships with Apple services, but it’s easy to replace those with your favorites. App selection Roku has one of the most complete app libraries, though Apple’s iTunes service is notably missing. You’ll need an Apple TV to access iTunes. Apple TV also has a good app selection, though out of 25 leading services The Associated Press checked, it’s missing direct access to Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and PlayStation Vue. You can get the first three indirectly with a Chromecast-like feature called AirPlay if you have a companion iPhone or other Apple device. Amazon’s Fire TV device is missing iTunes, Google Play, Vudu, ABC, Freeform and the NFL (though some games are shown through Twitter’s app). The selection on Android TV is also limited, but you can supplement that with apps for Chromecast. With an Android phone, you can get all but iTunes, though getting Amazon video is tough, as it requires getting Amazon’s “Underground” app store first. With an iPhone, you’re missing iTunes, Amazon and USA Network, even with AirPlay. If you just have a Chromecast device with an iPhone, you’re also missing Freeform (formerly ABC Family) and CNN. You’ll still need individual subscriptions to these services. The streaming device merely enables playback on the big screen. Entry-level devices Amazon’s Fire TV Stick stands out as a speedy, capable device for $40. It now comes with a voice remote for searches and Alexa assistant queries on weather, sports scores and other information. The Roku Express is cheaper at $30, though there’s no voice remote, and the interface is slower (which doesn’t matter as much once you sit back and watch the video). It’s a great choice considering its wider app selection, notwithstanding the lack of iTunes. Google’s entry-level Chromecast costs $35 — affordable, though the gadget is clunky without its own remote. It’s slightly better with Android than iPhones. Mid-range choices Xiaomi’s Mi Box is a speedy Android TV device with a nice price tag of $69. It supports higher-resolution video known as 4K, an option that once required more expensive devices. But you need a 4K TV and services that offer 4K video — so far, Netflix and YouTube do so for just some of their offerings. Mi Box also supports HDR picture quality. HDR, or high dynamic range, promises brighter whites, darker blacks and a richer range of colors — but you need an HDR TV and HDR video. Google’s new Chromecast Ultra also has 4K and HDR support for $69. Because Mi Box also does Chromecast, you get more overall for the same price. Mi Box also has a voice remote. The Roku Premiere also offers 4K for $80, but its remote lacks voice support. Amazon’s regular Fire TV has 4K and a voice remote for $90. Neither has HDR. For now, HDR sets are rarer than 4K, and even 4K sets aren’t that common. Why pay more? The $100 Roku Premium Plus and the $130 Roku Ultra offer both 4K and HDR. The remote for both also has a headphone jack for listening when everyone else is asleep. The Ultra also has a voice remote, something many cheaper devices offer. That remote also has gaming buttons and emits a sound when you lose it in a couch. For hard-core gamers, consider the $200 Nvidia Shield TV, an Android TV with both 4K and HDR support, plus faster processors for games with intensive graphics. Another premium choice is Apple TV, which starts at $149. You don’t get 4K or HDR, which won’t matter for regular sets. Instead, you get plenty of apps that do more than play video. You can browse Ikea’s catalog, order food from Grubhub and get the AccuWeather forecasts. For video, an upcoming app simply called TV promises to bring together all your viewing from various channels and services. An iPhone isn’t required, but helps. Sorry, no Android. And for iTunes, Apple TV is the only choice. Tags App Video Device Chromecast Ultra Hdr Itunes Iphone loading...

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear View All Editorials → Apple Launches Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin Nov 18th, 2016 11:00 AM EST | Product News Apple has launched a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus devices that suffer a flickering display or Multi-Touch issues. The program’s description specifies devices that experience these troubles “after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.” “If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149,” Apple said. In other words, Apple is still charging, but it’s likely to be less than it would have otherwise have been. Furthermore, the company said it would reach out to customers who may have already paid more through Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider “to arrange reimbursement.” That refers to the difference between what they paid and the new program’s price tag. Where to Start There are three ways to take advantage of the program: Apple Authorized Service Provider Apple Retail Store Apple Technical Support Note that the last two links are the same starting point. Long Standing Issue There have long been complaints about this issue, but this is the first time Apple has publicly acknowledged it. The specific wording for the program should be noted, as the company is clearly trying to maintain a tight grip over what is covered. Nonetheless, it’s always good for device owners when Apple opens up a repair program.

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear View All Editorials → Apple Has the Experience to Make an AR Bombshell Come True John Martellaro @jmartellaro Nov 18th, 2016 5:20 PM EST | Particle Debris Augmented reality (AR) is coming. Combine it with AI … and … wow! Mark Gurman and his colleagues at Bloomberg have written that Apple is exploring another wearables project: digital glasses. “Apple Considers Wearables Expansion With Digital Glasses.” According to people familiar with the matter: While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality (AR)…. But wait. Don’t laugh yet. I’ve long believed that this is our technical future. That is, a sophisticated optical device that displays all the information we need on our visual field. (Think about combining that with a really smart AI agent!) Just how that’s implemented is the key, and it will surely evolve. Google Glass was version 0.10. Right now, according to Gurman, Apple is in the testing phase. Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. Of course, as Google found out, there are lots of technical and social issues to work out. Perhaps, Apple with hindsight, tremendous R&D funding and vast UX/UI experience can get us all the way there, as it did with the Apple Watch. The days of walking around, dodging busses, staring at a little black brick will be over in a few years. Next page: The news debris for the week of Nov 14th.

Your choice Apple That is true of so much in the Apple universe right now. They keep saying there’s great stuff on the way. Rumours are out there of really cool stuff that will revolutionize things. But they never seem to arrive. Macs are stagnant, the SmartWatch fad has peaked, Tablets are essentially unchanged, and Phones are commodity items. Yes they are making money but they’re stagnant. You know what Apple reminds me of? GM in the early 1970s. Making lots of money making more or less the same thing they did ten years before. Then they were blindsided by small cars from Japan that were less expensive, more reliable, and more efficient. Apple is cranking out the same devices they have for a long time albeit with Incremental improvements. Somebody is going to come in with a revolutionary thing and Apple will be caught flat footed. The Surface Pro from Microsoft is close. I just hope it was enough of a slap across the face to wake Apple up. To get them innovating again. Because someone will ‘think different’ and roll out a product that will make the new MacBook Pro look like a ’73 Chevette. Something as revolutionary as the first Macintosh was to the DOS world. November 18, 2016 at 6:53 EST PM CudaBoy November 18, 2016 What geo said. I would add that the ol’ paradigm of Apple taking other’s pre-existing technology (swipe to unlock; NFC; stylus’, smartwatch etc) and sprinkling fairy dust on it just won’t fly any more. The AI assistance field (echo etc) seemed like Apple worthy; VR seemed Apple worthy, I just wonder. So, this glass will be the latest thing Apple poo-poo’d like NFC and stylus’ a few years ago only to backpedal and copy. Great. Steve’s rolling in his ‘pod’. Please, Apple – BUY Tesla and install Elon as CEO ASAP!!! I want a 35 lb carbon EV Apple Bike powered by Tesla !! And, Apple NEEDS Elon’s vision. GM, I mean Apple is getting a bit stale. November 18, 2016 at 7:05 EST PM Lee Dronick November 18, 2016 “They will update the desktop Macs, maybe starting with the Mac Pro, in the next few months…” See today’s Joy of Tech comic http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/2353.html November 18, 2016 at 9:04 EST PM ibuck November 19, 2016 Re: new iPad rumors: I don’t understand how bezel-free could possibly be wanted by anyone. Sometimes when I pick up my iPad (Air 2) a finger or thump barely grazes the edge of the screen and unwanted things happen, like interrupting the stream I am listening to. When iPads magically follow us around, then maybe edge to edge screens will be useful. Till then, not so much. November 19, 2016 at 12:12 EST AM Lee Dronick November 19, 2016 I agree Buck. We would end up putting a wider case on the iPad. November 19, 2016 at 8:22 EST AM Jamie November 19, 2016 Hmm . . . I have no doubt Apple could makes something neat with AR, but the question remains whether or not people actually want it. I think a big part of the issue with tech in general is this insistence on developing things for a future that has yet to arrive. Until something like this is as easy and functional as a ‘J.A.R.V.I.S.’, it’s just too much hassle. Is Silicon Valley insularity to blame? I can’t say for certain, but it sure seems to be. Wearing glasses isn’t much different than wearing a watch – if one isn’t inclined to do so, they most likely aren’t going to start. I can’t help but notice that in the current Samsung commercials that feature VR, it is mainly children using their goggles for play being depicted, and I think play and perhaps specialized scenarios where simulation would actually be useful is probably where that technology (which I think is cool, BTW) will likely end up when all is said and done. It’s just too cumbersome/annoying/inefficient – I don’t need to interact with a simulation of my mundane life-tasks, it’s so much easier just to do them, and I don’t want to have to unnecessarily accessorize to accomplish them. Some aspects of human existence just ain’t broke. November 19, 2016 at 2:00 EST PM Lee Dronick November 19, 2016 This afternoon at the Apple Store, well Apple, I had a chance to mess around with a MacBook Pro and Touch Bar. I think that I will opt for the model with the Touch Bar, it is very nice and will come in handy. Only 30 lbs more to go on my weight loss program, the new MacBook Pro is my incentive.

The new coffee table book definitely deserved this kind of parody. I think the problem with the Apple book is not necessary the book itself, but the timing of the book’s release. Overall, it does seem like a nice art book. However, considering how many products Apple is currently neglecting, both hardware and software, it makes this book seem like a giant ego trip. Had Apple released this book back when the new Mac Pro was actually still new, and the 5K iMacs just came out, the book would have probably been well received. Releasing this kind of book now is kind of like Marie Antoinette saying to starving people (allegedly) “let them eat cake”, when all they wanted was bread. For us Mac enthusiasts, bread is updated Mac hardware and software. It doesn’t have to be a complete redesign every time or even every other time, just updated specs.

Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Nov 18, 2016 at 11:24PM I've long anticipated that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would completely transition its products from LCD to OLED displays. The process has already started with the Apple Watch and should continue with Apple's wildly popular iPhone line. And according to astute supply chain watchers, it's increasingly likely that the process will happen on iPhones sooner than expected. Apple's latest iPhone 7 lineup, IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE, INC. Perspective is in order Around this time last year, multiple industry sources had already suggested that Apple was set to migrate its entire iPhone lineup from LCD to OLED. But given its massive unit shipment requirements, it was clear that sufficient manufacturing volume for the high-tech OLED displays wouldn't be available for all models until at least 2018. In a recent note to clients, however, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Chris Hemmelgarn cited supply-chain sources as stating that -- with the caveat that its designs aren't finalized -- Apple is set to reveal three new iPhones in 2017 for the iconic smartphone's 10-year anniversary. While the two smaller iPhones will probably stick to LCDs because of the aforementioned supply constraints, the largest Plus model will boast a 5.8-inch OLED display, allowing Apple to bend the display at its edges to create a curved, bezel-free design. Of course, a curved-edge iPhone isn't entirely surprising, considering Samsung has already revealed a similar feature with the OLED displays on its Galaxy Edge-series smartphones. Incidentally, Barclays also stated that the majority of these early iPhone OLED display panels will be provided by Samsung Display and LG Display, which together represent the two largest clients of another one of my personal favorite investments, OLED technologist Universal Display Corporation (NASDAQ:OLED). This also corroborates reports detailing that such a supply agreement was struck between Samsung Display and Apple earlier this year. For what it's worth, however, this isn't the first report suggesting that Apple will start with a single OLED iPhone next year. A few months ago, Universal Display shares hit an all-time high, after electronics equipment maker Applied Materials revealed a surprisingly strong quarter in which it received an incredible $700 million in display orders. Applied Materials later confirmed that the "vast majority" of those orders consisted of mobile OLED display equipment, while Bloomberg subsequently reported that the new OLED displays were set to make their way into Apple's lineup in 2017. In any case, to have that assertion echoed by Barclays' comments this month serves as badly needed affirmation for skeptical investors. Here's how to invest All things considered, I'll reiterate my assertion that buying shares of Universal Display is the single best way to take advantage of Apple's transition to OLED. For one thing, the reported Apple/Samsung supply agreement was rumored to last at least three years, indicating that Apple is invested in Universal Display's flagship OLED technology for the long haul. What's more, during Universal Display's most recent quarterly conference call earlier this month, CFO Sidney Rosenblatt made it clear that the company is preparing for accelerated growth next year by "building our infrastructure to meet the growing needs of our expanding customer base." Sure enough, Universal Display shares shot higher just last week on reports that iPhone display supplier Japan Display is in talks to receive financing to shift its own manufacturing lines from LCD to OLED. That's not to mention the prospect for Universal Display's OLED technology to continue to proliferate not only in smartphones, but also in tablets, televisions, and (over the longer term) differentiated lighting applications. For investors who buy now before the immense scale of Universal Display's growth story becomes evident, I think the stock's recent gains will prove a drop in the bucket compared with its long-term potential.

Apple on November 17 acknowledged the iPhone 6 Plus flaw, known as ‘touch diseases’. In return, the company has started offering a repair program to the customers to fix the flaw. “Apple has determined that some iPhones 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Mutli-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on device,” Apple wrote on its website. The flaw was acknowledged by engineers back in August 2016. A repair and teardown website iFixit, reported many iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners are continuously facing the touchscreen issue, claiming the handsets had stopped registering touch. The engineers termed the iPhone models touchscreen flaw as ‘touch disease.’ They highlighted the flaw was caused because of tow chipset touchscreen controller chips, or Touch IC, integrated in iPhone 6 models. However, in a statement Apple said the flaw will occur in case the handset will be ‘dropped multiple times on a hard surface.’ The repair program is available worldwide and will cover affected iPhone 6 Plus devices for five years after first retail of the unit, Apple wrote. The company is charging $149 for the service. However, pricing offered by Apple Authorised Service providers may vary. To seek more information on the program click here.

Reuters/Jason Reed If latest reports are to be believed, Apple will be releasing the iOS 10.2 in December 2016. This means, Chinese jailbreaking group Pangu could also be releasing the iOS 10 jailbreak in December. Tech experts stated that the iOS 10.2 is already in the beta testing phase and once released, it will come with a whole set of bug fixes and new features. Once Apple users have installed the update, Pangu could be releasing the iOS 10 jailbreak. Pangu has earlier claimed that it has already jailbroken Apple’s latest operating system but is simply waiting for the Cupertino-based company to release their update first, writes NEUROGADGET. There is another set of fans who believe that this time, even Pangu hasn’t succeeded in jailbreaking the Apple iOS 10, as the tech giant has claimed that the iOS 10 is the most secure system ever built by Apple. Whatever may be the reason, Pangu has been absolutely silent on the matter and is simply waiting for the latest update to be released. It does not want any information to get leaked as Apple will then quickly patch the glitches. Pangu reportedly does not want Apple to have the slightest clue as to how it has jailbroken the iOS 10 operating system, writes Mobile & Apps. However, it is known that most jailbreaking groups have failed in cracking open the system and even Pangu had a tough time. Moreover, there are no reports confirming whether Pangu has actually jailbroken Apple iOS 10. If at all, Pangu succeeds in releasing a jailbreak, Apple won’t be happy about it as it seems confident that its operating system cannot be jailbroken. Many believe that Apple’s regular updates on its operating system are the primary reason for the delay. Fans are still waiting for the iOS 10.0.1 jailbreak tool. Meanwhile, known hacker Luca Todesco has claimed that he has a jailbreak ready but hasn’t released anything as of now. Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Apple iOS 10 jailbreak impossible?

Globally, smartphone sales increased by 5.4% year-on-year, with 373.2-million devices sold. Leading this charge was Huawei, Oppo and BBK (the company that owns the likes of Oppo, OnePlus and Vivo). The three manufacturers claimed 21% of the global smartphone sales market in Q3 2016, compared to Samsung‘s 23.6% and Apple‘s 13%. Samsung had its worst smartphone sales quarters ever, thanks in part to the Note 7 Notably though, most of these smartphone sales from Oppo and BBK were in China. The fall of the old guard? Samsung and Apple had less successful quarters. Notable was Samsung’s terrible performance, thanks in part to the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. “Samsung’s smartphone sales in the third quarter of 2016 as a whole declined 14.2 per cent year over year — their worst performance ever,” Gartner notes. Apple also had a torrid quarter. The company’s global smartphones sales accounted for just 11.5% — it’s lowest total since 2009. “Apple’s sales fell by 8.5 per cent in the US and by 31 per cent in China, two of its biggest markets. The iPhone 7 struggled to stimulate replacement sales,” Gartner concludes. Author Bio Camper by day, run-and-gunner by night, Andy prefers his toast like his coffee -- dark and crunchy.

The team has introduced yet another full teardown of Apple’s current Cadillac model of MacBooks, It’s a pleasure to take a look at this new tech reduced to its most base of components, and even a little cathartic to think they dove right into a brand new expensive little bugger like this so see what makes it tick. Credit: iFixit For starters, the MacBook Pro 15″ has over a million pixels more than the previous 13″ models the site has torn down, along with a 15.4″ LED-backlit Retina display with 2880 × 1800 resolution and 2.6 GHz Skylake quad-core Intel Core i7. In short, this is a powerhouse of a MacBook with plenty of reasons for you to pick it up if you’re interested in jumping on the bandwagon. The size, in comparison to the 13″ MacBook Pro, at least as far as thickness goes, is nearly identical. Inside it seems as though it’s like a “scaled up’ version of the smaller version with tiny differences in the way the batteries are laid out inside. The enormous touchpad requires an additional touch controller, but nothing too special there. Once again, the Touch Bar is difficult to replace, you could damage the screen if you delve into the MacBook without knowing much about what you’re doing. Since the Touch ID sensor also doubles as the power switch and is paired with the T1 chip on the logic board, you basically need Apple’s assistance to repair. This isn’t something you’ll want to jump into to fix yourself. Take it from us. In short, the upgraded MacBook Pro packs the extra battery power, screen size and more but it also contains several components that are equally difficult for layman tech enthusiasts to replace. If you opt for picking one up and you run into problems, you’re going to be better served taking it in for repairs and letting Apple handle it.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple’s iPhone call logging is a feature, not a security scare Chris Smith BGR NewsNovember 19, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share A Russian company that makes iPhone-hacking software said earlier this week that Apple quietly collects iPhone call data in iCloud, including both cellular voice calls and FaceTime calls. But it turns out that’s a feature built into iOS and macOS for the user’s “convenience.” So there’s no point freaking out about it. That said, Apple could certainly have done a better job informing the user what happens with call data. DON’T MISS: All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon If you’ve got iCloud enabled on your Apple devices, and most people do, then Apple will record data from all your calls, whether it’s a regular phone call or VoIP-based calls including FaceTime, Skype, WhatsApp, Viber and others. Everything gets synced to the cloud, complete with phone numbers, call dates and times, and call duration. The reasoning here is pretty simple. Apple wants you to be able to access those calls and return missed calls from any of your devices. This is possible through Apple’s Continuity feature. The actual contents of a call aren’t saved in iCloud. After all, Apple doesn’t listen in on your conversations. However, the worry with some people is that the data stored in iCloud can be decrypted by Apple, and can be shared with law enforcement if a warrant requires Apple to do so. Hackers might also access call history, and Elcomsoft updated its Phone Breaker software to extract call records from iCloud using only an authentication token for an account from a computer belonging to the account holder. To make those call records disappear, you have to delete them from a device. Otherwise, they’ll remain in iCloud for up to four months. FaceTime call invitations can be stored for up to 30 days. “We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,” an Apple spokesperson said about the matter. “Device data is encrypted with a user’s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user’s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.” MacRumors notes that while Apple may not explain exactly what happens in the background, it does state that it collects call history for iCloud backups in a 63-page white paper about iOS security.

Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Even iSheep Might Not Purchase Apple’s Latest Product 88Shares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Azeem Ullah 4 days ago Talk about being self-obsessed. Whether you like it or hate it, it is clear Apple takes its design very, very seriously or just thinks people are idiots and will buy anything with an Apple logo. Going back to the Apple II and 1984 Mac launches, Apple has boasted about design which it meticulously tries to keep as humane as possible. No wonder, the company’s latest product is a $300 book, containing 450 photos of iconic Apple products from the 1998 iMac to the 2015 Apple Pencil, covering the peak years of Jobs and Ive’s partnership. Bet you won’t be see that from Samsung often. Aptly titled “Designed by Apple in California”, the book features the best of Apple’s industrial designs, which doesn’t only include Cupertino’s successful products, but others as well. Photography is done by Andrew Zuckerman, with images laid out in a “deliberately spare style”. In typical Apple fashion, the book will be arriving in two variants: a 10.2 x 12.75” version costing $199, and a 13 x 16.25” version costing $300. It will be printed in “specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink”. “Designed by Apple in California” is dedicated to the memory of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who was the mastermind behind so many of Apple’s greatest releases. It will be published by Apple itself and goes on sale starting today.

We now know that Super Mario Run will arrive on December 15th and that it will be, as promised, a "free-to-start" game (you'll be able to download it and start playing for free) but will not proceed along a free-to-play model. Instead, at some point in the game it'll ask you for a single $9.99 in-app purchase to unlock its full functionality. The devil is in the details, of course, and it remains to be seen how much Nintendo has been paying attention to the reasons why F2P dominates mobile in the first place. How exactly that IAP will be implemented and how the content it unlocks will be gated will be very interesting to see. Will Super Mario Run let you play the game as long as you like, but only in a very basic mode, without unlocking? Or will it let you play a certain number of times before slamming down a hard barrier that can only be removed by purchasing, an approach that would make any F2P designer recoil in hissing horror? Will the game employ standard retention strategies like daily rewards, which Pokemon Go rather astonishingly only got around to adding recently, or will it eschew these trappings of mobile gaming entirely? Most of all, perhaps, how much of the established structure of mobile gaming can Nintendo just barge through on the strength of its brand and its IP? $9.99 is an interesting price point, psychologically - it's a very expensive entry point by mobile standards, but probably more realistic than the premium prices companies like Square Enix have tried to charge for some games. Everything Nintendo does in mobile for now is an experiment, of course, but with this price point it's hard not to see them drawing a line in the sand. I imagine that $10 feels like the "right" amount players should be paying for a game, to Nintendo, and by going all-in with their biggest IP from the very outset, the company is essentially trying to push mobile gaming as a whole towards accepting that price point. "It's a coup for Nintendo...not least since it secured them an unprecedented preorder slot on the iOS App Store for several months, undoubtedly ensuring an enormous launch that may even eclipse that of Pokemon Go" It's not that Nintendo expects F2P to go away, and I doubt it's even especially opposed to the idea of F2P on some moral ground. It just wants to give itself options and flexibility, to have a chance to fit the right business model to the right game rather than being painted into an F2P corner by the simple fact of creating a mobile game. With Super Mario Run, it's testing to see if it can create a new norm within the market; a $10 price tag on premium, in-demand games. What's intriguing is the extent to which Nintendo is being aided in this endeavour by Apple. Certainly, it was a coup for Apple to have Super Mario Run on its event stage, and an even bigger one to secure exclusivity (of an as-yet unrevealed nature) for the game on iOS devices. However, these things run both ways; it's a coup for Nintendo too, not least since it secured them an unprecedented preorder slot on the iOS App Store for several months, undoubtedly ensuring an enormous launch that may even eclipse that of Pokemon Go. Both companies are stepping into unknown territory here; Nintendo with the game itself and by working with another platform holder, and Apple with the pre-order and with the very notion of a third-party iOS exclusive game. It's a collaboration, in short, and it's clear that the two companies have had extensive discussions behind the scenes. The question of business model must have come up in those discussions, and Nintendo's free-to-start, premium IAP model - essentially a shareware style demo and upgrade - most likely has Apple's blessing. That's something of a U-turn for Apple. Although the company has remained publicly agnostic about business models on the App Store for years, its deeds have clearly been aimed at promoting F2P to a large extent. That's understandable; Apple's business is selling hardware, and having an enormous library of software people can download for free is a great way to sell hardware. The reason F2P came to dominate mobile gaming so quickly was that unlike other platform holders (who sell hardware at a loss or at break-even and make their money from software licensing), Apple had no interest in holding up software prices. Freed from the control of a platform holder, prices trended towards the inevitable baseline - zero - and developers found different ways to monetise their work. Now it seems that Apple is willing, perhaps even actively interested, in exploring alternatives. Maybe the company has come to view the F2P model, which is great in principle but so often abused, as a net negative for its customer base and potentially harmful to sales. Perhaps it's concerned by the ongoing market dominance of such a small number of rapidly ageing game titles, which may be squeezing out other developers and quashing creativity. Perhaps it's simply interested in finding ways to expand the reach of the App Store and believes that encouraging a diversity of business models is a good way of doing so. Most likely, there's a little of all of these motivations in the mix, but the ultimate outcome is the same in any case; in striking its partnership with Nintendo, the closest collaboration it's ever done with a game company, it's given its badge of approval to a radically different approach to selling games on the App Store. For Nintendo's part, it's obviously taking a big risk; I confess to being moderately surprised, at the time, that it would commit Mario, its most valuable IP, to its very first full-fledged experiment in mobile gaming. My own guess had been that something like Animal Crossing or perhaps even a tie-in with current golden-child Splatoon would have been first to launch; you can't win 'em all, and in this case I clearly overestimated Nintendo's caution with its most precious asset. Perhaps that simply speaks to great confidence in the game they're launching; perhaps it's more a reflection of belief in the robustness of the Mario IP, which has after all survived the character's likeness being plastered all over all sorts of unusual games ever since the era of the NES. "It's not just Mario who'll get bruised if Super Mario Run doesn't live up to the company's standards. It'll be a blow to the firm's entire medium to long term strategy, and a major challenge to the leadership of its still relatively new CEO, Tatsumi Kimishima" Perhaps, though, there's a slightly different explanation - one suggested strongly by the enormous hype surrounding Pokemon Sun and Moon on the 3DS, the latest iterations in the venerable Pokemon franchise and unquestionably the most eagerly awaited and loudly hyped iterations in many years. Pokemon Sun and Moon are, of course, the first Pokemon games to launch since Pokemon Go became an overnight phenomenon on mobile devices over the summer. While much of the excitement around Pokemon Go has died down, the sheer degree of brand awareness and interest generated by the game is incalculable; it's quite literally the kind of marketing and publicity that money cannot buy. The boost it will provide to sales of Pokemon Sun and Moon is likely to be significant, as the 3DS titles have already sold-in 10 million copies. Thinking about timescales, a Super Mario Run launch in mid-December places it a similar distance ahead of the launch of Nintendo's new Switch console as the Pokemon Go launch was ahead of the launch of Pokemon Sun and Moon. It's a somewhat different proposition, of course, but the thinking may well be similar; stirring up enormous interest in a key, classic Nintendo IP - perhaps even one which will be a launch title for Switch - should give a major boost in the arm to the console when it launches. Much of Nintendo's challenge at the moment lies in reactivating its consumers; reminding people who used to be Nintendo players, but have either strayed to PlayStation and Xbox or stopped playing entirely, what they valued about the brand and its games. Mobile gaming isn't just a profitable business for the company, though it certainly hopes it will become that; it's also an outreach program, a way to bring people back into the fold and help the company to sustain its position in the market. All of this depends, of course, on Super Mario Run being a great experience. In that sense, next month brings a truly enormous risk - far greater than the risk of simply associating the Mario brand with a dud. It's not just Mario who'll get bruised if Super Mario Run doesn't live up to the company's standards. It'll be a blow to the firm's entire medium to long term strategy, and a major challenge to the leadership of its still relatively new CEO, Tatsumi Kimishima. Whatever else Nintendo is thinking about Super Mario Run, you can be absolutely assured that one thought is predominant; the game absolutely has to be good. Luckily, that's not exactly an alien thought for the company - no matter what platform you're working on or what business model you're designing around, some philosophies of game creation are universal.

It would be awesome if one 'brave leader' were to still recognize the potential for a monetization model that does not involve the current vampiric like activities the current freemium models resemble. Taking a casual survey of comments on the gaming forums I frequent, many F2P who don't normally pay into a game would probably appreciate a one time fee to unlock vs the current 'pay to win' models that are dominated by 'whales'. The current freemium is too lucrative to outright die, that is for certain. However, it would be nice if some tried a 'AAA' production game that either utilized a free for the beginning (i.e for RPGs this could entail the first 10 - 15 levels or beginning 3 zones etc), and subscription based service or one time fee unlock for the whole game. The subscription could be 1 or 2$ a month. Maybe I am just dreaming! 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Hugo Trepanier Senior UI Designer, Hibernum2 days ago Anthony, a form of subscription already exists for mobile games, though you typically have to renew your membership every month with a transaction. Often you'll get increased benefits as your VIP status goes up with every purchase. It does not alleviate the need to potentially keep paying for other elements of the game, but it gives you an edge to progress faster, earn more coins or XP, etc. 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Robin Clarke Producer, AppyNation Ltd2 days ago Good stuff. However I'm still not convinced by this narrative that Nintendo or Apple are trying to divert the established model. There aren't a lot of brands in gaming that can justify a premium price tag that aren't exploiting this already. SMR's model lets them take two bites of the cherry - a one-off payment for a finite arcade style game, and IAP for virtual currency and items in the other two game modes. Apple have always heavily favoured premium games to F2P in terms of giving them marketing support, taking the view that successful F2P games are able to buy enough visibility on their own. SMR isn't doing anything new with its monetisation that would need Apple's approval. 1Sign inorRegisterto rate and replyShow all comments (6) James Berg Games User Researcher, EA Canada2 days ago The $10 price point is definitely interesting. I hope they're successful, as a consumer I'd be happier seeing more premium titles from quality developers. I too think Run is likely viewed largely as adjunctive marketing for the Switch. 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Emmanuel Dorée Studying Software Engineering, Open University21 hours ago It's going to be interesting to see who is ready to pay $10 for a runner game on a phone. I wish they went instead with a different genre like a puzzle game or a throwback to game and watch games or Wario ware style games etc... Then I wouldn't mind the price tag. I find this game so uninspired so unNintendo. I will be more interested to see their approach with Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem. I hope though that this is successful and that it drives people back to Nintendo consoles. 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Daniel Hughes PhD Researcher, Bangor University3 hours ago As a consumer I'd definitely welcome more high quality mobile titles in the £5-£10 price range. Presumably Nintendo will want their core fans to buy-in first, and will then hope that gamers new to Nintendo either spend through IAP, or enjoy the free trial enough to feel confident that the final product is worth the £8/$10. I also fully expect we'll see Super Mario Switch launching alongside the new machine in March. The downside is I'm on Android, so I won't be trying Run out until sometime next year! 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Sign in to contribute Email addressPasswordSign in Need an account?

Nicknamed the “Touch Disease”, this particular problem was attributed to rather poor quality in the soldering of the smartphone’s touch controller component. Now three months later, Apple has finally spoken up about the matter and is offering repairs for any iPhone 6 Plus experiencing the issue. And, of course, Apple is placing the blame solely on the user. Initial third-party and consumer investigations speculated that the touch disease was a by-product of the iPhone 6 Plus’ “bendability”. With just the right (read: excessive) amount of pressure, the frame of the smartphone curves and some components, like the touch controller, get dislodged. Teardown experts and users alike criticized Apple’s craftsmanship, saying that even with bendgate, the components should not so easily detach from the logic boards. Apple doesn’t go into detail with the exact cause of the issue other than acknowledging that there is, indeed, a widespread issue. It does say, however, that the flickering and multi-touch problems are the result of the iPhone being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress. So, yeah, you’re holding/dropping it wrong. Nevertheless, Apple is accepting repairs for the iPhone 6 Plus experiencing this problem, as long as they are still in working order and don’t have broken screens. Oh, and you get to pay a $149 service fee as well. If you’re lucky enough for that service to be available in your country. Those who already did so before this Multi-Touch Repair Program will be contacted by Apple for reimbursements. If you’re one of those and haven’t received that e-mail yet, you can contact Apple directly as well. No word if the iPhone 6, some of which have also been bitten by the Touch Disease, are eligible.

President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants Apple to start making its "damn computers and things" in the US, and he may get his wish. Citing unnamed sources, Japanese newspaper Nikkei claims that Apple's key manufacturing partner Foxconn "has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the US." One source reportedly told the paper that Apple in June asked Foxconn and another Taiwanese iPhone assembler Pegatron to look into making the handsets in the states. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns," the source said, according to Nikkei. Moving iPhone production to the US would undoubtedly be more costly for Cupertino. One source told the newspaper that production costs would more than double. Apple and Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In 2011, Steve Jobs reportedly scoffed at the idea of bringing iPhone production to the US when asked by President Obama what it would take to make that happen. "Those jobs aren't coming back," Jobs said at the time. //Related Articles Report: Fire Breaks Out at Foxconn's iPhone Manufacturing Facility The following year, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced plans to bring some parts of Mac production to the US; Apple reportedly invested more than $100 million as part of that effort. This isn't the first time Foxconn has considered setting up shop in the US. The manufacturing giant in 2012 confirmed that it was looking to expand operations in North America, but that has not yet happened. "We are looking at doing more manufacturing in the US because, in general, customers want more to be done there," Louis Woo, a Foxconn spokesman, told Bloomberg Businessweek at the time.

Now Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is leading the charge. Vance is renewing calls for federal legislation to force Apple to unlock their phones in criminal investigations. Apple has so far remained steadfast in saying no to law enforcement entities. These days, everyone has a smartphone -- even criminals. Inside the Manhattan District Attorney's new Cyber Lab, which just opened Thursday, there are 409 locked iPhones. All seized from criminal investigations. The office believes accessing the stored data in these phones will further the investigations. According to Vance's office, 10 percent of the locked phones are involved in attempted murder or homicide cases. Nine percent of the phones in sex crimes cases. The impressive 2200 sq. foot facility will comb through digital evidence and try to crack passwords to get into those phones. DA Vance says of the new Lab: "A state-of-the-art cyber lab is an investment in 21st-century crimefighting and a demonstration of my Office's capacity to handle complex local, national, and international cybercrime investigations. Nearly every crime against Manhattan residents and institutions involving digital evidence will engage the resources and expertise of this lab. With a dedicated space for our prosecutors, investigators, and analysts to work together on fast-moving investigations, New York City is better equipped than ever to combat the rising tide of cybercrime and identity theft." Apple first went up against law enforcement when they butted heads in February after the FBI fought to have Apple unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter. Apple went against the court order. The FBI eventually unlocked the device without Apple's help. PIX11 spoke with people who have mixed feelings. Many say they want to be protected and help solve crimes but if it comes at the expense of their privacy, that becomes a more difficult question. Some are worried it opens the door to hackers. "There's always a possibility to be hacked. I don't know if it makes it bigger the possibility because hackers know their way into the phones but if they want to get into your phone, they'll find a way," said iPhone user Antonella Mangold. "I know it's like the FBI reading it but it still could be any person so I personally prefer my privacy over safety," said Nina Bechtold. DA Vance is calling for federal legislation to force Apple to write a "warrant-friendly operating system." A woman visiting New York City from Silicone Valley weighed in, saying "It's a conundrum there's both sides and I can see both sides. I'm from San Francisco we get it we understand the rights to privacy but we also understand there are times the government probably needs to get into phones for safety and security." DA Vance's call for federal legislation may get a boost when President-elect Trump takes office.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:07PM For about a decade, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has used processors designed and manufactured by microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in its iMac desktop and MacBook laptop computer families.  Apple iMac and MacBook computers. Image source: author.  However, as Apple's chip design prowess has grown, primarily to support its non-Mac products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, speculation has run rampant that Apple would eventually build processors to replace Intel's in the Mac.  Were that to happen, Intel's personal computer processor business would be negatively impacted, but Intel's business would be able to weather it (sales to Apple comprised less than 10% of Intel's total revenue in 2015).  It still hasn't happened, though.   Nevertheless, a new report from investment company Exane BNP Paribas (via The Street) suggests that Apple might be hiring engineers to build chips that will finally allow Apple to boot Intel out of the Mac. Let's take a closer look at what the analysts had to say.  Apple is hiring graphics engineers? You don't say! The analysts reportedly point out that Apple's looking to fill 87 hardware engineering positions related to graphics processing technology. Based on this, the analysts said that "the graphics job vacancies suggest that Apple is building a completely new chip design team, which in our experience points to a new application." The analysts further went on to say that "the need for computing, CPU and/or GPU skills could point to a custom Apple chip for the Apple MacBook." "It is entirely plausible that Apple could produce a beefed up 7 [nanometer] apps processor... capable of powering a MacBook in 2018," the analysts concluded. I'm not buying it. What else requires CPU and/or GPU technology? Inside of every Apple iPhone and iPad is an Apple-designed applications processor. These chips integrate a whole host of technologies, including CPUs, graphics processors, image processing units, memory controllers, and more. Microprocessor expert David Kanter recently revealed in an article published on website Real World Technologies that Apple has been using custom-designed graphics processors in its iPhone and iPad chips since the A8/A8X chips. Previous Apple chips incorporated graphics processor designs licensed from graphics specialist Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). It is far more likely that the job listings indicate that Apple is trying to bolster the graphics processor teams that build technologies for Apple's iPhone and iPad devices rather than for its Mac products.  So, about the Intel thing... Only Apple knows if its long-term plan is to replace Intel's processors with its own chips.  That said, a transition away from Intel processors and toward Apple-designed ARM processors across Apple's Mac lineup is unlikely to happen in the near-future, if it's going to happen at all.  Indeed, all of the software that runs on the Mac -- both first-party and third-party -- would need to be reworked in order to properly function on ARM processors, as it is all designed around Intel's technology. Yes, Apple has done such architecture transitions on the Mac before, but the last time that the company did one (moving from PowerPC to Intel), Apple gave developers ample notice so that they could get their software ready (the PowerPC to Intel transition was announced at World Wide Developers Conference 2005; the first Intel-based Macs didn't ship until WWDC 2006).   To my knowledge, Apple hasn't given developers such a heads-up about a transition of the Mac from Intel to ARM.  Nevertheless, the point here isn't whether or not Apple is ultimately planning to kick Intel out of the Mac; the point is that the fact that Apple is hiring experts to work on graphics processor technology is hardly evidence that Apple is planning to replace Intel in the Mac.

"Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.," the Nikkei Asian Review reported, citing a source. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." Apple declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. However, Apple has long said the barrier to moving iPhone production to the U.S. is expertise, in addition to cost. "Foxconn follows a strict company policy of not commenting on any matters related to current or potential customers, or any of their products," a company spokesperson told CNBC via email. Taiwan-based Foxconn and Pegatron assemble iPhones in China. The news comes following Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. The Republican president-elect has been vocal about how U.S. companies should be building their products in America. "We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries," Trump said in a speech in January.

But Beijing has hit back: In an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned that iPhone sales and other American goods could suffer if such a plan were to go through. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.," the Global Times article read. Manufacturing the iPhones abroad allows Apple to maintain a strong margin on its product. Apple is Foxconn's biggest customer but Chairman Terry Gou is worried about the rising production costs of such a move, the Nikkei reported, citing a source saying that costs will double. It's important to note that the discussions began in June, five months before Trump won the election. Analysts said it is still hard to quantify what such a move would mean for Apple's finances, but warned that there will be an impact. "If the world moves to a more nationalistic approach 'made in America, by Americans, for Americans' or 'made in China, by Chinese, for Chinese'... these variable conditions will likely impact margins, growth and suppliers exposed to the globalization trend of the last decade," wrote Neil Campling, head of global technology, media, and telecoms research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, in a note on Friday. "The same will likely make global tech a tougher place to invest in 2017," he said.

Well that was certainly a humble statement considering that KB Home just unveiled the nation's first HomeKit-enabled community at its Promenade at Communications Hill in San Jose today. KB Home is the first home builder to make a HomeKit smart-home package available to home buyers. Along with its introduction at Promenade at Communications Hill, the Apple HomeKit package will also be available for buyers at KB Home's Magnolia at Patterson Ranch community.   KB's press release states that "A model home showcasing how KB homeowners can simply and securely monitor and control Apple HomeKit-compatible accessories, such as lighting, door locks and other security features, and more, conveniently from their iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch, is now open at Promenade at Communications Hill.   Apple's Home app delivers a simple and secure interface to manage HomeKit-integrated home automation products in one place, allowing homeowners to connect and control their environment whether at home or away. For example, the Home app allows users to set customized scenes, such as "Leaving Home," which could turn off lights, lock the doors, and lower the thermostat.   The three-story floor plans available at Promenade range in size from 2,148 to 2,178 square feet, and can be built with up to five bedrooms, four baths, and a two-car garage. Pricing begins in the low-$900,000s.

Trump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had "worked hard" with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. In letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favorable policy changes in Congress. "Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis," said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. "They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that's great," she said. The No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump's crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington. Apple Inc, criticized by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday. Apple did not reply to a request for comment on Friday. JOBS = VOTES Trump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged center of the country. Ford gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no U.S. jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models. The Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 percent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. Ford went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new $195 million investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan. BOTH CLAIM VICTORY On Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky. As such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved U.S. jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer. "Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry," said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. It was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider. According to Cole, Ford's olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency. Cole said Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy. Ford nodded to those wider issues in a statement on Friday, saying it was encouraged that Trump's economic policies "will help improve U.S. competitiveness." Ford, like other global U.S. corporations, agrees with key aspects of Trump's economic plans. It has called for U.S. tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Trump's concerns about currency manipulation. (Editing by Bill Rigby) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Going into the election, Apple had a remarkable run. The stock immediately fell to $105 from $111 in the wake of Trump's victory. It has since slowly climbed back up to $110. "People may be confused about what a Trump administration means for Apple, so let me dispel the confusion — the positives far outweigh the negatives," the "Mad Money" host said. Cramer perceives Trump as unpredictable, so he decided to weigh out the potential negatives and positives that his presidency could mean for Apple. Andrew Burton | Getty Images News | Getty Images People stand outside the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue on August 5, 2015 in New York City. The negatives: 1. China. The majority of Apple phones are made in China, and Trump has railed on the Chinese for being unfair trading partners. This could affect iPhones dramatically, especially if Apple decides to make iPhones in the U.S. and the costs double. However, Cramer thinks it is unlikely a trade war will occur. 2. Trump's crackdown on the issuance of skilled worker visas could affect the foreign engineers and programmers in Silicon Valley, Cramer said. "Given that the staunchly anti-immigration Senator Jeff Sessions will be our next Attorney General, I wouldn't be surprised if the administration makes this a priority, but I am less sure about Congress," Cramer said. 3. The personal vendetta. In February, Trump called for a boycott on all Apple products. Cramer wonders what would happen in a similar situation with Trump as president, though he doubts the White House will call for a boycott, especially with bigger issues to worry about. The positives, which Cramer says outweighs the negatives: 1. Trump and the Republican Congress want a lower corporate tax rate. Since Apple's U.S. tax rate is 30.5 percent, this could bring billions in savings. 2. Repatriation of the dollar. Apple has a mountain of cash oversees which it hasn't been able to bring back to the U.S. because it would be hit with a 40 percent tax rate. As of the end of September, Apple had $237 billion in cash and marketable securities, and 91 percent of that was outside the U.S., which amounts to roughly $216 billion, or $40 per share of a $110 stock. If Trump and Congress create a tax holiday to allow American companies to bring cash in tax free, this would be huge positive for Apple and great for the U.S. if Apple reinvests that money or returns it to shareholders via a buyback or special dividend. "I think this tax holiday on the repatriation of foreign earnings is close to being a done deal," Cramer said. Ultimately, Cramer determined that Apple was still a stock to own. He's even salivating over the thought of the foreign cash that could soon be coming back to America. Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

Is Pursuing Augmented Reality Fox News Fox Business News Another Way Apple, Inc. Is Pursuing Augmented Reality By Evan Niu CFA - November 18, 2016 74 Continue Reading Below Image source: Getty Images. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is quite interested in augmented reality (AR). This we know. Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has made it abundantly clear that the company is far more interested in AR than virtual reality (VR). In Cook’s opinion, AR has much broader potential that can affect mainstream consumers, while VR looks like it could remain a niche for the foreseeable future. The Mac maker is also reportedly toying around with the idea of smart glasses as a way to deliver an AR experience while further expanding into the nascent wearables category. Well, Apple may have another idea up its sleeve. More From Fool.com There’s an app for that Earlier this week, Business Insider reported that Apple is looking to integrate AR technology directly into the iPhone’s camera app, according to an anonymous source.

Two go-to-market strategies are better than one Integrating AR into the iPhone would potentially be a stepping stone as Apple continues evaluating the prospect of smart glasses. Naturally, there would be a lot of overlap in the underlying technology. If Apple develops some useful AR tech for the iPhone, it would presumably be easy to repurpose and repackage that tech into smart glasses with minimal effort. By potentially adopting two different go-to-market strategies, Apple is also hedging its bets and reducing the likelihood of failure and wasted research and development investments. It’s conceivable that there will be room for both — a market for AR-powered smart glasses as well as a market for AR-powered smartphones. Not everyone will want smart glasses, and being able to deliver AR via a smartphone still allows the technology to scale. It’s been done The thing about AR on a smartphone is that it’s been done before. One of the earliest AR apps was released way back in 2009. It was a public transit app that allowed users to lift up their phones and see transit routes and find bus or train stations. Around this same time, Yelp even added an AR feature called Monocle to its app, allowing users to find local businesses through an AR interface. Since then, interest in AR waned as the uses were fairly limited and the novelty wore off. But then Pokemon Go happened, and reinvigorated interest in AR. For instance, Cook and Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster had this exchange on the July earnings call: Tim Cook: In terms of AR and the Pokemon phenomenon, it’s incredible what has happened there. I think it’s a testament to what happens with innovative apps and the whole ecosystem and the power of being a developer being able to press a button, so to speak, and offer their product around the world. And just a certain developer has elected not to go worldwide yet because of the pressure on their servers, et cetera, because of the demand. But I’m sure that they will over time. It also does show, as you point out, that AR can be really great. And we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. And so we’re investing, and the number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers’ products like Pokemon. And so that’s the reason why you see so many iPhones out in the wild right now chasing Pokemons. Gene Munster: Would you say there’s going to be a computing shift to AR longer term? Cook: I notice there are people that want to call it a new computer platform, and we’ll see. I think there’s a tendency in this industry to call everything new the next computer platform. However, that said, I think AR can be huge. So we’ll see whether it’s the next platform. But regardless, it will be huge. It’s likely that the early wave of AR apps was premature, both in terms of technological capability and interest.

Is Pursuing Augmented Reality Your iPhone might soon be able to deliver augmented reality experiences. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 18, 2016 at 6:04PM Image source: Getty Images. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is quite interested in augmented reality (AR). This we know. Furthermore, CEO Tim Cook has made it abundantly clear that the company is far more interested in AR than virtual reality (VR). In Cook's opinion, AR has much broader potential that can affect mainstream consumers, while VR looks like it could remain a niche for the foreseeable future. The Mac maker is also reportedly toying around with the idea of smart glasses as a way to deliver an AR experience while further expanding into the nascent wearables category. Well, Apple may have another idea up its sleeve.

But you probably won't notice. This isn’t another Antennagate. by Ina Fried Nov 18, 2016, 6:17pm EST tweet share Linkedin Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images A mini firestorm erupted today over a report that Apple was purposely limiting the performance of the modem chip in the iPhone 7. Bloomberg reported that Apple was intentionally throttling the performance of the Qualcomm modem chip inside some versions of the iPhone 7, in order to make it more similar to the Intel chip it was using in some other versions of the phone. That’s true, at least according to sources I talked to. Apple supposedly did this for a simple reason: It wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having two chip sources but also wanted the different versions of the phone to be as similar as possible (to avoid angering AT&T and T-Mobile and their customers in the U.S., for example). The result is that the modem in the Verizon/Sprint version of the phone, while just as good and perhaps a bit better than the one in the AT&T/T-Mobile version, is technically not fully living up to its potential. The real, and harder, question is just how big of a deal this is. The short answer is that it probably results in some loss of download speed, but in the context of other variables like network quality, signal strength and specific phone activity, it is hard to isolate in real usage. A more complete explanation requires getting into the weeds and trying to answer a theoretical-but-difficult question: What would the performance of an iPhone 7 be if it used the full potential of the Qualcomm chip? We don’t know because one doesn’t exist. Since we can’t answer that, we have to look at the question a couple of other ways. One can compare an iPhone 7 with a Qualcomm X12 modem to one with an Intel XMM 3360 chip. Bloomberg did that, in conjunction with some analyst firms, and found that the Qualcomm chip still slightly outperformed Intel. But this only tells us that Apple was able to mostly level the playing field, not how uneven it was to begin with. One can also look at how a phone with an unhobbled Qualcomm chip performs and compare that to the Qualcomm-powered iPhone, but that introduces all sorts of other variables as well. For their parts, Intel and Qualcomm both declined comment. Apple, repeating the statement it made to Bloomberg, said that “every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing.” “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models,” Apple said. But, of course, that just means Apple did its intended job of limiting the Qualcomm chip in such a way that it performs similarly to the Intel one. That answer sheds no light on how fast the Qualcomm iPhone 7 would be absent such limitations. It’s also worth noting that it is not unheard of for companies to have two component sources, creating some performance differences. With the iPhone 6S, for example, Apple had some of its processors made by Samsung’s manufacturing plants and others by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The result was not an enormous performance disparity, but some users noticed enough of a difference, especially in battery life, to raise the issue. Nor is it unheard of for product makers to limit some features in order to make the performance of a device consistent regardless of component differences, as Apple appears to have done here. That said, Apple is clearly valuing its own cost savings and supply chain flexibility over peak performance. Had it wanted the greatest speed and compatibility, it could have just used Qualcomm’s chip across all the models. Having made the decision to use Intel modems for some phones and Qualcomm for others, analysts say, Apple was probably wise not to allow one model to have a significant advantage. “Apple chose to use different modems for leverage and redundancy, and carriers had no real say in that,” Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson told Recode. “So it would be a little unfair if Apple allowed, say, Verizon and Sprint to say that their iPhone performs better than AT&T and T-Mobile’s.” Dawson added that device makers often choose not to use all the potential features of a component, and do so for a variety of reasons. “The reality is, of course, that every phone maker makes decisions about how to balance battery life and performance across a variety of components, and so you rarely see a phone that’s maxed out on all possible performance parameters because it would be terrible for battery life,” he said. recode_divider More From Recode Here’s what it’s like to ride in a self-driving Tesla Full transcript: Smosh and ScreenJunkies boss Keith Richman on Recode Media Here’s why Twitter turned down a Donald Trump advertising campaign Amazon is tweaking Donald Trump with a new Prime ad promoting religious tolerance Trump demands the cast of 'Hamilton' apologize for 'harassing' Mike Pence Full transcript: ‘Mr. Robot’ creator Sam Esmail on Recode Decode Trending Here’s what companies like Google, Facebook and Apple lost when Trump’s win killed the Trans-Pacific Partnership Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says a white-supremacy ad the company showed users was a ‘mistake’ Here’s the secret to Starry Internet’s plan to beam the internet to your house and break up the broadband monopoly Full transcript: ‘Mr. Robot’ creator Sam Esmail on Recode Decode LinkedIn’s CEO says more than five million jobs will be lost to new tech by 2020 More in Trending Newsletters Recode Daily Top stories of the day.

The release wasn't preceded by months of speculation online and there was no big press conference to announce its arrival. There was just a lone press release touting what is (likely) the company's last product announcement of 2016 (unless we do see AirPods before the year is out). The lack of fanfare is due to the fact that unlike Apple's other major releases this year, this one is (drumroll please)...a book. No, not another new MacBook Pro. Just, a book. Photo: Courtesy Apple. Advertisement Designed by Apple in California is the coffee-table book that every major Apple-obsessed buyer will be getting for Christmas this year. It is big, white, and contains 450 photographs of Apple products through the ages. It is a beautiful, nostalgic look at the technology of yore, but the $199 and $299 price tags (depending on if you buy the small or large size) are hard to swallow. Especially when you consider that for a few hundred dollars more, you could get the new iPhone 7. Many have joked about the release, but none have done it quite so elegantly and in such spot-on Apple fashion as Stephen Colbert. The spoof, which mimics Apple ads that have appeared at the company's launch events, talks about the book's "touch-page technology" and "no headphone jack design," which combine to make it "the most advanced book" Apple has ever made.

(Dreamstime/TNS) I got a call from my mother-in-law last week. Her iPhone had apparently updated its operating system and now the phone wanted a passcode before it would do anything. One problem: Nobody knew the passcode. Heck, nobody even remembered setting up a passcode. When I got my hands on the phone a few days later, I tried a passcode that I would have used if I had set it up. No dice. In fact, once I put in wrong passcodes enough times, the iPhone made me wait 60 minutes to try again. (There’s a separate security setting to wipe an iPhone after 10 failed passcode attempts. Luckily she didn’t have that enabled.) It was during one of those hourlong waits that I googled “iPhone passcode locked” and found some Apple instructions to wipe the phone and restore the newest software on it. Luckily I had a computer with iTunes, and we knew the Apple ID and password for the account on the phone. The restore went fine, but now I was going to have to re-enter all my mother-in-law’s phone numbers. Oh, well. I had some time, so I got a cold drink and sat down to do an hour’s worth of serious thumb typing. My mother-in-law doesn’t have a computer. She pretty much sticks to Facebook on an iPad and her iPhone. When I entered her Apple ID during the initial setup, a wonderful thing happened – her contacts reappeared. Yes, I’d forgotten that when we set up her iPhone last year, we turned on iCloud backup, which synced all her contacts to Apple’s iCloud server. So when I signed her in with the same Apple ID, the contacts were there. Lesson learned. Please set your iPhone or Android phone to back up to the cloud. Both operating systems should ask you during setup if you’d like to back up to the cloud. If you’d like to check your settings, on the iPhone, go to Settings, then iCloud, then Backup and make sure iCloud Backup is on. On Android, go to Settings, then Backup and Reset, and make sure Back Up My Data and Automatic Restore are checked and make sure your backup account is specified. Do this and you’ll save yourself some time the next time you have to configure a new phone or wipe your old one to start over.

Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, President-elect Donald Trump has picked someone who has supported NSA surveillance programs and has criticized Silicon Valley's stance on encryption. Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, is a former cavalry officer in the U.S. Army and a graduate of West Point. He serves on the House Intelligence Committee and is perhaps best known for his role on the Benghazi committee that investigated Hillary Clinton. But his committee assignment has also put him in the middle of several recent issues that have pitched the U.S. intelligence community against major tech companies. Back in February when the FBI was fighting Apple to gain access to data inside an iPhone used by a San Bernadino mass shooter, Pompeo criticized the company's position. Pompeo called Apple CEO Tim Cook's resistance to a subpoena "disappointing" and said he "should not stand in the way of the FBI’s investigation into a dead ISIS terrorist, who has the blood of 14 innocent Americans on his hands." The FBI had asked Apple to create custom software that would allow it an unlimited number of attempts to crack a passcode on the phone. Apple refused, and the case ended unresolved after the FBI said it had ultimately gained access to the iPhone using other methods. Pompeo has also supported the National Security Agency's decision to run some of its expansive surveillance programs that came to light after Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor, leaked secret documents to media organizations. In the face of widespread resistance to NSA domestic data collection, Pompeo opposed limits and argued that the agency's surveillance programs are essential in fighting the threat or terrorism aimed at targets in the U.S. He has also been a constant critic of Snowden. Commenting on his committee's report into Snowden, Pompeo called him "a liar and a criminal" and said, "the appropriate action would be to send Snowden to prison, not give him a pardon." Back in 2014, he pushed the organizers of the SXSW conference to cancel an event where Snowden appeared via video conference. In making his choice, Trump said Pompeo "will be a brilliant and unrelenting leader for our intelligence community to ensure the safety of Americans and our allies." His nomination will need to clear the Senate, and there will be some resistance. In response to the nomination, Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said the CIA needs "principled leadership now more than ever." Wyden criticized Pompeo's support for torture of terrorism suspects. "Unfortunately, Representative Pompeo’s comments in which he asserted that the CIA’s torture program was legal and that the American people did not deserve to know about it are deeply troubling," Wyden said.

The tech company will repair iPhone 6 Plus devices with the issue for US$149, it announced this week. Apple says it will contact people who have already paid the company or an authorised service provider to fix the problem and reimburse them for the price difference. The problem is caused when devices are “dropped multiple times on a hard surface” and then face “further stress,” the company said. Repair tech site iFixit says the issue seems to be a design flaw: The placement of key touch-screen-related chips causes them to become dislodged “as the phone flexes or twists slightly during normal use,” the site said. “Touch disease” is also reported to affect regular iPhone 6 devices, but Apple did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether it would be offering similar discounts on repairs for that model. In August, three California customers launched a federal class-action suit against Apple over the issue. That lawsuit has since expanded, and another suit was filed in Utah. The lawsuits allege that the company knew about the problem but failed to offer repairs. Now, at least some customers can have the problem fixed - for a price.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Touchdown for Chinese astronauts after record space mission 2 Fleet of driverless Baidu cars takes to the road in Wuzhen 3 Chinese researchers build world’s strongest magnetic field 4 WhatsApp rolls out video calling to more than one billion users 5 Are you an internet and social media addict?

Photograph: Alamy Geof Wheelwright in Seattle Friday 18 November 2016 17.02 EST Last modified on Friday 18 November 2016 17.06 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Apple has acknowledged a significant flaw that causes touchscreens to fail in some iPhone 6 Plus smartphones, claiming the problem can be triggered when devices are dropped multiple times. Announcing the “Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus” on Thursday, Apple said some devices may “exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device”. The company’s statement said that users could pay $149 to fix the issue, if their phones still work and don’t have a broken or cracked screen. Those who have already paid to have their phones repaired should contact Apple directly. iOS flaw lets hackers access iPhones using an iMessage Read more Yet the problem, dubbed “touch disease”, has been followed closely by the consumer site ifixit.org since August, which claims the problem of unresponsive touchscreens is not limited to devices that have been dropped. It claims the problem is actually caused by structural design flaws – the same ones flagged by “bendgate”, in which iPhones were found to bend when carried in tight pockets – and that Apple should admit the problem and extend consumers’ warranties under which the device would be repaired for free. A class action lawsuit brought in October also claims that tens of thousands of iPhone 6 Plus users have been affected. The suit targets “Apple’s concealment of a material manufacturing defect that ultimately causes iPhone touchscreens to become unresponsive and fail for their essential purpose as smartphones”. It describes in detail how the problem manifested for a variety of iPhone 6 Plus users, including Pennsylvania resident Thomas Davidson, whose phone became unusable less than two years after purchase. “The touchscreen on Mr Davidson’s iPhone 6 became unresponsive. Mr Davidson went to the Apple Care website on or about August 24, 2016,” the complaint states. “Mr Davidson discovered that he would be charged $320 for a replacement iPhone 6 if he sent his iPhone 6 in for service. He declined to do so and has discontinued use of the iPhone as the result of the touchscreen defect. “When the touchscreen defect manifests, Mr Davidson is unable to send or view text messages, take pictures, capture video, play music, browse the internet, send or view emails, use GPS navigation, use the touchscreen to make and take calls and download or use various applications, among other things.” Apple said it was not providing any further comment on the issue.

Now, Apple has finally acknowledged the problem and says it will repair it – for $149. Touch Disease is a result of the devices’ bendability, which causes the controller chip’s soldering to crack and start to lose contact with the board. “As the crack deepens into a full separation of the chip-board bond, the periods of no touch function become more frequent,” said microsoldering repair specialist Jessa Jones. Up until now, the Cupertino company hasn’t even acknowledged the existence of Touch Disease. Some owners claim that Apple told them buying a new device was the only solution if the affected iPhone was out of warranty. Now, Apple has launched a “Multi-Touch Repair Program” to address the issue. While Touch Disease has been reported in both variants of the iPhone 6, Apple’s service only covers the iPhone 6 Plus, which, due to its larger size, is more susceptible to the problem. Unsurprisingly, Apple isn’t claiming liability for Touch Disease; instead, it is blaming clumsy owners whose iPhones have been “dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.” Not only is Apple blaming customers for Touch Disease, but the company is also charging $149 to fix it. While this is half the price of normal out of warranty repairs, it’s still a case of consumers paying for a design flaw. Anyone who had their device repaired or replaced for similar symptoms – which could have cost more than $149 – will have the difference reimbursed by Apple. iFixit, which was one of the first publications to shine a light on the issue, has been critical of Apple’s repair program. CEO Kyle Wiens says he has seen Touch Disease on phones that have never been dropped. He added that an Apple Genius confirmed the company wasn’t repairing the affected iPhones but swapping them for refurbished devices. Moreover, the data from the old phones wasn’t being transferred. Apple is facing a class-action lawsuit from owners of iPhones affected by Touch Disease. How, or if, the new repair program will affect the case is unclear.

Now that the Republican is on his way to the White House, such a move could be possible - and it seems an Apple manufacturing partner has been preparing for it. According to Japanese website Nikkei Asian Review, Apple asked the two firms that assemble the iPhone - Foxconn and Pegatron - to look into assembling the devices in America back in June. Pegatron is said to have rejected the idea due to the increased costs, whereas Foxconn “has been studying the possibility” of opening US-based facilities. "Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.," an anonymous source told the publication. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." It had been suggested that moving production to the US would see the price of Apple products shoot up – the Nikkei’s source said "making iPhones in the US means the cost will more than double.” The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, recently outlined why Trump’s plan would be impractical, and wouldn’t necessarily create US jobs. However, some estimates claim that an iPhone assembled in the States would only cost about $30 extra, most of which would be a result of additional transportation expenses arising from shipping parts to the US. With Apple’s orders making up half of all Foxconn’s business, it’s not surprising that the Taiwanese company is looking into the possibility of a move, rather than face losing Apple as a customer. But whether Trump really does "get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries" remains to be seen. Earlier this week, China promised to cut iPhone and US automobile sales in the country if Trump imposed his promised 45 percent tariff on imports from the Asian nation.

The tech company is rolling out a repair program to fix iPhone 6 Plus devices with unresponsive touchscreen features. The term "Touch Disease" refers to the touchscreen issues that surface after the phone undergoes stress, like being dropped on the floor several times. In many cases, iPhone users have complained the touchscreen will entirely stop working for several months. In August, repair site iFixit discovered that the issue stemmed from faulty chips inside the devices. When the phone is dropped or bent, the chips become loose. At the time, iFixit called the issue "Touch Disease" -- and it was quickly adopted by the internet. Now, the company is willing to repair affected devices for $149 -- as long as your screen isn't cracked and the phone is in working order. Apple said on its website it "determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device." Although some iPhone 6 users have also reported the issue, Apple's fix only applies to the larger-sized iPhone 6 Plus. The company added it will reimburse people if they already fixed devices through Apple service providers for more than $149. Following widespread reports of the problem, "Touch Disease" -- on both sizes of the iPhone 6 -- has accounted for up to 22% of repairs at Apple Stores, according to tech site Apple Insider. Apple is facing class action lawsuits in California, Utah, and Canada over "Touch Disease." The complaints allege Apple knew about the faulty touchscreens and didn't do anything about it. These cases are not yet resolved. Copyright 2016 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

As the iconic mascot of Nintendo, Mario has seen over 100 unique titles over the last several decades, and as a property is the longest running franchise in video game history. In fact, 2016 marks Mario’s 35th birthday. Mario first appeared in the Nintendo arcade classic Donkey Kong in 1981, but it was 1983’s Mario Bros. on the Nintendo Entertainment System that made Mario a household name. Aside from the Atari 5200/7800, PC, and a few other obscure consoles like the Phillips CD-i, Mario has been exclusive to Nintendo manufactured hardware. However, Wired reports, Super Mario Run is exclusive to the iPhone and iPad for now, but will be going to Android devices next year. The title will mark the first time that Nintendo has exclusively released a Mario game on a platform it did not own. In 1994, Nintendo licensed the property to Phillips for use on its CD-i gaming system, but the singular release, Hotel Mario, was so terrible even Mario would rather forget about it. Playing #DonkeyKong on #ElectionNight pic.twitter.com/kBFzyn9WaQ — アギラー カイル (@kyle_a_nippon) November 9, 2016 Super Mario Run’s launch will come in the middle of Apple’s massive App Store purge, which began in October. According to Digital Trends, “The company announced in September that it would be removing apps that no longer worked as intended or didn’t follow guidelines from the App Store.” As of October 31, almost 50,000 apps had been deleted from the store since the purge began. Games were hardest hit, accounting for 28 percent of the removals. That is a huge chunk considering that the Entertainment category had the second most deletions at around nine percent and Books came in third at 8.96 percent. The removal of apps is not anything new or alarming, and should not effect new apps like Super Mario Run. Apple deletes old neglected apps all the time. However, the frequency of removals in the last month has increased 200-300 percent over the averages set between January and September. The purge was not a surprise either. Digital Trends reported that Apple announced that it would be purging abandoned apps and sent notice to app developers that they would have 30 days to update their programs. Apple’s big App Store purge is now underway https://t.co/45hS33Z20q pic.twitter.com/uACoShKFmQ #tech — Tech Now (@Tech_Now2) November 16, 2016 While the first month of removals did see a significant number of deletions, the purge is predicted to go on for at least a few months. Despite the massive housekeeping effort, the App Store is expected to continue growing. If growth remains consistent, analysts predict by the year 2020 the store could be host to over 5 million applications, even with regular removals. That is double the size that it is today. The purge is not expected to cause any delays or problems in purchasing Super Mario Run or any other app. The store is functioning properly at this time and will continue to operate correctly throughout the process of removals. So Nintendo can rest assured that Mario will be at the fingertips of everyone without delays or hiccups. Super Mario Run features minimalistic controls. Mario runs automatically, and the player taps the screen to make him jump to avoid obstacles. It is a control scheme mimicked from other similar games and is well-suited for mobile devices where often only one hand is available. The app is free to download, and players can play the first few levels, but the full game costs $9.99. $10 for #SuperMarioRun does seem a bit steep but that judgement is preemptive w/o knowing how much content is in the game pic.twitter.com/SGb2BSAgFt — Jammer (@JammerProHD) November 15, 2016 Interestingly, the price point seems to be a bone of contention among gamers. According to a survey conducted by IGN, over half those polled said they are unwilling to pay that much for the simplified game and would rather wait for a price reduction. Out of 12,582 respondents, only 5,986 said they were willing to pay $10 for Super Mario Run. However, having 47.58 percent of the demographic willing to make the $10 purchase on day one is not too bad. Even if the potential purchaser pool were only one million users (a very conservative estimate), that would equate to sales of about $4.8 million on launch day, and Nintendo is certainly going to milk it for all it is worth. The company may choose to hold out on those waiting for a price drop. Delaying reductions in price is a sound strategy that often leads procrastinators to a purchase, but only as long as reviews support the game’s value. Super Mario Run launches on iPhone and iPad in less than a month on December 15. Android users will have to wait until next year to get the game.

But while he likes the Apple Watch tracking app, Edwards isn't convinced his company's secure clinical communications technology needs a smartwatch app platform just yet, though PerfectServe does serve up notifications on the watch. The Knoxville-based businessman got his watch -- an entry-level sport model with a matte black finish and black plastic strap -- to replace his old Jawbone wearable tracker a few months after the watch first came out in April 2015. "The real driver of it was one of our early adopter physician clients," Edwards said. "He went out and bought it like the day it came out, and said, 'You gotta write an app for this thing.'" "And I said, let me get one, and I'll, you know, see how it works," Edwards said, adding that there are already a number of apps on the watch that he thinks aren't all that effective. Edwards said PerfectServe may someday develop a native app for the Apple Watch, but in the meantime the watch's tracking effectiveness for his three-to-five times a week running habit is already there. Terry Edwards The Apple Watch tracking technology comes into play on runs on the wide boulevards and gentle hills of Edwards' West Knoxville subdivision, where Edwards, 54, uses the device's Activity app to monitor not only distance, but also his heart rate, and adjust his pace accordingly. On these runs, Edwards stows his Apple iPhone in a special running belt. The phone is tethered to the watch via Bluetooth, and Edwards listens to podcasts or motivational recordings as he piles up the steps. Sometimes, he'll slow to a walk and hold phone conversations using his corded or wireless mic-equipped Bose headphones. I know if I’m getting a certain amount of steps in, I'm just going to feel better. Terry Edwards, president and CEO of PerfectServe Edwards also often jogs on his treadmill. Edwards, who has been running for fun and fitness since high school, also uses the trendy smartwatch on non-running days. He might be in Manhattan or Chicago and just be walking around a lot and traipsing through airports on company business; on those days he often exceeds his 10,000 daily step goal. "I know if I'm getting a certain amount of steps in, I'm just going to feel better," Edwards said. Edwards also tracks his weight on a smart scale from French health tech vendor Withings SA, and links the weekly weight readings to his watch to get a more holistic view of his overall health. In between runs and walks, Edwards is focused on signing on health systems to his company's PerfectServe Synchrony system, which integrates secure mobile and web-based text, voice and photo and video sharing for clinical care workgroups. Even though Edwards thinks Apple has improved its Siri voice recognition technology to the point at which the watch has become a useful wearable voice-to-text tool, he said voice-based applications are often not great in noisy clinical settings.

Priya Pathak   |   @Priyapathakview Last Updated: NOV 18, 2016 New Delhi Email Author Call it the Donald Trump effect. There are reports that Apple is exploring a way to make the iPhone in the US, instead of in China, the way the company currently does. During his election speech Trump had once said that he will get Apple to "start building their damn computers and things" in the US. Seemingly, this may soon come true.  According to Japanese website Nikkei Asian Review, the upcoming iPhones could be made in America. Also Read: Apple accepts 'touch disease' on iPhone 6 Plus but won't repair it for free The report claims that Apple has reached out to both Foxconn and Pegatron to explore if the iPhones can be made in the US. "Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the US," a source told Nikkei Asian Review. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." Apple currently manufactures its phones in China. China is believed to be an ideal nation for such high-costs manufacturing due to its low wages. However,  Tim Cook last year during his interview on 60 minutes had denied that low wages were a factor and had stated that it's skill and not wages why  company was making the iPhone in China. While Pegatron, which is a rival of Foxconn, has seemingly denied to work with Apple due to cost concerns, Foxcon has agreed to explore the US option. The company also recently replaced its 60,000 human workers with robots in one of its factories in China. Making iPhones in the US can be a tough for Apple due to several reasons. Most of the components of the iPhone are manufactured in China, which means assembling the phone itself is easier there. In the US assembling the phone will cost much more money. Also, there is the matter of skills. An article in New York Times recently noted how Chinese workers are now more skilled and qualified than Americans workers. The article talked about an incident where the company relied upon a Chinese factory to redesign the iPhone's screen at the last minute.

Yesterday the patent behind this new GPS/GNSS system was published and is considered a patent fulfilled. The secret that provides greater GPS accuracy is discussed in the patent filing as being the addition of a new adaptive filter.   Apple notes in their patent filing covering the use of GPS that in some implementations, mobile devices such as an Apple Watch or iPhone use a GNSS receiver to provide speed measurements. The speed measurements can be used to determine distance traveled for navigation or fitness applications running on mobile devices. What Apple has now added to the Apple Watch Series 2 is something called an adaptive bandwidth filter (as noted in patent FIG. 3 below) that estimates pedestrian pace or speed more accurately than conventional pedometer or GNSS estimation methods.   Apple's patent application 20160334433 titled "Pedestrian Pace Estimation with Pace Change Updating" was filed in May 2015 and published yesterday by USPTO.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Shirley Siluk. Updated November 18, 2016 9:57AM SHARE ALSO SEE Apple iPhone Data Security Privacy iCloud Mobile Apps FBI Top Tech News Apple customers can sync a lot of the data on their devices to iCloud, but some information is being backed up in a way they might not be aware of and can't control: their iPhone call logs. Moscow-based digital forensics firm ElcomSoft reported yesterday that it discovered Apple was automatically uploading iPhone call logs into iCloud for users running iOS 8 and up on their devices. What's more, users have "no official way" to turn off those backups, which include information about incoming, outgoing, missed and rejected calls, according to the company. ElcomSoft said the discovery has implications for the privacy of iPhone users. Apple has publicly fought law enforcement efforts to unlock iPhones connected to investigations, noting that it does not have access to customer passcodes that would allow it to do so. However, user data stored in iCloud is easier for third parties -- whether law enforcement or hackers -- to access. Only Fix 'Greatly Affects' Usability In its announcement yesterday, ElcomSoft said that Apple could store iPhone call logs on its servers for months. The company added that the only way that users can disable the syncing feature is by disabling iCloud completely on their devices, which would greatly affect usability. "Automatic cloud sync of call logs is great if you know about it and have an option to shut it off," ElcomSoft CEO Vladimir Katalov said in a statement. "While Apple works hard to improve security of their physical devices, they move more and more data into the cloud where law enforcement can easily obtain it." In a blog post about the discovery yesterday, ElcomSoft's Oleg Afonin added that iCloud data is "very loosely protected, allowing Apple itself or any third party with access to proper credentials extracting this information. Information stored in Apple iCloud is of course available to law enforcement." Apple's Privacy Battles Since the rollout of iOS 8 in September 2014, Apple devices running that operating system and later versions have been encrypted by default. That means only the owner -- and not Apple -- has the passcode to unlock the device. Just a few months after the release of iOS 8, Apple's stance on customer privacy became the focus of a hard-fought legal battle with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Following a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in December 2014, the FBI sought to force Apple to help it unlock an iPhone that had been used by one of the shooters. However, Apple fought that effort in court, contending that the request to create an "FBiOS" could leave millions of its other customers' devices vulnerable to hacking. The FBI eventually turned to a third part that unlocked the iPhone in question without Apple's help. However, officials still want Apple to help them unlock numerous other phones connected to state and federal investigations. In its legal process guidelines, Apple said it "does not have access to a user's passcode but, depending on the version of iOS that the device is running, may be able to extract some data from a passcode locked iOS device running iOS 4 through iOS 7 with a valid search warrant." Afonin noted yesterday that iPhone users have reported other problems with syncing, such as receiving missed call notifications for a spouse's phone using the same Apple ID. A user with more than one iPhone should "consider disabling iCloud Drive on one device (don't mix it up with iCloud; iCloud Drive is available elsewhere and can be disabled separately from iCloud)," Afonin said. "This way you'll prevent call sync without affecting things such as iCloud Photo Library or iCloud backups. You will, however, lose the ability to sync data across third-party apps that may use iCloud Drive to save their data."

AronPhoto.com Here's a whole community of Apple HomeKit-powered smart homes 0 Smart Home by Ry Crist November 18, 2016 11:13 AM PST @rycrist Up Next Amazon could start dropping off packages inside your home Can smart-home tech help sell houses? One California homebuilder is betting that it can, with an entire neighborhood of new homes designed to play nice with Apple HomeKit. The home builder is KB Home, and the neighborhood is the Promenade at Communications Hill in San Jose, California -- just 20 minutes southeast of Silicon Valley. KB now offers an Apple HomeKit package with every home in the neighborhood, and even features a model home filled with HomeKit-compatible lights, locks, thermostats and more. In other words, welcome to the iNeighborhood. 10 Siri runs the smart home with these HomeKit-compatible gadgets (pictures) First announced in 2014, HomeKit is Apple's iOS-based platform for the connected home. It's really just a set of rules and protocols programmed into the software that powers iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches. Smart home gadgets that follow those rules enjoy full compatibility with Apple's mobile devices, which lets users control them using Apple's Home app, or by using spoken Siri commands. Enlarge Image Houses in KB's Apple-friendly neighborhood start just north of $900K. Photo by Screenshot by Ry Crist/CNET And, if you're thinking of moving into the Promenade at Communications Hill, those HomeKit-friendly gadgets are now a big part of the sales pitch. It's the first community built around HomeKit, but not the first time we've seen big real estate try and tap into smart home tech to help close sales. Earlier in 2016, real estate franchise Coldwell Banker started selling "smart home staging kits" to clients trying to sell their homes. With recent studies showing that more and more Americans associate smart home tech with a move-in ready house, the kits are aimed at helping sellers keep up. KB Home is following a similar strategy here, and trying to stay ahead of the curve as analysts continue to project the potential for immense growth in the connected home. KB's HomeKit-ready homes won't come cheap. Pricing for a three-story, four-bedroom townhouse starts in the low $900,000s. Of course, this is California we're talking about, where real estate is expensive to begin with. A model house that's decked out with HomeKit-friendly tech is already open for tours, with several listings for the neighborhood live now. According to reports, the smart home packages will start at around $4,000, and include HomeKit-compatible lights, locks, thermostats, and ceiling fans, as well as an Apple TV and an iPad to control everything. A complimentary "concierge service" is also included for support needs.

(Shizuo Kambayashi / Associated Press) FRIDAY, NOV. 18, 2016, 1:06 P.M. Got iPhone touch disease? Apple will fix it - for a price Andrea Peterson Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Apple is offering a fix for some iPhones stricken with “touch disease,” a problem in which a flickering bar appears at the top of a device’s display and its touch screen stops responding. The tech company will repair iPhone 6 Plus devices with the issue for $149, it announced this week. Apple says it will contact people who have already paid the company or an authorized service provider to fix the problem and reimburse them for the price difference. The problem is caused when devices are “dropped multiple times on a hard surface” and then face “further stress,” the company said. Repair tech site iFixit says the issue seems to be a design flaw: The placement of key touch-screen-related chips causes them to become dislodged “as the phone flexes or twists slightly during normal use,” the site said. “Touch disease” is also reported to affect regular iPhone 6 devices, but Apple did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether it would be offering similar discounts on repairs for that model. In August, three California customers launched a federal class-action suit against Apple over the issue. That lawsuit has since expanded, and another suit was filed in Utah. The lawsuits allege that the company knew about the problem but failed to offer repairs. Now, at least some customers can have the problem fixed – for a price.

Analysis For the past few weeks, this tech reporter has been tussling with a complex issue: which new laptop to buy. Just a month ago, this seemed like an exciting proposition: not only was Apple going to update its MacBook Pro line (at last), but Microsoft had gone all Apple on us and come out with some genuinely innovative products. It was the perfect time to upgrade. And yet, at the end of a lot of consideration, the decision made was to not go for the new stuff but plumb for the lower-power, older, and definitely no-longer sexy MacBook Air, a clean copy of which will be available to pick up next week. For some time Apple has been criticized – somewhat smugly – as having lost its innovative edge. But this Air purchase is, ironically, evidence that it is true and that too many years going in the wrong direction (or having no real direction) is starting to come back to bite the fruity one. The Air laptop is a stopgap. A very expensive stopgap but a stopgap nonetheless. This loyal Apple customer has one foot out the door and when he goes, a slew of other purchases from media players to software to streaming music services will go with him. Even the iPhone, sat gleaming in all its blackness, is ready for the chop. It's a 6. Didn't get the 6S; didn't want the incremental 7. If the 7S doesn't do something spectacular, then it's the Samsung Galaxy 8 or the Google Pixel. But back to the laptop. This article is currently being written on a MacBook Pro, 15-inch, mid-2009 model. Yes, you read that right, mid-2009. But much like Trigger's Broom, it has had some modifications: new memory (now maxed out at 8GB); a new 750GB hard drive; and a new battery. Genius With these additions, the computer has handled an enormous workload every day for years. It was only in the past few months that it finally started giving up: occasional crashes; the odd failing to start up properly. Even then, it was only when several keys stopped working and an Apple Genius told me how much the company would charge for a new keyboard that it became apparent it was time to retire this old workhorse. And so the full, absolute intent from that point was to get a new MacBook Pro. Maybe the 13-inch instead of the 15-inch. Improved screen resolution and the fact that the smaller version can probably handle the Photoshop use and occasional video editing were the two big factors. It would be nice not to lug around a 15-inch laptop. And then Microsoft came out with its new Surface. The Surface Book looked exactly right. Powerful yet portable and with a detachable tablet. Perfect. Not only does it offer touch-screen tech – which is often incredibly useful – but it would act as a replacement for the aging iPad which now only really serves a couch-movie machine. But wait. Apple is refreshing the MacBook Pro line. It won't actually say it is, of course. Rumors were that it would do so at its big September event; rumors that my old friend Alan was obnoxiously Apple about. It didn't do it. But then rumors started up again immediately after (Alan again refused to comment). So I held out. And then they launched... ...with the same spec as before and the Touch Bar. Even as the Touch Bar was being launched, the scene looked like a hilarious Apple spoof. A thin touchable strip across the top of the laptop? That's what you came up with after two years? An easier way to add f**king emojis? The strip looked kinda useful, but fiddly for Photoshop. But when the launch showed a DJ cramming his fingers into a tiny space above the numbers to mix a dance track, I couldn't help but imagine a scene where Steve Jobs came back to life with a big smile on his face, waited for the awfulness to end, and then tore a new one in every executive that had green-lighted this transparently awful idea. In five minutes, Apple went from cool to trying-too-hard Hip Dad. Even the DJ (Karim Morsy) was in his 30s. And as the all-white, near-retirement Apple execs tried to persuade the room that he had "killed it" with his music demo, the beautiful dream of a super shiny MacBook Pro to last the next seven years took a last, shallow breath, lay down, and died. One-finger DJing: so cooooool. And practical. This is really going to catch on with the kids Hands on So, I traipsed over to the Microsoft store in San Francisco to test out the new Surface Book (and have a play on the new Surface Studio). And, it is good. Really good in fact. But it has several factors that prevented an immediate purchase: the screen removal is a little clunky. It works fine but it's a little clunky. And when testing it by running multiple applications and then editing a picture in Photoshop, there was a small lag in the touchscreen which was... disconcerting. And then the price. It starts at $2,400 but when you spec it out with a 1TB hard drive and 16GB RAM, that leaps to $3,300. A hell of a lot of money. And so I head over to Apple's shiny new store on Union Square. Where they don't actually have any of the new MacBook Pros. Instead they have two models propped up on pedestals, surrounding by glass and with two security guards hovering by them. At this point, it dawned on me that Apple may have completely lost its mind. And that was before considering the fact that it only has USB-C ports. Get your dongles here! Three for the price of four! I specced out the 13-inch MacBook Pro and the price was $2,900. Still $400 less than the Surface – reduced to $100 if I traded in my old laptop (Microsoft is very keen to get people like me to jump ship). But that was still a lot of money for something that doesn't have next-level performance. There is no way that this new Pro is going to last seven years – for the simple reason that Apple doesn't want it to. The mid-2009 Pro was basically the last Apple laptop that let you do all the things that kept it running: new memory, hard drive, battery etc. From that point, Apple started locking the laptop down. With this new MacBook Pro, there is literally nothing you can change. You can't even change the memory. If you buy it with 8GB, that's it for you. No upgrade possible. And forget about beefing it up to 32GB in two years' time. And so with my trusty old laptop hanging on for dear life, this reporter went back and forth between the Surface Book and the MacBook Pro trying to figure out which offered the least-worst option. And the answer was simple: wait. Future Not wait to get a new laptop – I have to have one of those. But wait out the high-end. Microsoft has made a bold push with its machines, offering touchscreens and new pens and the new roundy-turny thing. It has also embraced 3D and VR in a way that Apple should have been all over last year. All the VR gear is running on Windows 10. And Microsoft wiped the floor with Apple in its 3D demo and new interfaces. If Microsoft keeps it up, tightens it up and gets that price down, it is going to get the next 7-10 years of business from this individual. Apple meanwhile has two years tops to pull itself out of its rut and get innovating. If the next launch doesn't have a mind-blowing spec and some serious 3D and VR capabilities, and if that Touch Bar doesn't become a Touch Pad or a touchscreen, I'm out. And out means no new AppleTV (the Roku is still better), no Apple HomeKit (Nest is killing it), no Apple iPad, and, yes, no Apple iPhone. What will be there is the $1,500 MacBook Air. It's a fabulously light, well-powered, well-specced laptop with the ports I need, that can do 85 per cent of what I need. And it is half the price. It is a symbol of Apple Past, when all the hype around product launches was real rather than a sad rendition of lost glory days. In the meantime, this workhorse is going to be taken off day-to-day duty and will be fired up only for video editing. If it dies next week, it will probably be replaced by an iMac 27-inch which, combined with the Air, will still cost the same as the new Pro. Apple still got the sale. But it has lost the loyalty. When the next purchase comes around, it will be a pure play with everything on the table. And even though this is the tale of a single person, I am willing to bet that the same process is going on right now with millions of customers across the globe. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 127 Comments More from The Register Did Apple leak a photo of its new Macbook Pro in an OS update?

Big Data Cloud Computing Fintech Infosec Internet of Things Martech Wearable Tech Beacons Flopped, But They’re About to Flourish in the Future Posted November 18, 2016 By CloudTweaks Cloud Beacons Flying High When Apple debuted cloud beacons in 2013, analysts predicted 250 million devices capable of serving as iBeacons would be found in the wild within weeks. A few months later, estimates put the figure at just 64,000, with 15 percent confined to Apple stores. Beacons didn’t proliferate as expected, but a few forward-thinking brands did dip their toes. Macy’s, Lord & Taylor, and Sephora deployed beacons to send in-store notifications. Tech-happy airline Virgin Atlantic used them to offer currency deals and deploy blankets to chilly passengers. For the most part, though, retailers scoffed at ahead-of-its time geotargeting tech. Despite their slow start, beacons are tottering on the edge of a renaissance. Apple and Google keep releasing updates to their beacon ecosystems and wallet platforms that allow many different types of integrations. Major retailers are starting to pay attention, and the barriers blocking beacons are now falling fast. Great (Unfulfilled) Expectations Beacons were expected to boom for good reason. Contextual relevance is the holy grail of digital marketing, and beacons deliver personalized information to passersby at opportune moments. (Image courtesy of Unsplash and the tremendous artists involved in the initiative)  When a connected shopper nears a store, the retailer’s beacon jumps to action. It supplies the customer with information, promo deals, and personalized offers. For the business owner, it paints a data-grounded picture of the shopper’s behavior and desires. Not bad for a small, inexpensive piece of connected hardware. But before beacons could strut their stuff, they were indelibly stained by privacy fears. Tamped down, too, by the costs and timelines of building the necessary infrastructure, beacons lost their steam. It’s unfortunate, but perhaps unsurprising. Concerns about security loom large in popular imagination. Consumers have long balked at being tracked by phone, and they’re not crazy about pop-up ads, either. Retailers, though, have since learned to throw in coupons or rewards, raising the share of shoppers amenable to beacons to 70 percent. Absent incentives, Oracle found just 23 percent of consumers were comfortable with the technology tracking their movements in store and online. Hardware lag also stymied beacons. Hardware adoption always moves more slowly than software, and — although it seems strange now — not everyone had a beacon-sensitive smartphone in 2013, nor did many retailers have the capacity to broadcast beacons. The fault, in part, lies with Apple. Estimote co-founder Steve Cheney notes that “nearly everything Apple does…works perfectly right out of the box,” but not iBeacons. Retailers couldn’t roll out beacons until developers learned to deploy and secure them at scale, gutting “within weeks” popularity predictions. Other limiting factors like network coverage were beyond Apple’s control. Networks were traditionally fragmented and closed, but they’re opening up fast. Beacons bombed in 2013, but 2016 is another year. Beacons require a huge, deployed network to be successful. Slowly but surely, that network has been getting implemented and is now about to hit a usable saturation point. Developers have done their digging. Smartphones abound, networks are broader, and Google has addressed the security problem. Beacons may be gone from the news cycle, but they’re popping up fast in stores. By the first quarter of 2016, 6.2 million sensors had been deployed globally. When the second quarter rolled around, 2 million more had popped up, bringing the global total to 8.27 million. At the current pace of installation, 400 million will be broadcasting globally by 2020. Beacon Leadership? In the coming years, we’ll see beacons broaden from brick-and-mortar retail locations to venues of all sorts. Sports, transportation, and banking establishments are also likely turf for beacons. Beacons offer deals and details now, but in the future, they’ll facilitate transactions. Customers will leave wallets at home in favor of smartphones. Purchases will be simpler, and context-conscious discounts will become part of the shopping experience. CVS Caremark, for example, uses Google Nearby to notify shoppers they can print in-store photos from their phones’ galleries. United Airlines’ app lets travelers access free entertainment before boarding, and The Broad, an art museum, offers patrons an audio tour. The possibilities for contextual enhancement are as diverse as businesses are themselves. Contextual Sports and Entertainment In sports and entertainment, venues will use beacons to engage attendees and manage tickets. With a ticket sales app, for example, an attendee will buy a ticket and download it to his digital wallet; the ticket will pop up when he arrives at the venue. Already, North American sports team have used proximity tech to regain $1 billion in lost ticket sales. Beacons will allow brands, teams, and musicians to push contextual information, deals on refreshments, and emergency notifications directly to fans’ smartphones. Tourism and transportation are obvious candidates for beacon technology. Apps that suggest events tailored to users’ interests and locations will help tourists explore sights free of interpreters or itineraries. So far, a beacon-infused app offers guided tours of the Berlin zoo; the University of Notre Dame uses Nearby to guide visitors to historical landmarks; and the MyStop service sends transport alerts in London, with plans to expand across the U.K. The banking sector, too, will find beacons attractive. Millennials — now the largest U.S. age demographic — seldom visit branch locations but retain attachments to them. Beacons may be the thing to finally bring Millennials in for that auto loan, mortgage, or retirement account. Citibank is testing beacons at select New York City locations, where customers use iPads to access enhanced ATMs for services typically provided by tellers. But with great power comes great responsibility. Businesses must ensure their offers present enough value to merit the interruption. To allay security fears, brands should give customers in-app options to disable beacon transmissions. Beacons may not change things like the smartphone or internet did, but they’re about to make shopping smoother, marketing more precise, and live events more engaging — and they may even help us ditch those annoying chip cards.

Friday, November 18, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Apple Storing iPhone Call History Kim Zetter (via Hacker News): Russian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft has found that Apple’s mobile devices automatically send a user’s call history to the company’s servers if iCloud is enabled — but the data gets uploaded in many instances without user choice or notification. […] The logs surreptitiously uploaded to Apple contain a list of all calls made and received on an iOS device, complete with phone numbers, dates and times, and duration. They also include missed and bypassed calls. Elcomsoft said Apple retains the data in a user’s iCloud account for up to four months, providing a boon to law enforcement who may not be able to obtain the data either from the user’s phone, if it’s encrypted with an unbreakable passcode, or from the carrier. […] It’s not just regular call logs that get sent to Apple’s servers. FaceTime, which is used to make audio and video calls on iOS devices, also syncs call history to iCloud automatically, according to Elcomsoft. The company believes syncing of both regular calls and FaceTime call logs goes back to at least iOS 8.2, which Apple released in March 2015. Dan Moren: Apple is syncing your calls between devices logged in with your Apple ID. In theory, this is no big deal: Apple says that the idea is if you’re logged in to your iPad and your iPhone, you can see the same call record in FaceTime on both of them. Miss a call on your iPhone? You can return it from your iPad. Makes perfect sense as a feature from Apple’s perspective. Rene Ritchie: The Information called it “secretly” and “surreptitiously”, but it’s not only wicked obvious why Apple is syncing call history, it’s fully disclosed in Apple’s security white paper. I’m not really bothered by this, but I would not say that it’s obvious that an item in the “Here’s what iCloud backs up” section is backed up even when iCloud Backup is off. If call history sync concerns you, you can disable iCloud Drive in preferences and it’ll stop. There are no separate iCloud Drive settings for Phone or FaceTime, so if this concerns you I guess your only option would be to disable iCloud Drive entirely, which is probably not feasible because it would break other apps. n8ter#AC: There is no option to turn it on or off. This makes it completely opaque to the user that this is being done. Also, the way the devices interact with this data can lead a user to believe this is not the case. If I clear my call log on my iMac, it doesn’t not clear it on my iPhone, and vice versa. In a Sync’d system, one would expect the data on all connected devices to mirror the Sync’d source, so changes are propagated across devices. This isn’t the case for Apple devices (in a number of situations), therefore it makes complete sense that it would seem obvious to someone that Apple is not doing this, especially with their heavy “focus” on letting users know that everything stays on their device and is done locally. Update (2016-11-18): McCloud: You know what else syncs with catastrophic results? RESETTING NETWORK SETTINGS. Reset my iPhone, my Mac went off the radar. Couldn’t SSH.

Serious Eats> Recipes Techniques Features Thanksgiving Go Follow Us Menu Print 16 Festive Thanksgiving Cocktails You'll Truly Be Thankful For Rabi Abonour Profile Twitter Email 0 [Photographs: Elana Lepkowski] I celebrate Turkey Day with people who appreciate a good drink, so I always end up whipping up more than a few cocktails. I like taking the time to mix individual cocktails, but not everyone has the time—or desire—to spend all day behind the bar. Not to worry: We've got recipes to accommodate both the active and the passive drink-slinger. From a make-ahead smoky Scotch punch to a colonial-era-inspired Madeira sipper, we've got 16 Thanksgiving-appropriate cocktail recipes that'll let you enjoy your holiday as much as your guests will. Whiskey Triple Crown (Whiskey Sour Cocktail With Amaro) [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] You can be almost certain that there'll be a bottle of bourbon out at my place come Thanksgiving. This cocktail combines the whiskey with dark, bitter Amaro Montenegro, bittersweet grapefruit liqueur, and tart lemon juice to make an elegant, citrusy take on the whiskey sour. Get the recipe for the Triple Crown (Whiskey Sour Cocktail With Amaro) » Sparkling Bourbon Pear Cocktail [Photograph: Autumn Giles] If you have a lot of people coming over on Thanksgiving, you can save time by batching up the cocktail base ahead of time. This drink starts with a mix of bourbon, maple syrup, and roasted pear purée. Make it in the morning, stick it in the fridge, and once your guests arrive, simply pour it into glasses and top with chilled sparkling wine. Get the recipe for Sparkling Bourbon Pear Cocktail » Turkey and Sage Cocktail [Photograph: Autumn Giles] Three of Thanksgiving's classic flavors combine in this cocktail: pumpkin, sage, and wild turkey. Wild Turkey 101 bourbon, that is. The overproof whiskey is strong enough to stand up to the woodsy sage, and its caramel and vanilla notes pair well with a dollop of sweet pumpkin butter. Get the recipe for Turkey and Sage Cocktail » 9 Ladies Dancing Punch [Photograph: Elana Lepkowski] If you have a really big group coming to dinner this year, it may be a good idea to set out a large bowl of this festive punch. The base is a bottle of smoky blended Scotch, which is mixed with sweet and smooth Lustau East India Solera Sherry, chai tea, lemon juice, and a homemade vanilla-cinnamon syrup. Get the recipe for 9 Ladies Dancing Punch » 5-Spice Bourbon Punch [Photograph: Elana Lepkowski] The 9 Ladies Dancing Punch will serve a whole extended family; for a smaller gathering, try this four-serving pitcher drink. Made with bourbon, a savory five-spice-spiked syrup, tangy lime juice, and club soda, it's especially good if you live someplace where the weather is still warm come Thanksgiving. Get the recipe for 5-Spice Bourbon Punch » 100-Year-Old Cigar [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] This is more of a rum cocktail than a whiskey one, but it does have a quarter-ounce of Scotch. Choose something nice and peaty and mix it with a high-quality aged rum, bitter Cynar, herbal Bénédictine, and a single dash of Angostura bitters. We rinse the glass with absinthe for a little extra complexity. Get the recipe for the 100-Year-Old Cigar » Cider Apple Elixir [Photograph: Elana Lepkowski] Mulled cider is always a hit on Thanksgiving, but what if you want a cold cider drink? This cocktail is made with apple three ways: A spiced apple cider concentrate, Laird's Bonded Apple Brandy, and a few ounces of hard cider. We also squeeze in about half a lemon for balance. If you need even more apple flavor, garnish the drink with a slice of fresh or dried apple. Get the recipe for Apple Elixir » Tangy Cider Fizz [Photograph: Elana Lepkowski] This cocktail is relatively light on the booze, a plus if you're planning to drink all day. We start with fresh apple juice and spike it with fruity, complex Carpano Antica Sweet Vermouth. We also add a bar spoon of brown sugar and the juice from half a lemon before topping the drink off with club soda. Get the recipe for Tangy Cider Fizz » Sazerac and Cider [Photograph: Autumn Giles] This autumnal cocktail starts like a normal Sazerac, with rye whiskey, Peychaud's bitters, sugar, and an absinthe rinse. The traditional rendition is pretty boozy, though, so we soften it with a few ounces of hard cider. The apple pairs well with both the warming rye and the botanical-heavy absinthe. Get the recipe for Sazerac and Cider » Gin Smoky Sage Punch [Photograph: Elana Lepkowski] Thanksgiving isn't just about brown booze—this punch shows just how fall-friendly gin can be. We combine the botanical spirit with smoky lapsang souchong tea and aromatic sage syrup. Orange curaçao and oleo-saccharum lend it a citrusy sweetness. Get the recipe for Smoky Sage Punch » Date Martinez [Photograph: Elana Lepkowski] The Martinez is a lesser-known cousin of the martini, made with equal parts gin and sweet vermouth. This variation is sweetened with rich date molasses and finished with a few dashes of Peychaud's and an orange twist. Instead of sweet vermouth, we make the cocktail with dry amontillado sherry—its nutty flavor pairs wonderfully with the sweetness of the molasses. Get the recipe for the Date Martinez » Charred Lemon Gin Sparkler [Photograph: Autumn Giles] If you've never charred lemons before, you're in for a treat. Searing lemon halves mellows them out and gives them a caramel-like flavor. Here, we juice the charred lemons into a blend of gin, sugar, and rosemary to make a mixer that we serve with sparkling wine. Bruising the rosemary with the back of a wooden spoon brings out its aroma. Get the recipe for Charred Lemon Gin Sparkler » Wine and More Sparkling Apple Sherry Cocktail [Photograph: Elana Lepkowski] We're back to apples, this time in the form of diced fresh apple and Laird's Bonded Apple Brandy. We muddle the apple and mix it with the brandy, dry oloroso sherry, and sweet Mandarine Napoléon liqueur, then top with prosecco. If you can't find Mandarine Napoléon you can use Grand Marnier or a dry orange curaçao. Get the recipe for Sparkling Apple Sherry Cocktail » Shagbark's Sangaree [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] This drink is based on a colonial-era recipe for sangaree, the precursor to modern sangria. It's made with Madeira, a fortified wine common in the time of the Founding Fathers. Once you've got the right Madeira (look for a bottle labeled "Malmsey") all you have to do is shake it with simple syrup and lemon juice, and garnish with freshly grated nutmeg. Get the recipe for Shagbark's Sangaree » Tangy Cranberry-Black Pepper Shrub Cocktail [Photograph: Elana Lepkowski] Cranberries shouldn't just be limited to sauce—they're also great in cocktails. This pretty drink is made with a tart, slightly spicy cranberry-black pepper shrub that we mix with sparkling wine and orange bitters. The shrub can be made up to a month in advance, so it's great for minimizing the work you have to do come Thanksgiving day. Get the recipe for Tangy Cranberry-Black Pepper Shrub Cocktail » Sparkling Lemon-Suze Pitcher Cocktail [Photograph: Elana Lepkowski] If you really want to impress your guests, bring out a bottle of something they've probably never seen before: Suze. This bitter, floral, gentian-flavored French aperitif is a lovely sipper all on its own, but here we pair it with a lemon-sage syrup and top with Cava (or whatever dry sparkling wine you'd like).

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Local church donates turkeys to families in need as part of Operation Gobble Friday Nov 18, 2016 at 12:09 PM Nov 18, 2016 at 12:09 PM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — For as long as he can remember, Donald De Baets and Our Lady of the Desert Catholic Church has been providing for families in need when the holidays arrive. “We’ve been doing this for years and years,” De Baets said. More than 70 turkeys and holiday baskets full of food were distributed to local families in Apple Valley Friday morning as the church and Golden State Water Company partnered together again for their annual Thanksgiving turkey giveaway. Each basket contained a full sized turkey and other holiday goodies such as potatoes, stuffing, canned vegetables and fruits, Jell-O, bread and more as over a dozen volunteers pitched in to ensure each basket had the right amount of “If it’s a bigger family, we always make sure to give them something a little extra,” De Baets said. De Baets and the church’s goodwill was part of Operation Gobble, a partnership spearheaded by Golden State Water that works to ensure every family will enjoy a traditional meal on Thanksgiving. Golden State Water’s program distributed more than 8,000 Thanksgiving turkeys throughout the month of November to nonprofit organizations that benefit local families and individuals with limited resources, according to the company. Since the program’s inception in 1990, Golden State Water has provided more than 216,000 turkeys through partnerships with elected officials and community organizations. “We’ve been getting everything ready throughout the last few months and we usually get a really good turnout for the occasion,” said volunteer Mary Martell. “Something like this makes me feel good in terms of helping others and seeing everyone come together to help.” Although collecting the food requires more time, Martell said she and the other volunteers begin filling all the food baskets the Monday before the event. Once the baskets are ready to go, preregistered families present a driver’s licenses or other identification to pick up their food. “I’ve been volunteering for the last four years and it just feels great to be able to help people, especially during the holidays,” said volunteer Steve Larsen. “For us as a church, it’s a privilege to be serving and loving on others who are most in need.” While several members stood outside the church to greet families and small children, others continued to unload boxes of turkeys from the Golden State Water truck, where it will be packaged into the remaining holiday baskets. “Golden State should really be the ones getting all the thanks. Without them we wouldn’t have the turkeys to give to the people,” De Baets said. Monica Solano can be reached at MSolano@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6231. Follow her on Twitter @DP_MonicaInes.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 18, 2016 at 1:58PM This device has been a nonstop headache for Samsung. Image source: Samsung. South Korean conglomerate Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) already reported that third-quarter earnings took a massive hit following the global recall and subsequent discontinuation of the Galaxy Note 7. Operating profit in the company's all-important mobile division got crushed, falling an astounding 98% sequentially in the third quarter. For context, mobile operating profits comprised over half of total operating profit in the second quarter. So it's a pretty important business for Samsung. But Samsung does not disclose unit volumes, so investors have to rely on third-party estimates. Market researcher Gartner has put out its latest estimates on the smartphone market in the third quarter, and Samsung expectedly took a big hit in the wake of the Note 7 crisis. Survey says Samsung remains the No. 1 vendor, a title it has long enjoyed by a healthy margin in terms of unit volumes. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw some minor slipping, too, and Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are really driving growth these days. Here are the top five players: Vendor Q3 2015 Units Q3 2016 Units Change (YOY) Samsung 83.6 million 71.7 million (14%) Apple 46.1 million 43 million (7%) Huawei 27.4 million 32.5 million 19% Oppo 11.9 million 24.9 million 110% BBK 10.4 million 19.9 million 90% Data source: Gartner. The combined market share of Huawei, Oppo, and BBK was about 21%, and those companies' strong performance helped the overall market grow by 5% to 373 million units. Samsung's 14% decline represented the company's worst performance ever, even worse than the 12% decline it saw in Q3 2014. The company's brand has been significantly tarnished by the Note 7, and it has a lot of work ahead of it to rebuild consumer trust. A successful Galaxy S8 launch will be critical to redeem itself. Apple continues to lose unit share, and its 11.5% market share is the lowest since early 2009, according to Gartner's figures. The researcher believes that units dropped 8.5% in the U.S. and a gut-wrenching 31% in China during the third quarter. Those are Apple's most important markets by far, combined representing nearly 60% of sales last quarter. If you're wondering why Gartner's estimate of 43 million differs from the 45.5 million iPhones that Apple officially reported, that's because Gartner measures sales to end users while Apple (and most companies) report based on channel sell-in. At the end of the third quarter, Apple had just launched the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and was working to increase channel inventory. Gartner does not believe that the iPhone 7 is doing a lot to spur upgrades, either. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Gartner.

According to Apple, however, this flaw is caused by dropping the phone repeatedly. The company says it will not cover the cost of a repair and will ask those affected by the issue to pay $149 to have it fixed. That might not sit too well with the iPhone owners who filed class action lawsuits against Apple over the touch disease issue. “Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,” the company writes on its website. “If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149.” Apple says those who have already paid for a service repair related to the issue are eligible for reimbursement equal to the difference between the original service repair cost and the new $149 price. The company says it has begun contacting those who have already paid for such a repair, but urges customers who think they’re affected to reach out and contact Apple Technical Support to expedite the process. - Via: 9to5Mac - Source: Apple Next Up In Circuit Breaker This smart device sniffed my morning breath to check for gum disease These are some fancy iPhone corner protectors Get the Google Home speaker for $99 at Best Buy on Black Friday Daydream Nation Google is bringing Android app support to four more Chromebooks The Dashbot is a $49 gadget that turns your car into Knight Rider’s KITT Now Trending Black Friday 2016: All the best deals in one place MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future This Article has a component height of 5.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Apple offers $149 fix for iPhone 6 "touch disease" by Wayne Manion  2:05 PM on November 18, 2016 Apple iPhone 6 Plus owners suffering from flickering displays or inconsistent multi-touch response finally have official recourse, though the service will hit affected iPhone owners in the pocketbook. Apple published a new page on its support site with guidelines for repair of what independent repair shops have been calling "Touch Disease." Apple avoids the use of this turn of phrase, but the fix doubtless involves the repair of a touch controller chip that can come loose from the logic board. Owners will have to shell out $149 to have their phones fixed. Apple shirks responsibility for the problem, suggesting that the issue is brought about by "being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device." For now, only iPhone 6 Plus owners are eligible for any company-assisted repairs, though iFixit says iPhone 6 handsets are also affected to a lesser extent. Forbes reports that the problem is widespread and that several class action lawsuits have been filed over the issue. Owners who have already paid for these repairs can file a claim with Apple for reimbursement of any payment in excess of the $149 manufacturer repair price. The repair is not offered for phones with broken or cracked screens. Some owners are upset about the costly repair in light of previous Apple campaigns to repair common issues on older iPhone models free of charge.

By Conner Forrest | November 18, 2016, 10:55 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/Wachiwit In its war for encryption, Apple just found its latest battleground: New York. On Thursday, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office released an updated Report on Smartphone Encryption and Public Safety, calling for Apple (and others) to return to operating systems that would allow the company to access the data, and make it easier to serve warrants for that data. The report opens by explaining Apple's shift to stronger security with the introduction of iOS 8 in September 2014. The key feature of the security updates in this version of iOS is that it would eliminate Apple's ability to access and extract user data, even if it was ordered to do so, the report said. The following statement from Apple was cited on the report: "Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data. So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8." SEE: Apple demands to know how FBI cracked San Bernardino iPhone Of course, other tech companies then pursued similar measures in their own way, and this was a problem for law enforcement. According to the report, making that data more difficult to extract "would pose a significant risk to public safety, because it would allow law breakers, be they international terrorists or domestic criminals (e.g., thieves, fraudsters, drug traffickers, identity scammers) to plot, coordinate, arrange, recruit and conspire, without fear of law enforcement discovering their tracks." The report's release coincided with the opening of the Manhattan DA's new cyberlab. In the report it was revealed that New York has 423 iPhones and iPads confiscated during investigations into crimes such as homicides, larceny, drugs, and sex crimes. The report went on to give examples where device data was used to solve crimes in the past and called for federal legislation to "address the problem of smartphones whose contents are impervious to search warrants." More about IT Security The 20 biggest tech disasters of all time Interview with a hacker: S1ege from Ghost Squad Hackers Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter One of the core arguments for legislating that OS manufacturers make their software more friendly to warrants was that it would not require a federally-mandated backdoor into the system. Additionally, the report said, it wouldn't make smartphone users any less safe. "Default device encryption does not meaningfully increase smartphone users' protection from unauthorized hackers, and requiring the smartphone manufacturer or software supplier to maintain a key to the smartphones would not imperil those users," the report said. Of course, the public conversation around encryption came into the national spotlight during Apple's standoff with the FBI over the data on an iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook. The FBI was eventually able to unlock the phone with help from an outside source, which seemed to take the focus off of the topic for a while. Now, it's back on center stage. The issue presented by the FBI unlocking the phone apart from Apple proves that the data extraction isn't impossible. However, using a third party could be more expensive, and take more time. The New York DA's call for legislation to limit the use of certain security measures brings about important matters that need to be discussed in corporate IT departments. Managers and administrators need to have conversations about what it means if your IT department is asked to decrypt something for an investigation. Companies should develop a set of guidelines to determine how they will approach such situations, and how their IT employees should handle them. SEE: Encryption Policy Template (Tech pro Research) Bob Gourley, co-founder of the cyber security consultancy Cognitio and former CTO of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said that this is not just something that should be left up to legislators and product vendors, though. "Civilized society must make some key decisions here," Gourley said. "Humanity has already decided murder, kidnapping and other violent crime is bad and must be stopped. Now, humanity must decide if we want to give criminals more advantage in the digital age. This report goes a long way in helping inform the debate we should all be participating in." On an individual level, there is a balance that must be struck between privacy and security, said John Pironti, president of IP Architects. "If individuals want to protect their rights to privacy and security they have to be willing to accept that law enforcement may not be able to effectively support or protect them in their time of need," Pironti said. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers The New York district attorney recently released a report asking for legislation that would require smartphone OS developers to return to systems that make it easier for the manufacturer to extract user data. The legislation would then make it easier for governmental organizations to serve warrants for data to be used in criminal investigations. Much like Apple's previous battle with the FBI over encryption, the New York DA's report raises some concerns about user privacy regarding smartphone communications.

According to the report, sources claim that Apple has approached Foxconn and Pegatron, the two manufacturing companies that are largely responsible for assembling iPhones. Foxconn is apparently exploring the possibility, while Pegatron has elected to decline due to cost concerns. According to the Nikkei, Apple made the request to explore moving manufacturing to its partners in June, prior to President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the recent election. But despite that, this report has to be considered in light of Trump’s comments regarding Apple earlier this year. Trump has repeatedly suggested that Apple move its manufacturing back to the US. His most recent comments were made in January at a talk at Liberty University where Trump said, “We're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries." Trump has repeatedly suggested that Apple move its manufacturing back to the States Moving iPhone production overseas would likely be a pricey endeavor, with Nikkei sources claiming that it would increase production costs by nearly 50 percent, which makes sense given that the vast majority of Apple’s part suppliers are already located in Asia. Motorola also tried to move smartphone manufacturing to America, but the experiment ended in 2014 when Motorola closed the factory due to costs. Apple has made some efforts in bringing hardware production back to America in the past — most notably, the Mac Pro in 2013, when the company invested over $100 million dollars to jumpstart production — but relocating iPhone manufacturing to the United States would be a move of a vastly different scale.

Is Apple throttling the 4G speeds of some iPhone 7 models? by Chris Smith 18 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments If you have an iPhone 7 running on the Verizon Wireless network in the United States then your device may not be living up to its fullest 4G potential, reports have claimed. According to Bloomberg sources Apple may be deliberately tempering the speeds of the Verizon iPhone 7 models so they don’t make the AT&T version look bad. Related: iPhone 7 vs Galaxy S7 In theory the Verizon model should be much faster than its rival’s due to the presence of a Qualcomm LTE modem compared with the Intel modem within AT&T's phone, but tests have shown little difference. Now researchers are suggesting Cupertino may be have chosen not to enable certain features of the iPhone’s network chip to keep AT&T’s models on an even playing field. “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Twin Prime’s Gabriel Tavridis. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” Apple said there’s no discernible difference between network performance, but did not address whether this was by design. “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” said Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models." Video: iPhone 7 vs 7 Plus Why would Apple hold back performance when it would surely love to be able to boast 4G speeds? Well it doesn’t want to create the sense that some versions of its phone are superior, according to Jan Dawson or Jackdaw Research. "They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better," he said. "If Apple had a guiding principle it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance.” As a Verizon subscriber would you be annoyed if this proved true?

That's part of why you choose a network, for coverage, speed, cost, etc. It's not for Apple to interfere with this part of the marketplace and they're depriving another company of a way to differentiate itself within the marketplace. It's a disgraceful business tactic and if I was the company being disadvantaged by this I'd be taking them to court. fried_egg November 19, 2016, 12:53 pm I can't talk for the USA market but I can look at it from the UK market... and networks sell themselves on their performance.. E.G EE with it's up to 24mbps 4G, upto 60mbbs "double speed" & upto 150 (but likely 90) 4G+ services that other 4G networks can't or find hard to match... if the network is "charging" for their premium speed offers, should the hardware maker "slow them down" so as to create a "level" consistent "experience" for their phone users ? I would expect Apple to be sued for degrading a service being paid for if they did it in the UK Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

Dave McGinn The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 12:24PM EST Last updated Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 1:56PM EST Comments Print / License AA By middle age, you’ve been punching a clock long enough to know what work you love – and what jobs you’d do anything to avoid. Maybe one has morphed into the other, and the work you once enjoyed just doesn’t do it for you any more. That’s not the bind it used to be: While earlier generations may have held only a few jobs over their lives, a Workopolis report from 2014 found that Canadians can expect to hold 15 jobs in their lifetimes. Change is the new normal. Some people embrace it – 59 per cent of adults and 73 per cent of professionals in their 30s in the United States are interested in a career change, according to a 2015 survey out of the University of Phoenix School of Business. The prospect of beginning anew can be daunting, but two former Apple employees want to help. Since 2010, Dave Evans, who led the design of Apple’s first mouse, and Bill Burnett, a former program manager at the tech giant, have taught a Stanford University class called Designing Your Life. Their main argument is that the path to happiness isn’t the old hippie adage to “follow your bliss,” but instead to “think like a designer” – learning to see problems from new angles, then testing out solutions collaboratively. Related: Stuck in a rut? How to navigate a career change Read more: Is a midlife career change a retirement killer? It has become one of the most popular classes at the school, so popular that droves of middle-aged men and women have sought out Burnett and Evans for career advice. There are still many doubters. “A lot of people have this dysfunctional belief that ‘Oh, wait a minute. I’m 40, it’s too late. I can’t change. I’ve got the house, I’ve got the kids, I’ve got the mortgage. Even if I want to change, I can’t,’ ” Burnett says. Evans says it’s wrong to think their design-based solutions apply only to new graduates. “It’s really for anybody who thinks the rest of their life is important to them and they haven’t got it all figured out yet,” Evans says. “That turns out to be just about everybody.” The two put have put their philosophy into a new book, Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-Lived, Joyful Life. Much of it concerns career satisfaction – for all ages. The key is following three core principles. Reframe Some people may begin by daydreaming about their ideal job, singular. Instead, Burnett and Evans say, try coming up with three different “Odyssey plans” of what your life could look like over the next five years – a time frame that’s long enough to make significant accomplishments but not so long that the commitment becomes too daunting. “Designers never come up with one right answer,” Evans says. “They come up with lots of ideas.” Each plan should reflect a different journey for your life. The first should be centred on something already in mind, whether it’s advancing in your current job or pursuing the dream you’ve always had. The second plan is whatever you would do if the first plan was gone – if you had to make a living without that first option, what would you do? Melanie Jantzie of Calgary found her career in technology sales was too stressful and not giving her enough time at home with her two children. “I thought, let’s figure something out that I can do that is fulfilling to me and that I enjoy and that I’ll be challenged by but also allows me to be on point for the home,” she says. Jantzie didn’t know exactly what else she might enjoy, so she enrolled in a financial planning course, largely because she found the subject interesting. “It was something that I had always done in the house anyways, and I had a business degree,” she says. “If I hated it, it was still going to be good knowledge for me to have personally.” That was six years ago. She has been a financial planner ever since. For your third “Odyssey plan,” go for it – whatever it is you would do if money or your personal image were no object. Evans offers one caveat: Once you make a final decision on a new career, commitment is essential. “When you make a choice, if you want that choice to work, you actually have to let go of the options you didn’t choose,” he says. Prototype In the design world, “prototyping” means building models to help understand a problem. When Burnett and Evans recommend a “prototype conversation,” what they really mean is network. “Find somebody who is doing the thing you think might be interesting and before you commit yourself to doing it, talk to them,” Burnett says, adding that you should aim to have at least half a dozen of these kinds of talks. That resonates for Susan Hess, who found herself trying to re-enter the work force at the age of 34 in 2014, after 14 years spent raising her family full-time. Her dusty résumé as a call centre manager hardly had phones ringing off the hook. Even worse were the words of a recruiter. “They basically said I would have to start from the bottom again,” recalls Hess, who lives in Toronto. Yet in a way, the news was liberating: Since she had to start from scratch, Hess decided to choose something she would love. She had imagined being a nurse since she was a child, and she had nurses in her ex-husband’s family, so she was familiar with the profession. But that wasn’t the end of her research. One day, she overheard a woman at Starbucks talking about finding jobs for nurses. “I kind of nosed my way into it,” Hess recalls. A long conversation about going back to school to become a nurse ensued and this year, she will graduate with a degree in nursing. Her advice to those making a midlife career choice? “You need to have some tenacity and some courage,” she says. Get moving “A great way to get stuck is to think about it,” Evans says. He and Burnett advocate adopting a “bias to action,” designer-speak for prioritizing acting on a problem rather than simply pondering it. Like most design processes, it needs to be incremental. Small steps could include volunteering for an organization in an interesting field, attending relevant conferences or shadowing someone in your desired profession, the authors say. Often, those small steps can completely change a person’s mind. “We have students who want to be doctors and they go and shadow a doctor and they come back and go, ‘I don’t want to be a doctor. That’s nothing like what I thought it was,’ ” Evans says. Bias to action helps to solve the problem most common to people who are considering changing careers: fear. “There’s a real fear of failure, a fear of the unknown,” says Dianne Hunnam-Jones, a district president at recruitment firm Robert Half. “They’re worried that they are going to be the partner who is dragging their feet. And [they worry], ‘Is it going to be that much different than what I’m in now? Am I just an unhappy person or is it anything to do with my job?’ ” Many of the people Burnett and Evans see fret so much about change that they never actually begin to take whatever small steps might lead to not only a better job but a better life. “It’s just the fear of getting started,” Evans says.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr @ satprnews.com Top 6 Vendors in the Wearable Payment Market from 2016 to 2020: Technavio LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Technavio has announced the top six leading vendors in their recent global wearable payment market report. This research report also lists 16 other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. The global wearable payment market is likely to grow at a CAGR of 59.44% to reach USD 227.91 billion by 2020. Wearable devices such as smartwatches by Apple provide mobile payment options through its Apple Pay mobile payment gateway. Mobile payment through wearable devices is the latest trend in the payment industry. Wearable payment is gaining high traction in developed and developing countries. The use of fitness bands such as UP4 by Jawbone is not limited to fitness-based programs and apps. They also allow users to make payments with a tap of the wrist. In April 2016, Jawbone announced to launch the NFC chip-enabled UP4 fitness band in collaboration with American Express. It will allow users to tap and pay directly from the wrist. Competitive vendor landscape The global wearable payment market is highly competitive because of the presence of many players. Intense competition, consumer spending patterns, demographic trends, and frequent changes in consumer preferences are significant risk factors for vendors. Vendors are competing based on the availability of apps, product differentiation, digital content, portfolio, and pricing. During the forecast period, the competition will become more intense with the increase in product extensions. “Vendors are investing in planning, designing, developing, acquiring new players, and expanding existing facilities. Technological innovations and creativity play a significant role in driving the market growth. To sustain in the competitive market, vendors have to develop new ideas and technologies and stay up-to-date with the emerging technologies that could influence the service lines,” says Ujjwal Doshi, a lead internet and e-commerce analyst from Technavio. In 2015, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay together accounted for more than 70% of the market. In February 2015, Apple Pay reported having 12 million monthly users. Both, Samsung Pay, which was launched on August 20, 2015, and Android Pay, which was launched on September 11, 2015, had 5 million users each.

The homes, available initially in a couple of developments from KB Home in California, will include HomeKit accessories for lighting, door locks and other security features, allowing buyers to control everything with their iPhones, iPads, Apple Watch and Siri. The company’s press release doesn’t offer any info on specific accessories that will be installed or available to buyers as options, but it does note some potential use cases: Apple’s Home app delivers a simple and secure interface to manage HomeKit-integrated home automation products in one place, allowing homeowners to connect and control their environment whether at home or away. For example, the Home app allows users to set customized scenes, such as “Leaving Home,” which could turn off lights, lock the doors, and lower the thermostat. MercuryNews notes that the package starts at $4000 and includes an iPad and Apple TV (either of which is needed for remote access). The company has a model home where interested homebuyers can demo the tech, and it’s currently selling houses starting in the $900,000s at its Promenade at Communications Hill development near San Jose. It also plans to make the new HomeKit package available for homes at its Magnolia at Patterson Ranch development in Fremont.

The latest Apple Inc. smartphones that run on Verizon Communications Inc.’s network are technically capable of downloading data faster than those from AT&T Inc. Yet in testing, the two phones perform about the same, according to researchers at Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights. Neither firm is clear on the reason, but Twin Prime says it may be because Apple isn’t using all the potential of a crucial component in the Verizon version. “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models." It would be an unusual step for a major phone company to restrain its devices. Normally, companies battle to make the fastest, most reliable handsets. Apple may be doing this because it wants to ensure a uniform iPhone experience, according to analysts. "They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better," said Jan Dawson, founder of technology advisory firm Jackdaw Research LLC. "If Apple had a guiding principle it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance.” But the move could backfire if customers realize their device isn’t performing to its full potential, or that it’s less capable than other handsets, analysts said. "This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product," said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. The firm does paid analysis for smartphone suppliers, including Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. The component at the root of the performance gap is the modem, a tiny chip buried deep inside a phone’s innards that turns wireless signals into data and voice. The iPhone 7 is the first Apple phone for several years to have versions with different modems. Verizon users get an iPhone 7 with Qualcomm’s latest X12 modem -- capable of downloading data at up to 600 megabits per second. AT&T customers get a handset with an Intel modem that tops out at 450 megabits per second. Apple likely went with multiple suppliers to keep component costs in check. In field tests by Twin Prime, the Verizon version is a little faster than its AT&T stablemate -- but not as fast as it could be. The firm proved this by doing the same tests on the Samsung Galaxy S7, which also runs on Verizon’s network and uses the Qualcomm X12. The S7 was about twice as fast as the iPhone 7 running on the same network with the same modem chip, Twin Prime found. This was based on data from more than 100,000 phones downloading an image in large U.S. cities. Qualcomm’s X12 is capable of dealing with more channels of data simultaneously than its Intel rival, according to a report by Milan Milanovic, an analyst at Cellular Insights, which tests phones and networks. Apple didn’t enable this feature "to level the playing field between Qualcomm and Intel,” Milanovic wrote. Cellular Insights tests phones in labs with equipment that can vary the strength of the signal, basically approximating a phone moving from good coverage to poor coverage. The differences in performance between the handsets Milanovic tested were greatest when the phone signal was weakest, he said.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Twin Prime and Cellular Insights have no relationships with chip makers, phone makers or wireless carriers. Four other network testing firms contacted by Bloomberg News said measuring phone data speeds is difficult because performance can be influenced by weather and other factors beyond the control of wireless providers and phone makers. Though none of these other firms disputed the findings of Twin Prime and Cellular Insights. Happy Carriers In addition to creating a unified iPhone 7 user experience, leveling the playing field would also keep wireless carriers happy, according to some industry analysts. “Apple likely has some incentive to balance the performance of its iPhones across its U.S. operator partners," said Jeff Kvaal, an analyst with Instinet LLC. "It would be difficult, for example, to explain to AT&T, which remains the U.S. carrier with the most iPhone subscribers, why Verizon is offering a superior product." Representatives of AT&T, Verizon, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Companies that "de-feature or go with a less-advanced modem" may be left behind as the networks offer faster data speeds, Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf said in a recent conference call, without naming specific firms. Qualcomm vs. Intel Apple is in this situation because it chose different modems for the latest iPhone. By pitting Intel against Qualcomm, the company may be trying to improve its negotiating position on price. Qualcomm’s modems have for years been almost ubiquitous in high-end smartphones, including iPhones. Intel has struggled to break into this market and has used subsidies to try to win share in mobile. Sacrificing performance in return for cheaper components may not go down well with Apple users.  "It was probably multiple factors that drove that decision. But in the end, it was a bad decision," said McGregor. "It is really hard to argue for doing this because Qualcomm really does have the best modem technology." Still, many users may not realize their iPhone is different from their friends’ iPhones. And even if they do, they may decide Apple isn’t responsible. Most consumers blame their wireless service provider when a phone doesn’t work well, Milanovic said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Mello Jr. Nov 18, 2016 10:09 AM PT Apple this week introduced a new offering that is neither hardware nor software, but a pricey book bulging with artsy photos of the company's products. Designed by Apple in California contains 450 photos of products created by Apple over a 20-year span. It's available in two sizes: 10.20 by 12.75 inches for US$199 and 13 by 16.25 inchesfor $299. The linen-covered hardbound volume -- filled with photographs by Andrew Zuckerman, who is known for popping his images out of stark white backgrounds -- is dedicated to Apple's late cofounder Steve Jobs. It is printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink. "This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years," said Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive. "We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines," he added. The books are availabile at Apple.com in eight countries, as well as at a select number of Apple retail stores. Mixed Messages Although it's not unusual to see expensive books at this time of year, Apple's aims appear to be higher than just grabbing some real estate on coffee tables. "The idea is to reinforce Apple's design philosophy and reassert their message that their designs start in Silicon Valley and throughout California, which in many ways still sits at the heart of technology and its future," Creative Strategies President Tim Bajarin told the E-Commerce Times. Although many of the designs pictured in the book were groundbreaking, the marketing strategy behind the book is an old one. "The new volume finds Apple following a fairly conventional messaging strategy -- delivering a high-profile document that reminds people just how great your products are, thus justifying their happiness and your own success," said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "A secondary benefit is that focusing intense attention on past successes also helps divert people's attention from your current problems and shortcomings," he told the E-Commerce Times. Sticker Shock Companies tooting their own horn in vanity books isn't new, although businesses that do it typically have a longer history than Apple's. "Companies will occasionally publish books about their history," explained Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University. "Those kinds of books are meant for employees and, to some degree, investors. They're meant to put an exclamation mark by the substantial nature and viability of a company," he noted. "Apple's book is about its products, which from a design perspective have had an advantage in aesthetics in the competitive fray," Chiagouris told the E-Commerce Times. Nevertheless, at $300, the audience will be limited. "When companies do expensive books like this, they will either lower the price in the future and keep the $300 price point on the book so people will think they're getting a great deal," Chiagouris said, "or they'll offer the book as a premium when someone makes a major Apple purchase." The book targets a narrow audience, Pund-IT's King suggested. "The pricing will put it out of reach for most consumers and curious buyers, even as a holiday gift," he said. "Then again, the book is really aimed at pleasing Apple's truest fans -- the folks who believe that the company's products are fully worth their premium prices," King pointed out. "As a status item, I expect the $299 version to be a big seller among those Apple customers." Audacious Move Others may see value in the book beyond its status symbol appeal. "It will be of great interest to design professionals across all disciplines," said Creative Strategies' Bajarin, and "there will be serious interest from those in the tech world who want a better understanding of how Apple thinks about design and products." Publishing Designed by Apple in California is an audacious move, said Chiagouris. "If nothing else, it's getting us talking about Apple and the history of design. That's a good thing for Apple," he said. That said, "if they wanted more of us to talk about it, they might have come up with something that was less than $100, so people would take it seriously and spend more time discussing and reviewing it," Chiagouris added. "Their strategy was a smart strategy," he said, "but their execution leaves a lot to be desired, because they picked such a high price point."

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com Top 6 Vendors in the Wearable Payment Market from 2016 to 2020: Technavio LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Technavio has announced the top six leading vendors in their recent global wearable payment market report. This research report also lists 16 other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. The global wearable payment market is likely to grow at a CAGR of 59.44% to reach USD 227.91 billion by 2020. Wearable devices such as smartwatches by Apple provide mobile payment options through its Apple Pay mobile payment gateway. Mobile payment through wearable devices is the latest trend in the payment industry. Wearable payment is gaining high traction in developed and developing countries. The use of fitness bands such as UP4 by Jawbone is not limited to fitness-based programs and apps. They also allow users to make payments with a tap of the wrist. In April 2016, Jawbone announced to launch the NFC chip-enabled UP4 fitness band in collaboration with American Express. It will allow users to tap and pay directly from the wrist. Competitive vendor landscape The global wearable payment market is highly competitive because of the presence of many players. Intense competition, consumer spending patterns, demographic trends, and frequent changes in consumer preferences are significant risk factors for vendors. Vendors are competing based on the availability of apps, product differentiation, digital content, portfolio, and pricing. During the forecast period, the competition will become more intense with the increase in product extensions. “Vendors are investing in planning, designing, developing, acquiring new players, and expanding existing facilities. Technological innovations and creativity play a significant role in driving the market growth. To sustain in the competitive market, vendors have to develop new ideas and technologies and stay up-to-date with the emerging technologies that could influence the service lines,” says Ujjwal Doshi, a lead internet and e-commerce analyst from Technavio. In 2015, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay together accounted for more than 70% of the market. In February 2015, Apple Pay reported having 12 million monthly users. Both, Samsung Pay, which was launched on August 20, 2015, and Android Pay, which was launched on September 11, 2015, had 5 million users each.

I think this is a great item for a guest to bring to the festivities as it can be made ahead of time, transports easily and be kept warm in a Crock-Pot and not require use of the stove — which is usually overloaded. The fun part is having a bunch of toppings so everyone can customize their soup with what they like!” Roasted Apple Pumpkin Soup Makes 1½ gallons  9 pounds of pumpkin 6 apples, peeled, cored, chopped  ½ cup olive oil 2 medium onions, diced 3 medium carrots, peeled and diced 4 stalks of celery, diced 6 garlic cloves, minced 2 tablespoons kosher salt 2 teaspoons cracked black pepper 1 tablespoon curry powder 2 tablespoons fresh sage, chopped ½ cup brown sugar 10 cups vegetable or chicken stock 4 cups whole milk yogurt (local preferred)  For the pumpkins, select small pie pumpkins or mix an assortment of pumpkins and squash such as acorn, butternut and carnival. The apples should be semi-tart, and can be mixed with others  such as granny smith, Cortland, Gala or Jonathan. 1. Preheat oven to 400°F.  2. Cut pumpkins and squash in half and remove the seeds. Place them cut-side down on greased baking sheets. Roast in oven about 20-30 minutes. The pumpkins should be softer and easier to work with, but they do not need to be fully cooked. 3. Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly until you are able to handle them — about 15 minutes. At this point, you can remove the skins and rough chop the meat. 4. Return the chopped pumpkin to the baking sheet and combine with the diced apples. Drizzle half the olive oil (about ¼ cup) over the apples and pumpkin and place them in the oven to roast for another 20 minutes or until they are tender and slightly browned. 5. In a large, heavy pot, heat the remaining ¼ cup olive oil. Place in the onions, carrots, celery and garlic, and sauté for 5 minutes until tender. Season with the salt and pepper, curry powder, sage and brown sugar. Mix until the ingredients are combined and the sugar dissolves. 6. Add the roasted pumpkins, apples, broth and yogurt. Allow everything to come to boil, then turn the heat down and gently simmer for 30 minutes. Taste the broth as it cooks; adjust the seasoning if needed. 7. Using a blender, carefully puree soup in batches (do not fill the blender more than halfway). After the soup  is pureed, it can be placed into a container for storage or into a slow cooker. Taste again for final seasoning. Additional liquid (broth or water) may be necessary to get the soup to the right viscosity. Serving day of: 1. If soup is made ahead of time, it can be reheated on the stove or in a slow cooker. Bring it up to temperature slowly so it does not burn. A slow cooker is great here because you can avoid the stove, which typically is overcrowded on Thanksgiving. 2. Put out a variety of toppings for people to garnish the soup themselves. Suggested ingredients include toasted pumpkin seeds, yogurt, croutons, popcorn (plain or flavored such as pumpkin spice), crumbled bacon, roasted apple rings and toasted or spiced nuts (pecans, walnuts or even crispy chickpeas). 3. For an upgraded presentation, use extra whole pumpkins that have been deseeded and roasted for serving dishes.

Moscow-based digital forensics firm ElcomSoft reported yesterday that it discovered Apple was automatically uploading iPhone call logs into iCloud for users running iOS 8 and up on their devices. What's more, users have "no official way" to turn off those backups, which include information about incoming, outgoing, missed and rejected calls, according to the company. ElcomSoft said the discovery has implications for the privacy of iPhone users. Apple has publicly fought law enforcement efforts to unlock iPhones connected to investigations, noting that it does not have access to customer passcodes that would allow it to do so. However, user data stored in iCloud is easier for third parties -- whether law enforcement or hackers -- to access. Only Fix 'Greatly Affects' Usability In its announcement yesterday, ElcomSoft said that Apple could store iPhone call logs on its servers for months. The company added that the only way that users can disable the syncing feature is by disabling iCloud completely on their devices, which would greatly affect usability. "Automatic cloud sync of call logs is great if you know about it and have an option to shut it off," ElcomSoft CEO Vladimir Katalov said in a statement. "While Apple works hard to improve security of their physical devices, they move more and more data into the cloud where law enforcement can easily obtain it." In a blog post about the discovery yesterday, ElcomSoft's Oleg Afonin added that iCloud data is "very loosely protected, allowing Apple itself or any third party with access to proper credentials extracting this information. Information stored in Apple iCloud is of course available to law enforcement." Apple's Privacy Battles Since the rollout of iOS 8 in September 2014, Apple devices running that operating system and later versions have been encrypted by default. That means only the owner -- and not Apple -- has the passcode to unlock the device. Just a few months after the release of iOS 8, Apple's stance on customer privacy became the focus of a hard-fought legal battle with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Following a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in December 2014, the FBI sought to force Apple to help it unlock an iPhone that had been used by one of the shooters. However, Apple fought that effort in court, contending that the request to create an "FBiOS" could leave millions of its other customers' devices vulnerable to hacking. The FBI eventually turned to a third part that unlocked the iPhone in question without Apple's help. However, officials still want Apple to help them unlock numerous other phones connected to state and federal investigations. In its legal process guidelines, Apple said it "does not have access to a user's passcode but, depending on the version of iOS that the device is running, may be able to extract some data from a passcode locked iOS device running iOS 4 through iOS 7 with a valid search warrant." Afonin noted yesterday that iPhone users have reported other problems with syncing, such as receiving missed call notifications for a spouse's phone using the same Apple ID. A user with more than one iPhone should "consider disabling iCloud Drive on one device (don't mix it up with iCloud; iCloud Drive is available elsewhere and can be disabled separately from iCloud)," Afonin said. "This way you'll prevent call sync without affecting things such as iCloud Photo Library or iCloud backups. You will, however, lose the ability to sync data across third-party apps that may use iCloud Drive to save their data."

This fuelled speculation that Apple was abandoning a core power feature of the pro Mac user’s wheelhouse. A 9to5Mac reader (who asked to remain anonymous) emailed Apple software exec Craig Federighi about the future of automation on the Mac. Federighi responded with a definitive reply that Apple “has every intent” to continue supporting automation on macOS.  See the full email after the jump … Automation encapsulates a lot of Mac features that allow users to make a script, in code using AppleScript or a GUI with Automator, to let the operating system handle repetitive tasks and time-consuming work. Automator has been bundled with every Mac in the /Applications folder since OS X 10.4 Tiger and remains fully functional to date … although the app has received very few updates in recent years. The concept of Automation doesn’t really exist on iOS although third-party apps like Workflow have replicated much of the functionality. Craig Federighi’s reply says that Apple will at least continue supporting the automation workflows for the foreseeable future, although it doesn’t necessarily promise the systems will receive any new major features. The 9to5Mac reader sent an email asking the Apple SVP not to kill AppleScript and Automator after hearing the news about the dissolution of the automation manager. Here’s what Craig said to our reader in an email response, essentially denying the possibility that they were going away as many had speculated. Hi [name], We have every intent to continue our support for the great automation technologies in macOS! Thanks for being an Apple customer! — craig 9to5Mac has verified the message headers for their authenticity. This should allay the community concern in part that Sal Soghoian’s ousting is a sign of bad news for the automation features in macOS. Perhaps, Apple is simply re-organizing the Mac software team and a named leader of automation technologies wasn’t necessary. Soghoian’s departure may also signal that Automator et all are now in ‘maintenance mode’, where the products continue to be supported but don’t have a new features roadmap for future macOS versions. However, that isn’t really a change from the status quo of the last few years … Guides macOS View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Technically, the iRig Mic Studio is a USB sound card, which can connect to a smartphone or tablet (Android or Apple flavor) or a Windows or Mac laptop. Operationally, it’s a large-diaphragm cardioid condenser microphone (1 inch), with a microphone preamp and monitor channel, powered by the device to which it is connected. The iRig Mic Studio will connect to Apple and Android devices running Android 5 or higher. The connection is made with an OTG cable for Android devices, a Lightning cable for Apple devices and a USB cable for connection to laptops, all three of which are enclosed with the iRig Mic Studio. A 30-pin Apple connector is available from IK Multimedia. It has a 3.5 mm jack for headphones and level controls for microphone output and headphone output. LED indicators include shades of blue for standby and power, green to orange for setting optimum output levels, and the red LED which, with your ears, will tell you to back off on the gain. The iRig Mic Studio comes with its own mount and folding desk stand, and a pouch to protect the mic from scratches in transit. I used the iRig Mic Studio and Lexis Audio Editor to record short liners for my “Radio-Road-Test” program on a Nexus 7 tablet running Android 6. The device recognized the iRig Mic Studio as a sound input via the OTG cable with no recognition drama. With my Galaxy S4 running Android 5.0, I recorded a short test count using Lexis Audio Editor. That sort of flexibility is helpful if you need to do quality work in a big hurry, and your studio is not available for whatever reason. Admittedly it’s not a Neumann U 87, but it does produce the warm, robust sound one would expect from a condenser microphone with a 1-inch diaphragm. IK Multimedia specifications say the unit will pass audio with a 20 Hz to 20 kHz frequency response and 24-bit, 44.1/48 kHz resolution. The maximum SPL for the iRig Mic Studio is listed as 133 dB. Because of the inherent sensitivity of a condenser microphone, quiet spaces would be optimal for recording with the iRig Mic Studio — so, too, use of a windscreen or a pop filter if you tend to get close to the microphone. So what applications might the iRig Mic Studio be used for? It could be used to do voiceovers, cutting voice tracks, and, if using a live origination app like Skype or Luci Live Lite, to substitute a full-fidelity microphone for the onboard microphone on a smartphone or tablet. The list price for the iRig Mic Studio is $179.95, street price is around $149.99. For information, contact IK Multimedia in Florida at (954) 846-9101 or visit www.ikmultimedia.com.

Over 1,500 attendees were in San Francisco at A.I. World recently to hear experts talk about the future of the artificial intelligence industry. One of the highlights was a panel featuring William Mark, PhD, President of SRI's Information and Computing Sciences Division and one of the brains behind Apple's Siri. "We need to make artificial intelligence less artificial," said Dr. Mark, who stressed that A.I. is a lot more than "deep learning" and machine intelligence. This was an important distinction as most attendees were from the enterprise sector and almost entirely focused on using A.I. to do what humans cannot—massively parallel computing. Many speakers pulled out the oft-quoted data point that IBM's Watson supercomputer can read 40 million documents in 15 seconds as an indicator of our hurtling trajectory towards the Singularity. But Dr. Mark's vision for the future of A.I. is altogether, well, more visionary, and complex in terms of system design. "We do a lot of work in conversational A.I.," said Mark. "And we do use deep learning for parts of what those systems do, but there's also intent recognition, natural language processing, as well as emotion detection. "In managing real-time conversation, [so the A.I. knows what to say next] when someone says something, we have to teach it to know that they've introduced a new intent, but haven't finished the previous one yet. For that we don't use machine learning, we use explicit rules and all kinds of inference mechanisms." After getting his PhD in Computer Science at MIT, Dr. Mark held executive and research roles at National Semiconductor and Lockheed Martin Palo Alto Research Laboratories. Joining SRI in 1998, he focused on creating new technology in speech and natural language, vision and perception, planning and reasoning. After Siri was spun out and bought by Apple in 2011, his group refined another conversational A.I. platform called KAI, which is used by the banking industry. Although it's now a separate company, Mark remains on its board of directors. KAI's financial system-based A.I. meant Mark's team had to incorporate trust mechanisms into its design. "Being able to trust these A.I. systems is going to be a major factor, which is what I meant by making A.I. less artificial," Mark said. "Because people think differently. For example, people like to think of cause and effect but most of the systems are [designed to be] about correlation. Making that bridge [between the two modes of thinking] is really important, and one of the leading edge problems we're working on—to move forward with trustable systems." Finally, he told the attendees at A.I. World what's next from his team at SRI: something he dubbed "Super Siri." "One of the things we're working on is the problem of the aging population," explained Mark. "It's a huge cultural and economic issue [and there are] many aspects to that problem. People's minds immediately go to 'robotic help in the home?' And we are working on that. But we're also looking at companionship. Many elderly people are lonely and that leads to cognitive decline. We're working on systems—think 'Super Siri'—which will bring in family, help bring back memories people had in the past, and it is all tied into sensors in the home" to monitor mobility and other health issues, and into IoT. So there you have it: the next wave of A.I. are systems that engender trust, use inference mechanisms to infer intent, and predict what you might say, do or need next. Perhaps something like this scenario: "How about a nap?" "Excellent idea, Siri, I think I will. Wake me up after 20 minutes of REM when I reach steady delta wave formation." "What's the magic word?" "Please." "Consider it done."

More like this Hands on: ‘Siri, what’s new in macOS Sierra?’ The phenomenon of old tech guilty pleasures Review: Four ways to manage Macs in a Microsoft world Video Computerworld Holiday Gift Guide 2016: Wonderful Wearables I gave myself a little gift recently and revisited Ubuntu Mate by virtue of a transplanted hard disk. In my case, Mate was a gift that was giving and giving until it wasn’t. When the eMachines T6528 went belly up due to leaky logic board capacitors, I parted this tank of a tower out, half-heartedly vowing to get back to this low-footprint Linux distribution as soon as I could. Fast forward several months and with some precious free time on my hands, I was finally able to make good on the promise. When I removed the hard drives inside the eMachines PC I placed the larger one in a spare Rosewill external USB enclosure I had lying around. I tried to boot from the PC I had hooked it up to at the time with limited success; the Mate desktop came up but with only 1025 x 768 resolution. It pretty much looked not ready for primetime and so I took out a cease and desist order regarding any further investigation. Windows 10 is the OS that drives all my main production machines. When I’m blogging, I still like the familiarity of the old Power Mac G4 running  Mac OS X Leopard that sleeps until I wake it. But, while it still does everything it always has, Windows 10 pretty much can’t be beat for an all-around operating system that’ll handle anything you throw at it. Mac user loyalties tested  I have customers with Macs running OS X El Capitan and not macOS Sierra. Every upgrade of a Mac operating system requires more RAM. The last iMac I serviced was a late 2009 model, whose 1 TB Seagate hard disk had failed. I installed a 6 TB Western Digital replacement. I recommended more memory in case the customer was interested in eventually upgrading to Sierra. While hard disk replacement in a late 2009 model iMac is moderately difficult, memory upgrades are easy. I maxed out the machine from 8 GB to 16. Professionals who rely on their Macs, and who update as soon as Apple OS releases are available, do so at their own peril.  But, last time I checked, Apple has hardly any new Macs on which to run its latest OS. And even the most loyal of Mac users are currently scratching their heads at Apple’s indifference towards Macs. I think the words, “the thrill is gone,” pretty much sums up what Apple leadership and even many Mac loyalists think about Macs, the memory-guzzling macOS Sierra and the dearth of new Macs available to fill the void. Are your anti-virus definitions current? While Macs have seemed to peak in terms of relevance, the thing that bothers me most about the rise-to-prominence Windows 10, is what has always bugged me about Microsoft’s OS: It requires malware and virus protection. Any security software running, no matter how lightweight, steals performance. I do give Microsoft a lot of credit with how well a job it does with Windows 10 on older PCs. But, the fact a user needs to go to extra lengths to secure their machine running Windows has always been a turn off. The Mac by comparison shines with less concerns over security and malware, and more with Cupertino’s inability to bring new Macs to market. Which brings us back to Ubuntu Mate. Why do geeks periodically return to the Linux fold in some shape, form or manner when Apple and Microsoft are around? Linux an acquired taste? The reason is because Microsoft and Apple are still around. Linux is a draw for a lot of reasons. Its market share is minuscule compared to its commercial brethren, but there is a simplicity and simultaneous complexity to it that those who dabble therein will never cease to enjoy. Another reason that Linux is always worth a try is because many of us have older PCs around. And we just want to run a modern OS without any of the baggage Microsoft and Apple brings. In my case the install of Ubuntu Mate was perfectly fine except for the display resolution issue. I understand it is not attractive for a novice to have to do some tinkering in order to fix things. But, it’s the payoff of troubleshooting efficiently that also is appealing to Linux users. There is a sense of control that comes with running a Linux variant that Apple and Microsoft can never touch with their operating systems. No significant malware concerns, no old machines left behind and no planned obsolescence with respect to security updates. Linux on the desktop is an underdog, probably always will be, but I personally am a fan of this underappreciated OS. After writing a display resolution script, saving it to my home folder and setting it to run at start up, I’ve got a perfectly functioning, secure, modern OS, featuring up-to-date browsers and a Microsoft-compatible office productivity suite. Heck, it even runs MS Office via Wine. And it’s all working beautifully via the simplicity of an external hard disk enclosure cabled to the PC’s USB 2.0 port (the PC also features Windows 10 on its internal hard disk). Blissful, peaceful OS co-existence. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

Apple sold 61 million iPhones in the first three months of 2015, or 40 percent more than in the same period a year ago. That represented about two-thirds of its $58 billion in revenue. (AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi, File) By Patrick May | pmay@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: November 18, 2016 at 9:04 am | UPDATED: November 18, 2016 at 2:21 pm So Apple has finally fessed up to the existence of the much-dreaded “Touch Disease” — but users will tell you it’s worse than Apple admits, and they aren’t happy about the company’s plan to deal with it. Touch Disease is the annoying phenomenon that plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against the Cupertino tech giant have been saying is messing up their iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones, leaving a flickering bar at the top of the display and creating all kinds of multi-touch issues. (You all remember “multi-touch,” right? All those cool things you can do with your iPhone by touching it in different ways and with different amounts of pressure? And you saw that Apple how-to a while back that said, among other things, “if the Home button doesn’t respond as you expect, make sure that your hands are clean and dry . . .” ?) I wrote about the issue back in August, when the lawsuit first became known. “The iPhones are not fit for the purpose of use as smartphones because of the touch-screen defect,” said the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose. At that time, Apple declined comment. Now Apple has officially recognized the problem and announced a new worldwide program where it will fix any affected iPhone 6 Plus devices – for a $149 service fee. So just how bad is it to have an iPhone beset with problems caused by Touch Disease? Listen: Elizabeth Jackson, having lunch with her husband, told WCPO Cincinnati that using her iPhone 6 Plus has become increasingly frustrating. “There’s sometimes when it won’t respond when I go to text or open an app. It takes a while to open up.” . WCPO also got an earful from Brianna Booker, whose iPhone 6 Plus would flash a light gray band at the top of the phone  – and then simply stop responding to her touch. It was, as it were, unswipable: “I wasn’t able to swipe. I had notifications coming in, but I wasn’t able to answer any text messages or phone calls.” It gets worse. Commenting online about my colleague’s story this morning on Apple’s acknowledgement of the problem, a guy named John Smith complained that he had hit a wall when he tried to get Apple to fix his diseased phone: “I was told “Tough” by the Apple store employees when I brought it in even though they admitted it was also a problem with the 6.” Over in Europe, where they were already wide awake and ready to share their tales of woe, “Süddeutsche Zeitung” tweeted “#TouchDisease: @Apple räumt beim iPhone 6 Plus Reparaturrabatte ein, weist aber die Schuld von sich. via @golem” which translates roughly to: “#TouchDisease: @Apple admits iPhone 6 plus repair discounts, but assigns the blame from itself via @golem http://sz.de/1.3255427” The morning was just getting started here in Silicon Valley when a steady chorus of TD complainers began to grow louder. In responses to a story in TechCrunch, readers unloaded: “I have never dropped my 6,” said Tommy Ray Pabst at Cornell University, “but it does a LOT of weird things on its own.” Bill Thompson wrote that he had a iPhone 6 Plus “until the recent trade in offer on the iPhone 7. I never had an issue with it, but I promptly put it in a tough case that protected against drops and bending. It was tougher to slip in an out of my pocket, but I had little fears about easily breaking it.” Related Articles Apple admits to iPhone ‘touch disease,’ blames users Apple faces class-action lawsuit over iPhone touch disease And a reader named Anono Mouser said Touch Disease was symptomatic of a larger problem: Apple’s incessant software updates and the problems they often cause: “Seems like every few days my 6plus wants to update it’s OS to something new. It’d be nice if one of those updates made the smartphone smart enough to actually answer a phone call. I mean it is a phone, right? Instead it mocks me to swipe to answer, and then ignores every swipe, push, and curseword that’s thrown at it.” But if you want to hit the mother lode of Touch Disease-caused agony, go read Jason Koebler’s piece at Motherboard. He said his inbox was flooded with TD complaints after he wrote about the problem in September. “In the last 24 hours, I’ve gotten emails from 27 separate iPhone 6 Plus owners who have encountered this problem and were unaware that Apple internally considers it a known issue,” he wrote. ” Many of them have been put through lengthy tech support protocols on obviously broken phones only to be told that they would have to pay $329 for a refurbished phone that is still fundamentally flawed. Others have had to put up with months of forcefully bending or twisting the phone in order to get its Touch IC connectors to intermittently work for a few minutes, hours, or days before the problem inevitably resurfaces.” Here are just a few of the tales Koebler heard: From Cherish: “Missed a lot of great photos during a friend’s wedding weekend because I unfortunately relied on my iPhone to be my camera. Apple called me on August 17, but when they called my screen was frozen and I could not answer the phone. They left a message saying they would call back. I went to my rental car, connected the Bluetooth and used that to answer. I gave them my alternate cell number so that solved the calling issue. I was on the phone with them for an hour after that and they insisted for most of the call that this is a normal occurrence and is often resolved by restoring the OS.” From Paul: “I’ve lived with this problem on and off for almost two years now. It started happening almost as soon as I got it. I got a screen change under warranty, and had to get a refurbished phone the day after because the screen change did nothing. A few months later it started showing the signs again, and now I can’t use it.” Wait, there’s more from Paul: “As a kicker just a couple weeks ago, the phone stopped connecting to my cellular network and AT&T said it was a phone problem, not carrier. I had to order an iPhone 7 Plus but I feel cheated out of my money as I paid full price for my 6 Plus and could’ve used it at least another year or even two, if it worked properly.” And from Katasha: “The top grey bar would almost flicker all the time, and that’s when I knew my phone wouldn’t respond to my touch. So, after dealing with this for a couple weeks, I ended up at the Apple Store, where I was told yes, it was a problem, but not something that could be fixed, nor was it covered, and I exchanged my phone for $329, to get a new one, because what else was I to do?” Tags:  Apple iPhone Patrick May Patrick May is an award-winning writer for the Bay Area News Group working with the business desk as a general assignment reporter.

Slate Sign In Sign Up Apple Will Charge Less to Fix iPhones Afflicted by "Touch Disease" Apple Will Charge Less to Fix iPhones Afflicted by "Touch Disease" Slate Sign In Sign Up Slate Business Insider Analyzing the top news stories across the web Nov. 18 2016 12:03 PM Apple Will Charge Less to Fix iPhones Afflicted by "Touch Disease" By Kif Leswing   "Touch Disease" causes the iPhone's display to flicker and become unresponsive to touch. Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images This post originally appeard on Business Insider. Apple announced on Thursday that it will fix certain issues with iPhone 6 Plus phones for $149, a significant discount from the $329 service charge the company had been offering users. Advertisement The company wrote in a service document: Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149. Although Apple never uses the phrase, this is a fix for "touch disease." Advertisement The problem occurs when an internal issue in certain iPhone models — the iPhone 6 Plus, in particular — causes the display to flicker, show a gray bar at the top, and become unresponsive to touch. The issue was fairly widespread, according to our readers, who emailed us frequently after we covered the issue in October. Most people were frustrated that although Apple appeared to be aware of the issue, it would still charge out-of-warranty customers $329 for a fix. Apple says it will reimburse customers the difference if they already paid the $329 to get their iPhone 6 Plus fixed. Frustratingly, Apple is still claiming the issue is not caused by an engineering defect, but rather because the phones were "dropped multiple times on a hard surface." You can get your iPhone 6 Plus fixed at Apple retail stores and authorized service providers.

However, it is blaming users for dropping the handsets and will be charging for repairs. Touch Disease was first reported back in August. An iFixit blog post detailed how repair specialists had been noting an influx of iPhone 6 handsets being sent in with unresponsive touchscreens and a flickering grey bar at the top of the display. The problem appeared to be a widespread hardware defect. Experts warned it could eventually affect every iPhone 6 device. Three months and a class action lawsuit later, Apple has finally accepted that Touch Disease is real. However, rather than offer the free repairs users had hoped for, the company said its devices are not at fault. It blamed users for dropping phones "multiple times" onto hard services. "Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device," said Apple. Apple's explanation of Touch Disease doesn't fit with what the repair shops have been seeing. iPhone handsets that haven't been dropped or placed under excessive stress have experienced the problem. It is thought that the iPhone 6 Plus' famous tendency to bend when under pressure flexes the internal connections that attach the touch controller to the logic board. Over time, the join wears down and then breaks off completely, leaving the touchscreen unusable. Touch Disease can be easily remedied at repair shops for a small expense. Apple is now offering its own discounted service price for affected handsets. The company will repair affected iPhone 6 Plus devices that are "in working order" for $149. iPhone 6 handsets are not covered by the lower repair price. Apple said only the larger Plus model is impacted by the touchscreen issues. The $149 service offer isn't the free repair that owners have been asking for. It's still more expensive than some third-party repairs and isn't even available for the smaller iPhone 6 model. While the larger Plus edition is the most at risk of Touch Disease, there have been reports of its 4.7-inch sibling running into similar issues. Micro-soldering experts had previously called on Apple to offer free warranty services to affected handsets. Apple's handling of the situation hasn't impressed customers. The company has known of the problem for months without taking action. Customers who have already had their phone repaired may be able to claim reimbursement from Apple though. Apple said its support staff will be able to help iPhone 6 Plus owners who have already paid for a repair at an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider. The reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price paid for the original service and Apple's new $149 repair offer. Currently affected iPhone 6 Plus devices will be covered by the worldwide repair program for five years after the original date of purchase.

So if Apple didn’t mop-up all of those disenfranchised Samsung fans, who did? Gartner cites a dramatic rise of Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and Oppo; the latter performing twice as well as last year. Of course the vast majority of these gains came in China, where sales of smartphones grew by 12.4 per cent. Samsung’s comeback from its worst sales slump in two years will commence with the eagerly-anticipated Galaxy S8 handset, which we’re expecting to see in February. Is the Galaxy S8 already the most important Samsung phone release ever? If the company ever needed to nail a smartphone it was this one. Are you remaining a Samsung loyalist in spite of the last few months’ shenanigans? Share your thoughts below.

Usually people get bored and eventually the attention seekers melt away, ready to try again at the next launch. Obviously they are going to be out in force for Samsung, and obviously every tech blog will syndicate the footage on a no-questions-asked basis, excusing themselves of any journalistic integrity. Of course buried in there will be one or two genuine cases - no phone is perfect. How is Samsung going to ride out the inevitable, predictable media frenzy and me-too attention seekers putting up these flaming videos every day?

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | November 18, 2016 41 shares 37 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0               Earlier this year, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 with its lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack. While Apple wasn’t the first to do it, they obviously riled up the most attention and backlash, throwing “courage” back at the company that’s putting a lot of focus on a wireless (accessories) future for its flagship smartphones. One step towards that direction is more wireless headphones. That includes more Beats-branded options, and the top of the list: AirPods. Apple’s first major foray into truly wireless earphones, they share a similar design aesthetic to the standard EarPods, but obviously they lack any wires. There are a lot of bullet points to consider when looking at the AirPods, too. They can sense when they are in your ears, and they’ll pause automatically when you take them out. There’s a simple one-tap setup process, too, which can make it easy to sync up with other Apple products, so quickly switching sources —especially with Control Center— will be easy. There’s the W1 chip inside the tiny frame, which manages better battery life, and Apple says it will also improve wireless connectivity to boot. There is five hours worth of listening, 24 hours of overall battery life, and charging them for 15 minutes will net you three hours of battery life. Like I said, there’s a lot of good stuff here. You tap on the AirPod and you call up Siri — that’s how you control things. The important things, like making a call, play a playlist, ask Siri how to get somewhere, and how to adjust the volume of what’s playing. So if you don’t want to touch your phone, and you want to turn up the volume, you have to ask Siri to do that. All of that to get here: How comfortable is that in every day usage? I can’t help but think that Apple stacked the AirPods with so much technology, that they almost got lost in the conception of it, and the technical rollout, that they overlooked a simple feature in physical controls. There are physical controls, of course. You have to tap either AirPod to get access to Siri, after all. But why stop there? We’ve seen other truly wireless headphones on the market that offer on-device controls, like the Beats Solo3 for instance, and others have just as small a profile as the AirPods. Physical controls would be easier to control playback and volume, and it also avoids any kind of awkwardness when you might happen to be around people. Talking to yourself, or to Siri, just to turn up the volume? Seems like a genuinely strange path to go down. The other features in the AirPods still have me interested, especially how easy it will be to connect to devices, but that voice-only controls has me hesitant. So I’m curious: How do you feel about the AirPods? Are they on your radar at all? Or do you plan on picking up other truly wireless headphones instead? Let me know!

Breaking News Day at a glance Weather Horoscopes Ireland Business World Showbiz #Discover Sport Tech Jobs Property Login Trump presidency Public-sector pay Syria Central Remedial Clinic North-South council meeting School patronage Weather conditions Could Apple be considering moving iPhone production to the US? PreviousNext 18/11/2016 - 16:53:03Back to Business Home Apple is looking into the idea of manufacturing the iPhone in the US following Donald Trump’s election victory. During his campaign, the now president-elect said on several occasions he wanted to push American companies to moving manufacturing back to the US. Now, reports in Asia claim that Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics company that assembles the iPhone in China, has been asked to look into the feasibility of moving its production to the US. (Kiichiro Sato/AP) Trump spent his election campaign criticising major companies which took their manufacturing overseas. Earlier this year, he said that, if elected, he would “get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country”. Now, it is being suggested that his threat is being taken more seriously, with the Nikkei Asian Review reporting that Apple asked its manufacturers in the region to assess what it would cost to move iPhone assembly to the US from China. (Kin Cheung/AP) Apple has not commented on the reports and there is no word on whether any such investigation is a serious assessment of a possible change or simply an exercise to look into the potential costs. The technology giant has had a busy few months in hardware, launching the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the Apple Watch Series 2 and a new line-up of MacBook Pros. 2017 is also shaping up to be a busy time for the company, with their new ‘spaceship’ Campus 2 headquarters set to open. Then, there’s the small matter of the 10th anniversary iPhone due in September.

Apple has reportedly asked its major suppliers to look into local manufacturing as an option. The Nikkei Asian Review reports that Apple has Foxconn and Pegatron to study the opportunities for manufacturing in India. "Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the US," a source said. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." The biggest hurdle in the shift in manufacturing from China to US is the rise in production costs. Foxconn and Pegatron assemble more than 200 million iPhones every year from their campuses in China. While Foxconn is studying the scope for US manufacturing, its Chairman Terry Gou is less enthusiastic about the plan. "The idea of making iPhones in the US is seen to more than double the cost," notes Nikkei Asian Review. The new US Presidential-elect Donald Trump had announced that he will force to shift production to the United States. During his build up to the Presidential race, he asked supporters to boycott Apple products in the light of FBI vs Apple encryption battle. It is believed that Trump will push Apple to shift its production once he takes over White House in January, 2017. It costs about $225 for Apple to make an iPhone 7 with 32GB memory, says IHS Markit. Apple sells the product unsubsidised for $649, bringing the margin close to $424 on every iPhone sold. Apple, Foxconn and Pegatron declined to comment to Nikkei Asian Review but an iPhone with 'Designed and Assembled by Apple in California' may happen soon.

ComputerWorld India had an extensive chat with Dheeraj Pandey, Co-founder CEO, Nutanix on hyper convergence, IPO debut, and competitive landscape. "Hyper convergence is a pit stop in the true journey towards an invisible infrastructure for companies. One can spin up a firewall or storage array through a written code than buy the hardware for the humans to rack and stack it," said Pandey during his recent India visit. Edited Excerpts: Tech OEMs, big or small, end-to-end or niche, are all hitching a ride on the hyper converged Infra bandwagon. How do you demystify `hyper converged' for enterprises? Half a decade ago, tech OEMs jumped onto mobile world introducing tablets and phones to beat Apple. HP bought Palm, Cisco launched tablets to name a few. They couldn't fathom Apple dominating enterprise mobile space. OEMs have the tendency to jump onto the next big paradigm shift. Within a few years; HP, Dell, Cisco exited mobile device domain. Three years ago, all OEMs latched to cloud but many also shut their cloud business a year ago. Hyper converged today is hype as the word by itself means nothing. Organizations want to elevate themselves away from infra silos to make multiple components of a datacentre invisible to an extent. There is an undeniable shift in the datacentre because all hardware components can be pure software and the infra is eminently programmable. You can spin up a firewall or storage array by writing a piece of code as opposed to buying hardware for humans to 'rack and stack' it. This leads to a humanless datacentre in some sense. The silos managed by different teams -- storage, networking, virtualization - will converge into the cloud team. Increase of automated processes in datacentre means more job losses in the tech industry. No. With virtualization, the industry expected sale of fewer servers but that didn't happen. That was because people had more expectations which they could execute at a faster rate. With digitization in the nineties and even today one expects same kind of automation from the workforce. The velocity and agility with this kind of efficiency creates more demand and much more is possible with a '40 hour per week' employee than in the past. Tech Industry has been a hunting ground for MA and PE firms in 2016. Did Nutanix choose the alternate IPO route to create bigger expectations for its shareholders? IPO is a milestone in the journey of any growing company. There are hardly one or two very successful private technology companies today. All of them went public at some stage. Many went private because they stopped innovating and instead acquired companies. The dearth of innovation invokes the public investors to question a company's top line, fast growth, and profitability. It was a natural course for Nutanix to go deeper in Global 2000 which calls for fast evolving brands and transparent financial books. I like the quote 'Stock market in short term is a voting machine but a weighing machine in the long term'. The stock market does reward good companies that continue to innovate, disrupt, cannibalize themselves and be at the leading edge of the tech curve to dominate the market. Nutanix going public means more acquisitions would be on the radar. We will always look at smaller acquisitions and not the big ones. A great company needs to innovate continuously which is not about acquiring customer base, but acquiring great teams and great technology to build great products. We would introspect meaningful acquisition of great teams which unfortunately could not find a great target market. Do you seriously believe the days of silos in IT infra are numbered for companies to pursue a platform approach? The most successful platform companies had a single code base for all workloads - be it Linux, VMware, Oracle, Windows. Rather than one box for one workload that creates silos, we are aiming for all the components in DC or cloud environment that can be addressed with a single OS and one code base for that OS. Consumption of Apps does not mean just compute and storage. OS should cater to the capabilities of every service in DC whether it is containers, virtual machines on compute side, storage, or networking or security. Nutanix competes and co-operates with infra and cloud providers like VMware, AWS which often weighs heavy on CIOs and their legacy infra. Is co-opetition the way to go moving forward? It's always been the case. Apple competes with Microsoft and Google, but all MS products and Google Apps are available on App Store. Oracle and Microsoft compete in various ways but they have shaken hands. Similarly for many enterprise tech OEMs too. One of the advisors said -- 'Beyond a certain scale, you have to act like a country which has no perfect friends and there are no perfect enemies. You always deal with frenemies.' With all our technology partners, we maximize the overlap of interest and that potential minimizes the conflict of interest. Have CIOs lost their influencing power to chief digital officer, chief cloud evangelist, CMO and other C-Suite peers in digital era? Most CIOs focus on keeping the lights on and hence have little time to innovate and be at pace with the demands from LOBs. They need to focus on net promoter score to charm their end users. Most IT leaders have never treated the LOB as their customer. Once IT team realize that the company's different departments expect value and delight from the shared service called IT, I think good things can happen to reinvigorate CIO's positon. What would be your tech bets for 2017 and beyond? Hype convergence by itself will turn into this froth wherein a lot of consolidation will happen over the next 18 months. Many of 'me-too' hyper converged companies will be forced to sell as they failed to build sustainable independent business with customers over time. There will be the emergence of one or two platform companies that would have to be honest about networking, security, identity management. The reality of On-Prem vMotion needs to happen between clouds in the next three to five years. App mobility will become very common with tons of opportunities for companies focusing on mobility. Any change of goals - personal and professional - since Nutanix's NASDAQ debut on 30th September 2016? Not really. It is business as usual at Nutanix. We were acting as a kind of a public company though not listed. If people look at post-public life differently then it starts to get into your head. I have always believed the public market investor is taken care of if you take care of employees, customers and partners.

By starting the first-round pick and playing him every defensive snap in Monday's 21-20 win over the Bengals. "It was good seeing that," Apple said of his coaches' faith. "It was just great being back out there and having the chance to play my game and have an impact on the game." Victor Cruz tests out his ankle in practice Apple had a perfectly quiet game on Monday, finishing with one tackle. He allowed just completion all night, a harmless 9-yard pass at the end of the first half. "Any time you're a corner out there pressing as much as we do, there's some unnoticed really good plays," defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said. "There were some really good snaps in there where both him and (Janoris Jenkins) took away the wideouts. It was good to see." Flying under the radar was welcomed after Apple stood out for the wrong reasons in the Giants' 28-23 win over the Eagles in Week 9. Apple repeatedly missed assignments and tackles before he was benched midway through the third quarter of that game. "You don't ever want to be benched," Apple said. Apple's benching ended a tumultuous week that featured his mother criticizing the Giants for the second time in her column on SI.com. The 21-year-old Apple handled that controversy with maturity and he disagreed with the idea that he's been through a lot in the first 10 weeks of his NFL career. "I wouldn't say all that," Apple said. "It's just been up and down a little bit with the injuries. Now I'm back, so now I've got to back into it even faster." Vernon's hand healing Apple was emerging as the No. 2 cornerback opposite Janoris Jenkins early in the season before pulling his hamstring early in a Week 3 loss to the Redskins. Apple missed the Giants' Week 4 loss to the Vikings and then injured his groin early in a Week 5 loss to the Packers. Apple missed the Giants' Week 6 win over the Ravens with the groin injury and then returned for their Week 7 win over the Rams, which coincided with his mother's first criticisms of the Giants for the organization's handling of the Josh Brown domestic violence situation. Apple said the drama with his mother wasn't a distraction. He said his injuries have been more of a setback. "It probably hurt just a little bit," Apple said. "Any time you're in a flow and then you're out of it for a little bit, it takes you a little bit to get back into it. But I understand that's no excuse. You've just got to make sure that you're always getting better no matter what."

Other iPhone models are not covered by the program, but we haven’t heard of problems beyond the iPhone 6 Plus. Apple claims the problems are associated with “being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,” which seems a bit like blaming the victim. Adam Engst’s father’s iPhone 6 Plus succumbed to touch disease recently, despite having been protected by a wraparound case and generally treated well. If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting flickering and erratic multi-touch behavior, but is otherwise in good working order with no screen cracks, Apple will fix the problem for $149. You can schedule an appointment with an Apple Authorized Service Provider or the Genius Bar at your nearest Apple Store, or you can contact Apple Technical Support. As always, be sure to back up your iPhone to iTunes or iCloud before you take it in for service. If you already paid for a repair from Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, Apple will contact you to reimburse you for the cost of the repair minus the $149 service price. Should you not hear from Apple, or if you paid for a repair elsewhere, contact Apple.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

There are a few reasons why, the first of which is that it doesn’t go too overboard in what it thinks Apple will add. There isn’t a display that morphs into a crazy keyboard or anything that seems unlikely. Instead, it adopts what we’ve been expecting Apple to offer. As you’ll note, the entire front face of the iPhone 8 concept, developed by iDropnews, is touch. That follows in-line with rumors that Apple wants an edge-to-edge display and might ditch the home button to instead use fingerprint technology that exists below the screen. I’m not so sure about the digital home button at the bottom that stretches the whole width of the screen, though, that seems a bit excessive. I do love the way the screen appears to spill over the sides of the device, much like we’ve seen from Samsung’s Galaxy products. Just an iPhone 8 concept There’s no guarantee at all this is what Apple’s next iPhone will look like. It’s just one artist putting pen to paper. On the other hand, there’s at least evidence that Apple does want to take the design this way in some fashion, and that’s why I really dig this concept and think it’s compelling enough to share. It sure does look nice, doesn’t it?

Only the entry-level 13-inch model with a standard row of function keys has a removable SSD in Apple's new MacBook Pro lineup. 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar The teardown confirms the processor, RAM, and flash memory are soldered to the logic board, meaning the SSD in particular cannot be removed or upgraded after the fact. If you opt for Apple's standard 256GB or 512GB configurations, for example, you will be unable to upgrade to a larger Apple or third-party SSD at a later time. Interestingly, however, the teardown finds the new MacBook Pro has a connector that leads to "nowhere," which iFixit speculates could be for Apple to access the soldered-in SSD for data recovery. iFixit suggests there might at least be a chance of recovering data with Apple's help should the logic board experience hardware failure. Apple's notebooks have become increasingly hard to repair and upgrade as their designs have become thinner and lighter. iFixit gave the new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar its lowest "repairability" score of 1 out of 10, noting the Touch Bar is difficult to replace while the entire battery assembly is strongly glued into the case. The rest of the teardown reveals the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is very similar to the 13-inch model, beyond having a different six-cell battery layout.

Then, to get the new, much-hyped Touch Bar is basically another price tag all on its own. Then, they remove all the compatibility for older ports and chargers, so you need to buy dongles, cables, and chargers. Then, the guys at iFixIt tear it open and find that nothing inside is user-replaceable or even user-serviceable. Finally, and because of that, the guy at 9to5Mac says you'd better purchase AppleCare to protect it for three years, though it will likely get outdated or superseded in two. Cupertino has been clever for years, but they're coming fast to that crossroads or tipping point where it no longer becomes worth it, competition is catching up, and users are willing to jump ship to a different platform. On a side note, what good is that 'environment friendly' chart they always tout, when nothing is upgradable and the whole system has to be tossed when it goes bad or becomes obsolete because it can't be tweaked anymore?

Hundreds of people had waited in a line that went around the block through the night in order to be among the first people to buy the new smartphone, which comes in two versions: the Apple iPhone 6 and the somewhat larger Apple iPhone 6 Plus. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) It's offering a new repair program for iPhone 6 Plus phones with touchscreen problems Apple is launching a new repair program to fix an issue some iPhone 6 Plus owners have been experiencing known as “touch disease.” Under the new service, Apple will repair affected iPhones for $149. The so-called “touch disease” causes the screens on some iPhone 6 Plus units to become unresponsive. In some instances, users will see a series of grey bars appear near the top of the screen as well, as Motherboard explains. ‘ The problem is said to be caused by the same internal engineering flaw that caused some iPhone 6 Plus phones to bend. As such, the issue can’t be fixed by simply buying a new iPhone 6 Plus or replacing its screen. Apple says on its website that it has “determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.” Those who have an affected iPhone 6 Plus that is in otherwise working condition with its screen intact are eligible for the repair program. iPhone 6 Plus owners who have already paid for a service repair through Apple or one of its authorized service partners will receive a reimbursement that evens out with the new $149 price.

Major hacks seem ever more frequent. Investigators believe that a set of top-secret National Security Agency hacking tools were offered to online bidders this summer. And many of those worried about expanded government surveillance by the N.S.A. and other agencies have taken steps to secure their communications. In a recent Medium post, Quincy Larson, the founder of Free Code Camp, an open-source community for learning to code, detailed the reasons it might be useful for people to make their personal data more difficult for attackers to access. “When I use the term ‘attacker’ I mean anyone trying to access your data whom you haven’t given express permission to,” he wrote. “Whether it’s a hacker, a corporation, or even a government.” Here then, are seven basic steps you can prevent that from happening. 1. DOWNLOAD SIGNAL, OR START USING WHATSAPP TO SEND TEXT MESSAGES. Encryption is a fancy computer-person word for scrambling your data until no one can understand what it says without a key. But encrypting is more complex than just switching a couple of letters around. Mr Larson said that by some estimates, with the default encryption scheme that Apple uses, “you’d have to have a supercomputer crunching day and night for years to be able to unlock a single computer.” He said that the best way to destroy data was not to delete it, because it could potentially be resurrected from a hard drive, but to encode it in “a secure form of cryptography.” Signal is one of the most popular apps for those who want to protect their text messaging. It is free and extremely easy to use. And unlike Apple’s iMessage, which is also encrypted, the code it uses to operate is open-source. “You can be sure by looking at the code that they’re not doing anything weird with your data,” Mr Larson said. “In general, the idea behind the app is to make privacy and communication as simple as possible,” said Mr Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper Systems, the organization that developed Signal. That means that the app allows you to use emojis, send pictures and enter group texts. One bit of friction: You do have to persuade your friends to join the service too, if you want to text them. The app makes that easy to do. WhatsApp, the popular chat tool, uses Signal’s software to encrypt its messaging. And in Facebook Messenger and Google’s texting app Allo, you can turn on an option that encrypts your messages. Mr Marlinspike said that the presidential election had sparked a lot of interest in Signal, leading to a “substantial increase in users.” When asked to speculate why that was, Mr Marlinspike simply said, “Donald Trump is about to be in control of the most powerful, invasive and least accountable surveillance apparatus in the world.” 2. PROTECT YOUR COMPUTER’S HARD DRIVE WITH FILEVAULT OR BITLOCKER. Your phone may be the device that lives in your pocket, but Mr Larson described the computer as the real gold mine for personal information. Even if your data were password protected, someone who gained access to your computer “would have access to all your files if they were unencrypted.” Luckily, both Apple and Windows offer means of automatic encryption that simply need to be turned on. 3. THE WAY YOU HANDLE YOUR PASSWORDS IS PROBABLY WRONG AND BAD. You know this by now. Changing your passwords frequently is one of the simplest things you can do to protect yourself from digital invasion. But making up new combinations all the time is a hassle. Mr Larson recommends password managers, which help store many passwords, with one master password. He said that he uses LastPass, but knows plenty of people who use 1Password and KeePass, and that he doesn’t have a strong reason to recommend one over another. Not every security expert trusts password managers. Some noted that LastPass itself got hacked last year. So that means you may want to write them down in one secure location, perhaps a Post-it note at home. It seems more far-fetched that a hacker would bother to break into your home for a Post-it note than find a way into your computer. If you take that route, try setting a weekly or biweekly calendar reminder to change your passwords. As far as making passwords up goes: Don’t be precious about it. Use a random word (an object near you while you’re hunched over your Post-it), scramble the letters and sprinkle in numbers and punctuation marks. If you’re writing passwords down, you don’t have to worry about making them memorable. 4. PROTECT YOUR EMAIL AND OTHER ACCOUNTS WITH TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION. When you turn this step on, anyone trying to sign in to your email from new devices will have to go through a secondary layer of security: a code to access the inbox that is sent to your phone via text message. (Though sadly, not through Signal.) You can also set two-factor authentication for social media accounts and other sites. But email is the most important account, since many sites use email for password recovery, a fact that has been exploited by hackers. Once they have access to your email, they can get access to banking, social media, data backups and work accounts. 5. USE A BROWSER PLUG-IN CALLED HTTPS EVERYWHERE. Mr Marlinspike recommended this plug-in, developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital security organization. It ensures that you are accessing the secure form of websites, meaning that your connection to the site will be encrypted, and that you will be protected from various forms of surveillance and hacking. And this is a good time to note that you should always be aware whether the Wi-Fi network you’re using is secure. Public networks — and even private networks without security keys — often are not. 6. REMEMBER THAT INCOGNITO MODE ISN’T ALWAYS PRIVATE. You may be in such a hurry to use this feature, available on Chrome, Safari and Firefox, among other browsers, that you do not heed its clear warning. On Chrome, the second paragraph of the “incognito” home screen spells it out for you. “You aren’t invisible,” it says. “Going incognito doesn’t hide your browsing from your employer, your internet service provider, or the websites you visit.” Mr Larson recommended Tor in his article, a browser that allows for private web activity. But we’re not going to recommend that here, mostly because Tor is relatively slow and clunky at the moment. “I’ll be honest, I don’t use it very often,” Mr Larson said. He said that he suspected other browsers would start adding ways to browse more securely. “Apple is very security conscious,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they started to incorporate Tor-like features into Safari.” 7. DO SENSITIVE SEARCHES IN DUCKDUCKGO. Mr Larson said that if people were paranoid about Google, he would strongly encourage them to use DuckDuckGo, an alternative search engine. He said however, that he personally, was not paranoid. “Google is built on the hacker ethic and they have put principle above profits in some aspects,” he said. But he also acknowledged that he meets “people all the time who are extremely skeptical of any large software organization and I think that’s reasonable.” There are trade-offs. Google’s search results are more useful and accurate than competitors’ precisely because of the ways it collects and analyzes information about its customers’ searches. A BONUS: COVER YOUR WEBCAM WITH TAPE. That way, if someone has found a way to compromise your computer, they cannot spy on you through its camera. And yes, this happens.

Apple Touch Disease has plagued plenty of handsets, and as of today we finally know what the Apple Touch Disease fix will be… We are not sure who came up with the moniker “Touch Disease” but we are thankful as we didn’t want to go through another gate this year. If you are wondering what that is exactly, it’s an issue known to spring up on the iPhone 6 Plus with reports of it on the regular 6 as well. It would cause various display issues including flickering and issues with touch obviously. Apple hasn’t fully admitted there is a problem, but that are issuing a Apple Touch Disease fix… of sorts. Apple will offer up half-price repairs to iPhone 6 Plus users which means an Apple repair center will fix you up for $149. That’s quite a bit cheaper than what you would normally have to pony up, and if you previously had your handset repaired, they will give you back some cash as well. That said, the company did not come out and say there was an issue related to Bendgate, but that the issue appears “after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress.” Despite lawsuits and pitchforks, it appears Apple will not admit their fault with this one, but will offer up consumers something in return for their troubles. It certainly took long enough, and while the regular iPhone 6 experienced some issues of its own, we will have to settle for their Apple Touch Disease fix on the iPhone 6 Plus for now.

 Apple may bring Siri to iMessage BI Intelligence Nov. 18, 2016, 10:10 AM 1,345 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also CHATBOTS EXPLAINED: Why businesses should be paying attention to the chatbot revolution MESSAGING APPS FOR PUBLISHERS REPORT: Why chat apps are now crucial for publishers Here's what a Trump presidency means for mobile apps and platforms This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Apple filed a patent last year to integrate Siri with its iMessage platform for iOS devices, TechCrunch reported. The voice-based virtual assistant would be able to conduct activities like making payments, scheduling appointments, and providing weather updates within a chat in the iMessage application. The patent filing clearly indicates that Apple has been working on bringing chatbots and other messaging app functions to iMessage. The patent provided an example of how the assistant could schedule meetings by scanning the calendars of everyone involved in a group chat, finding times when they are available, and then allowing everyone to vote on the best time slot within the chat. It could also conduct a person-to-person payment by scanning for applications on the user’s phone that can conduct the transaction, like Square Cash or Venmo, and then allow the user make a selection with a tap. The patent also describes how the company would ensure data security and privacy during interactions using Siri within iMessage. For instance, users could opt in or out of sharing any personal or device data with others, including businesses, much like iOS users can opt in or out of sharing ad-tracking data in iOS settings. The patent also states that companies would need informed consent from users before collecting such data. These measures indicate that Apple is already considering how brands could interact with consumers through iMessage via chatbots. The patent suggests that Apple is working to turn iMessage into a full-fledged messaging app that can compete with Facebook Messenger, Google Allo, and others. Such full-fledged messaging services with chatbots and voice-command capabilities are set to become a competitive feature for high-end smartphones. Google heavily emphasized the capabilities of its “smart” messaging app, Allo, when it unveiled its Pixel smartphone earlier this year. The Allo app will be available for other Android devices as well, although Google Assistant, Google’s new Siri competitor, will be available only on the Pixel phone for now. Additionally, Samsung will reportedly include its own proprietary voice-based virtual assistant in the S8, the next generation of its flagship handset. Apple will have to compete against popular apps like Facebook Messenger to gain user and brand engagement with a full-fledged messaging platform. Advancements in artificial intelligence, coupled with the proliferation of messaging apps, are fueling the development of chatbots — software programs that use messaging as the interface through which to carry out any number of tasks, from scheduling a meeting, to reporting weather, to helping users buy a pair of shoes.  Foreseeing immense potential, businesses are starting to invest heavily in the burgeoning bot economy. A number of brands and publishers have already deployed bots on messaging and collaboration channels, including HP, 1-800-Flowers, and CNN. While the bot revolution is still in the early phase, many believe 2016 will be the year these conversational interactions take off. Laurie Beaver, research associate for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on chatbots that explores the growing and disruptive bot landscape by investigating what bots are, how businesses are leveraging them, and where they will have the biggest impact. The report outlines the burgeoning bot ecosystem by segment, looks at companies that offer bot-enabling technology, distribution channels, and some of the key third-party bots already on offer. The report also forecasts the potential annual savings that businesses could realize if chatbots replace some of their customer service and sales reps. Finally, it compares the potential of chatbot monetization on a platform like Facebook Messenger against the iOS App Store and Google Play store. Here are some of the key takeaways: AI has reached a stage in which chatbots can have increasingly engaging and human conversations, allowing businesses to leverage the inexpensive and wide-reaching technology to engage with more consumers. Chatbots are particularly well suited for mobile — perhaps more so than apps. Messaging is at the heart of the mobile experience, as the rapid adoption of chat apps demonstrates. The chatbot ecosystem is already robust, encompassing many different third-party chat bots, native bots, distribution channels, and enabling technology companies.  Chatbots could be lucrative for messaging apps and the developers who build bots for these platforms, similar to how app stores have developed into moneymaking ecosystems.   In full, the report: Breaks down the pros and cons of chatbots.
