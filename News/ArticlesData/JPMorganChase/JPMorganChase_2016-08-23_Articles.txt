John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Aug 24, 2016 at 6:20PM Image source: Wikimedia Commons. Most people who follow bank stocks probably know JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is a big bank. It is, after all, reputed to be the nation's largest. But even people who are familiar with JPMorgan Chase may be surprised at how much larger it is if you measure its size in a slightly different way. When analysts talk about the size of a bank, they're generally referring to its balance sheet and, more specifically, to the combined value of its assets, which tend to consist of loans and government securities. JPMorgan Chase has $2.5 trillion worth of assets. Roughly a third of those are loans, a third are securities, and the final third is split between cash and other types of assets. Data source: Quarterly regulatory filings. Slideshow by author. The size of a bank's balance sheet is unquestionably important. This follows from the fact that one of the main ways a bank makes money is to arbitrage interest rates -- that is, to borrow money at low short-term rates from depositors and wholesale lenders, and then invest the funds into assets that earn higher longer-term rates, such as loans and securities. The more a bank can leverage its capital in this way, the more money it makes. Last year, for example, JPMorgan Chase generated $44 billion worth of so-called net interest income. That equated to just under half of its net revenue. But even though measuring a bank's size based on the value of the assets on its balance sheet is the most common way to do so, there are other things investors should factor into the equation. There's one metric in particular that shows just how much a bank's balance sheet underestimates its economic footprint. I'm talking about assets under management or custody. The former are assets held for individuals in, say, an investment fund that's actively managed by JPMorgan Chase. Assets under custody, by contrast, refers to assets the bank administers for institutional investors. The important thing to note, here, is that neither of these types of assets is reflected on JPMorgan's balance sheet. Additionally, while assets under custody or management don't generate the same bang for the buck that on-balance-sheet assets do, since the majority of income therefrom goes to the assets' legal owners, assets under management or custody do play into a bank's profits by way of noninterest income. To this end, in JPMorgan Chase's latest quarter, nearly a quarter of its fee-based revenue, or $1.1 billion, from its corporate and investment bank came from activities associated with asset management, administration, and commissions. On top of this, the quantity of assets under management or custody also factors into the amount of capital a bank must hold. In short, a bank that exercises authority over a sizable amount of off-balance-sheet assets like these face slightly higher capital requirements. So, just how much bigger is JPMorgan Chase if we include these? It's roughly 10 times bigger than its balance sheet lets on. As of its latest quarter, it reported nearly $21 trillion worth of assets under custody and management. Add that to the $2.5 trillion on its balance sheet and you're looking at a bank that controls assets valued at just under $25 trillion. John Maxfield has no position in any stocks mentioned.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Business Insider Aug 24th 2016 9:46AM Wall Street jobs and internships are extremely tough to score, and JPMorgan is no exception. That firm receives tens of thousands of applications for internships every year. So if you're one of those people, you definitely want to avoid making any big, obvious mistakes. JPMorgan's head of firmwide campus recruiting, Michelle Bucaria, has seen it all. She's held multiple human-resources positions at JPMorgan, and worked on the front lines of campus recruiting early on in her career in the 1990s. Bucaria told us about some of the most common mistakes that she and her recruiters encounter. Take notes. No typos on the résumé! "Read it," Bucaria said. Seriously, you'd think this would be a given. But according to Bucaria, "It's reasonably common — more than you think." The last thing you want to do in investment banking is look sloppy. Don't be too narrow with your "objective" on the résuméReuters It's not a bad idea to clearly state your objective at the top of your résumé. But you need to be really careful about it. You don't want to inadvertently state an objective that doesn't describe the program you're applying to. The most common mistake here is that students will say they want to work "in investment banking." That indicates to recruiters that they have no interest in the finance program, the commercial bank, or any other program except for the investment-banking division. But in reality, that's often not the case! "That can dismiss you when you didn't even mean to be dismissed," Bucaria said. Don't forget to speak to recruiters before the résumé dropGetty Most investment banks hold events and presentations on campuses long before it's time for students to actually submit applications. The idea is for students to ask lots of questions about the firms, get to know some recruiters, and schedule some informational interviews. But if you go to an event and just listen, Bucaria said, "Nobody's walked away with any other different impression of you than when you came in." She said a big part of the evaluation comes before résumés are even submitted, when students are at events or interacting with the company and doing informational interviews. "Make sure you're asking questions — be inquisitive," she said. (But also beware of overtalking at campus events — nobody likes an attention hog.) Save yourself some embarrassment at the interview stage by not overstating anything on your résuméReuters At the interview stage, Bucaria said, one common issue she encounters is a breakdown in communication where students aren't able to concisely articulate the contributions that they've made. You need to walk to the line between being too arrogant and too humble. But what's worse is when students aren't able to really talk about something on their résumé because it was totally overstated in the first place. "Sometimes it becomes apparent that something on the résumé seems a little bit better than what you hear in the actual story," Bucaria said. "And somebody might fall down there." Don't forget to read up before your interview so that you can wow them with great questions The questions you ask in your interviews will indicate how much you've prepared. "You can't just come in and ask, 'Tell me about investment banking,'" Bucaria said. "You have to demonstrate that you've done a decent amount of your own research and have thoughtful questions that you want to get answers to." Some examples might be: • "I was reading in the news about JPMorgan's Investor Day, and I saw that Daniel Pinto talked about X. I didn't understand all of the nuances of it, what are the implications for the division I'm applying to?" • "I understand that this is a rotational program. I read the description but it wasn't clear to me if I would actually have the opportunity to rotate through the consumer side of the bank too?" • "What are the opportunities for mobility? I know JPMorgan is great for mobility — they've got opportunities all over the world — how does that actually play out within the corporate-analyst-development program that I'm looking at?"

A gauge of the dollar held a three-day advance after futures traders priced in an increased probability of a rate increase by December. The Fed chief is slated to speak Friday at the annual monetary-policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The next Fed policy decision will be announced Sept. 21.

That has created “an easy squeeze situation for the most crowded positions -- like short pound,” he said, referring to the possibility that traders who bet on the U.K. currency falling versus the dollar may have to rush to end those short positions should Yellen’s remarks push the greenback higher. The JPMorgan Chase & Co. gauge of currency price swings was at 10.22 as of 7:11 a.m. in New York, matching the highest since July 26 on a closing-market basis. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 peers, held a three-day, 0.7 percent gain. The U.S. currency strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.1276 per euro and was little changed at 100.25 yen. The probability of a U.S. rate increase next month rose to 28 percent from 24 percent at the start of this week, and the chances by the end of the year grew to 54 percent from 51 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from fed fund futures. “Yellen has to take a clear hawkish stance to justify sustained dollar strength beyond this weekend,” said Nizam Idris, head of foreign-exchange and fixed-income strategy at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “While we expect the dollar to rebound in coming days, as recently built short-dollar positions are likely to be squared off ahead of the symposium, the currency could weaken again on even a subtle shift in Yellen’s views.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

"It is a view around risks concerning both the ECB and the Bank of Japan next month," Sally Auld, a fixed income and foreign-exchange strategist at JPMorgan, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Tuesday. "We broadly see the U.S. dollar as a range trade for the rest of the year." Auld noted that while JPMorgan's economists expected both the BOJ and the European Central Bank would ease at their policy meetings next month, both central bank decisions posed market risks. "The risks around the calls are not that we're going to get more easing than our economists expect, but that we might actually get less," she said, noting that some central banks may have begun to indicate that unconventional policy measures were nearing the end of the line. "If we were starting to get a sense that these central banks were really starting to worry that there really wasn't much left in the tank, investors are pretty good at extrapolating small changes in policy into big ones and you could see both euro and yen actually do better against the dollar," she said. Auld also noted that she doesn't expect the U.S. Federal Reserve would tighten policy until December, leaving few catalysts to potentially boost the greenback. To be sure, Auld warned about entering into fresh dollar short positions while heading into the Jackson Hole meeting. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's Monetary Policy Symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming will be held later this week. The annual Fed symposium has sometimes been used by Fed chairs to make important policy pronouncements. Fed chief Janet Yellen's speech in Jackson Hole on Friday has been anticipated for weeks, especially after Fed speakers over the past several days suggested the Fed could raise rates as early as September. Rather than shorting the dollar ahead of the conference, Auld tipped selling the Swiss franc against the greenback. "It doesn't really feel like the right thing to be doing ahead of Jackson Hole is to be initiating fresh U.S. dollar shorts," she said, noting that the dollar actually appeared to be currently trading cheaply against some currencies, such as the yen, where traders already have taken short dollar positions. The yen has climbed against the dollar so far this year, with the greenback fetching just 100.27 yen at 12:21 p.m. HK/SIN on Tuesday, compared with levels over 120 yen in January.

IBM Exec Headed to JPM to Oversee Cloud Development By Robert Barba August 24, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related Citi Recruits JPM's Gavin Michael to Lead Consumer Technology How B of A's Billion-Dollar Tech Cuts Could Fuel Startups IBM Touts Security of Blockchain Cloud Service How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue JPMorgan Chase has recruited an IBM executive to oversee its adoption of cloud services. Harish Grama will join the firm next week as its chief information officer for cloud services, according to an internal memo from Dana Deasy, global chief information officer, that was obtained by American Banker. The new hire was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Grama will oversee relationships with external cloud providers and will chair the cloud steering committee, according to the memo. He will also develop a strategy to retrain JPMorgan developers to create cloud-native applications. Grama spent the last 20 years at IBM in various software development roles. He was most recently head of software development for IBM's cloud unit, according to the memo. "Harish has extensive experience in leading large globally distributed organizations in cloud native offerings," the memo said. "Additionally, he was a key leader in driving the transformation of IBM's developer workforce." JPMorgan is pursuing a "hybrid cloud model," which means it is looking to use both public and private clouds. The company has dubbed its private cloud Gaia. The use of cloud technology is appealing to banks because it promises greater efficiencies and should make it easier for the bank to adopt newer technology. However, security risks are the downside.

After trouncing their human counterparts in the first half of the year, equity managers who rely on automated processes are having a rough third quarter. The proportion of quantitative funds whose return exceeds their benchmark has dropped to 28 per cent since July, data from JPMorgan Chase & Co show. Compare that to fundamental equity managers, where 52 per cent are outperforming. With earnings season now all but complete, stocks have barely budged in the past two weeks. Photo: Michael Nagle Stock pickers are exacting revenge because of a rotation below the surface of one the quietest share markets since before the tech bubble, a stretch of peace that lingered Wednesday as the S&P 500 Index slipped 0.2 per cent to 2183.37 at 12.32pm in New York. The popularity of richly valued low-volatility stocks has begun to fizzle - bad news for quantitative funds that latched onto them for their momentum characteristics following the Brexit vote. Now, value stocks are showing signs of regaining favour. "This unwind of low vol likely explains the recent underperformance of quant funds, while the rotation into value has helped fundamental investors regain some lost ground," Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of equity strategy and global quant research at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. "Quant funds fared better in the first half as their performance is more closely tied to low-vol stocks. " US stocks edged lower Wednesday, circling in a holding pattern as investors awaited Friday's speech from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen for clues on when to expect higher borrowing costs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 25.27 points to 18,522.03, and the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.1 per cent. The S&P 500 briefly climbed yesterday above its August 15 record close. The gauge has gone 32 days without a 1 per cent move in either direction, the longest since 2014. It's been a difficult year for active mutual funds, faced with nearly $US110 billion of outflows as investors poured $US35 billion into passive vehicles. Only 34 per cent beat their benchmark in the second quarter, according to JPMorgan data. Quantitative strategies fared better, with roughly half outperforming, after their programs benefited from a rally in energy shares following the February low. Now the edge is shifting back to the humans. Advertisement Low-volatility ETFs were among the biggest beneficiaries of passive flows this year. The iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility ETF and the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility fund reached $US20 billion in total combined assets for the first time in May. Investor interest in defensive industries pushed valuations to records and turned many low-vol companies into into momentum stocks, a favourite among the trend-following quant strategies. But since the the start of August, BlackRock's minimum variance product has seen more than $US333 million in outflows, the most ever for a period of that length. Investors added $200 billion to the Vanguard Value ETF over the same time frame. "What we have seen over the last couple of months is that the more defensive sectors such as consumer staples and utilities have started to underperform because they are so overvalued," Julian Emanuel, executive director of US equity and derivatives strategy at UBS, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television Wednesday. "This is a more uncertain world, and we think volatility will revert once again." Quants had been the only hedge fund category to actually add to stock holdings in the first half of 2016, a move which paid off as the S&P 500 crept within striking distance of all-time highs. But computer-driven investors have been unloading shares since the Federal Reserve's June meeting, according Mark Connors, Credit Suisse Group's global head of risk advisory. "Quant funds had a very large footprint in gross exposure in 2016 versus long-short funds, which were contracting," Connors said by phone. "Gross exposure is almost flat on the year now for quant funds. They don't do that when their strategies are working." Hawkish remarks from Fed officials last week, lofty stock prices and lacklustre data combined to curb the rally that drove the S&P 500 to fresh records this month amid better-than-estimated earnings. A report today showed sales of previously owned homes last month dropped more than forecast from a nine-year high. The main equity index is up 19 per cent since reaching a 22-month low in February, and trades near its highest valuation in more than decade, based on estimated income. With earnings season now all but complete, stocks have barely budged in the past two weeks. The S&P 500 has weaved near the 2180 level, while the CBOE Volatility Index is close to a two-year low. At a mean level around 12 this month, the measure of market turbulence known as the VIX is the lowest for any August since 1994, and has been below 15 for 35 days, the longest stretch of calm since July 2014. It rose 5.3 per cent Wednesday to 13.03 for a third straight advance. Advertisement Advertisement HuffPost Australia Australia Can't Afford A Gap Between ...

They're bullish. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Aug 24, 2016 at 11:20AM Wells Fargo has never failed a physical. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Analysts are bullish on Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock, but they don't think its share price has as much upside as its peers. Most of the 36 analysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance who track Wells Fargo rate the bank either a buy or a strong buy. And while a third of them rate it a hold, none of them are encouraging clients to sell their stakes in the nation's third-biggest bank by assets. Taken together, Wells Fargo earns a recommendation rating of 2.4, which is in the vicinity of a buy. The scale goes from 1.0 for strong buy, up to 5.0 for strong sell. A rating of 3.0 is a hold recommendation, while a 2.0 is the standard buy recommendation. Bank Recommendation Rating Bank of America 1.9 Citigroup 2.0 JPMorgan Chase 2.1 Wells Fargo 2.4 Morgan Stanley 2.4 Goldman Sachs 2.4 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Wells Fargo ranks near the bottom of the list compared to the nation's five other megabanks, but this has less to do with its future prospects than it does with its current valuation. In that vein, it's no coincidence Bank of America and Citigroup have the highest ratings, and trade at the largest discounts to book value. This also helps to explain why analysts see less short-term upside in Wells Fargo than they do in Bank of America and Citigroup. The consensus price target on Wells Fargo stock is $53, which is about 9% higher than where it trades today. By comparison, as you can see in the table below, analysts are forecasting double-digit upsides for B of A and Citi. Bank Current Price Consensus Price Target Consensus Upside Citigroup $46.49 $54.19 16.6% Bank of America $15.23 $17.28 13.5% Wells Fargo $48.62 $53.00 9% Goldman Sachs $166.76 $181.21 8.7% JPMorgan Chase $65.88 $69.84 6% Morgan Stanley $30.69 $32.37 5.5% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. It's worth noting, too, that Wells Fargo has suffered a handful of analyst downgrades. Most recently, Raymond James downgraded it from an outperform to a market perform. But because these downgrades struck industrywide, it's fair to say that they were triggered primarily by the broader economy, not by concerns specifically about Wells Fargo. And, to be clear, this isn't the most hospitable environment for banks. In addition to the fact that economic concerns about China and Europe are suppressing loan demand, low interest rates here in the United States are constraining lending margins as well. This weighs on banks' profitability. Making matters worse for the institutions are post-financial-crisis regulations that have increased their operating costs. Even after factoring in these concerns, however, analysts are still broadly bullish on banks. While they see more short-term upside in undervalued stocks like Bank of America and Citigroup, they're optimistic about Wells Fargo's prospects too.

Ogawa, a former hedge fund manager at Evolution Japan, will report to Chiyo Aoshima, head of equity sales at JPMorgan Securities Japan Co., and corporate access and client relationship management in Asia, the brokerage said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg News. JPMorgan is seeking to boost its Japan stock business, and Ogawa is at least the fourth senior recruit by the U.S. bank for the operation in the past year.

Oil climbed. The dissonance of reports showing a surge in American new home sales and a slowdown in manufacturing brought into question the hawkish tone of recent comments from Fed officials, keeping the relative sense of calm across asset classes. The S&P 500 Index briefly topped its record closing high, while Treasury 10-year notes were stuck in the tightest monthly trading range since 2006. Oil rallied on speculation that Iran may be more willing to cooperate with other producers seeking to freeze output. Market sentiment has seesawed in recent weeks as traders look for clues on how aggressive the Fed will be in its approach to tightening, while awaiting a speech from Chair Janet Yellen on Friday. The set of mixed economic data is dimming the outlook for the US to diverge from increased monetary stimulus in Europe and Asia. There’s a 26 per cent chance of a rate hike in September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on fed fund futures. “We’re crawling toward another high, and it’s all about being in this sweet spot where everything is working well, but not overheating,” said Larry Peruzzi, managing director of international equities at Mischler Financial Group Inc. in Boston. “Now everybody’s looking to Yellen’s testimony on Friday.” The Bank of America Merrill Lynch GFSI Market Risk Index, a measure of future price swings implied by options trading on global equities, interest rates, currencies and commodities, is close to the lowest level of 2016. US stock volatility hovered near a two-year low, while a similar gauge for Treasuries has tumbled from its June peak. Earlier this month, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. index tracking three-month currency swings fell to its lowest since late 2015. Stocks American equities showed signs of breaking out of a torpor, with Monsanto Co. leading a rally in raw-material shares as it’s said to be closer to a merger with Bayer AG. Chipmakers boosted the technology group, and Best Buy Co. surged 20 per cent after surprising earnings. The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent at 4 p.m. in New York. The benchmark gauge has been moving within narrow ranges as investors assess valuations near the highest levels in more than a decade and signals from policy makers, while the earnings season winds down. “We’re in the most aggressive dip-buying market I’ve ever seen,” said Brian Frank, a portfolio manager at Key Biscayne, Florida-based Frank Capital Partners LLC. “I wouldn’t even call the last two days a dip, but any little tiny decline seems to be an excuse to buy and talk about the Fed.” European shares rose the most in two weeks as commodity producers rebounded on higher metals prices, and data pointed to continuing economic progress in the region. BHP Billiton Ltd. and Anglo American Plc led miners to the best performance of the 19 industry groups on the equity gauge as iron ore in China jumped to a two-week high. Emerging-market shares halted a two-day slide as Brazil’s Ibovespa rose after the government signaled stepped up efforts to trim a budget deficit, fueling optimism that lawmakers will support measures aimed at restoring the country’s finances. Bonds Benchmark Treasury 10-year note yield was little changed at 1.55 per cent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It hasn’t closed above 1.6 per cent since June 23, the day the U.K. voted to leave the European Union. Investors turned even more neutral on Treasuries in the week ended Aug. 22, with both long and short positions declining, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. survey showed. The Fed chief is scheduled to speak at an annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Aug. 26, at a time when vice chairman Stanley Fischer and other Fed colleagues have stated that interest rates may still rise in 2016.  Officials are trying to balance their desire to hike this year, following liftoff from near zero in December, with longer-term concerns that slowing global growth may prevent the policy rate from rising to levels seen in previous economic cycles. “It’s the boring part ahead of Yellen,” said David Keeble, New York-based head of fixed-income strategy at Credit Agricole SA. “The Fed can control the short end to some extent—that control has lessened with each promise they’ll hike which hasn’t been fulfilled. But if Yellen does give a firm signal we’ll get a rate hike fairly soon, perhaps September or December, we’ll definitely react.” Yesterday’s US$26 billion (RM104.52 billion) US two-year note sale drew a yield of 0.76 per cent. Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place bids with the Treasury, purchased 25.2 per cent, the highest allocation since May and exceeding the 16.3 per cent average at the previous 10 auctions. The yield premium that investors demand for holding Italian 10-year debt instead of benchmark German bunds has widened from a four-month low reached on Aug. 15. Already struggling with sluggish growth and a banking crisis, Italy is heading for a referendum as Prime Minister Matteo Renzi attempts to overhaul the constitution. Currencies The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 major peers, rose 0.1 per cent after dropping throughout most of the trading day. The greenback lost 0.1 per cent to 100.24 yen, and rose 0.1 per cent to US$1.1306 per euro. “The way investors are starting to get biased right now is that yes, maybe we get a little bit of a boost to the dollar from this one hike this year, but if the longer-term picture is still relatively benign, this supports risk sentiment” and works against the dollar, Vassili Serebriakov, a foreign-exchange strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in New York, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “The bias is still for Yellen to be quite dovish, and if there’s a risk of a surprise, maybe it’s a little less dovish than more dovish.” South Africa’s rand led losses in major currencies after the Daily Maverick said a police unit had ordered Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to report to its offices tomorrow, raising concern the National Treasury chief may be replaced. Commodities Oil rose 1.5 per cent higher after Reuters reported that Iran is sending “positive signals” that it may support joint action to bolster the oil market, citing unidentified sources in OPEC and the oil industry. Iran hasn’t decided whether to join any action, according to the sources. If OPEC and some other producers agree to cap output at informal talks next month, the resulting price boost may help other suppliers revive output, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. “This is just more jawboning,” said Sarah Emerson, managing director of ESAI Energy Inc., a consulting company in Wakefield, Massachusetts. “Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia are the OPEC members that everyone is listening to. The market will react to any news that comes from them.” West Texas Intermediate for October delivery rose 69 cents to settle at US$48.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Former Gophers baskeball star and Timberwolves player Sam Jacobson is facing felony theft charges over the sale of his Apple Valley home five years ago. Former Minnesota Gophers star Sam Jacobson played with the Los Angeles Lakers, the Golden State Warriors and the Minnesota Timberwolves during three seasons after being picked 26th in the first round of the 1998 NBA draft. (File photo) Jacobson sold the home at a loss in August 2011 after his lender, JP Morgan Chase, approved the short sale and agreed to forgive his remaining loan amount. But he didn’t tell Chase he was selling the home to his girlfriend and he would remain in the home while they fixed it up for resale, according to charges filed in Dakota County District Court. Jacobson’s girlfriend, Traci Quam, sold the house four months later at a profit of $150,000, which she used to put a down payment on a $552,000 home in the Cobblestone Lake development in Apple Valley. “The day she closed on the Cobblestone Lake home, July 20, 2012, Sam Jacobson proposed to her,” an investigator wrote in the criminal complaint. The two had signed documents stating there was no relationship between buyer and seller, that Jacobson would not remain in the home and he would receive no proceeds from the sale of the home. A Chase representative told an investigator the bank lost nearly $80,000 on the deal and would not have approved it if the relationship between Jacobson and Quam had been disclosed.

They are to make first court appearances Oct. 24. Sam Jacobson’s attorney, Ryan Garry, said they would be fighting the allegations aggressively. Jacobson, an all-time top scorer for the Gophers who played high school basketball in Cottage Grove, was picked 26th in the first round of the 1998 NBA draft and went on to play several seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, the Golden State Warriors and the Minnesota Timberwolves. He retired from professional basketball in 2007 after playing in Europe and got a degree from the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management.

Wayne from Woodbury Looks like the Carlson School of Management isn’t teaching “Wall Street 101” very well. Hey Sam, you’re not supposed to screw the banks, you’re supposed to screw the government, then nobody cares! What you need here is an FHA loan. caringwhiteguy Sorry Mr. Indoctrinated. Wall Street does not screw the Government; it colludes with the Government to screw the public. That way they both get their take. Just take a quick look at the contributors to the Clinton Foundation and the picture will become more clear to you. Denis Liljedahl So what’s the big deal about their relationship and the bank? I don’t understand. Skip67 The problem is…..short sales are the last option for the bank. It causes them to eat the loss between what is owed on the loan, and what the home can sell for. When two parties are in cahoots to arrange a short sale, and the seller continues to live there afterwards…..they are conspiring to avoid paying all of the loan they took out and stick the bank with the loss. That’s where it’s illegal. Denis Liljedahl Got it, thanks for clearing that up for me. Eastsider 3 When my daughter was looking to buy her first house, she considered a home where the seller had gotten the OK from the bank to have it be a short sale. When my daughter made an offer on the home, she had to sign numerous statements saying that there was no relationship between her and the seller, that the seller would have no further connection to the house, that there were no “side” arrangements between her and the seller, etc etc, and it was explained in great detail why this was being asked and the consequences for this kind of fraud. And that was just to make an offer! (This was also in 2012, just like the Jacobson transaction.) So it would be hard for any buyer or seller to claim that they didn’t know or didn’t understand the ramifications of this kind of action. Especially a graduate of the Carlson School of Management. Kiki J. I read this criminal complaint on the MN department of Commerce site and it was really slick how he did it with his girlfriend and her father was also involved in it as well. Not sure why he wasn’t charged with anything. Skip67 Sounds consistent with the character of this kid Mistress Lorna This guy would have played for Clem Haskins, right ?? Shocking. Just shocking. DavefromMinn Did he fill out the fraudulent documents himself, or have his tutor do the work for him? JonasGrumby Don’t tick the ex-wife, either! Tom Yeah. Word is he was ratted out by the ex! willallen2 Yes, brilliant legal minds have determined that committing a felony with the new wife, in full view of the angry old wife, is an inadvisable path to take. To use a techicall legal term, Mr. Jacobson is likely, well, thiis is a family newspaper…… Rob Bauman Put this criminal and gal in jail! Anybody else would be heading there and in the end, we pay for all of this as taxpayers! peterpuck66 Senator Jacobson….has a nice ring to it:) bigdrone Should have done this working FOR the bank. Then you would have gotten a raise instead of criminal charges.

R3 Files Blockchain Patent for Financial Agreements Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the project for which R3 had filed a patent. It is Corda, not Concord. By Tanaya Macheel August 24, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related Banks' Privacy Concerns Shaping Blockchain Vendors' Strategies Bank Consortium CEO Wants to Build the Microsoft of Blockchains Why Standards Would Aid Blockchain's Adoption Blockchains and Shared Ledgers: A Banker's Guide (white paper) How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue R3 CEV, a consortium of several of the largest global banks focused on blockchain, filed its first patent on Tuesday: a distributed ledger platform designed to manage financial agreements between regulated financial institutions. The bank consortium expects to launch a full-scale version of the platform by mid-2017 with firms testing it in early 2017, a spokesman for R3 confirmed Wednesday. Current members of the consortium haven't committed to using it and aren't bound to it. R3 launched almost a year ago with nine bank backers to develop a settlement platform for the billions of dollars in transactions processed by the financial industry each year. It has since grown to more than 60 members, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citi. The group has acted as a sort of standards-setting body thus far as its fellow blockchain vendors have begun developing technology for financial services more publicly. In September the firm hired IBM's former executive architect of banking innovation, Richard Gendal Brown, who has since been building Corda to record and manage important, financial agreements among institutions. Corda is just one element of the wider Concord platform, the startup's development project that will allow companies to run high-scale financial applications on permissioned blockchain networks across organizations and internally, according to the Wall Street Journal, who first reported on Concord Wednesday morning. Such applications could include trade clearing and settling, recording cash balances and asset registry and reconciliation. Pushing middle- and back-office functions to a cloud-based ledger is a major focus of the project and there will be various other elements of Concord like Corda, though R3 declined to give further details. Separately, R3 members BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Santander and UBS are also working on a blockchain-based transaction settlement project called the Utility Settlement Coin, an asset-backed digital cash instrument for institutional financial markets implemented on blockchain technology. The initiative builds on earlier experiments by UBS and blockchain software company Clearmatics, Deutsche Bank said in a Wednesday news release.

What's in a Name? ClearXchange Eyeing Catchier Moniker By John Adams August 24, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints IMAGE: Bloomberg News Related B of A Sees Digital Payments Cutting $1B Cash-Handling Cost U.S. Bank Stops Charging for Real-Time P-to-P Payments The Real Promise of Real-Time Payments (It's Not the Fees) Chase Revisits Its Approach to P-to-P 7 Faster Payments Projects in the U.S. ClearXchange has access to a majority of the market's online banking accounts as it takes on Venmo, but there's one thing it may not have. "If you look at Venmo, it's as much a verb as it is a noun…'venmo' me the money. It's tough to turn clearXchange into a verb," said Richard Crone, a payments consultant whose firm also researches marketing. The bank-led clearXchange system is expected to launch a new brand for its P-to-P service, "Zelle," according to the Wall Street Journal. The paper attributed the report to unnamed sources, and Early Warning—clearXchange's operator—did not return a request for comment by deadline. "Zelle has a new hip flair to it and it can be easily translated into a verb," Crone said. "'Zelle me the money' almost sounds like 'show me the money.'" The name is not final, the Journal reported, but as of now it's scheduled to be unveiled in October. The paper also said clearXchange, which has operated for several years, has not been promoted as a consumer brand. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Well Fargo founded clearXchange as a way to attract consumers to an easy-to-use money transfer system—email or mobile phone numbers are all that's required to route most transactions. The three founding banks cover more than half of the online banking market, and clearXchange has added other banks over the past four years, including community banks such as FirstBank and larger banks such as U.S. Bank. Early Warning, a bank-driven risk management initiative that includes many of the same banks behind clearXchange, merged the two systems in 2015 to broaden the scale and scope of both ventures. The bankers behind Early Warning and clearXchange also have broader ambitions for the service, including catalyzing faster payments and corporate disbursements. Getting P-to-P right in particular is considered a gateway for banks wishing to grab a broader share of corporate transactions such as payroll, health care and insurance payments. The banks also hope to counter PayPal's Venmo social P-to-P app, a product that has proven popular with younger consumers. Like the banks, PayPal also sees mobile P-to-P as a pivot, including expanded in app mobile payments and improved collaboration with the card brands. ClearXchange is attracting users—it handled 46 million transactions in the first quarter, or $16 billion, well exceeding Venmo's $3.2 billion. But the popularity of the potential social aspect of P-to-P among retailers may be the real prize for the mobile P-to-P apps such as Venmo or 'Zelle.' ClearXchange has a substantial advantage because of its size, though Venmo is expanding rapidly, Crone said, adding the social nature of Venmo is popular with retailers. A more 'active' brand like Zelle could be easier for retailers to pitch to consumers, similar to Facebook or Twitter, Crone said. "Retailers want a public posting of their payments, and that is what Venmo has," Crone said. "Retailers fight and plead for that, for you to like them on Facebook or follow them in Twitter or view their videos on YouTube."

Stuart Davis Filed on August 25, 2016 Share More > Vote Clearly, hackers are proving to be a source of consternation for banking heads, with the cyber landscape looking bleaker by the year. With news of the hack against Qatar National Bank dominating headlines, we are reminded yet again of the resolve of cyber attackers in targeting financial institutions using any means necessary. Cyberattacks against banks are not new and simply represent a leap forward in criminal innovation and tenacity. However, what has changed in recent years, and worryingly so, is the frequency with which these attacks are taking place - and on a global scale. The impulse behind any financially-motivated threat actor is quite simple: to go where the money is. Just follow the news and you'll come across a slew of hacks, featuring some of the biggest names in the financial world. Bank of America and CitiGroup in 2012; Wells Fargo in 201 followed by Bank Muscat and the National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah during the same year. And of course, who can forget the 2014 JP Morgan Chase breach, what many call 'the single biggest cyberattack against a bank'? This attack alone led to the compromise of 83 million accounts. This troubling trend continues in 2016, with targeted attacks against HSBC and Bangladesh Bank, the latter resulting in staggering losses amounting to USD 81 million. More recently, it was QNB, Bank Indonesia and the Bank of Korea. Clearly, hackers are proving to be a source of consternation for banking heads, with the cyber landscape looking bleaker by the year. During the first week of May, FireEye researchers detected hackers probing the defences of various banks in the region, in a reconnaissance effort assumed to be a precursor to an intensive campaign against clearly identified targets. The attacks appeared to use unique and deceptive scripts, with multiple emails containing macro-enabled Excel (XLS) files being sent to employees working in the Middle East banking sector. In one case, the content of the email appeared to be a legitimate email conversation between several employees, even containing contact details of employees from several banks. It was then forwarded to several people, with the malicious Excel file attached. Once opened, these malicious email attachments are capable of gathering information on the user's system, including user and administration passwords, and software running on the bank's computers. Be it rival nation-states or independent actors, the consolidation of assets and concentration of wealth in the GCC has made it a lucrative target for various players around the world. Energy, real estate, aviation, finance and tourism have propelled local economies to unprecedented highs, with diversification set to augment the gains from these sectors. Add to this the geopolitical rivalries in the region and it's no surprise that institutions in the region are more likely to get caught in the crossfire. After all, actions in cyberspace are merely a reflection of real-world politics. The last few years have seen attacks on critical infrastructure, with no signs of them abating anytime soon. In the case of QNB, the Gulf's biggest lender, the hackers used undetected macro-embedded Excel files and leaked key account information. Among the affected customers were staff from state-owned Al Jazeera, and state defence and security officials. Successful hacks can go beyond merely stealing credentials or wealth. A well-placed attack against the right vulnerability could incapacitate a bank in the short term, rendering it unable to operate and carry out critical functions. Whether its malware, spear-phishing or a DDoS attack, every threat actor has their own modus operandi, with the same goal in mind. Certain forms of targeted attack malware can even bypass standard security measures such as anti-virus software and firewalls. Another development is the rise of groups who can be contracted for specific campaigns. Once an organised team of cybercriminals accepts a request for a targeted attack against a specific bank, preparations begin with developing sophisticated malware specifically tailored to infiltrate the specific bank's security system. Such malware can be injected into the bank's processing system - a rather difficult task - which can potentially allow access to a bank's transactions. There's no denying the fact that our region is a hotbed for cyberattacks. For the ideologically driven or financially motivated, the IT infrastructure of a bank presents an alluring target, allowing them to hit the organisations where it could hurt the most. So what exactly is the need of the hour? The first thing that comes to mind is the need for greater collaboration and intelligence-sharing. An "every man for himself" mindset does no good to anyone and banks need to realise that only by pooling resources for mutual benefit can they constantly stay a step ahead and keep the modern cyberattacker at bay. A good example is cooperation between central banks in the Far East, which allowed Bank Indonesia and the Bank of Korea to foil a recent DDoS attack. Ultimately, a concerted approach is required to tackle this problem head-on. There needs to be a firm alignment of people, process and technology, with everyone from the CEO to IT personnel working in cohesion. The fallout from a successful breach is not just the loss of financial resources, but also irreparable damage to the bank's reputation and, possibly, its leadership. Take the case of Bangladesh Bank. In the wake of the disastrous attack, the bank's governor was forced to resign. A recent study carried out by FireEye in the UAE showed that 46 per cent of respondents had a negative view of brands subjected to a successful attack, while an overwhelming 72 per cent said that they would be willing to switch to a competitor that offered better data security. Herein lies the true cost of a breach to a bank. Financial losses and theft of intellectual property are one thing, but what about the long-term trust of customers, who might completely lose faith in the bank in question? To prevent this from happening, banks need to rethink cybersecurity. They need to make the required investments and introduce measures to counter all forms of cyberthreats in a globalised economy. After all, it's a question of nothing less than survival itself.

 Apple could be on the hook for $19 billion in taxes, and the Obama administration is livid Kif Leswing Aug. 24, 2016, 3:52 PM 190,109 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty The European Commission is expected to levy a judgment against Apple in the next few months that could total in the billions of euros. JPMorgan has estimated that Apple could be on the hook for as much as $19 billion — or about 17 billion euros — the Financial Times reports. The commission is accusing Apple of striking a sweetheart tax deal with Ireland, in which the iPhone maker would move its profits to wholly owned Irish subsidiaries to reduce its corporate taxes. Apple has one major defender in its corner, though: the US Treasury Department and, by extension, the Obama administration. The Treasury released a white paper on Wednesday, commissioned by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, that did not mince words while defending American companies, including Apple, Starbucks, and Amazon. It says that the Brussels-based investigation of Apple is "supranational" and essentially accused the European Commission of executing a power grab and unfairly targeting American companies. Here's the money quote from the paper (emphasis added): "The U.S. Treasury Department continues to consider potential responses should the Commission continue its present course. A strongly preferred and mutually beneficial outcome would be a return to the system and practice of international tax cooperation that has long fostered cross-border investment between the United States and EU Member States." Tax is one of the biggest and most touchy policy issues for Apple. Congress investigated Apple's tax arrangements in 2013, which led to CEO Tim Cook testifying before a US Senate subcommittee. Apple has billions of dollars held offshore that it would love to bring back to the US, but Cook has said that he thinks the system is unfair. "The money that's in Ireland that he's probably referring to is money that is subject to U.S. taxes. The tax law right now says we can keep that in Ireland or we can bring it back," Cook told The Washington Post. "We've said at 40 percent, we're not going to bring it back until there's a fair rate. There's no debate about it. Is that legal to do or not legal to do? It is legal to do. It is the current tax law." "It's important for everyone to understand that the allegation made in the E.U. is that Ireland gave us a special deal. Ireland denies that," Cook said. Based on the release of Wednesday's paper, it sounds as if Apple can continue to rely on the Treasury's support while navigating this multibillion transatlantic spat.

R3 Files Blockchain Patent for Financial Agreements Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the project for which R3 had filed a patent. It is Corda, not Concord. By Tanaya Macheel August 24, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related Banks' Privacy Concerns Shaping Blockchain Vendors' Strategies Bank Consortium CEO Wants to Build the Microsoft of Blockchains Why Standards Would Aid Blockchain's Adoption Blockchains and Shared Ledgers: A Banker's Guide (white paper) How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue R3 CEV, a consortium of several of the largest global banks focused on blockchain, filed its first patent on Tuesday: a distributed ledger platform designed to manage financial agreements between regulated financial institutions. The bank consortium expects to launch a full-scale version of the platform by mid-2017 with firms testing it in early 2017, a spokesman for R3 confirmed Wednesday. Current members of the consortium haven't committed to using it and aren't bound to it. R3 launched almost a year ago with nine bank backers to develop a settlement platform for the billions of dollars in transactions processed by the financial industry each year. It has since grown to more than 60 members, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citi. The group has acted as a sort of standards-setting body thus far as its fellow blockchain vendors have begun developing technology for financial services more publicly. In September the firm hired IBM's former executive architect of banking innovation, Richard Gendal Brown, who has since been building Corda to record and manage important, financial agreements among institutions. Corda is just one element of the wider Concord platform, the startup's development project that will allow companies to run high-scale financial applications on permissioned blockchain networks across organizations and internally, according to the Wall Street Journal, who first reported on Concord Wednesday morning. Such applications could include trade clearing and settling, recording cash balances and asset registry and reconciliation. Pushing middle- and back-office functions to a cloud-based ledger is a major focus of the project and there will be various other elements of Concord like Corda, though R3 declined to give further details. Separately, R3 members BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Santander and UBS are also working on a blockchain-based transaction settlement project called the Utility Settlement Coin, an asset-backed digital cash instrument for institutional financial markets implemented on blockchain technology. The initiative builds on earlier experiments by UBS and blockchain software company Clearmatics, Deutsche Bank said in a Wednesday news release.

Luke Kawa @LJKawa More stories by Luke Kawa , Alexandria Arnold More stories by Alexandria Arnold , and Vivien Lou Chen @vivienlouchen More stories by Vivien Lou Chen August 24, 2016 — 1:53 PM EDT What Will We Hear From Fed's Yellen on Friday? Markets have been eerily quiet ahead of the Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's remarks at the Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday morning, which have the potential to upset the calm that's prevailed throughout the month. Broadly, analysts expect Yellen's remarks to be on the hawkish side, though many caution that there might not be a bevy of actionable information on the short-term outlook for rates given the speech's title, "The Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Toolkit." Here's what Wall Street firms are looking for from Yellen and how strategists are altering their positions heading into the event. Scotiabank "USD risk is elevated as we head into Friday’s Jackson Hole speech from Fed Chair Yellen, with a low bar to a bullish surprise as we consider the market's relatively muted expectations for Fed normalization," writes Chief FX Strategist Shaun Osborne. "The softening in expectations appears somewhat excessive as we consider the relatively robust growth outlook anticipated through the second half of 2016 with an Atlanta Fed GDPNow ‘nowcast’ forecasting model looking to a 3.6 percent pace of growth for Q3." Jefferies "Yellen will be optimistic about the economy and what the Fed has accomplished toward achieving the dual mandate goals of full employment and stable inflation," writes Chief Financial Economist Ward McCarthy, noting that this would place her in the same camp as New York Fed President William Dudley and Fed Vice-Chair Stanley Fischer. "In acknowledging the limitations of monetary policy, Yellen will also argue for the need for fiscal policy to play a more significant role as a complementary tool to monetary policy." JPMorgan From Chief U.S. Economist Michael Feroli: We suspect the conclusion of the study released last week – asset purchases and forward guidance should be able to compensate for the FOMC’s likely limited scope to cut short-term interest rates in the future – is indicative of the sense of the Committee. We expect there will be strong resistance to negative interest rates, though they will not be completely ruled out. Would such a speech be seen as dovish or hawkish? The Fed can definitely tighten, and probably ease. This asymmetry lends itself to the dovish conclusion that risk management considerations counsel caution when tightening at very low interest rates.  Credit Suisse "The symposium’s rather apt topic, 'Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future,' could shed light on the Fed’s concern regarding policy efficacy as central banks globally come to grips with potential limits to monetary policy—most recently exemplified in last week’s essay by SF Fed’s Williams in which he posits alternatives to the current 2 percent inflation target," writes a team led by Praveen Korapaty. "We think her characterization of potential options could provide useful insight into the leading proposals and, like past academic discussions, give markets cause to react." The analysts observe that discussions on this topic have typically induced either a steepening or flattening of the Treasury yield curve by roughly 15 to 20 basis points, and unwound a 10s30s flattener position ahead of the speech. Barclays "We believe Chair Yellen may use the opportunity to signal the FOMC’s growing confidence in the outlook for activity and inflation," writes Nikolaos Sgouropoulos, FX strategist. "Given the low market expectations for a September or December Fed rate hike, a re-pricing at the front end of the rates curve should drive a near-term rebound in the USD." TD Securities "A nuanced view from Chair Yellen at Jackson Hole can prevent a significant repricing in rates," writes a team led by Millan Mulraine, deputy head of U.S. research and strategy. "Our base line view sees disappointment on both sides of the debate." However, the team also suggests that this view could potentially signal "that Yellen may have shifted into the one-hike [for 2016] camp." Bank of America Merrill Lynch "We think it will be clear from the conference that the Fed will only be able to execute a very shallow hiking cycle," writes Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics. Meyer thinks that clues on upcoming Fed action (or a lack thereof) "will be difficult to find." BNP Paribas Markets are failing to adjust prices ahead of Yellen’s speech Friday, which means her remarks are “becoming an increasingly binary event” — one with major implications for the U.S. dollar in the short-term. Strategists at the bank are positioned for upside in the U.S. dollar into the speech, suggesting Yellen may give an indication that the central bank is considering a rate hike in September. Citigroup "Markets should look out for three themes to gauge [Yellen's] degree of dovishness: (1) the level of r*; (2) the costs and benefits of “low-for-longer” interest rates; and (3) how the global and domestic backdrops stack up against the Fed’s tightening rubric," writes a team led by Dana Peterson. "Unless Yellen turns hawkish at Jackson Hole, the dovish track record of the FOMC causes us to expect a December interest rate hike." However, the analysts don't expect the Fed Chair to provide a "hard signal" on the timing of the next rate hike.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter "Yellen is unlikely to use her Jackson Hole talk to signal an increase in the federal funds rate at the FOMC's next meeting," writes Chief Economist Stuart Hoffman and Deputy Chief Economist Guy Faucher. "She is looking to create a consensus, and does not want to get too far out in front of other FOMC members." The duo warns that the Fed Chair likely won't use words that give the impression further tightening is imminent, and that the only calendar-based guidance that might be offered is that a rate hike is likely to occur before the year is out. Alliance Bernstein The “biggest obstacle to a clear path forward is the hesitancy of monetary-policy makers,” writes Economist Joseph Carson, saying that the Chair's speech is likely to "tip the scales — one way or the other" on whether hike is coming soon. Oxford Economics "We expect her comments to focus mostly on how the policy framework or tools may have to eventually evolve in a low interest rate environment," writes Kathleen Bostjancic, director of U.S. macro investor services. "Given the fed funds futures market is currently pricing in just a 24 percent probability of rate hike in September, we would not be surprised if Yellen construes her comments to lift those odds."

(TWTR) Stock Set to End 2016 with a Whimper Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock’s Rebound Underscores the Buy Case General Electric Company (GE) Stock Hasn’t Looked This Healthy in a While View All Posts Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) has been on a tear for two months, but it has looked like a slam-dunk buy for ages, and now Wall Street has come around to the same view on BAC stock. While everyone has been focused on interest-rate policy or trading volume, BAC has quietly gathered up a host of buy calls. Indeed, as The Motley Fool noticed recently, going by recommendations and target prices, BAC is the Street’s favorite big bank stock. They’re right. Of the 34 analysts covering Bank of America stock, 27 call it a buy and seven have it at hold, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. No one says it’s a sell. Only Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) comes close to getting that kind of love on the Street. At the same time, BAC has one of the highest price targets among peers. Analysts’ average target stands at $17.28, which implies upside of around 13% in the next year or so. For the sake of comparison, Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) — aka Warren Buffett’s favorite big bank stock — carries implied upside of less than 10%. The other most well regarded big bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), has implied upside of less than 6%. BAC Stock: Patience Is the Key As we’ve said before, it’s going to take a good long while for BAC stock’s value proposition to pay off. After all, valuation tends to revert to the mean, but it can take its own sweet time in doing so. 9 Stocks to Buy That Will Sprint Past Everything Else Take the tantalizing prospect of a rate-tightening cycle, strength in the housing market, lending and retail banking — and projected earnings-per-share growth of 22% next year — and the bias on this name is to the upside. And, as mentioned, it’s just too darn cheap: With a price-to-book multiple of 0.65, BAC stock trades at a whopping 35% discount to shareholder equity. This is unusual for a bank’s price-to-book, which should sit around 1.0. The low valuation was reasonable in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Back then, BAC’s ability to come back was seriously in doubt. Today, however, it’s taking advantage of gradual improvement in the domestic economy and cost cuts. The stage is set for growth. Surely, BAC stock is worth something at least resembling shareholders’ equity in the firm. Bank of America stock has been looking pretty frisky of late, rising roughly 15% since the end of June, but it’s not too late to initiate or add to a position. Just look at that valuation again. The on-again, off-again chatter about a Federal Reserve rate hike is a headwind, but then the effects have been priced in for a long position. Besides, the Fed can’t stand pat forever. This one is likely to be a grind, but BAC stock has market-beater written all over it if you think like an owner and hold on. As of this writing, Dan Burrow did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The vacancies — courtesy of tenants like Citibank, Major League Baseball and others — could impact 10 percent of the office submarket, which stretches from East 45th to East 59th streets, Crain’s reported. In addition to Citibank and MLB, other major tenants are weighing their options, including investment firm BlackRock , which could leave its 700,000 square foot digs at 345 Park and 40 East 52nd Avenue and move to Hudson Yards or the World Trade Center when its lease expires in 2023. JPMorgan Chase, meanwhile, is planning to leave its 300,000-square-foot digs at 277 Park in order to consolidate at 270 Park and 383 Madison Avenue.”What you’re seeing is a migration to newer product,” said CBRE’s Mary Ann Tighe. “The age of these buildings is catching up to them.” According to data from Cushman & Wakefield, Park Avenue offices have an average age of 55.6 years, and many have lower ceilings and structural columns. Meanwhile, many finance companies — which currently occupy roughly 70 percent of Park Avenue’s 22 million square feet of space — are weighing smaller spaces in light of shrinking profits. Landlords say the vacancies are a number of years away, giving them ample time to find new tenants. And some are looking at the impending vacancies as an opportunity to upgrade their properties or diversify their tenant base. At 299 Park, Boston Properties is spending $50 million to upgrade the building after Citibank vacates 385,000 square feet next year. “Large tenants have left Park Avenue before, and the space always gets filled,” said John Powers, who heads Boston Properties’ New York office. Meanwhile, L&L Holding Co. is currently building 425 Park, a 670,000-square-foot tower where hedge fund Citadel has already committed to 200,000 square feet at an average of $175 per foot, including a penthouse space that rents for roughly $300 per square foot. And Vornado Realty Trust — responding to expectations that the city could rezone part of Midtown East — is attaching clauses to its leases at 350 Park to allow it to clear out the building and replace it with a state-of-the-art spire. [Crain’s] —E.B. Solomont Correction: An earlier of this version mischaracterized the average per square foot rent at 425 Park Avenue; though rents reach as high as $300 per square foot at the penthouse, the overall price per square foot averages around $175.
