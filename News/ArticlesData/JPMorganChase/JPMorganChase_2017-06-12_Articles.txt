"The majority of equity investors today don't buy or sell stocks based on stock specific fundamentals," said JPMorgan's Marko Kolanovic. JPMorgan believes the recent sell-off in technology stocks may have been related to quantitative and computer trading and not traditional fundamental investors. Evelyn Cheng | @chengevelyn Tuesday, 13 Jun 2017 | 4:49 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Robo advisors are 100 times cheaper    Sunday, 9 Apr 2017 | 11:53 PM ET | 02:04 Quantitative investing based on computer formulas and trading by machines directly are leaving the traditional stock picker in the dust and now dominating the equity markets, according to a new report from JPMorgan. "While fundamental narratives explaining the price action abound, the majority of equity investors today don't buy or sell stocks based on stock specific fundamentals," Marko Kolanovic, global head of quantitative and derivatives research at JPMorgan, said in a Tuesday note to clients. Kolanovic estimates "fundamental discretionary traders" account for only about 10 percent of trading volume in stocks. Passive and quantitative investing accounts for about 60 percent, more than double the share a decade ago, he said. In fact, Kolanovic's analysis attributes the sudden drop in big technology stocks between Friday and Monday to changing strategies by the quants, or the traders using computer algorithms. In the weeks heading into May 17, Kolanovic said funds bought bonds and bond proxies, sending low volatility stocks and large growth stocks higher. Value, high beta and smaller stocks began falling in a rotation labeled "an unwind of the 'Trump reflation' trade," Kolanovic said. "Upward pressure on Low Vol and Growth, and downward pressure on Value and High Vol peaked in the first days of June (monthly rebalances), and then quickly snapped back, pulling down FANG stocks" — Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet, the report said. Along with Apple, the big tech-related names fell more than 3 percent each last Friday and dropped again Monday, sending the Nasdaq composite lower in its worst two-day decline since December. However, "the contribution coming from quant rebalances to this snapback is now likely over," Kolanovic said, noting that S&P derivatives have supported market gains at the beginning of this week. "$1.3T of S&P 500 options expire on Friday, and this will change dealers' positioning," he said. "This can result in a modest increase of market volatility starting on Friday and into next week." Tech recovered Tuesday, helping U.S. stocks close higher with the Dow Jones industrial average at a record. Derivatives, quant fund flows, central bank policy and political developments have contributed to low market volatility, Kolanovic said. Moreover, he said, "big data strategies are increasingly challenging traditional fundamental investing and will be a catalyst for changes in the years to come." Figures from market structure research firm Tabb Group point to similar gains in machine-driven trade volume, while the overall number of shares traded has declined. A subset of quantitative trading known as high-frequency trading accounted for 52 percent of May's average daily trading volume of about 6.73 billion shares, Tabb said. During the peak levels of high-frequency trading in 2009, about 61 percent of 9.8 billion of average daily shares traded were executed by high-frequency traders. To be sure, not everyone on Wall Street is giving ground to the machines so easily. AllianceBernstein analysts made the case in an April 28 note that artificial intelligence is unable to generate significantly different results — by the mere fact that analyzing more and more data results in increasingly similar strategies.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: JPMorgan Chase's 2Q Earnings: Why Are Analysts Lowering Their Expectations? There are two main reasons analysts are lowering second-quarter earnings-per-share estimates for JPMorgan Chase. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jun 13, 2017 at 1:43PM With interest rates on the rise and the regulatory burden in the financial services sector on the decline, investors are right to be optimistic about JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) second-quarter performance, which will be announced in the middle of next month. Yet, in the past week, one high-profile analyst has lowered his expectations for JPMorgan's earnings for the three months ending June 30. In a recent note to clients, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods' Brian Kleinhanzl said that he now expects JPMorgan Chase to earn $1.57 per share in the second quarter. That's down from his previous estimate of $1.69 per share. JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Kleinhanzl cited a number of reasons for the downgrade, but the most important is an expected drop in trading revenue. "Market volatility has fallen off after first-quarter results were announced and we expect the environment to remain subdued through quarter-end," wrote Kleinhanzl. "As a result, we are updating our trading revenue forecast to reflect lower volatility and lower market activity." As a universal bank, with both commercial and investment banking operations, JPMorgan Chase earns a substantial amount of revenue each quarter from trading equities and fixed-income securities. In the first three months of the year, the nation's biggest bank by assets generated $5.8 billion in trading-related income. But with volatility unusually low right now, combined with a seasonal drop in trading volumes in the summer months, this figure is expected to fall. Kleinhanzl also noted that a recent decline in long-term interest rates could impact big banks' bottom lines as well. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, the primary long-term interest rate benchmark in the United States, has dropped from a peak of approximately 2.6% earlier this year down to 2.2% currently. Because this reduces the yield on a bank's loan and securities portfolios, it translates into lower revenue and earnings. 10 Year Treasury Rate data by YCharts. As Kleinhanzl wrote: We have lowered [net interest income] estimates in 2Q17 for lower long-term rates versus our previous expectations. The 10-year treasury rate has averaged 2.28% thus far quarter to date and this is below our original forecast of 2.65%. Lower long-term rates weighed on earnings revisions and we believe lower rates have also contributed to the underperformance in Universal bank stocks versus the broader market this year -- flat versus up 8.5% for the S&P 500. The good news is that, despite these expected headwinds, KBW expects JPMorgan Chase and other universal bank stocks to outperform the broader market. They trade at around 66% of the average price-to-earnings multiple on the S&P 500. Moreover, with the Federal Reserve seemingly set to increase short-term rates this week, and with the results of this year's stress tests due out at the end of this month, there are plenty of reasons for bank stock investors to be optimistic. This doesn't necessarily mean that you should buy JPMorgan Chase's stock right now. Much of the expected good news is presumably already baked into the New York-based bank's stock. In addition, the turmoil in the nation's capital, combined with the unfolding legislative paralysis in Congress and the market's already lofty valuation, could easily lead one to conclude that there's more to gain than to lose by waiting for a potential pullback before diving further into the market.

Gothamist is a website about New York View Pretty | Blog Arts & Entertainment Food News Popular Advertising Contact Newsletter RSS Feed Staff Our Cities Chicago London Los Angeles New York City San Francisco Shanghai Toronto Washington DC JPMorgan Chase Yanks Ads From NBC News Over Megyn Kelly's Alex Jones Interview by Jen Chung in News on Jun 13, 2017 10:18 am Megyn Kelly at the NBC Upfront (Getty Images) Growing outrage from Sandy Hook massacre victims' families has prompted JPMorgan Chase to remove its ads from NBC News' new Megyn Kelly interview program—because of Kelly's interview with controversial conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones has claimed that the mass shooting, which left 20 children and six adults dead, was faked. Victims' families are upset that Kelly is giving Jones a platform to further promote his baseless skepticism of the Sandy Hook massacre. Megyn Kelly interviews Alex Jones Sunday, June 18 at 7/6c during "Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly" on NBC. pic.twitter.com/dLApjwTLOW— Melanin Moor (@MelaninMoor) June 12, 2017 In the interview, Jones talks about how "9/11 was an inside job, but when I say inside job it means criminal elements in our government working with Saudi Arabia and others, wanting to frame Iraq for it." Regarding the Sandy Hook massacre, Jones's remarks are more confusing: "Well, Sandy Hook’s complex because I have had debates where, we devil’s advocates have said the whole story is true, and then I have had debates where I have said, that none of it is true." The mother of six-year-old Ana Grace Márquez-Greene Tweeted at Kelly: Here you go @megynkelly - her name is Ana Grace Márquez-Greene. Say her name- stare at this & tell me it's worth it. @nbc #SandyHook pic.twitter.com/mKrU63KWmA— Nelba Márquez-Greene (@Nelba_MG) June 12, 2017 And the chief marketing officer of JPMorgan Chase, Kristin Lemkau, Tweeted on Monday morning: As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why? https://t.co/luwyCwP7Ti— Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017 According to the Wall Street Journal, "JP Morgan Chase has asked for its local TV ads and digital ads to be removed from Ms. Kelly’s show and from all NBC news programming until after the show airs, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company doesn’t want any of its ads to appear adjacent to any promotions for the interview, the person added." Kelly stood by her decision to interview Jones, Tweeting, "POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light." But Ana Grace Márquez-Greene's mother, Nelba Márquez-Greene, Tweeted, "To give a man like this such a platform normalizes behavior that isn’t normal. How do I explain this to my son?" Because this is what it looks like when you shine light on #AlexJones - they don't go away. They double down @megynkelly . #SandyHook pic.twitter.com/GjeBVpC6HR— Nelba Márquez-Greene (@Nelba_MG) June 12, 2017 The family of Victoria Soto, a teacher who was killed while trying to protect children, posted a message to NBC and Kelly on Facebook: We would like it to be publicly known that we are greatly disappointed in your decision to give Alex Jones airtime. Alex and his followers have done nothing but make our lives a living hell for the last 4 1/2 years. Every family picture has been stolen, dissected, & analyzed with complete falsehoods. Our friends have even had their pictures stolen and have been harassed by these Sandy Hook hoaxers. One of his followers, Matthew Mills, showed up at Vicki's race, disrupted the race, harassed our family and was ultimately arrested. You can find videos online of Mills and Jones directly interacting. This incessant need for ratings at the cost of the emotional well-being of our family is disgusting and disappointing. You should be ashamed of yourselves for allowing this behavior. We hope you never are subjected to the kind of torture that Alex Jones and his followers inflict on us.Mills also crashed a Super Bowl press conference to say that 9/11 was a conspiracy. Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit which describes itself as "[building] a national movement of parents, schools and community organizations engaged and empowered to deliver gun violence prevention programs and mobilize for the passage of sensible state and national policy," has asked Kelly to drop out as the host for their annual gala. Jones himself wants Kelly to pull the interview, for different reasons: "Megyn Kelly lied to me several weeks before she came here, and she said the interview was not going to be about Sandy Hook and the mass shooting there." He also said that he now believes children did die, but doesn't really "know what happened." Kelly's show, Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly, will air at 7 p.m. on Sunday, June 18th. Update: Kelly has released a statement about Sandy Hook Promise's decision, adding that she does find Jones' conspiracy theories "personally revolting": New @MegynKelly statement on Sandy Hook Promise event >> pic.twitter.com/ICFMQdWMse— Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) June 13, 2017 Contact the author of this article or email tips@gothamist.com with further questions, comments or tips. twitter facebook reddit print alex jones conspiracy theory megyn kelly sandy hook massacre Other Interesting Stories Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Subscribe By Rebecca Dalzell This story is part of The Pursuit, a series in which small business owners share insights on how they build their enterprises—and follow their dreams, brought to you by Chase for Business. JPMorgan Chase "This was an old-fashioned way of cooking and they couldn't think of Americans cooking like this." Andrea Mugnaini In 1989, when Andrea Mugnaini began importing open hearth wood-fired Italian ovens to the United States, food had not yet become a national obsession. There was no Food Network, and few celebrity chefs. People said Italian ovens were a risky investment. The Italian manufacturer thought a country used to simply pressing "start" on a microwave oven wouldn't be interested in lighting a fire to start dinner in an open hearth oven. Yet, despite many sleepless nights, Mugnaini believed she'd found a product capable of creating unique flavors, as well as communal experience, that would appeal to cooks. Building a customer base out of her home office, now, nearly three decades later, Mugnaini Imports has made fans out of world-class chefs—as well as home cooks from Canada, the US and Mexico. In the following interview, Mugnaini explains how she broke through in the American market, built her own manufacturing center, as well as a cooking school, and still answers customer calls herself. JPMorgan Chase Mugnaini explains how she broke through in the American market, built her own manufacturing center, as well as a cooking school, and still answers customer calls herself. Here's an excerpt, edited and condensed for clarity. Chase: How did you discover the oven? Mugnaini: I was looking for a career change and had an opportunity to import Italian wines and olive oils to California. I went to Tuscany and Piedmont for training. I first saw the oven in restaurants. Then, as I made friends, I found that every country house had one in outdoor kitchens. I had never cooked like that, and the food—crisp pizzas, roasted vegetables and baked fish—was amazing. It was much more dynamic than the grill sitting in my yard at home. Chase: What made you consider selling it in the United States? Mugnaini: I didn't really consider it as a business, initially. When I got home, I installed a commercial oven. This was a restaurant appliance, because there wasn't much available at the time for home use. I tried to entertain and cook for my friends and family, but it just didn't work like the ones I had used in Italy. So that really led me to think about serving the home market. I knew there were people like me who would embrace this style of cooking. Chase: What was the initial reaction to your idea? Mugnaini: People thought I was crazy. I went to the Italian manufacturer and they said they were not interested. They couldn't think of Americans cooking like this. They thought we used microwaves and high-tech methods. They agreed to sell me a handful of ovens to begin with, and I had to pay them in cash. Chase: How did you finance the company? Mugnaini: My husband and I financed it, and it was a risk. All my advisors said, "Don't do it." But I trusted myself. After that first year, there were all the right signs, and I never looked back. But there were a lot of sleepless nights. Chase: Who were customers? Mugnaini: My first couple of years I really targeted the home market. Then I branched into high-end independent restaurants. Chase: How did you sell them? Mugnaini: Back then--we're talking pre-internet—I did trade shows, print ads. I would drag people home to see the oven and do demonstrations. It's most effective when they see it, taste it and live it for 20 or 30 minutes. You are using your senses. It's not just putting something in the oven, shutting the door and walking away. I do a three-hour class where I create a full meal—using vegetables from the garden, fish, wild game. On multi-day courses, we'll also do overnight cooking—once the ovens absorb the heat, they're designed to hold onto that—so we do big terra-cotta pots of beans. We show students that in the morning you can open the oven up and in go the eggs, frittata, pots of oatmeal or cinnamon rolls. JPMorgan Chase The oven takes an hour to heat from room temperature, but you can roast vegetables while it warms up. When it's hot, pizzas take three minutes to bake. Chase: What were challenges? Mugnaini: Sometimes people would walk by in a trade show—to this day, it's one of the reasons I don't really call it a pizza oven—and they'd go, 'pizza oven, oh my gosh why would I do all that just for pizza?' Two misconceptions are that it takes a long time to heat, and it's complicated to operate. The oven takes an hour to heat from room temperature, but you can roast vegetables while it warms up. When it's hot, pizzas take three minutes to bake. Chase: How did you overcome these kind of misconceptions? Mugnaini: Perseverance. If it wasn't something I was confident about, I don't think I could have done it. It wasn't like it was new to the world—generations had used it. But it was new to the American market. The live demonstration became an effective way of communicating what this was. My belief allowed me to be convincing. Chase: What's a typical day like? Mugnaini: Every day of my life is filled with clients. I had a couple from Alabama yesterday I was training with. But an important part to my business is a personal touch. No matter how efficient we are with technology. I hear it over and over again when I pick up the phone that people appreciate having somebody answer the phone and help them. Chase: What kind of changes have you seen? Mugnaini: On the commercial end, when I first started the oven was limited to Italian pizzerias. Now I have them in Mexican restaurants, fish restaurants, we put them on trucks and trailers for our catering clients. Wineries put them in. It's fun to see them in grocery stores. For the home cook, they've become a standard appliance for both indoor and outdoor kitchens. Chase: After 28 years in business, what are you proudest of? Mugnaini: Bringing back a human way of cooking. It engages you. We use our senses: visual assessments, touch and smell. It brings people together, because it becomes the focal point of a gathering. JPMorgan Chase For the home cook, they've become a standard appliance for both indoor and outdoor kitchens. Andrea Mugnaini's tips for small businesses: Believe in yourself, even if no one else does Don't give up, keep pushing Remember to keep the personal touch, customer service is important Be ready to innovate as markets mature Seek expert advice, but trust your instincts, too Rebecca Dalzell is a Chase News contributor.

Morgan Chase has pulled its ads from NBC after a controversy erupted over Megyn Kelly interviewing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. (Image Source: YouTube screenshot) 6 Follow Share Tweet Banking and finance giant J.P. Morgan Chase pulled its advertisements Monday from NBC because of the controversy surrounding Megyn Kelly’s decision to interview fringe conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Kelly was criticized roundly for the interview, which will air Sunday. According the Wall Street Journal, J.P. Morgan Chase has decided to pull all of their TV and digital ads from the network until after the interview airs. J.P. Morgan Chase’s chief marketing officer, Kristin Lemkau, tweeted, “As an advertiser, I’m repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why?” As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why? https://t.co/luwyCwP7Ti — Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017 Critics say that conspiracy theorists like Jones encourage listeners to mistrust authorities to a dangerous degree based on often misleading, exaggerated, or outright false reports. Nelba Marquez-Greene, a mother of one of the Sandy Hook victims, tweeted angrily to Megyn Kelly, saying, “Hey @megynkelly, let me know if you want to give his victims equal air time. Promoting this fool is bad news. Do not encourage his abuse.” Hey @megynkelly , let me know if you want to give his victims equal air time. Promoting this fool is bad news. Do not encourage his abuse. https://t.co/WTJjFuSSuG — Nelba Márquez-Greene (@Nelba_MG) June 12, 2017 Conspiracy theorists have claimed that the horrific mass murder at the Sandy Hook Elementary School was a “false flag” operation committed by the government, with actors and supposedly invented victims. Just recently a woman was arrested for sending death threats to another parent of a Sandy Hook victim and accusing him of being part of the hoax. In a promo released for the show, Kelly challenges him on what he’s said about the Newtown mass murder and calls him out for dodging the question. “Sandy Hook is complex,” he explains, “because I’ve had debates where we’ve devil’s advocates said the whole story’s true, and I’ve had debates where I’ve said, uh, that none of it’s true.” “When you say parents faked their children’s death,” Kelly says, “people get very angry.” “Oh I know,” he replies, “but they don’t get angry about the half million dead Iraqis from our sanctions—” “That’s a dodge,” she interjects.

The only way I could fail was not doing it, and letting [NBC] rig it, and letting them interview me for four hours to edit it together, and then be able to show people what was really said.” He complained that they lit him poorly in order to make him appear sinister for the show. In a highly publicized custody battle where his wife accused Jones of being an unfit father, his lawyer argued that his conspiracy persona was just a performance.

Share this article SANTIAGO, Chile, June 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- New Notes Offerings The Republic of Chile ("Chile") announced today the commencement of a global offering (the "Notes Offering") of a series of global notes due 2047 to be denominated in U.S. dollars (the "USD Notes"), as well as a concurrent offering (the "Euro Offering") of Chile's 1.875% Notes due 2030, which will constitute a further issuance of, and will form a single series with, Chile's outstanding 1.875% Notes due 2030 initially issued on May 27, 2015 (the "Reopening Euro Notes" and, together with the USD Notes, the "New Notes").  Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or their affiliates will serve as Joint Lead Managers and Bookrunners for those offerings (collectively, the "New Notes Offerings"). The New Notes Offerings are being made only by means of a prospectus supplement and an accompanying base prospectus under Chile's registration statements (as amended) filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  Copies of the prospectus supplement and prospectus for the New Notes Offerings may be obtained by calling Citigroup Global Markets Inc. at 1-800-831-9146, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC at 1-866-471-2526, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. at 1-866-811-8049 or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC at 1-866-846-2874. Chile intends to use the net proceeds of the sale of the USD Notes for general budgetary purposes and partially to pay the purchase price for certain outstanding debt securities of Chile that are validly tendered and accepted in the offer to purchase described below and the balance for general purposes of the government, and the net proceeds of the sale of the Euro Notes for general budgetary purposes of the government. Application will be made to have the New Notes admitted to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Tender Offer Chile also announced today the commencement of an offer to purchase for cash (the "Tender Offer") debt securities of each series listed in the table below (the "Old Notes" and each Old Notes, a "series" of Old Notes) such that the aggregate Purchase Price (as defined below) to be paid for the Old Notes tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer is equal to a maximum purchase amount to be determined by Chile in its sole discretion (the "Maximum Purchase Amount"). The terms and conditions of the Tender Offer are set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated June 13, 2017 (the "Offer to Purchase").  The Tender Offer is not conditioned upon any minimum participation of any series of Old Notes, but is conditioned on the pricing of the USD Notes in an amount, with pricing and on terms and conditions acceptable to Chile in its sole discretion. The tender period (the "Tender Period") will commence at 8:00 a.m., New York time, on Tuesday, June 13, 2016 and expire at 4:00 p.m, New York time, on the same day unless extended or earlier terminated.  The settlement of the Tender Offer is scheduled to occur on Tuesday, June 20, 2017 (the "Tender Offer Settlement Date").  The purchase price to be paid for the Old Notes of each series tendered and accepted pursuant to the Tender Offer will be a purchase price to be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Offer to Purchase using the fixed spread specified in the table below (the "Purchase Price"). Holders whose Old Notes are accepted in the Tender Offer will also receive any accrued and unpaid interest (the "Accrued Interest") on their Old Notes up to (but excluding) the Tender Offer Settlement Date.

During the Tender Period, a holder of Old Notes may place orders to tender Old Notes ("Tender Orders") only through the Dealer Managers.  Holders will NOT be able to submit tenders through the Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., Clearstream Banking, société anonyme or The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") systems.  If a holder does not have an account with any Dealer Manager, such holder may place a tender offer through any broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company, other financial institution or other custodian that it customarily uses.  J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as the billing and delivering bank for the Tender Offer (in such capacity, the "Billing and Delivering Bank"), will consolidate all Tender Orders and, upon instruction of Chile, accept Old Notes for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer, subject to proration as described in the Offer to Purchase, prior to 8:00 a.m., New York time, on June 14, 2016 or as soon as possible thereafter.  Each of Chile and the Billing and Delivering Bank reserves the right, in the sole discretion of each of them, not to accept any or all Tender Orders and to terminate the Tender Offer for any reason.  Tender Orders by a holder of each series of Old Notes must be in Permitted Tender Amounts as set forth in the Offer to Purchase. There is no letter of transmittal for the Tender Offer.  Old Notes held through DTC must be delivered to any of the Dealer Managers for settlement no later than 3:00 p.m., New York time, on the Tender Offer Settlement Date.  Failure to deliver Old Notes on time may result in (i) the cancellation of your tender and in you becoming liable for any damages resulting from that failure, and/or (ii) in the case of Preferred Tenders (as defined below), cancellation of any allocation of New Notes in the New Notes Offerings in respect of your related Indication of Interest and/or (iii) in the case of Preferred Tenders, in the cancellation of your tender and in your remaining obligation to purchase your allocation of New Notes in respect of your related Indication of Interest and/or (iv) in the delivery of a buy-in notice for the purchase of such Old Notes, executed in accordance with customary brokerage practices for corporate fixed income securities.  Holders will not have withdrawal rights with respect to any tenders of Old Notes in the Tender Offer.  Old Notes accepted for purchase will be settled on a delivery versus payment basis with the Billing and Delivering Bank on the Tender Offer Settlement Date in accordance with customary brokerage practices for corporate fixed income securities (i.e., a "desk to desk" or "broker to broker" trade). If the aggregate Purchase Price would exceed the aggregate Purchase Price payable for the Maximum Purchase Amount and proration occurs, preference will be given to Tender Orders submitted by holders who place firm orders for New Notes prior to the pricing of the New Notes Offerings ("Preferred Tenders").  Such priority will apply, for each Preferred Tender, with respect to an amount of Tender Orders having a Purchase Price equal to the amount of New Notes ordered by such holder, subject to certain limits. All Old Notes that are tendered pursuant to Tender Orders placed through a Dealer Manager and accepted will be purchased by the Billing and Delivering Bank.  Only the Billing and Delivering Bank will be liable for the payment of the Purchase Price and Accrued Interest for Old Notes validly tendered and accepted.  Chile will not be liable under any circumstances for any payment of the Purchase Price and Accrued Interest to the holders of Old Notes tendered in the Tender Offer.  The Billing and Delivering Bank shall not be liable for payments to any holder of Old Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase if such holder fails to deliver such Old Notes on or prior to the settlement of the Tender Offer as described in the Offer to Purchase.  The Billing and Delivering Bank shall only have the obligation to sell to Chile the Old Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase that the Billing and Delivering Bank has actually received pursuant to the Offer to Purchase on the Tender Offer Settlement Date.  Tender Orders that are not for Permitted Tender Amounts will not be accepted. The Tender Offer is subject to Chile's right, at its sole discretion and subject to applicable law, to instruct the Dealer Managers to extend, terminate, withdraw or amend the Tender Offer at any time.  Each of Chile and the Billing and Delivering Bank and the Dealer Managers reserves the right, in the sole discretion of each of them, not to accept tenders for any reason.

Sandy Hook Promise, an organization that was created in memory of the 20 students and six staff members who were massacred in the 2012 school shooting in Newton, Connecticut, announced on Monday that Kelly would no longer host one of their annual Promise Champions Gala, That announcement came just two days before Kelly was set to take the stage at the event on Wednesday night in Washington DC. The decision made by the non-profit organization also leaves Kelly with a big gap in her episode that will be airing this Sunday, as she planned to film the gala to run alongside her interview with Jones.  That plan went up in smoke however when she managed to draw the ire of Sandy Hook parents, who lashed out loud and quick as they attacked Kelly for allowing Jones' ideas to be heard by her audience of 6million. Kelly responded to the controversy on Friday in a statement, saying she wa 'disappointed' but also 'respected the decision' of the charity. Scroll down for video  Red alert: Megyn Kelly has come under fire for her decision to interview InfoWars' host Alex Jones, the polarizing conspiracy theorist who thinks Sandy Hook was a hoax Gone girl: She was fired as the host of the annual Sandy Hook Promises Gala on Monday night, two days before the event takes place in Washington DC (above the scene outside Sandy Hook in December 2012) Rationale: Kelly responded to the outcry by writing on Twitter: 'POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show ... Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light' (Kelly and Jones above during interview taping in Texas) 'I understand and respect the decision of the event organizers but I'm of course disappointed that I won't be there to support them on Wednesday night,' began Kelly in her statement. 'I find Alex Jones's suggestion that Sandy Hook was "a hoax" as personally revolting as every other rational person does.' She then explained: It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: how does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions?' Kelly then offered theories, stating: 'President Trump, by praising and citing him, appearing on his show, and giving him White House press credentials, has helped elevate Jones, to the alarm of many.' 'Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light - as journalists are supposed to do - on this influential figure, and yes - to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity,' said Kelly.

Share this article Share 649 shares That statement came roughly 12 hours after news broke that Sandy Hook promise would no longer work with Kelly.   'Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,' said Nicole Hockley, co-Founder and Managing Director of Sandy Hook Promise, in a statement annoucning the NBC hostw as out.  'It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.'  That statement came after family members and friends of the victims in Newtown, Connecticut took to social media on Monday and implored Kelly to not air the interview. Their outcry was over comments made by Jones in the wake of the deadly shooting, which he continues to share almost five years later despite a lack of substantive proof backing up his outlandish theory. Jones initially argued that the government was behind the murders, but later amended that conspiracy to say that there were no deaths at Sandy Hook and the victims were played by child actors.  On Monday, he changed that stance again, telling InfoWars' listeners that he now believes Sandy Hook did happen, and that children died there. He claimed that his remarks to that effect had been edited from the promotional clip, and added: 'I'm tired of being misrepresented.' JP Morgan Chase also pulled its advertising from Kelly's upcoming episode featuring the right-wing conspiracy theorist, that is still scheduled to air at 7/6pm central on NBC this Sunday.. Soon after a report emerged claiming that the company was pulling their TV spots, Chief Marketing Officer Kristin Lemkau confirmed that claim and voiced her disdain with the network and Kelly on Twitter. 'As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why?' she fumed.  The former Fox News host shared a preview of her sit-down with Jones, the popular and very polarizing host of InfoWars, following her most recent show on Sunday night. She later posted the clip on her Twitter account, writing: 'It was a riveting exchange. Promise you that.'  That comment did not go over well with some however, including Chelsea Clinton. 'There is no justification for amplifying lies (or a liar), particularly about unimaginable tragedy. I hope no parent, no person watches this,' wrote the former first daughter, who is the mother of two young children.  Chelsea is also a former NBC employee, working there for three years from 2011 to 2014 as a 'special correspondent' for the news division. That post netted her an annual salary of $600,000 despite her infrequent appearances on the network, with one of her interviews being with the GEICO gecko on an episode of the now-cancelled Rock Center With Brian Williams. Chased off: JP Morgan Chase reportedly pulled its advertising from all NBC channels ahead of Megyn Kelly's interview with Alex Jones. Chief marketing officer Kristin Lemkau (pictured) has also directly addressed Kelly on Twitter Repulsed: Lemkau asked why Kelly would give 'one second of airtime' to Jones, who has claimed that the Sandy Hook and Aurora cinema massacres did not happen Not having it: Chelsea Clinton was one of the first to lash out at Kelly, saying that everyone show boycott the episode when it airs on Father's Day this Sunday (above) Horrific loss: Many soon began to retweet the comments being posted online by Nelba Marquez-Greene, who lost her 6-year-old daughter Ana in the school shooting (Ana above) Chelsea, and many others, then began to retweet Nelba Marquez-Greene, who in a direct response to Kelly's tweet wrote: 'I promise you it's not riveting. How [would] you feel if someone shot your kids, some fool said it wasn't true- and I gave him a show?' Greene's daughter Ana was a victim of the Newtown, Connecticut shooting, losing her life at the age of six when gunman Adam Lanza opened fire in the school.  NBC News did  not respond to a request for comment.  In the wake of the immediate backlash she received on social media, Kelly tried to address her detractors. 'I hate that this type of coverage is gonna help legitimize him. Truly disappointing, wrote one Twitter user on Sunday night.  'POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light,' Kelly explained . President Trump is a big fan of Jones' show, and a frequent listener he himself has admitted in the past. He also appeared on the show during his campaign.  CONSPIRACY THEORIST Here are some of the extraordinary claims that Alex Jones has made about high-profile tragedies. 9/11 attacks An inside job with elements inside the government detonating bombs they had set in the towers in a bid to blame Osama bin laden and then have reason to take out the CIA asset. Boston Marathon A 'false-flag' attack staged by the FBI. Oklahoma City bombing Jones said this was a government-manufactured terror attack that was devised to help Bill Clinton boost numbers in the polls while also suppressing civil liberties. Gabbie Gifford shooting 'My gut tells me this was a staged mind-control operation. The government employs geometric psychological-warfare experts that know exactly how to indirectly manipulate unstable people through the media.'  Oklahoma tornadoes in 2013 Caused by the Air Force. 'If you saw that, you better bet your bottom dollar [President Obama] did this, but who knows if they did. You know, that's the thing, we don’t know.' In the preview of her interview with Jones, the NBC News host demands to know how he can declare something like Sandy Hook a hoax given the loss of young lives and parents who are still grieving for their children. 'Oh I know, but they don't get angry about the half-million dead Iraqis from the sanctions...' starts Jones before he is cut off by Kelly and accused of dodging her question. 'The media doesn't cover all the evil wars...' begins Jones, who again is cut-off by Kelly. 'That doesn't excuse the things you said about Newtown, you know that,' states the host, who actually traveled to Texas to meet with Jones in his own studio. 'Here's the difference, I looked at all the angles of Newtown and I made my statements before the media even picked it up.'  And in 2012, in the wake of the Aurora cinema massacre that saw 12 killed and 70 injured when a gunman opened fire during a screening of The Dark Knight, Jones claimed it was a 'false flag'. 'If you look at the full spectrum of information unfolding right now, 100 per cent chance that the mass murder committed in the suburb of Denver, Colorado, right next to Littleton and Columbine was a false flag mind control event.'  He even blamed President Obama for being behind a series of deadly tornadoes in Oklahoma back in 2013 that claimed the lives of over 30 people.  Horrible day: Greene posted an image of her daughter and told Kelly to look at the girl and say her name, then later shared the online harassment she receives from deniers (Greene and her husband Jimmy in 2014) Kelly's two-minute preview infuriated Greene, who continued to voice her disgust, disdain and disbelief on social media throughout the night and into the morning. In other tweets, Greene asked Kelly if she planned to 'give [Jones'] victims equal air time' and criticized her for turning 'victim pain' into 'entertainment' for her show. 'To give a man like this such a platform normalizes behavior that isn't normal. How do I explain this to my son?' asked Greene. She later opined: 'It's a miracle no #sandyhook parent has ended their life yet. The loss of a loved one and the constant harrasment is too much. @MegynKelly' Then, in a tweet that has been shared over 5,000 times, Greene posted a school photo of her deceased daughter.  'Here you go @MegynKelly - her name is Ana Grace Márquez-Greene. Say her name- stare at this & tell me it's worth it,' wrote Greene. In a series of tweets that began on Sunday night and are still being posted to her account, Greene also shared some of the horrors that she and other parents endure because of Jones and other deniers of the grade-school massacre. 'It has been 5 years since we lost our child. While we don't speak of the harassment very often, I must tell you it has left us traumatized,' wrote Greene in one tweet. She then bgean taking grabs of the comments she recieves on social media and posting them on her own twitter account, writing on one: 'Because this is what it looks like when you shine light on #AlexJones - they don't go away. They double down @megynkelly . #SandyHook.' In the attached grab, a woman wrote to Greene: 'Did Ana really die? Everyone knows SandyHook is SandyHoax. Did you sell her into a Child-trafficking ring?' She then shared another grab of a Twitter user 'asking a grieving mom for live shots and proof of dead bodies and coroner reports.' That man then began to harass Greene on Twitter, writing: 'Got court records? Blood samples? Coroner reports? ... proving a gunman shot her at #SandyHook?' He later wrote: 'Not disrespecting anyone. Just asking questions to give you an opportunity to make your case. So far you're failing at it.'  Not happy: Chelsea did not post any other tweets after her first, and instead began sharing Greene's comments (Chelsea and Charlotte above in March) The family of first-grade teacher Vicki Soto also criticized NBC in a post on Facebook that was shared Sunday night. In a letter addressed to NBC and Kelly, Soto's family wrote: 'We would like it to be publicly known that we are greatly disappointed in your decision to give Alex Jones airtime. Alex and his followers have done nothing but make our lives a living hell for the last 4 1/2 years.' The letter then details how their private family photos have been dissected by Jones and other conspiracy theorists, with one man interrupting their annual memorial run for Soto, who was just 27 when she was killed while shielding her students from the shooter. 'This incessant need for ratings at the cost of the emotional well-being of our family is disgusting and disappointing,' wrote the family.  'You should be ashamed of yourselves for allowing this behavior. We hope you never are subjected to the kind of torture that Alex Jones and his followers inflict on us.'  Chelsea meanwhile has yet to personally weigh in again on Kelly's interview, though she did send a message to Green on Twitter, writing: 'I'm so sorry Nelba, you continually confront disbelief and derision. It should be obvious how very, very wrong that is.'  Just a few days prior she had tried to have a little fun on social media Kelly, sharing a photo of the recent Enquirer cover story on the NBC host and writing: 'welcome to the "club"! Soon you too will have alien children (or siblings), excerpts from diaries never kept published & more!' Speaking up: A letter to NBC and Kelly from the family of Vicki Soto calling for the show to not air (above) At the same time Kelly is also dealing with another adversary in Jones himself, the same man who is the subject of the interview that she has been forced to defend the past few days. In an 12-minute diatribe posted to his YouTube page after the day-long NBC interview last week, Jones went after the former Fox News host's physical appearance and stated that he had 'zero attraction' to Kelly. Jones' rambling rant culminated with a vicious and ferocious personal attack against the 47-tear-old mother-of-three, and the radio host's admission that he told Kelly during her visit to Texas: 'Your children are going to die of cancer.' He then really drove that comment home by adding: 'You’re going to outlive your children, Megyn.' 'Not feminine. Cold. Robotic. Dead,' said Jones of his interview with Kelly, whose warm demeanor and welcoming looks managed to melt the icy facade of Russian president Vladimir Putin one week prior. 'I felt zero attraction to Megyn Kelly. That's not an insult to Megyn Kelly. I talked to a lot of other folks that know her. They say, "No. It's the same." Because you're dealing with a sociopath? A psychopath? I don't know."' Jones did not stop there either, also taking some time to go after Kelly's facial features. 'You can have that painted-on joker smile all you want,' Jones said at one point. 'And those lawyer, sociopath eyes. But at the end of the day, I’ve spoken the truth.' He closed out his rant a bit weak however with a rather dated film reference while explaining why he did the interview. 'I wanted to see it for myself. The girl next door sitting there with the toad creature,' said Jones. 'She should be in the new "Bladerunner" as the new replicant robot. I’m like this fat toad creature.' It is unclear however if Jones' actually believes any of this hullabaloo or is simply trying to motivate his listeners into hate-watching Kelly's show on Sunday night. Much like his friend President Trump, Jones' is a big fan of numbers and audience size. 'I got to tell you, having Megyn Kelly yesterday here until like 10:45 at night was a soul-sucking experience,' said Jones at the top of the video of his interview earlier in the week. 'I tell ya, I take my licks to get the word out, but man, dealing with lawyers that make being sociopaths an art form really lets you know why society is in so much trouble.' He then gave a a brief recap of how he thought the interview went, with less than kind words for Kelly. 'This report that’s supposedly going to air in the next few weeks, this profile, but it’s really an investigative report, masquerading as a profile, but really fake news in my view,' explained Jones. And then , he gave his assessment of Kelly's crew. 'I mean nice people, nice producer. I felt like the lady that’s the lead producer – nice southern belle lady, older lady – is like somebody that leads you to the gas chamber, or to the hangman’s noose, or to the electric chair,' said Jones.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Merrill Lynch Top Bank Stock Picks for Fed Rate Hikes By Lee Jackson June 13, 2017 8:20 am EDT Print Email Tweet Despite the political uncertainty, and other macro issues that have weighed on the markets, it’s a good bet that Chair Janet Yellen and the members of the Federal Reserve board of governors will vote to raise interest rates from the current range of 75 to 100 basis points to a higher target range of 100 to 125 basis points, or 1.00% to 1.25%. While historically still incredibly low, this could be good news for some of the top banks. We screened the Merrill Lynch research universe of financials for banks that should benefit from an increase in the federal funds rate. It’s also important to note that the financial sector, which took off after the Trump win in November, has traded back to almost the exact level it was at right before the election. Citigroup This top bank is trading at the same level it was in the summer of 2015. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. It provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services and wealth management. Trading at a still very cheap 10 times estimated 2018 earnings, the bank looks very reasonable in what has become a pricey stock market. A continuing stock buyback program is a big positive.  The company outperformed each of its major peers after posting a solid set of underlying first-quarter results. Merrill Lynch thinks the key for the stock to outperform, outside of capital return, is to improve the quarterly earnings per share run rate. Citigroup investors receive a 1% dividend. Merrill Lynch just raised its price target for the stock to $68 from $64. The Wall Street consensus price objective is $64.96. Shares closed Monday at $64.32. JPMorgan This stock trades at a reasonable 13 times estimated 2017 forward earnings and could respond good in a rising rate scenario. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) is one of the leading global financial services firms, and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States, with about $2.6 trillion in assets. The company as it is today formed through the merger of retail bank Chase Manhattan and investment bank JPMorgan. The firm has many operating divisions, including investment and corporate banking, asset management, retail financial services, commercial banking, credit cards and financial transaction services. The company reported solid first-quarter results and continues to take advantage of revenue opportunities in new markets and with the credit card business. Investors receive a 2.3% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $99 price target, and the consensus target is $94.13. The shares closed Monday at $86.98. PNC Financial Services This top regional bank was down almost 10% in March but has started to rebound. PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (NYSE: PNC) is one of the country’s largest diversified financial services organizations. It provides retail and business banking; residential mortgage banking; specialized services for corporations and government entities, including corporate banking, real estate finance and asset-based lending; and wealth management and asset management. With consistent earnings growth and a very positive and growing loan portfolio, the company is a premiere super-regional bank stock to own. Wall Street analysts point to numerous positives, including the bank implementing huge cost savings plans. The bank is working on up to $100 million of new savings announced last year, and it is also applauded for outstanding credit/risk management and the limited exposure to the capital markets related areas, while focusing on traditional banking. Shareholders are paid a 1.8% dividend. The $135 Merrill Lynch price target compares with the consensus target of $128.38. The stock closed Monday at $122.84 a share. Wells Fargo This large cap bank is another stock for investors to look at now for safety, dividends and solid upside potential. Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) is a nationwide, diversified, community-based financial services company with $1.8 trillion in assets. The company provides banking, insurance, investments, mortgage and consumer and commercial finance through 8,700 locations, 12,800 ATMs, the Internet and mobile banking. It also has offices in 36 countries to support customers who conduct business in the global economy. Wells Fargo serves one in three households in the United States. Wells Fargo has slowly, but surely, become one of the biggest mortgage lending companies in the United States, in addition to its normal banking and brokerage businesses. A continued increase in commercial real estate lending could really boost the bank’s bottom line and overall revenue. The stock also remains a top Warren Buffett holding. First-quarter earnings were somewhat disappointing as spread revenues and efficiency were lower than estimates. In addition, a confusing Investor Day message, along with a slower spread income outlook, drove shares down almost 10% over the past two weeks. Top analysts feel the company is laying the foundation this year for a much better earnings outlook starting in 2018. Wells Fargo shareholders receive a 2.83% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target is $62. The posted consensus target is $57.59, and shares closed Monday at $54.09. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Sticking with the big money center and regional leaders makes sense, especially with some volatility creeping back into the overall markets. While the near term could get rocky, the long-term outlook for all these large cap leaders is solid, and with a potential for rates going higher, and the stocks much cheaper at current levels, the risk-reward is solid.

Kelly caused an uproar when she tweeted a clip of the interview with Jones, who has claimed that high-profile massacres at Sandy Hook and an Aurora cinema were faked by the government. Later that day JP Morgan Chase decided to pull its advertising, The Wall Street Journal reported. The company's chief marketing officer, Kristin Lemkau, pulled no punches on Twitter. 'As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why?' she fumed. Scroll down for video  Chased off: JP Morgan Chase reportedly pulled its advertising from all NBC channels ahead of Megyn Kelly's interview with Alex Jones. Chief marketing officer Kristin Lemkau (pictured) has also directly addressed Kelly on Twitter Repulsed: Lemkau asked why Kelly would give 'one second of airtime' to Jones, who has claimed that the Sandy Hook and Aurora cinema massacres did not happen Courting controversy: Jones (right) has amended his views on Sandy Hook and says he thinks kids did die, but that there were 'anomalies'. Kelly's interview with him airs this Sunday An insider told the WSJ that it asked for its local and digital ads to be removed from all NBC programming until after Kelly's show airs on Sunday. They said JP Morgan Chase didn't want their advertisements appearing alongside promos for the show.  The former Fox News host shared a preview of her sit-down with Jones, the popular and very polarizing host of InfoWars, following her most recent show on Sunday night. She later posted the clip on her Twitter account, writing: 'It was a riveting exchange. Promise you that.'  That comment did not go over well with some however, including Chelsea Clinton. 'There is no justification for amplifying lies (or a liar), particularly about unimaginable tragedy. I hope no parent, no person watches this,' wrote the former first daughter, who is the mother of two young children.  Chelsea is also a former NBC employee, working there for three years from 2011 to 2014 as a 'special correspondent' for the news division. That post netted her an annual salary of $600,000 despite her infrequent appearances on the network, with one of her interviews being with the GEICO gecko on an episode of the now-cancelled Rock Center With Brian Williams. Not having it: Chelsea Clinton was one of the first to lash out at Kelly, saying that everyone show boycott the episode when it airs on Father's Day this Sunday (above) Horrific loss: Many soon began to retweet the comments being posted online by Nelba Marquez-Greene, who lost her 6-year-old daughter Ana in the school shooting (Ana above) Chelsea, and many others, then began to retweet Nelba Marquez-Greene, who in a direct response to Kelly's tweet wrote: 'I promise you it's not riveting. How [would] you feel if someone shot your kids, some fool said it wasn't true- and I gave him a show?' Greene's daughter Ana was a victim of the Newtown, Connecticut shooting, losing her life at the age of six when gunman Adam Lanza opened fire in the school.  NBC News did  not respond to a request for comment.  In the wake of the immediate backlash she received on social media, Kelly tried to address her detractors. 'I hate that this type of coverage is gonna help legitimize him. Truly disappointing, wrote one Twitter user on Sunday night.  'POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light,' Kelly explained . President Trump is a big fan of Jones' show, and a frequent listener he himself has admitted in the past. He also appeared on the show during his campaign.  CONSPIRACY THEORIST Here are some of the extraordinary claims that Alex Jones has made about high-profile tragedies. 9/11 attacks An inside job with elements inside the government detonating bombs they had set in the towers in a bid to blame Osama bin laden and then have reason to take out the CIA asset. Boston Marathon A 'false-flag' attack staged by the FBI. Oklahoma City bombing Jones said this was a government-manufactured terror attack that was devised to help Bill Clinton boost numbers in the polls while also suppressing civil liberties. Gabbie Gifford shooting 'My gut tells me this was a staged mind-control operation. The government employs geometric psychological-warfare experts that know exactly how to indirectly manipulate unstable people through the media.'  Oklahoma tornadoes in 2013 Caused by the Air Force. 'If you saw that, you better bet your bottom dollar [President Obama] did this, but who knows if they did. You know, that's the thing, we don’t know.' In the preview of her interview with Jones, the NBC News host demands to know how he can declare something like Sandy Hook a hoax given the loss of young lives and parents who are still grieving for their children. 'Oh I know, but they don't get angry about the half-million dead Iraqis from the sanctions...' starts Jones before he is cut off by Kelly and accused of dodging her question. 'The media doesn't cover all the evil wars...' begins Jones, who again is cut-off by Kelly. 'That doesn't excuse the things you said about Newtown, you know that,' states the host, who actually traveled to Texas to meet with Jones in his own studio. 'Here's the difference, I looked at all the angles of Newtown and I made my statements before the media even picked it up.' Jones initially argued that the government was behind the murders, but later amended that conspiracy to say that there were no deaths at Sandy Hook and the victims were played by child actors.  On Monday, he changed that stance again, telling InfoWars listeners that he now believes that Sandy Hook did happen, or at least that children died there. He claimed that his remarks to that effect had been edited from the promotional clip, and added: 'I'm tired of being misrepresented.' And in 2012, in the wake of the Aurora cinema massacre that saw 12 killed and 70 injured when a gunman opened fire during a screening of The Dark Knight, Jones claimed it was a 'false flag'. 'If you look at the full spectrum of information unfolding right now, 100 per cent chance that the mass murder committed in the suburb of Denver, Colorado, right next to Littleton and Columbine was a false flag mind control event.'  Horrible day: Greene posted an image of her daughter and told Kelly to look at the girl and say her name, then later shared the online harassment she receives from deniers (Greene and her husband Jimmy in 2014) Kelly's two-minute preview infuriated Greene, who continued to voice her disgust, disdain and disbelief on social media throughout the night and into the morning. In other tweets, Greene asked Kelly if she planned to 'give [Jones'] victims equal air time' and criticized her for turning 'victim pain' into 'entertainment' for her show. 'To give a man like this such a platform normalizes behavior that isn't normal. How do I explain this to my son?' asked Greene. She later opined: 'It's a miracle no #sandyhook parent has ended their life yet. The loss of a loved one and the constant harrasment is too much. @MegynKelly' Then, in a tweet that has been shared over 5,000 times, Greene posted a school photo of her deceased daughter.  'Here you go @MegynKelly - her name is Ana Grace Márquez-Greene. Say her name- stare at this & tell me it's worth it,' wrote Greene. In a series of tweets that began on Sunday night and are still being posted to her account, Greene also shared some of the horrors that she and other parents endure because of Jones and other deniers of the grade-school massacre.

Share this article Share 787 shares 'It has been 5 years since we lost our child. While we don't speak of the harassment very often, I must tell you it has left us traumatized,' wrote Greene in one tweet. She then bgean taking grabs of the comments she recieves on social media and posting them on her own twitter account, writing on one: 'Because this is what it looks like when you shine light on #AlexJones - they don't go away. They double down @megynkelly . #SandyHook.' In the attached grab, a woman wrote to Greene: 'Did Ana really die? Everyone knows SandyHook is SandyHoax. Did you sell her into a Child-trafficking ring?' She then shared another grab of a Twitter user 'asking a grieving mom for live shots and proof of dead bodies and coroner reports.' That man then began to harass Greene on Twitter, writing: 'Got court records? Blood samples? Coroner reports? ... proving a gunman shot her at #SandyHook?' He later wrote: 'Not disrespecting anyone. Just asking questions to give you an opportunity to make your case. So far you're failing at it.'  Rationale: Kelly responded to the outcry by writing on Twitter: 'POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show ... Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light' (Kelly and Jones above during interview taping in Texas) Not happy: Chelsea did not post any other tweets after her first, and instead began sharing Greene's comments (Chelsea and Charlotte above in March) The family of first-grade teacher Vicki Soto also criticized NBC in a post on Facebook that was shared Sunday night. In a letter addressed to NBC and Kelly, Soto's family wrote: 'We would like it to be publicly known that we are greatly disappointed in your decision to give Alex Jones airtime. Alex and his followers have done nothing but make our lives a living hell for the last 4 1/2 years.' The letter then details how their private family photos have been dissected by Jones and other conspiracy theorists, with one man interrupting their annual memorial run for Soto, who was just 27 when she was killed while shielding her students from the shooter. 'This incessant need for ratings at the cost of the emotional well-being of our family is disgusting and disappointing,' wrote the family.  'You should be ashamed of yourselves for allowing this behavior. We hope you never are subjected to the kind of torture that Alex Jones and his followers inflict on us.'  Chelsea meanwhile has yet to personally weigh in again on Kelly's interview, though she did send a message to Green on Twitter, writing: 'I'm so sorry Nelba, you continually confront disbelief and derision. It should be obvious how very, very wrong that is.'  Just a few days prior she had tried to have a little fun on social media Kelly, sharing a photo of the recent Enquirer cover story on the NBC host and writing: 'welcome to the "club"! Soon you too will have alien children (or siblings), excerpts from diaries never kept published & more!'

Harry Macklowe’s firm began the search for construction financing last summer, when he was seeking $1 billion. Then, in March, the developer decided to instead increase the equity by about $200 million and seek a lower construction loan of about $850 million. The property will hold either entirely or mostly residential condominium units. Bloomberg first reported that JPMorgan has agreed to provide the loan. Sources said the deal is slated to close in the next two months. If it closes, it will be one of the largest residential construction loans of this cycle. JLL is brokering the loan deal. Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jaber al-Thani, one of the world’s richest men and the former prime minister of Qatar, is Macklowe’s primary equity partner on the 50-story building, TRD revealed in March. Together, the partners bought it from the Bank of New York Mellon for $585 million in 2014. JT Magen & Company was recently hired as the construction team for the $1.5 billion project, replacing Gilbane Building, which took heat for its use of nonunion labor on the conversion. Last month, HFZ Capital Group locked in a $1.25 billion construction loan for its mixed-use Chelsea megaproject at 76 11th Avenue.  Meanwhile, Related Companies is in advanced talks to secure a $2.5 billion financing package for 50 Hudson Yards, which is poised to be New York’s most expensive office building.

She’s delivering — though perhaps not in the way executives had hoped. The chief marketing officer of JPMorgan Chase, Kristin Lemkau, tweeted Monday night that she was “repulsed” by a report scheduled to run this weekend on “Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly” in which the anchor is slated to interview Alex Jones, a self-styled provocateur who is known for spreading dubious theories about national events. NBC News teased the segment this past weekend during the second broadcast of Kelly’s newsmagazine, which launched earlier in June. A person familiar with the matter confirmed a Monday report in the Wall Street Journal saying JPMorgan requested that any digital ads or local TV ads that could appear adjacent to the next “Sunday Night” broadcast be removed. It remained unclear whether the financial-services company was pulling its ads from NBC properties or simply “re-expressing” an advertising schedule so that commercials would run at different times or alongside different programming. NBCUniversal and JPMorgan did not make executives available for comment. NBC News declined to comment on the scheduled Jones segment. The big bank’s saber-rattling around Kelly’s program is the latest example of the new dilemma many advertisers face in the aftermath of the 2016 election, which has polarized America’s consumer base. “Advertisers have always prided themselves on their grasp of consumer research and their understanding of popular culture, but the current socio-political environment often has them stumped,” said Kelly O’Keefe, a professor of creative brand management at Virginia Commonwealth University. “Running a national ad campaign costs millions of dollars and lately, getting it right feels like steering a straight course through an asteroid field. There are more touchy issues and the population is more on edge. Watch for more missteps, pulled ads, and social-media snafus in the year to come.” Related Megyn Kelly Hopes to Spark ‘Sunday Night’ for NBC Marketers ranging from USAA, Mercedes-Benz, and Hyundai to T. Rowe Price and Delta Air Lines have come under pressure for supporting Fox News Channel programs like “The O’Reilly Factor” and “Hannity,” both of which have come under scrutiny in recent weeks, or, more recently, a revival of William Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” produced by New York’s Public Theater. When USAA announced its intention to remove its commercials from “Hannity,” conservative advocacy groups urged it to pull commercials from MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show.” Eventually, USAA returned its commercials to its regular rotation. Kelly has on Twitter defended the decision to feature Jones in a “Sunday Night” segment. “Our job is to shine a light,” Kelly said on Twitter after being called out for giving the host a forum on mainstream TV. She called the interview a “riveting exchange.” Jones has in the past suggested a horrific massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 was a hoax and promulgated other conspiracy theories without much solid evidence to back them up. Kelly isn’t the only famous figure to come under the harsh glare of the social-media spotlight. Bill Maher faced calls for his firing after uttering a racial slur on the June 2 broadcast of his “Real Time” on HBO. Maher apologized for using the word and was challenged on this past weekend’s broadcast by rapper and actor Ice Cube and scholar Michael Eric Dyson. Delta Air Lines and Bank of America said on Sunday that they were pulling some funding of the Public Theater’s schedule after reports surfaced that Caesar was portrayed as looking a lot like President Donald Trump. Advertisers have always had the ability to pull commercials from media properties that caused them angst or angered their consumers. But they were rarely as public about it as they have been in recent months. Procter & Gamble and other family-focused advertisers have long been known to review TV episodes for sexual content and violence. And they might, over the course of a TV season, ask that commercials not appear alongside a particular episode of a comedy or drama. But they never talked about it beyond conversations held with a TV network or other media outlet. In 2017, advertisers feel they have to soothe a roiled public letting its id and ego out for battle on Twitter, Facebook, and elsewhere. Related Donald Trump’s Election Puts Super Bowl Advertisers on Tricky Playing Field Announcing the pulling of a commercial was once reserved for moments of crisis. Advertisers have publicly acknowledged yanking ads in 2007 from MSNBC’s morning broadcasts of radio host Don Imus’ program after he made racist remarks about the Rutgers University women’s basketball team, or in 2015 from  TLC’s “19 Kids and Counting,” a 2015 reality show that spotlighted the Duggar family after the revelation that the oldest boy in the family had sexually assaulted teenage girls. Now, the practice is becoming commonplace. Activists often monitor advertiser support of a particular outlet, then throw a spotlight on the sponsors to try to get consumers to demand the cessation of financial support. Sleeping Giants, for example, is a group that uses Twitter to call out advertisers whose commercials appear on the right-wing news site Breitbart. GrabYourWallet is a grassroots campaign that initially focused on trying to get consumers to stop buying products associated with businesses operated by President Trump and his family. The current controversy surrounding NBC’s “Sunday Night” may not be what Kelly or her producers had anticipated. “This is going to have big interviews and investigations, all with some heart and humility,” Kelly told Variety late last month in an interview. NBC had pitched the program to advertisers as something that would contain hard-hitting material, but also some life-affirming elements. The network may have to work to demonstrate how this weekend’s broadcast will provide both in equal measure. Meanwhile, Jones took to Twitter Monday night to ask that the segment not be aired.

Reply Chad says: June 13, 2017 at 1:31 pm I hope marketing directors everywhere understand how serious the misinformation problem is getting. Those controlling sponsorship dollars are *absolutely* going to become targets if they don’t put a stop to it. Given their indifference to misinformation and its consequences to America, I fear they’re mindlessly walking into harms way. Reply mjweir0317 says: June 13, 2017 at 8:39 am I want to congratulate Delta Airlines and Bank of America. I didn’t think I could possibly hate them more than I already do but they upped the ante by yanking funding for the arts as if they should have control over what the Public chooses. Reprehensible. I used to fly Delta exclusively and spend 10 of thousands of dollars a year on their airline. I’ll walk before I use them again. Reply Donald Mei says: June 13, 2017 at 5:30 am I’m a conservative Republican and as far as I am concerned giving someone as repulsive as Jones a forum to spew his garbage is like inviting the Flat Earth Society to dispute Columbus. Reply Dorian says: June 13, 2017 at 3:13 am Researchers and producers can’t grasp marketing because we are experiencing a “sess pool” of disgust which both of these ppl represent and powers that be are oblivious to. NBC made a huge mistake and most comments written supported this premise, and once her debut on NBC was announced, I stop watching the Today Show. They chose what they thought was popularity at Fox as a following but it’s not.. It’s a small group of ppl who watch Fox n Kelly represented the disgust.. Now she is trying to say. ” that’s not the real me” but all NBC had to do was read the comments as their research.. It would have saved them from this debacle .. Tamron Hall would never interviewed ppl like Alex Jones.. They allowed her to leave for Kelly..False popularity over substance.. Huge 15 million dollar mistake… Reply SMS says: June 12, 2017 at 9:28 pm Stay tuned for next week’s episode where she devotes a full hour to Holocaust deniers.

Reply Lou Bencomo says: June 12, 2017 at 9:14 pm Whatever party you support you must admit this is another example of media chasing dollars by running content that they would have shunned even 5 years ago. For NBC to give time to a case like Alex Jones, a man whose own lawyers have stated that his comments are often driven by ratings and not conviction, is disturbing. How far we have fallen. Reply Sam says: June 12, 2017 at 7:54 pm Wow so much plastic surgery she doesn’t even look like her high school pic. Reply Anna says: June 12, 2017 at 7:07 pm NBC should never have hired a propagandist like Kelly. She spent years at Fox News pushing racist garbage to stoke fears and generate ratings. She is not a journalist, certainly not one of the caliber of Diane Sawyer or Murrow. She’s a hack.

Earlier today, the chief marketing officer of J.P. Morgan Chase publicly expressed disgust at Kelly giving airtime to the conspiracy theorist: As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why? https://t.co/luwyCwP7Ti — Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017 Well, hours later, according to The Wall Street Journal, J.P. Morgan Chase has now asked for its ads to be pulled: J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. has asked for its local TV ads and digital ads to be removed from Ms. Kelly’s show and from all NBC news programming until after the show airs, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company doesn’t want any of its ads to appear adjacent to any promotions for the interview, the person added. So far Kelly’s interview with Jones is set for next Sunday night. Jones tonight said it should be pulled because she allegedly “misrepresented” his views on Sandy Hook.

Over the next week, five of the largest U.S. banks will light up their segments of a new payments network called Zelle, executives said in interviews.  They say more than 86-million U.S. mobile banking consumers will be able to send and receive money through the service, without having to download a new app, as the technology will be built into existing banking apps. Over the next week, five of the largest U.S. banks will light up their segments of a new payments network called Zelle, executives said in interviews. WHO IS ON BOARD?  JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) will be the first to plug into Zelle.  Another two dozen banks and credit unions to join over the next year.  The long-awaited network will allow tens of millions of bank customers to send money to each other instantly - known as person-to-person payments - with a few taps on their smartphones.  That is an improvement over Venmo, which immediately alerts users that a money transfer is in progress, but takes time to shift funds between bank accounts. Customers who use existing bank payment apps may not notice much of a change beyond marketing.  Transfers will simply happen faster because the banks are finally linking to each other, executives said. 'By coming together to offer Zelle, we are providing a large majority of Americans with a safe, fast and easy way to move money,' said Bill Wallace, head of digital at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the biggest U.S. bank by assets. JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) will be the first to plug into Zelle. The network is the product of an industry consortium called Early Warning Services LLC, whose seven owners have more than 86 million U.S. mobile banking customers.  Zelle took years to establish because fierce rivals had to come together to make it work.  In the interim, Silicon Valley has made inroads into digital payments, particularly with the young customers coveted by banks.

Share this article Share In addition to Venmo, which is owned by PayPal Holdings Inc , Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google and Apple Inc all offer payment platforms that allow individuals to send money to each other. The banks want to leap over those sleek but scattered offerings by connecting their critical mass of account holders through a single network. 'Fragmentation has been frustrating for consumers,' said Paul Finch, chief executive of Early Warning.  HOW ZELLE WILL WORK  The long-awaited network will allow tens of millions of bank customers to send money to each other instantly - known as person-to-person payments - with a few taps on their smartphones. Zelle will work on bank's websites and in their apps.  After the sender provides the email or phone number and amount, the recipient gets a notification that explains how they can can complete the payment.  The money will then be available minutes later.  A Zelle app will arrive at a later point, but Early Warning declined to say when beyond 'the coming months.'  'Inconsistent experiences have made it difficult to send and receive money between banks.' Despite losing some ground to technology companies, banks still have a big advantage: No matter what network is used to transfer money, banks hold the vast majority of funds. And despite the popularity of apps like Venmo, they transfer far less money than banks.  The value of digital payments processed through non-financial firms was one-fifth of what banks and credit unions processed last year, research firm Aite Group estimates. 'We are excited to bring the service to everybody and anybody, regardless of which brand of phone you have in your hand or which generation you belong to,' said Gareth Gaston, head of omnichannel banking at U.S. Bank.  Along with building customer loyalty, banks hope that Zelle will reduce their costs from handling checks and cash.  Eventually, they would like to sell access to businesses that want to eliminate their own paper-related costs. As more banks connect and more customers use the service, sending cash to another individual will simply involve knowing the person's mobile phone number or email address.  Later this year, individuals with accounts at banks not connected with Zelle will be able to use its real-time features by downloading an app and pairing it with a Visa Inc (V.N) or Mastercard Inc (MA.N) debit account. In launching Zelle, banks are being careful not to confuse customers by offering yet another payments app. For instance, Chase will initially twin the brand with the QuickPay app its customers already use by showing 'QuickPay with Zelle' on its mobile app and website. Eventually, the QuickPay name could fade away.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 9 shares Most watched News videos A quick thinking driver leaps out of an overturning truck Hilarious moment plucky iguana steals a pizza off of a man A Lioness is filmed in the back of pickup truck in Pakistan Success!

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

The US banking industry is about to launch its answer to the popular mobile payments app Venmo, in what is likely to be the biggest change in years in how individuals exchange funds digitally. Over the next week, five of the largest US banks will light up their segments of a new payments network called Zelle, executives said in interviews. They plan to announce details of the launch on Monday, and expect another two dozen banks and credit unions to join over the next year. The long-awaited network will allow tens of millions of bank customers to send money to each other instantly - known as person-to-person payments - with a few taps on their smartphones. That is an improvement over Venmo, which immediately alerts users that a money transfer is in progress, but takes time to shift funds between bank accounts. Customers who use existing bank payment apps may not notice much of a change beyond marketing. Transfers will simply happen faster because the banks are finally linking to each other, executives said. "By coming together to offer Zelle, we are providing a large majority of Americans with a safe, fast and easy way to move money," said Bill Wallace, head of digital at JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest US bank by assets. JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo & Co, US Bancorp and Capital One Financial Corp will be the first to plug into Zelle. The network is the product of an industry consortium called Early Warning Services LLC, whose seven owners have more than 86 million US mobile banking customers. Zelle took years to establish because fierce rivals had to come together to make it work. In the interim, Silicon Valley has made inroads into digital payments, particularly with the young customers coveted by banks. In addition to Venmo, which is owned by PayPal Holdings Inc, Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google and Apple Inc all offer payment platforms that allow individuals to send money to each other. The banks want to leap over those sleek but scattered offerings by connecting their critical mass of account holders through a single network. "Fragmentation has been frustrating for consumers," said Paul Finch, chief executive of Early Warning. "Inconsistent experiences have made it difficult to send and receive money between banks." Despite losing some ground to technology companies, banks still have a big advantage: No matter what network is used to transfer money, banks hold the vast majority of funds. And despite the popularity of apps like Venmo, they transfer far less money than banks. The value of digital payments processed through non-financial firms was one-fifth of what banks and credit unions processed last year, research firm Aite Group estimates. "We are excited to bring the service to everybody and anybody, regardless of which brand of phone you have in your hand or which generation you belong to," said Gareth Gaston, head of omnichannel banking at US Bank. Along with building customer loyalty, banks hope that Zelle will reduce their costs from handling checks and cash. Eventually, they would like to sell access to businesses that want to eliminate their own paper-related costs. As more banks connect and more customers use the service, sending cash to another individual will simply involve knowing the person's mobile phone number or email address. Later this year, individuals with accounts at banks not connected with Zelle will be able to use its real-time features by downloading an app and pairing it with a Visa Inc or Mastercard Inc debit account. In launching Zelle, banks are being careful not to confuse customers by offering yet another payments app. For instance, Chase will initially twin the brand with the QuickPay app its customers already use by showing "QuickPay with Zelle" on its mobile app and website. Eventually, the QuickPay name could fade away.

Clary | Getty Images The U.S. banking industry is about to launch its answer to the popular mobile payments app Venmo, in what is likely to be the biggest change in years in how individuals exchange funds digitally. Over the next week, five of the largest U.S. banks will light up their segments of a new payments network called Zelle, executives said in interviews. They plan to announce details of the launch on Monday, and expect another two dozen banks and credit unions to join over the next year. The long-awaited network will allow tens of millions of bank customers to send money to each other instantly — known as person-to-person payments — with a few taps on their smartphones. That is an improvement over Venmo, which immediately alerts users that a money transfer is in progress, but takes time to shift funds between bank accounts. Customers who use existing bank payment apps may not notice much of a change beyond marketing. Transfers will simply happen faster because the banks are finally linking to each other, executives said. "By coming together to offer Zelle, we are providing a large majority of Americans with a safe, fast and easy way to move money," said Bill Wallace, head of digital at JPMorgan Chase, the biggest U.S. bank by assets. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and Capital One will be the first to plug into Zelle. The network is the product of an industry consortium called Early Warning Services LLC, whose seven owners have more than 86 million U.S. mobile banking customers. Zelle took years to establish because fierce rivals had to come together to make it work. In the interim, Silicon Valley has made inroads into digital payments, particularly with the young customers coveted by banks. In addition to Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, Facebook, Alphabet Inc's Google and Apple all offer payment platforms that allow individuals to send money to each other. The banks want to leap over those sleek but scattered offerings by connecting their critical mass of account holders through a single network. "Fragmentation has been frustrating for consumers," said Paul Finch, chief executive of Early Warning. "Inconsistent experiences have made it difficult to send and receive money between banks." Despite losing some ground to technology companies, banks still have a big advantage: No matter what network is used to transfer money, banks hold the vast majority of funds. And despite the popularity of apps like Venmo, they transfer far less money than banks. The value of digital payments processed through non-financial firms was one-fifth of what banks and credit unions processed last year, research firm Aite Group estimates. "We are excited to bring the service to everybody and anybody, regardless of which brand of phone you have in your hand or which generation you belong to," said Gareth Gaston, head of omnichannel banking at U.S. Bank. Along with building customer loyalty, banks hope that Zelle will reduce their costs from handling checks and cash. Eventually, they would like to sell access to businesses that want to eliminate their own paper-related costs. As more banks connect and more customers use the service, sending cash to another individual will simply involve knowing the person's mobile phone number or email address. Later this year, individuals with accounts at banks not connected with Zelle will be able to use its real-time features by downloading an app and pairing it with a Visa or Mastercard debit account. In launching Zelle, banks are being careful not to confuse customers by offering yet another payments app. For instance, Chase will initially twin the brand with the QuickPay app its customers already use by showing "QuickPay with Zelle" on its mobile app and website. Eventually, the QuickPay name could fade away. Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change COF --- AAPL --- GOOGL --- FB --- PYPL ---

Relatives of people killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting — which Jones has called “a hoax” — sought to publicly shame Kelly via Twitter. Bill De Blasio, the mayor of New York, said the network should “pull the segment.” And reports have surfaced that J.P. Morgan Chase asked NBC to pull its advertisements during the episode. Nevertheless, NBC is planning to air the interview on Sunday, and the show’s executive producer is asking viewers to withhold judgment until then. Next Sunday, I sit down with conservative radio host @RealAlexJones to discuss controversies and conspiracies #SundayNight June 18 on NBC pic.twitter.com/7bVz6Fobf5 — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 11, 2017 “Until you see the full program, in the full context, I wouldn’t judge it too much,” said Liz Cole, the executive producer of “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly.” “Judge it when you see it. Megyn does a strong interview. We’re not just giving him a platform. “Giving him a platform would mean he goes unchallenged, and that’s not the case in any way. Where is he getting these theories and this information? … “Viewers will see Megyn do a strong interview where she challenges him appropriately. … That’s the benefit of putting him out there. When someone actually sits down and asks him questions and he has to come up with answers — there’s value to that.” Jones’ radio show reaches millions of listeners every day and his website, Infowars.com, had more than 5 million unique visitors in April, according to Quantcast. Jones has also claimed, without protest from the White House, that then-President-elect Donald Trump called to thank him after the election. To many people, Jones’ views are not only baseless but reckless, offensive and downright weird. In addition to his claims about Sandy Hook, Jones also believes 9/11 was “an inside job” and that humans have been “creating animal-human hybrids” for the last 30 years — all of which he says in his interview with Kelly. “He’s a controversial figure for sure,” Cole said. “But as journalists it’s our job to interview newsmakers and people of influence no matter how abhorrent their views may be.” After the release of the promo, relatives of some of the people killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting called on Kelly and NBC to pull the interview. On Monday afternoon, De Blasio weighed in as well. “Trump may promote Alex Jones, but NBC News shouldn’t give a platform to someone who claims 9/11 & Sandy Hook were hoaxes. Pull the segment,” he said. Then, on Monday night, The Wall Street Journal reported that J.P. Morgan Chase had decided to pull its advertisements from Kelly’s show until after the segment aired. A representative from J.P. Morgan declined to comment. Also on Monday night, an anti-gun violence organization founded by Sandy Hook parents announced that it had dropped Kelly as host of an event it is holding in Washington this week. “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” Nicole Hockley, the group’s co-founder and managing director, said in a statement. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” “I understand and respect the decision of the event organizers but I’m of course disappointed that I won’t be there to support them on Wednesday night,” Kelly said in a statement. “I find Alex Jones’ suggestion that Sandy Hook was ‘a hoax’ as personally revolting as every other rational person does. It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: How does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions? “President Trump, by praising and citing him, appearing on his show, and giving him White House press credentials, has helped elevate Jones, to the alarm of many. “Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light – as journalists are supposed to do — on this influential figure, and yes — to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity.” Meanwhile, Jones has called on NBC to pull the interview, but for a different reason. On Monday he claimed, without evidence, that NBC had used “deceptive editing” to make him look like a monster. Trademark and Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Morgan Chase & Co. said Monday that they would pull all local televised and digital ads associated with Megyn Kelly's new show. As a result, there's an increase in scrutinization of Kelly's $15 million net worth.     Kelly worked with Fox News and hosted "The Kelly File" from 2013 to 2017. She gained nationwide notoriety for getting into a public feud with then presidential candidate Donald Trump during the first 2016 presidential debate and then later on Twitter. Her yearly intake was $6 million, and when she moved over to NBC in February 2017, where the network risked $25 million on "Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly." Kelly's first interview was with controversial Russian Prime Minister Vladamir Putin. However, J.P. Morgan pulled their ads from the second interview with Alex Jones set to air on June 18, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Jones is the host of "The Alex Jones Show" on his website "InfoWars," and has a net worth of $10 million. He is notorious for pushing conspiracy theories and has gained high praise from the president. A marketing officer from JP Morgan took umbrage with Jones' spreading of conspiracy theories about mass shootings in Aurora and Sandy Hook.  "As an advertiser, I’m repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes," tweeted Kristin Lemkau.

Why? https://t.co/luwyCwP7Ti — Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017 J.P. Morgan & Chase wrote in an email to International Business Times that they are not commenting on the story. READ: Megyn Kelly Defends Alex Jones’ Interview, But Sandy Hook Theorist Doesn’t Want It Aired Jones said that the airing of the interview should be canceled, claiming that his views of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre were misrepresented in their sit-down.   "I’m calling for @megynkelly to cancel the airing of our interview for misrepresenting my views on Sandy Hook," he tweeted Monday afternoon, along with a 41-minute YouTube video explaining that he was only playing devil's advocate on his show.  "My listeners questioned it. … I played devil’s advocate by saying maybe none of it happened and it was all fake," Jones said in the video. "The other side of me believes those parents I’ve seen on TV, and real mass shootings happen, so it probably did happen." I'm calling for @megynkelly to cancel the airing of our interview for misrepresenting my views on Sandy Hook - https://t.co/TfLEPHEYrd — Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones) June 12, 2017 Kelly defended the interview on Twitter saying on her show Sunday that it was a "riveting exchange" and that "InfoWars" has been given White House press credentials. "Many don’t know him; our job is 2 shine a light," she tweeted.  POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential.

She was dropped as the host of the Promise Champions Gala, an annual event for the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation, a nonprofit gun violence prevention group founded by family members of some of the Sandy Hook shooting victims, according to the Washington Post.  Additionally, some of the family of the victims took to Twitter to vent their frustration at what they view as the legitimizing of Jones' views through Kelly's show.  Here you go @megynkelly - her name is Ana Grace Márquez-Greene. Say her name- stare at this & tell me it's worth it. @nbc #SandyHook pic.twitter.com/mKrU63KWmA — Nelba Márquez-Greene (@Nelba_MG) June 12, 2017 "Here you go @megynkelly - her name is Ana Grace Márquez-Greene.

Shame on you @megynkelly," added Cristina Hassinger, whose mother and principal of Sandy Hook, Dawn Hochsprung, was also killed. After the Sandy Hook shooting in December of 2012, Jones angered victims of the shooting when he was quoted on his show saying that it was a "synthetic completely fake."  "Sandy Hook is a synthetic completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured," said Jones in a clip from his radio show on Youtube from 2014. "I couldn’t believe it at first. I knew they had actors there, clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids. And it just shows how bold they are, that they clearly used actors."

The company does not want its name appearing next to plugs for the interview, which will air on Kelly’s new program “Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly,” the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. JP Morgan’s Chief Marketing Office criticized Kelly’s decision to conduct the interview via Twitter on Monday, referencing Jones’ past characterizations of the Sandy Hook Massacre as a hoax.

Why? https://t.co/luwyCwP7Ti — Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017 Victims of the Sandy Hook massacre and others have derided the interview on Twitter, using #ShameOnNBC to voice their criticisms. Many of the critics argued Jones’ past statements about the tragedy, which left 20 children and six staffers dead, should disqualify him from a major media appearance. The interview has been advertised as an exploration of “controversies and conspiracies.” In a promotional clip, Kelly pushes back against Jones’ Sandy Hook conspiracy theories. “When you say parents faked their children’s deaths, people get very angry,” Kelly says. Jones attempts to defend himself by equivocating. “But they don’t get angry about half-a-million dead Iraqis from the sanctions?” he says. The clip concludes with Jones enthusiastically pivoting to another conspiracy. “Thirty years ago they began creating animal human hybrids. Isn’t that the big story, Megyn Kelly?” he asks. Its not clear from the clip exactly who “they” refers to in this context. Jones called for Kelly to cancel the interview via Twitter Monday, alleging the promotional clip misrepresented his views on Sandy Hook.

Relatives of people killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting -- which Jones has called "a hoax" -- sought to publicly shame Kelly via Twitter. Bill De Blasio, the mayor of New York, said the network should "pull the segment." And reports have surfaced that J.P. Morgan Chase asked NBC to pull its advertisements during the episode. Nevertheless, NBC is planning to air the interview on Sunday, and the show's executive producer is asking viewers to withhold judgment until then. "Until you see the full program, in the full context, I wouldn't judge it too much," Liz Cole, the executive producer of "Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly," told CNNMoney. "Judge it when you see it. Megyn does a strong interview. We're not just giving him a platform." "Giving him a platform would mean he goes unchallenged, and that's not the case in any way," Cole said. "Where is he getting these theories and this information?... Viewers will see Megyn do a strong interview where she challenges him appropriately... That's the benefit of putting him out there. When someone actually sits down and asks him questions and he has to come up with answers -- there's value to that." Jones is certainly influential. His radio show reaches millions of listeners every day and his website, Infowars.com, had more than 5 million unique visitors in the month of April, according to Quantcast. Jones has also claimed, without protest from the White House, that President-elect Donald Trump called to thank him after the election. To many people, Jones' views are not only baseless but reckless, offensive and downright weird. In addition to his claims about Sandy Hook, Jones also believes 9/11 was "an inside job" and that humans have been "creating animal-human hybrids" for the last 30 years -- all of which he says in his interview with Kelly. "He's a controversial figure for sure," Cole said, "but as journalists it's our job to interview newsmakers and people of influence no matter how abhorrent their views may be." Following the release of the promo, relatives of some of the people killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting called on Kelly and NBC to pull the interview. Nelba M������rquez-Greene, whose daughter was killed in the shooting, tweeted several photos of her daughter and wrote, "Here you go @megynkelly - her name is Ana Grace M������rquez-Greene. Say her name- stare at this & tell me it's worth it." "This piece of actual garbage encourages people to call my mom's death a hoax and harass other Sandy Hook families," wrote Cristina Hassinger, the daughter of the school's principal. "Shame on you @megynkelly." On Monday afternoon, Mayor De Blasio weighed in as well: "Trump may promote Alex Jones, but NBC News shouldn't give a platform to someone who claims 9/11 & Sandy Hook were hoaxes. Pull the segment." Then, on Monday night, The Wall Street Journal reported that J.P. Morgan Chase had decided to pull its advertisements from Kelly's show until after the segment aired. A representative from J.P. Morgan declined to comment. Also on Monday night, an anti-gun violence organization founded by Sandy Hook parents announced that it had dropped Kelly as host of an event it is holding in Washington, D.C., this week. "Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host," Nicole Hockley, the group's co-founder and managing director, said in a statement. "It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview." "I understand and respect the decision of the event organizers but I'm of course disappointed that I won't be there to support them on Wednesday night," Kelly said in a statement. "I find Alex Jones's suggestion that Sandy Hook was 'a hoax' as personally revolting as every other rational person does," she continued. "It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: how does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions? President Trump, by praising and citing him, appearing on his show, and giving him White House press credentials, has helped elevate Jones, to the alarm of many. Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light - as journalists are supposed to do - on this influential figure, and yes - to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity." Meanwhile, Jones himself has called on NBC to pull the interview, but for a different reason. On Monday he claimed, without evidence, that NBC had used "deceptive editing" to make him look like a monster. Copyright 2017 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

Toggle navigation Celebrity Gossip Fashion Weddings Babies Hair Pets News Sports Politics TV Movies Megyn Kelly: Dropped by Advertisers, Benefit Gala Over Alex Jones Interview! by Simon Delott at June 13, 2017 11:33 am. Comments Megyn Kelly's interview with famous jerk and creator of Infowars Alex Jones hasn't even aired yet and it's already mired in controversy. The contentiousness of the decision to interview such a man hasn't gone unnoticed. Advertisers have been fleeing to the hills. And now Megyn Kelly's been asked to step down from hosting a Sandy Hook benefit ... because Alex Jones and his people famously declared that the Sandy Hook mass shooting was a hoax. Tomorrow, Sandy Hook Promise, a major gun violence-prevention organization, holds its annual Champions Promise Gala, where Megyn was originally supposed to emcee. She has now been asked to step down from that role. In case there was any doubt as to why she's being bumped, Sandy Hook Promise issued this statement:  "This decision was spurred by NBC’s planned broadcast of Kelly’s interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who believes the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT, was a hoax." Yeah, we can absolutely see how that would rub grieving parents the wrong way. "Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host. It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview." That's pretty understandable. Networks care about image, but only up to a certain point and only as a means to an end. What most of them really care about is ratings and advertisers, and the ratings only because they attract more money from advertisers. While some controversies and drive up viewers, some businesses do not want to risk the association and pull their ads -- which is exactly what's happening here. J.P. Morgan Chase has pulled its ads from NBC -- not just for Megyn's timeslot -- until after the interview is scheduled to air on June 18th. J.P. Morgan Chase's chief marketing officer tweeted that she was "repulsed" that Alex Jones would receive airtime. Alex Jones, for his part, has already declared to his followers that the interview will be "fake news" and that "they're scared of what we're covering." As always with conspiracy theorists, the use of "they" could mean anything from "the establishment" to Illuminati lizard people, which are often just one and the same. Everybody learns of the existence of Alex Jones and Infowars in their own way. Have you ever made the mistake of looking up something without paying attention to where you were looking it up? I did, a few years back. I looked up some dumb movie -- Transcendence -- for an analysis of its portrayal of transhumanism. The first couple of paragraphs just summarized the film, and the next one briefly defined transhumanism -- it's basically just technology making our lives longer and better. The next paragraph, and in fact the rest of the article, was talking about how this film was made as part of some diabolical campaign to "prepare" the public for transhumanism, though it would only be reserved for "global elites." That was when I looked up at where Google results had taken me -- it was Infowars. Other articles discussed various vague and elaborate "plots" that involved various innocuous elements of pop culture and politics. I'd quickly had my fill of nonsense. These days, the far-right fringe conspiracy site is much better known. From a viral video of Alex Jones decrying that he doesn't "like 'em putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!" to the disturbing links between Infowars and Donald Trump, people these days are much more familiar. Unfortunately, a huge part of that is because of ironically named "Sandy Hook Truthers" who deny that the Sandy Hook mass shooting took place, and instead insist that the children never existed and that the very real grieving parents are paid actors. That's a lot more upsetting than a dumb theory about a dumb movie. So Megyn Kelly choosing to interview Alex Jones has her on blast for giving the guy a platform. Parents who are still -- and will always be -- grieving don't want to see see anyone even seem to give credibility to the guy who's claims that their children never existed. It's one thing to interview Putin, who's terrible but can't be ignored. It's another thing to give a platform to Alex Jones. But, at the same time, we have to wonder if she could do more good by exposing Alex Jones for exactly the sort of man he is. Especially since Alex Jones has been praised by Donald Trump and Infowars has been given White House press credentials, as if they were a real news organization. One thing's for sure -- this interview's going to get a lot more viewers due to all of the controversy. People will want to see what all of the fuss is about. Assuming that NBC doesn't pull it entirely. Edit Delete Share Tweet Email Follow Megyn Kelly?

The trio will appear at a court hearing in New York on 17 July, Reuters reports. Rohan Ramchandani, Richard Usher and Chris Ashton, formerly of Citi, JPMorgan and Barclays respectively were indicted in January. US authorities accuse the currency traders of one count each of conspiracy to manipulate markets, a charge which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment and a $1m fine. The figure could rise to twice the gain they received from their actions or twice the losses suffered by those on the other side of the deal. All three men deny the charges.

This information was then allegedly used to manipulate exchange rates, allowing the traders to make a profit for their banks and ultimately themselves.

Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images One of the most powerful ways corporations can show they disapprove of a program’s actions is by pulling financial support. Delta, Bank of America and American Express did just that this weekend to protest the Public Theater’s “Trump-like” Julius Caesar, and now JPMorgan Chase is taking a stand against a controversial Megyn Kelly interview. The next episode of Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News host’s new NBC show, will feature an interview with radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. On his website InfoWars and his eponymous radio show, Jones has stated that the Oklahoma City bombing and 9/11 attacks were “inside jobs.” Most controversially of all, he claimed the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting (in which 20 children and six teachers were killed) was a hoax staged by actors who wanted to further their gun control agenda. Because of this, the families of people killed at Sandy Hook are especially livid with Kelly for giving Jones a platform. They have also been calling her out on Twitter: Here you go @megynkelly – her name is Ana Grace Márquez-Greene. Say her name- stare at this & tell me it's worth it. @nbc #SandyHook pic.twitter.com/mKrU63KWmA — Nelba Márquez-Greene (@Nelba_MG) June 12, 2017 This piece of actual garbage encourages people to call my mom's death a hoax and harass other Sandy Hook families. Shame on you @megynkelly. https://t.co/uGmhqQAEeR — cristina hassinger (@chass63) June 12, 2017 This is airing on Father's Day. Imagine losing your child in a shooting while the man who denies it happened gets an interview. #ShameOnNBC — Danielle Vabner (@daniellelvabner) June 12, 2017 The interview also caused at least one corporation to deny NBC its most valuable resource: advertising money. JPMorgan Chase & Company has decided to remove its TV and digital ads from all NBC programming until after the Jones interview airs on Sunday, The Wall Street Journal first reported last night. Earlier in the day, the company’s chief marketing officer Kristin Lemkau had called out Kelly on Twitter: As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why? https://t.co/luwyCwP7Ti — Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017 No other advertisers have pulled out yet, though the gun violence prevention group Sandy Hook Promise announced that Kelly would no longer host its annual Promise Champions Gala. Shannon Watts, founder of the advocacy organization Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, also appealed to Kelly in an op-ed for Refinery29. “Alex Jones has been in the spotlight for far too long,” Watts wrote. “It’s time to turn that light off and let him crawl back under the refrigerator.” Kelly has been defending herself on social media for several days: POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light. https://t.co/5e88BJyqnz — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 12, 2017 Ironically, one of Kelly’s most vocal critics has been Jones himself. On his radio show Monday, he said the interview was “rigged” and fake news, and accused Kelly of misleading him. He also called on NBC not to broadcast the interview, and described the host as cold and robotic. “I felt zero attraction to Megyn Kelly,” he said.

Rohan Ramchandani, Richard Usher and Chris Ashton, formerly of Citi (C.N), JP Morgan Chase (JPM.N) and Barclays (BARC.L) - dubbed the "Cartel" - were indicted by the Department of Justice in January. A preliminary hearing in New York has been scheduled for July 17. As per the bail terms agreed with the DOJ, the three men, who all deny wrongdoing, will be able to return to and stay in Britain until the case comes to trial. "Mr Ramchandani has agreed to travel voluntarily to the USA to stand trial and clear his name. He has not committed any criminal offense," said Alison Geary, a lawyer at WilmerHale in London acting on behalf of Ramchandani, in a statement. Sara George, partner at Stephenson Harwood acting on behalf of Chris Ashton, said in a statement: "Chris Ashton has reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice which will allow him to travel voluntarily to the United States to stand trial for an offense ... which he did not commit." Jonathan Pickworth, a lawyer at White & Case, representing Usher, said in a statement that his client "welcomes the opportunity to defend himself and set the record straight – the first time he has had such opportunity in the four years since this investigation began." The three men were members of the "Cartel" electronic chatroom in which they are alleged to have shared sensitive client order information to manipulate exchange rates. Britain's Serious Fraud Office in March last year closed its own criminal investigation, concluding that there was "insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction." The global FX investigation into allegations that the "Cartel" and others rigged benchmark FX rates resulted in the world's biggest banks paying $10 billion in fines and dozens of traders being fired.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By Elizabeth Heichler A solid collections process—making sure you're paid promptly for your products or services—is an essential part of smooth cash flow, and a healthy company. JPMorgan Chase A checklist to help businesses set up effective invoicing and collections. "When you need to make payroll, or if you have a big project coming up, having your arms around timing of payments is critical," says John Bailey, founder of Boston Startup CFO, which provides financial consulting to startups. Use this checklist to help establish fundamentals that will serve your business well for years to come. 1. Involve your sales team: Get salespeople to gather important billing and collections data at the start of a relationship. Ask them to: Gather new customer information. Give them a template that includes names, phone numbers and emails of the purchaser and accounts payable contact; the physical address; and any invoicing requirements. Participate in collections efforts as needed. Check a customer's payment history before extending more credit. 2. Line up resources for credit checks: Equip your team to run credit checks on new customers for particularly large deals. The major credit bureaus offer online services. In addition, provide no-cost research tools that sales can use, such as: Plug-ins available for some customer relationship management systems Local Better Business Bureau sites Guidelines for a basic web search that may turn up relevant news about the customer or other information 3. Set terms: Determine how soon you will expect customers to pay. For example, you may start with terms that require payment within 21 or 30 days of the invoice date. You might offer a discount for paying early. Charging late fees of 1.5 percent to 2 percent monthly also provides incentive to pay. 4. Set payment type: Decide what kinds of payments you will accept. Accepting credit cards on your website via a merchant service such as Chase Checkout may encourage customers, especially smaller ones, to pay invoices more quickly. 5. Define your invoice format: Create an invoice template. It should include bill-to and ship-to names, addresses and contact information; purchase order number; payment due date and invoice date; and terms, including any early payment discounts or late payment fees. Also provide information on how to remit payment, including your bank account name, number and routing information. 6. Tap tools that speed payments: Set up electronic invoicing. You may need your IT person to set up a template for your accounting software, but "in the long run, it's totally worth the time and investment," says Bailey. If bigger accounts require you to invoice them through their own portals, your sales team should get you logins. Look for bank services that move payments into your account faster. For example, Chase Express Funding allows small-business owners to receive funds from customers' card purchases the next business day, rather than the more typical several-day processing. Customers who have business checking and merchant services accounts with Chase can take advantage of this benefit. 7. Put yourself on a schedule: Pick a day of the week—say, every Friday—when you always do invoicing, and stick to it. Likewise, pick a day to review receivables to identify accounts that are past due and require further action. Speedy action on delayed payments will dramatically impact your likelihood of collecting. 8. Set communications protocols: "Put a defined policy in place for reaching out to customers," says Bailey. Establish a polite, respectful relationship with the customer's accounts payable department. "Never take a hard line with someone in accounts payable," he says. Start all interactions in the spirit of seeking to clarify and remedy any miscommunication. Create a follow-up schedule: At 30 days, send a friendly reminder; at 45 days, send another and mention applicable late fees; at 60 days, send a letter—and ask sales to check in with their contacts as well. If you've had no response at 90 days, you might write off the debt and refer it to a bonded collection agency. 9. Measure results and tweak your process: At the end of each month, calculate your "Days Sales Outstanding" (DSO). Divide your current accounts receivable by the total sales made on credit during the month, and multiply the result by the number of days in the month. The average benchmark is around 45 days, according to Bailey. If you implement changes, such as shortening your payment terms, or sending invoices out earlier, calculating your DSO every month will reveal whether those moves had an impact.

Finance giant JPMorgan Chase has pulled all of its adverts from NBC News until after the pre-recorded interview is aired on 18 June. And Sandy Hook Promise, an organisation formed to protect children from gun violence, announced that Ms Kelly would no longer host their annual fundraising gala on Wednesday. Some social media users have lambasted Ms Kelly for providing Jones with a national platform "to discuss controversies and conspiracies". Jones admits "some real kids" were killed at Sandy Hook but has helped push a theory that the Sandy Hook massacre was "synthetic, completely fake with actors". Twenty-six people, mostly young children, died in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. For years, families of the victims have been targeted by conspiracy theorists who falsely claim that the tragedy was staged by the government in an attempt to tighten gun control laws. Image copyright Twitter/@Nelba_MG Image caption The mother of six-year-old Ana Grace Márquez-Greene - killed at Sandy Hook - has said giving Alex Jones a platform is "especially cruel" Ms Kelly has defended the interview, saying US President Donald Trump gave "White House press credential" to Jones by appearing on and praising his show. But Jones has called for the interview's airing to be cancelled for "misrepresenting his views". The mother of Ana Grace Márquez-Greene - a six-year-old girl who was killed at Sandy Hook - tweeted the NBC host an image of her daughter: "Here you go @megynkelly - her name is Ana Grace Márquez-Greene. Say her name - stare at this & tell me it's worth it. @nbc #SandyHook" She also told The Washington Post that giving "Alex Jones a platform on Father's Day is especially cruel to me". "This piece of actual garbage encourages people to call my mom's death a hoax and harass other Sandy Hook families. Shame on you @megynkelly," added Cristina Hassinger - whose mother and principal of Sandy Hook, Dawn Hochsprung, was also killed. More on Sandy Hook from BBC Trending: Sandy Hook to Trump: 'Help us stop conspiracy theorists' The Sandy Hook Hoaxers Others said the interview was akin to "defiling the memory" of the killed and would "help legitimise" Alex Jones. Chelsea Clinton said there was "no justification for amplifying lies" while actor Chris Evans added that human decency was being "trampled by the quest for ratings". New York mayor Bill Blasio also called on NBC to "pull the segment". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionNoah Pozner was one of the children killed in the massacre. His father is leading the fight against the conspiracy theorists And tens of thousands also used the Twitter hashtag #ShameOnNBC, rallying people to call the network and tell them not to air the interview. Some, including political commentator Ana Navarro, said they would not be watching the show in support of the victims. One Twitter account added as an alternative it would air the video about the "26 Sandy Hook Angels" who died. Ms Kelly left Fox News earlier this year to anchor her NBC show "Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly". Image copyright Twitter/@KaivanShroff In a video posted to his website in November 2016, Alex Jones said in his "final statement" on Sandy Hook: "There is some evidence that people died there... I don't know what the truth is, all I know is the official story of Sandy Hook has more holes in it than Swiss cheese." Jones has also helped push forward the theory that 9/11 was a "fable" and an "inside job" and other theories surrounding the Oklahoma City bombing as well as mass shootings in Orlando and Aurora, Colorado. However, he has retracted some of them when threatened with legal action, including his defamatory remarks about yogurt company Chobani, and has apologised for promoting the false Pizzagate theory.

The central bank is scheduled to release its decision at 2 p.m EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to hold a press conference at 2:30 pm EDT. “The expectation of a rate hike...is widely held, and has been reinforced by the most recent round of Fed communications,” said Michael Feroli, an economist with JPMorgan. Read more Cautious Federal Reserve knocks dollar and supports bond prices Economists polled by Reuters overwhelmingly see the Fed raising its benchmark rate to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25 per cent this week. The Fed embarked on its first tightening cycle in more than a decade in December 2015. A quarter percentage point interest rate rise on Wednesday would be the second nudge upwards this year following a similar move in March. Since then, the unemployment rate has fallen to a 16-year low of 4.3 per cent and economic growth appears to have reaccelerated following a lacklustre first quarter. Read more Cautious Federal Reserve knocks dollar and supports bond prices US Federal Reserve raises interest rates US dollar spurred by expectations of a Federal Reserve rate rise Federal Reserve signals another interest rate hike 'fairly soon' However, other indicators of the economy's health have been more mixed. The Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 per cent from 1.8 per cent earlier in 2017 and investors are growing increasingly doubtful policymakers will be able to stick to their anticipated pace of tightening of three interest rate rises this year and next. There are also growing doubts on the size and scope of fiscal stimulus the Trump administration may inject into the US economy with campaign promises on tax reform, financial regulation rollbacks and infrastructure spending either still on the drawing board or facing hurdles in Congress. Fed policymakers' confidence in their outlook will be on show on Wednesday when they release their latest set of quarterly projections on growth, unemployment and inflation as well as their expected rate hike path. Few economists expect major changes in the Fed's overall forecasts this time around, although the extent of jitters on inflation moving away from the Fed's 2 per cent goal will likely be reflected at an individual level. Markets are, however, increasingly anxious for the Fed to give a clearer steer on the timing and details of its previously announced plan to reduce this year its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the financial crisis to help keep rates low and bolster the economy. “If the Fed is serious about reducing the size of its balance sheet this year and wishes to communicate those plans well in advance, it is running out of time to do so,” said Michael Pearce, an economist with Capital Economics.

Morgan Chase Pulls NBC News Ads Over Megyn Kelly's Interview With Alex Jones (Report) 5:31 PM PDT 6/12/2017 by the Associated Press , THR Staff FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Steve Granitz/Getty Megyn Kelly Kelly has defended her decision to feature the 'Infowars' host on her NBC newsmagazine amid criticism from the families of Sandy Hook victims. J.P. Morgan Chase has pulled its advertisements from NBC News in light of Megyn Kelly's upcoming interview with Infowars host Alex Jones, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. The company has decided to remove all of its TV and digital ads from all programming on the network until after the show airs on Sunday, according to the paper. Kelly has defended her decision to feature Jones on her NBC newsmagazine despite taking heat Monday from families of Sandy Hook shooting victims and others, saying it's her job to "shine a light" on newsmakers. POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light. https://t.co/5e88BJyqnz — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 12, 2017 Critics argue that NBC's platform legitimizes the views of a man who has suggested, among other conspiracy theories, that the killing of 26 people at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 was a hoax. The network released a brief portion of the interview, which is scheduled to air on Sunday. Kelly, who interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin on the June 4 premiere of Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly, said on Twitter that President Donald Trump has praised Jones and has been on his show. Since many people don't know Jones and his views, Kelly noted the importance of explaining them. NBC hasn't immediately commented on the criticism. J.P. Morgan Chase's chief marketing officer tweeted Monday that she was "repulsed" that Kelly would "give a second of airtime someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes." As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why? https://t.co/luwyCwP7Ti — Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017 Nelba Marquez-Greene, whose 6-year-old daughter Ana Grace was killed at Sandy Hook, said she fears that giving Jones exposure would encourage his followers who have harassed her and others. "You can't just put him in a box and say he's just a character," Marquez-Greene said. "He's really hurting people." A year ago, a New York City man who was a follower of Jones was sentenced to probation after approaching a sister of slain Sandy Hook teacher Victoria Soto during a charity road race and angrily claiming the shootings never took place. On Facebook, Soto's family said the "incessant need for ratings at the cost of the emotional well-being of our family is disgusting and disappointing." A writer for the conservative website Red State, Andrea Kutz, wondered, "What is Megyn Kelly thinking?" "I'm a news and politics-engaged individual," said Kutz, "but I don't care to watch interviews with liars of either Putin's or Jones' ilk. These interviews aren't interesting even in the abstract." In the interview clip released by NBC, Kelly said to Jones, "When you say people faked their children's deaths, people get very angry." When he tried to change the subject, Kelly said, "That's a dodge." After the interview had been taped, Jones denounced it on Infowars as "fake news, in my view." He said he expected a "rigged" report because a day's worth of interviews will be boiled down to an 11-minute report. "They're scared of what we're covering," he said. "They're scared of what we're doing." Jones also described Kelly as not feminine, cold and robotic. "I felt zero attraction to Megyn Kelly," he said. Among Kelly's social media critics was Shannon Watts, the founder of the anti-gun violence group Moms Demand Action, who suggested that Kelly "turn your light off and let him back under the refrigerator."

Morgan Chase Reportedly Pulls Ads Over Megyn Kelly’s Upcoming Alex Jones Interview By Halle Kiefer Share Facebook iconShare Twitter iconTweet Google Plus iconShare Pinterest iconPin It Email iconEmail Comment iconComment Print icon Print Photo: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images For Entertainment Weekly After defending her decision to sit down with controversial Infowars host Alex Jones on Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly, Megyn Kelly must now grapple with J.P. Morgan Chase’s decision to temporarily pull its advertising from NBC over the interview. According to The Wall Street Journal, the bank has reportedly “asked for its local TV ads and digital ads to be removed from Ms. Kelly’s show and from all NBC news programming until after the show airs.” On Monday morning, J.P. Morgan Chase’s chief marketing officer Kristin Lemkau took to Twitter to express her dismay over Kelly’s decision to speak with Jones on her program. Lemkau wrote, “As an advertiser, I’m repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why?” It’s a sentiment shared by family members of those killed in the 2012 mass shooting. As for her rationale for having the Infowars founder on her show, Kelly points to his jovial relationship with President Trump, who has been a guest on Jones’s show and praised his reputation. “He’s giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don’t know him; our job is 2 shine a light,” Kelly tweeted on Sunday. In the past, Jones has suggested that the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, was — among other catastrophic moments in U.S. history, including 9/11 — a staged event created by the government to further their clandestine agenda. Jones is now also calling on Megan Kelly not to air their interview for “misrepresenting” his views on the shooting, which killed 28, including the shooter Adam Lanza. Jones’s interview is scheduled to air this Sunday, June 18. WSJ THR Tags: the controversies never cease controversies megyn kelly alex jones j.p. morgan chase nbc tv More J.P.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday the company has asked all of its local TV and digital ads to be removed from all NBC News programming until after the episode airs. The interview, which has caused an uproar due to Jones’ promotion of several controversial conspiracy theories, is scheduled to air on June 18. The company’s chief marketing officer, Kristin Lemkau, tweeted her disapproval of the interview Monday morning. “As an advertiser, I’m repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes,” she wrote. “Why?” Latest entertainment videos Also Read: Alex Jones Demands Megyn Kelly Interview Be Canceled: She 'Lied to Me' (Video) In a 97-second preview of the interview, Jones calls the 9/11 attacks an “inside job” and questions the legitimacy of the Sandy Hook shootings. He asays that “30 years ago, they began creating animal-human hybrids.” “Isn’t that the big story Megyn Kelly should be doing?” Jones says in the teaser. The interview has been met with widespread condemnation from those who object to Kelly giving Jones a mainstream platform to express his views. Kelly defended the interview on Twitter, writing that because of Jones’ connections to President Donald Trump, it is her responsibility to “shine a light.” Also Read: Megyn Kelly Lands Jackie Levin as Executive Producer For NBC Morning Show However, Jones himself has also called on the interview to be canceled, claiming that Kelly misrepresented his views. In a live stream on Monday afternoon, Jones said that Kelly lied to him, and promised that the interview would not be about Sandy Hook or other conspiracies. “Megyn Kelly lied to me several weeks before she came here,” he said. “She said that the interview was not going to be about Sandy Hook and the mass shooting there, and it was not going to be about Pizzagate and these other issues that the media always obsesses on and misrepresents what I’ve said and what I’ve done.” As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes.

Morgan Chase has pulled its advertising from all NBC News programs until after a controversial interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones​ airs — an interview Jones himself now wants canceled. According to The Wall Street Journal, the financial services company does not agree with the network airing Megyn Kelly's interview with Alex Jones, a controversial figure who has said in the past he believes the Sandy Hook school shooting and the Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting were hoaxes, and the Sept. 11 terror attacks were an "inside job." The interview is scheduled to air during the next episode of "Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly." Jones runs the Infowars website and has floated several conspiracy theories in the past. The 2012 Sandy Hook shooting left 20 children, six staff members, and the shooter's mother dead. The shooter killed himself before police arrived. Kelly posted a teaser of the interview on her Twitter account. According to the New York Daily News, Jones said Monday on his radio program he believes Sandy Hook was not a hoax, but that the media "exacerbated" the tragedy. He later posted a tweet that called on NBC to cancel the interview "for misrepresenting my views on Sandy Hook."

It would mark the first advertiser to do so since NBC began promos for the interview with the radio talk show host, Infowars founder and friend to Donald Trump. Related Megyn Kelly Torched For Giving NBC Air Time To Sandy Hook Truther Alex Jones According to the Wall Street Journal, JP Morgan has asked that its local TV and digital ads be removed from Kelly’s Sunday show and all NBC news programming until after Sunday’s episode airs. JP Morgan declined comment, and NBC has not returned requests for comment.

Kelly said Sunday on Twitter that “many don’t know” Jones, and “our job is 2 shine a light.” The back-and-forth has resulted in the hashtag #ShameOnNBC.

Reply turnitup • on Jun 12, 2017 9:16 pm You’re more interested in being on the winning side than the moral side to equate these two things. Alex Jones is the worst of humanity And you are one hundred percent coward. Reply Chris • on Jun 13, 2017 5:39 am No he’s the same as the liar in chief.

Reply • on Jun 13, 2017 9:12 am Yeah, because the pain and suffering of the parents whose children were murdered at Sandyhook and who continue to be harassed, stalked, and threatened by an army of psycho sociopaths whipped into a frenzy by Alex Jones is JUST LIKE TRAVELGATE. Reply Pedro • on Jun 12, 2017 6:51 pm Free speech is dead now. Before people even say anything, we are already trying to shut them up. Jones is an idiot, but, like anyone else, he has the right of a voice. And given what he says, letting him speak only proves how wrong he is. Reply Ricky Lee Jones • on Jun 13, 2017 4:24 am He has a voice and he continues to spread hatred and lies on a daily basis. No one is trying to stop him from spewing his venom. It is our right not to have him do it on via NBC on this kind of platform. Free speech is the right to speak without interference from the government not without interference from private citizens. Reply SW • on Jun 13, 2017 5:34 am Nobody is taking away his right to free speech. But that speech doesn’t have to be given the spotlight this show would give it. He can still go on his channel and say whatever he wants and nothing will happen to him. You’re confusing Free Speech with a programming decision. Reply MM • on Jun 12, 2017 7:15 pm Alex Jones belongs in a cesspool, not on NBC. Megyn, not impressed with your opening moves. Putin intv was a fluff-fest. Reply Tentoes • on Jun 12, 2017 11:45 pm Alex Jones should not be given a voice on NBC, that’s absolute bullshit, and a dereliction of their duty as members of the 4th estate. Corporate owned media – no principles. Just in it for the bucks. AND the primary problem at the root of all problems in the U.S. today. Reply Nell • on Jun 13, 2017 2:55 am Not at all a fan of AJ, but isn”t it the duty of the media to investigate controversial views? Without having seen the interview but judging MK’s ability from her Putin interview, the problem would seem to be her lack of pushback. Having a TV show or being a columnist/writer doesn’t automatically make a person a newsperson or journalist in anything other than name.

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: J.P. Morgan Chase pulls NBC News ads over Megyn Kelly’s interview with Alex Jones In News by THR Staff / The Hollywood Reporter / June 12, 2017 Share < br />this article: J.P. Morgan Chase has pulled its advertisements from NBC News in light of Megyn Kelly’s upcoming interview with Infowars host Alex Jones, the Wall Street Journal reports. The company has decided to remove all of its TV and digital ads from all programming on the network until after the June 18 show airs, according to WSJ. Kelly has defended her decision to feature Jones on her NBC newsmagazine despite taking heat Monday from families of Sandy Hook shooting victims and others, saying it’s her job to “shine a light” on newsmakers. POTUS’s been on & praises @RealAlexJones’ show. He’s giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don’t know him; our job is 2 shine a light. https://t.co/5e88BJyqnz — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 12, 2017 Critics argue that NBC’s platform legitimizes the views of a man who, among other conspiracy theories, has suggested that the killing of 26 people at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 was a hoax. The network released a brief portion of the interview, which is scheduled to air on Sunday. Kelly, who interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin on the June 4 premiere of “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly,” said on Twitter that President Trump has praised Jones and been on his show. Since many people don’t know Jones and his views, Kelly noted the importance of explaining them. NBC hasn’t immediately commented on the criticism. J.P. Morgan Chase’s chief marketing officer tweeted Monday that she was “repulsed” that Kelly would “give a second of airtime someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes.” As an advertiser, I’m repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why? https://t.co/luwyCwP7Ti — Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017 Nelba Marquez-Greene, whose six-year-old daughter Ana Grace was killed at Sandy Hook, said she fears that giving Jones exposure would encourage Jones’ followers who have harassed her and others. “You can’t just put him in a box and say he’s just a character,” Marquez-Greene said. “He’s really hurting people.” A year ago, a New York City man who was a follower of Jones was sentenced to probation after approaching a sister of slain Sandy Hook teacher Victoria Soto during a charity road race and angrily claiming the shootings never took place. On Facebook, Soto’s family said the “incessant need for ratings at the cost of the emotional well-being of our family is disgusting and disappointing.” A writer at the conservative web site Red State, Andrea Kutz, wondered, “what is Megyn Kelly thinking?” “I’m a news and politics-engaged individual,” Kutz said, “but I don’t care to watch interviews with liars of either Putin’s or Jones’s ilk. These interviews aren’t interesting even in the abstract.” In the interview clip released by NBC, Kelly said to Jones, “When you say people faked their childrens’ deaths, people get very angry.” When he tried to change the subject, Kelly said, “that’s a dodge.” After his interview had been taped, Jones denounced it on Infowars as “fake news, in my view.” He said he expected a “rigged” report because a day’s worth of interviews will be boiled down to an 11-minute report. “They’re scared of what we’re covering,” he said. “They’re scared of what we’re doing.” Jones also described Kelly as not feminine, cold and robotic. “I felt zero attraction to Megyn Kelly,” he said. Among Kelly’s social media critics was Shannon Watts, the founder of the anti-gun violence group Moms Demand Action, who suggested that Kelly “turn your light off and let him back under the refrigerator.” This story originally appeared on The Hollywood Reporter. Associated Press contributed to this report.  [Photo: Getty] Tags: Alex Jones, Megyn Kelly Recommended for you Sandy Hook nonprofit drops Megyn Kelly as host for annual gala Alex Jones demands Megyn Kelly not air his interview, claims it’s a conspiracy to make dads look bad Sandy Hook families to Megyn Kelly: ‘Shame on you’ Megyn Kelly gives platform to man who claims Sandy Hook parents faked children’s deaths Trump campaign sends email about ‘Pittsburgh, Not Paris’ rally with a link to InfoWars Chobani yogurt gets the better of Alex Jones in lawsuit over phony refugee conspiracy theory sign up to get the latest deathandtaxes news Thank you for signing up for our newsletter.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Renae Merle By Renae Merle June 12 Follow @renaemerle A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York on May 17. (Reuters/Brendan McDermid) The nation's biggest banks have a common gripe: They have too much money. Since the 2008 financial crisis, Wall Street has been forced by regulators to set aside larger financial reserves, enough capital to survive losses they may suffer in an emergency -- without the help of taxpayer bailouts. Now, some of the industry's key players say their financial cushions are getting too plump. “Left to our own devices, we wouldn’t hold as much capital as we’re holding,” Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said in an investor conference earlier this year. "It is clear that the banks have too much capital,” Jamie Dimon, head of JPMorgan Chase, said in his annual letter to shareholders. "We think it’s clear that banks can use more of their capital to finance the economy without sacrificing safety and soundness." With lower capital requirements, the industry argues, banks could buy back more of their own stock or increase dividends, effectively returning the wealth to shareholders. Regulators have largely dismissed the industry's complaints, saying banks may need even more capital, not less. "Although capital standards are higher than before the last crisis, they are not nearly high enough," Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in response to Dimon's shareholder letter. "Unfortunately, regulators have taken it easy on the large banks, which today have only about half of the equity they need." But that could change under President Trump. The White House has said regulators went too far in regulating the banking industry, making it too hard to get a loan. At the center of the debate is one of the chief causes of the financial crisis: Banks had too much debt and not enough capital to absorb growing losses and had to be bailed out by taxpayers. The industry has significantly increased its financial cushion since them. The common equity capital ratio -- which compares an institution's core equity to the relative risk of its various assets---is one measure of an institution's ability to absorb losses. The ratio for the country's largest banks has more than doubled from 5.5 percent in early 2009 to 12.2 percent by 2016, according to the Federal Reserve. That amounted to an increase of more than $700 billion to $1.2 trillion in such capital. But just how much banks should hold and what forms it should take remains a contentious issue. "Too little capital is bad for a company, too much capital is also bad," said Ed Mills, a policy analyst at investment bank FBR Capital Markets. After Trump's election, "what investors got excited is that we may be seeing the high watermark" in the amount capital banks are required to hold. One approach championed by some Republicans is to give banks regulatory relief if they hold onto more capital. In legislation passed last week by the House, banks that raised more capital would be eligible for an "off-ramp" and would not face the same level of regulatory scrutiny. But critics say the requirement included in the legislation is still too low. The bill is likely to meet stiff resistance in the Senate, but even if it did pass, many of the biggest banks are not likely to choose the off-ramp, industry analysts say. JPMorgan Chase would need to set aside an additional $107 billion to take advantage of that option, according to research by Nomura, a global investment bank. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America would need to set aside an additional $45 billion and $82 billion, respectively. “The challenge for regulators is that there is no magic number for what is the appropriate amount of capital,” said Kevin Petrasic, a banking partner at White & Case LLP. “Economic risks change over time, they inflate and contract,” he added. “How do you establish capital criteria that are flexible for all types of situations? What is the appropriate amount of capital, relative to the potential risk?” The current capital standards are already too high and complex, industry officials say. U.S. regulators sometimes “gold plate” the standards set by international groups, putting American firms at a disadvantage, they say. Also, how U.S. regulators count capital can differ according to agency or the rule under consideration. That has prompted some banks to hold onto more capital than they need, creating a buffer to comply with changing federal standards. Banks are sitting on $131 billion in excess capital, according to a March research report from Goldman Sachs. If capital requirements are lowered, banks could return the money to shareholders in the form of dividends, boosting the payouts perhaps by 45 percent in 2018, the report found. Hampering the industry's arguments has been record profits. Despite the higher capital requirements, the country's banking industry reported more than $171 billion in profit last year and the volume of bank loans has increased significantly since the financial crisis. “To the point that they have shown themselves profitable, the Federal Reserve has taken the opportunity to further raise capital” requirements, said Mills of FBR. In a 2015 column in the Financial Times, former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan argued that having 20 percent capital was reasonable. "The objection to a capital requirement of 20 percent or more, even when phased in over a series of years, is that it will suppress bank earnings and lending. History, however, suggests otherwise," Greenspan said. And former Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo said in his final speech last April that it may be time for banks to increase capital again. A recent study by three Federal Reserve Board researchers concluded that some capital levels should be between 13 percent to 26 percent, he noted. "Current requirements for the largest U.S. firms are toward the lower end of this range," he said. business wonkblog false after3th true Please provide a valid email address.

Follow @GillianTan Facebook Twitter Email Print Share May 17, 2017 3:06 PM EDT BANK OF AMERICA CORP -0.22 At Closing, June 15th 23.54 USD If the Trump bump is over, what's going to keep bank stocks aloft? Plenty, it turns out.  Every major bank from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Bank of America Corp. tumbled on Wednesday, leading to a more than 4 percent drop in the KBW Bank Index. Some stocks had their biggest intraday declines since last year's Brexit vote. The fear is that President Donald Trump's bank-friendly legislative agenda may be stymied by the political turmoil roiling the White House. In the Red Increased political uncertainty around President Donald Trump's agenda led some bank stocks to their worst day since last June's Brexit vote Source: Bloomberg *Data reflects intraday movements It's understandable that investors are questioning Washington's ability to deliver on promises around tax reform, financial deregulation and even infrastructure spending. But hang on: Even if there are months of disruption and distraction, Republicans' current hold on Congress means those topics will remain atop the agenda for at least the next couple of years. Plus, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has already signaled ways to loosen financial regulation without having to rewrite the law. Banking regulators can issue guidance instead, or simply not enforce existing rules. And changes in law aren't required for regulators to ease requirements in the annual stress-testing of large banks, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR.  Holding On Despite falling 10 percent from their highs, bank stocks have kept the bulk of their gains since President Donald Trump was elected into office Source: Bloomberg Stepping past the noise in Washington, banks remain on a path to improving profitability. That's tied to an assumption that their interest income will rise as interest rates climb, however slowly. For example, Bank of America, the most sensitive of the largest banks to rate hikes, forecasts an additional $3.3 billion of net interest income for every 100 basis-point shift in the yield curve, which measures overall economic health.  And though the yield curve flattened on Wednesday (pressuring bank stocks), traders are still pricing in an 82.5 percent chance of a 25 basis-point hike at next month's Federal Reserve meeting, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Another move is still expected later in 2017.   Flatlining The conviction around President Donald Trump's pro-growth policies has dwindled to its lowest levels since the election, as measured by the slope of the Treasury yield curve Source: Bloomberg Beyond that, regional banks should continue to forge ahead with industry consolidation as a means to bolster their earnings and justify higher valuations. Achieving cost savings through synergies may become an even more compelling proposition if tax cuts and loosened regulation are delayed or otherwise muted.  Back to Washington: Investors could hear reassuring news as soon as Thursday, when Mnuchin testifies before the Senate Banking Committee. Any additional details about how the administration intends to wind back parts of the Dodd-Frank Act or make it easier for small banks to compete will obviously be welcomed by shareholders. Upside? Wednesday's pullback has left some of the largest U.S. banks offering sizable potential returns Source: Bloomberg But even absent new information, bank stocks don't deserve a battering.  In fact, Wednesday's declines -- and any that may follow -- present believers with a buying opportunity. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.  Admittedly, this is down from 97.5 percent odds earlier this week.

Why is air travel so uncomfortable? Financial capitalism obviously: "As in other industries, like manufacturing or consumer goods, the focus is on more traditional financial metrics like pretax income, margins, return on capital and total shareholder return," said Andrew Goldstein, head of the executive compensation practice in North America for Willis Towers Watson. "Airlines haven't abandoned operational and customer-service metrics, but they are putting less emphasis on those factors." Customer service has been replaced by other goals: “Fifteen years ago, airlines competed with each other over who could buy the most planes or have the most routes,” said Jamie Baker, a top airline industry analyst at JPMorgan Chase. “Executives are just as competitive today, but it's about who can achieve an investment-grade rating first, who can be a component in the S. & P. 500, and who has better returns for investors.” That mention of the S&P 500 is all the excuse I need to bring up my favorite explanation for airline misery, which is the claim that cross-ownership of many U.S. airlines by the same diversified institutional investors -- index funds and "quasi-indexers" -- discourages the airlines from competing on price and quality, and encourages them to focus on margins. An airline that cuts fares or spends money on better service to win market share isn't necessarily doing its shareholders any favors: The increased market share comes at the expense of other airline companies that the shareholders also probably own. There are objections to that explanation. For one thing, fare cuts are a bigger part of the story than it would suggest: "The pressure on United, American and other giants is only going to increase with the rise of so-called ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant." Airlines are competing, but competition on price is bad for service. But I think the "index funds ruin capitalism" story is best read as just one strand of a larger "financial capitalism ruins capitalism" story, and while the index funds story is still pretty niche, the financial capitalism story has become very popular. In this story, managers and investors have stopped thinking of companies as companies, as human networks of employees and customers and investors, and now think of them instead as numbers, as sets of financial factors to be optimized. There are many explanations for this: Developments in graduate business education, or the rise of corporate activism, or the cultural role of Wall Street. But the basic story is that companies used to balance the interests of workers, customers and investors; now they have adopted a fully investor-centric model in which profits are the only goal and customer service and workers' rights are sacrificed. Sheelah Kolhatkar writes that "the investors-above-all doctrine seems to have triumphed over the more inclusive approach." You can easily connect this story to indexing and quasi-indexing. Modern scientific financial capitalism is closely bound up with the idea of diversification. If you are an individual investor choosing a small number of stocks to invest your savings in, you might choose them based on how you feel about their businesses. If you are an institution choosing hundreds of stocks to make up a diversified portfolio at the efficient frontier, you are going to consider those stocks as a series of numbers, of exposures to risk factors that you want to optimize. You'll want to focus on the quantifiable, not on your feelings, or on vague stories about how short-term financial sacrifices can lead to long-term opportunities. Also, diversified institutional investors create the investor class that managers are now supposedly serving. If one company has one set of owners, and a different company has a different set of owners, there is no a priori reason to think that those owners will want the same sorts of things. Some owners might want short-term profits, and others might want long-term growth, and a third set might want the warm fuzzy feeling of owning a popular business with good labor relations. Managers would have to, I don't know, go ask the owners what they want, and then do that. Or not do that: With no monolithic investor class, managers might instead go ask customers what they want, and do that instead. But if every company has the same basic set of owners, then managers can use a simpler generic model of what those owners want, light on idiosyncratic preferences and heavy on higher margins, and try to optimize for that. Meanwhile, "British Airways’ epic meltdown over a busy holiday weekend further fanned public outrage of an industry infamous for its focus on cost cuts over customer service." And: "Passive investing is worse than… the misuse of antibiotics," argues an active manager. Stock splits. On the other hand, the rise of scientism and institutional investors and treating companies as numbers seems to have led to the death of the stock split: So far this year, only two S&P 500 companies have split their stock. In all of last year, six companies in the large-company index did. That’s down sharply from 20 years ago, when 93 S&P 500 firms split their shares, a rate of close to two per week, according to Birinyi Associates. After decades of mostly remaining in a range between $25 and $50, the average stock in the S&P 500 is now trading above $98, the highest ever, according to Birinyi Associates. The basic rational discussion about stock splits goes like this: Our stock is at $200. Is that a problem? No that is a meaningless number. Okay should we split it in two so that each share is worth a more manageable $100? No come on that is dumb. I mean, it's fine! It's fine. Do the split, or don't, whatever. The price of one share of stock doesn't matter, and it is silly to spend much time thinking about optimizing it. But there's a historical mysticism about having the correct stock price to appeal to retail investors and signal that you are a normal company instead of a weird one. That mysticism is fading. Now the way to signal normalcy is with financial rationality, and there's no rational reason to care about stock splits. No-vote shares. Here is a speech urging the Securities and Exchange Committee and the U.S. stock exchanges to prevent companies from going public with non-voting stock, arguing that "the core concern here is corporate governance 101: Separation of ownership and control over time can lead to a lack of accountability, and accountability to owners is necessary for course corrections that are critical in our capitalist system." This is a popular view and fair enough. But the speech is by Ken Bertsch, the Executive Director of the Council of Institutional Investors, and he speaks on behalf of his members. Which is odd. Presumably institutional investors can read a prospectus and make an informed decision about whether or not to buy a company's stock. If they don't like non-voting stock -- if they think that "accountability to owners is necessary" -- then they can just not buy it. But that's not exactly what they want: They don't want to choose not to buy non-voting stock; they want someone else to prevent them from buying non-voting stock. They know that, if left with the choice, they'll keep buying non-voting stock, even though they think it is bad. They want a ban to protect them from themselves. You can guess one reason: As institutional investors, they benchmark themselves against indexes of public stocks, and if they refuse to buy some big stocks, they will have a harder time matching or outperforming the index. (This is even more true if some investors shun companies with no-vote stocks, giving those stocks a higher cost of capital and so higher expected returns -- as Cliff Asness argues about "sinful" stocks.) Bertsch's speech is directed at the SEC, but a lot of the action is at the index providers: "CII and a group of our members are approaching index providers to explore exclusion from core indexes, on a prospective basis, of share classes with no voting rights." If companies go public with non-voting shares, but those companies aren't included in the indexes, then for institutional investors' purposes it's almost like they aren't public at all. Almost, but not quite. Even excluded from the indexes, those non-voting stocks will still be a dangerous temptation to the institutional investors. One way to think about it is that the institutional investors want to own stock in, say, Snap Inc. They think, for whatever reason, that Snap is a good investment. But they want to own the stock in their preferred form -- with the usual voting rights. Snap's founders want to sell stock, but they want to sell it in their preferred form -- with no voting rights. This is the sort of debate that gets intermediated by the market, and it was, and Snap won. The market is clearly willing to give Snap the terms that it wants. But the institutional investors want the regulators to reverse the verdict of the market and give them the opportunity to invest in Snap on their preferred terms, not its. Maybe that will work? But then of course the next Snap could just stay private longer. Snap went public because it could get the terms it wanted -- because investors were happy to give it those terms. Or sad to give it those terms, I guess, but gave them anyway. Venezuela. A rough summary of this story is that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bought Venezuelan government bonds from Venezuela's government for 31 cents on the dollar, and people are angry about it because Goldman seems to be propping up Nicolás Maduro's government: Goldman's purchase of $2.8 billion in bonds, first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, comes as Mr. Maduro's detractors have recently pleaded with international financial institutions to avoid any transactions that might help a government accused of human-rights abuses. On Monday, they upped the ante, threatening that a successor government could forgo paying the debt. "It is apparent Goldman Sachs decided to make a quick buck off the suffering of the Venezuelan people," Julio Borges, head of Venezuela's opposition-controlled congress, said in a public letter to the New York bank's chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein. "I also intend to recommend to any future democratic government of Venezuela not to recognize or pay on these bonds." Part of this is the perennial tension in distressed investing. On the one hand, if you are buying bonds at 31 cents on the dollar, you really are trying to make a quick buck off someone's suffering. (If they weren't suffering, the bonds wouldn't be trading at 31 cents on the dollar.) On the other hand, if you're buying the bonds, you're betting on -- hoping for, perhaps even working for -- an improvement. "We recognize that the situation is complex and evolving and that Venezuela is in crisis," said Goldman. "We agree that life there has to get better, and we made the investment in part because we believe it will." (Disclosure: I used to work at Goldman.) But of course if the government you are financing is what's standing in the way of making things better, then buying bonds from that government is especially problematic. By the way, the story is not exactly about Goldman buying Venezuelan government bonds from the Venezuelan government. The buyer was Goldman Sachs Asset Management, so it's client money, not the bank's own money. The bonds were issued in 2014 by Petróleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company, not the government itself. The seller was Venezuela's central bank, not the government. And the sale wasn't direct: Goldman bought the bonds from a broker, Dinosaur Group, "and did not interact with the Venezuelan government." So it would be a bit awkward for a future government to repudiate the bonds: Which bonds? All bonds issued by PdVSA? All bonds issued by PdVSA and later held by the central bank? All PdVSA bonds held by the central bank and then sold to third parties? All PdVSA bonds held by the central bank and then sold to Goldman Sachs this week? If there were a single brand-new financing transaction with new bonds meant to prop up the regime, then a future government could identify and repudiate it. But a sale of already-existing bonds at market prices in market channels muddies the waters. One other oddity: What if Goldman had bought brand-new Venezuelan government bonds directly from the government at 31 cents on the dollar? Would those bonds have par claims in any future restructurings? Would they be treated as par bonds under credit-default swap contracts? Could a country in trouble dilute other creditors by issuing tons of new bonds at steep discounts to friendly creditors? People are worried about unicorns. Here is a proposed "Tradeable Automated Term Sheet" for private-company seed fundraising, which would "explicitly state that the investors' shares can't be subject to restrictions on transfer (with minor exceptions) after the earlier of five years or a $100 million valuation." Private markets are the new public markets, but in private markets even quite big companies with diversified institutional investors sometimes put transfer restrictions on their stocks. But people really want private markets to be the new public markets, complete with free transferability and exchange-like platforms to create liquidity, and so the norms are shifting. Work Stuff. Here is advice on how to make small talk from someone whose brain seems to work very differently from mine: Ms. Van Edwards recently asked a stranger she met on a business trip what he was working on that was exciting. The man replied that he hated his job and was going through a divorce. She salvaged the exchange by thanking him for being honest, empathizing and drawing him into brainstorming about what’s it’s like being stuck in a rut and how to escape it. Wow I feel like maybe he didn't want the exchange to be salvaged? I guess that is why I am not a widely cited small-talk guru. It just goes to show you that things could always be worse. Even if you hate your job and are going through a divorce, just think: At least I'm not stuck on a plane with a stranger who insists on brainstorming with me.

Mayo, 54, will join as a New York-based managing director, reporting to Todd Wickwire and Sam Pearlstein, co-heads of equity research, Wells Fargo said Monday. Mayo will oversee U.S. large-cap bank research, the bank said. “Mike’s stature in the industry is well-recognized,” Diane Schumaker-Krieg, global head of research for Wells Fargo’s investment bank, said in a news release. “We are thrilled to have such an influential voice in this critical sector join our growing platform.” Forewarned? Wells Fargo has agreed to hire Mayo's old team, and is "100% on board with how we have done the job in the past,” newly hired analyst Mike Mayo says. Bloomberg News Mayo has earned a reputation for being unafraid to challenge bank executives. In recent years, he’s criticized Citigroup and Bank of America for missed goals and uncertain targets that prevent investors from being able to hold management accountable. He’s been on the job market since February, when his employer, CLSA Ltd., shuttered its U.S. equity-research operations. Less than 24 hours after his dismissal, Mayo appeared at a JPMorgan Chase event, calling himself a “ free agent” as he questioned Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon about the bank’s brand. “You’re a brand, too — Mike Mayo,” Dimon replied. The banker went on to recall how he once ordered his staff at a JPMorgan predecessor to read a critical report Mayo wrote on their business, telling them “read his tome because he is right about every single thing in there.” Mayo is the author of “Exile on Wall Street: One Analyst’s Fight to Save the Big Banks from Themselves.” He’s also worked at UBS Group AG, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Credit Suisse Group and Deutsche Bank. He began his career as a Federal Reserve analyst in 1988. Mayo replaces Matt Burnell, an analyst who had been covering banks for Wells Fargo after the firm purchased his company, Wachovia, in the depths of the financial crisis. Burnell “has decided to pursue other opportunities outside the bank,” Jessica Ong, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, said in an email. In an interview, Mayo said he looked at about a dozen options and conducted extensive due diligence on Wells Fargo’s research offering before making his decision. The bank also has agreed to hire his team, which includes three other people, he said. “In the end it comes down to one word: impact,” Mayo said. “We think we can have a strong impact at Wells Fargo. They are 100% on board with how we have done the job in the past.” Article The mortgage search goes digital Search habits and online lenders are forcing loan officers to step up their digital game to compete.

With that, Zames, 46, joined the ranks of possible successors Dimon has outlasted, including Jes Staley, Bill Winters, Charles Scharf and Frank Bisignano, former top executives at JPMorgan who moved on to become CEOs at other banks and finance companies. Dimon, who’s 61 and has held the top job since 2005, has said he’d like to stay at New York-based JPMorgan for another five years or so - and he’s joked he’ll keep saying that until the day he leaves.

Ever since JPMorgan Chase & Co elevated Matt Zames to co-chief operating officer in 2012, the former hedge fund trader was viewed as a potential heir to Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. The speculation ended on Thursday, when Zames said he’ll leave the bank because he wants to run his own business. With that, Zames, 46, joined the ranks of possible successors Dimon has outlasted, including Jes Staley, Bill Winters, Charles Scharf and Frank Bisignano, former top executives at JPMorgan who moved on to become CEOs at other banks and finance companies. Dimon, who’s 61 and has held the top job since 2005, has said he’d like to stay at JPMorgan for another five years or so — and he’s joked he’ll keep saying that until the day he leaves. Dimon himself was pushed out at Citigroup two decades ago because then-CEO Sandy Weill wasn’t ready to let him take charge, Weill told the New York Times in 2010. So who’s next in line now that Zames is gone? Here are some candidates: Mary Callahan, Erdoes Erdoes, asset and wealth management CEO, has risen through the ranks since joining JPMorgan in 1996. Her division, which she’s run since 2009, earned a record $3.5 billion in pretax income last year, which grew at an annualised rate of 7% over five years. Gordon A, Smith Smith, consumer & community banking CEO, joined JPMorgan in 2007 and initially ran the co’s credit-card services business before being promoted in the same 2012 shakeup that elevated Zames. His division turned in $9.7 billion in 2016 profit. Daniel E, Pinto Pinto, corp & investment Bank CEO, advanced through the trading side of JPMorgan and is responsible for businesses that generate 35% of bank’s revenue. He was paid $19 million for 2016. Marianne, Lake As CFO, Lake is known to investors and analysts, speaking about the bank’s results on quarterly earnings calls.

The Dow briefly touched an intraday record high of 21,318.43. The Federal Reserve convened for its two-day meeting on Tuesday. Markets expect few surprises there. An interest rate hike in June has been widely expected since Fed commentary in recent weeks suggested there were more hawks than doves. Members have pointed to a tightening job market, the risk of being behind the curve on inflation, and a generally healthy economic recovery. The Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policy arm of the central bank, will make an announcement on interest rates on Wednesday, June 14. Wall Street is incredibly confident in a rate hike -- CME Group fed funds futures have priced in a more than 99% chance of a 25-basis-point increase. Should the Fed raise rates, it will be the second of three expected hikes this year. The Fed will also release updated economic growth and rate hike forecasts, while Fed Chair Janet Yellen will hold a press conference mid-afternoon Wednesday. The central bank could also outline how and when it will begin reducing its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.  "The U.S. economy can easily take this week's hike in its stride," said James Athey, senior investment Manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. ""The debate is really about what happens next. Inflation has softened a little lately and some are saying that the Fed should pause or cease this tightening cycle after this week as a result. That would be a mistake and the Fed should press on." Banks were outperforming markets on the prospect of an interest rate hike. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  (GS) led the Dow higher, while Citigroup Inc. (C) , Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , Bank of America (BAC) , and JPMorgan (JPM) sported healthy gains. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) increased 0.6%.  Citigroup and Wells Fargo are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells C or WFC? Learn more now. Benchmark indexes, the Nasdaq in particular, have been under pressure after the tech sector fell from recent gains and dragged overall markets down with it. The sudden selloff was partially tied to a note from Goldman Sachs that cautioned investors not to think of the sector as a safe haven. The Nasdaq fell 2.3% over the past two sessions.  The FAANG stocks --Facebook Inc. (FB) , Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Amazon Inc. (AMZN) , Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) (formerly Google) -- were among the hardest hit in recent days after significantly contributing to gains this year. Those stocks have accounted for two-fifths of the S&P 500's gains this year, said John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer. That's "reason enough we'd think for some investors to take a little money off the table in the tech space," he wrote in a note. FAANG stocks rebounded on Tuesday, driving gains across the tech space. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) climbed 0.65%.  Apple, Facebook, and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

A market correction will eventually come, but this selloff wasn't it, argued James "Rev Shark" Deporre over on our premium site for investors, Real Money.

Core producer prices, which excludes food and energy, declined by 0.1% last month. Prices over the last 12 months rose 2.4%, or 2.1% when excluding food and energy.  Crude oil production among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose in May, the oil cartel said Tuesday. Overall OPEC production increased 1%, driven by increases in output in Libya, Nigeria and Iraq. The increases from Libya and Nigeria had been expected after disruptions to operations at their oilfields in recent months. Iraq, however, was a surprise. The country increased production by around 44,000 barrels to more than 4.4 million barrels a day.  Saudi Arabia will cut its oil exports to the U.S. in a continued effort to reduce a global supply glut cramping prices, The Wall Street Journal reported. State-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. will reduce U.S. exports to about 1 million bpd in June, then 850,000 bpd in July. That's the lowest level since 1988, according to EIA data.  West Texas Intermediate crude added 0.6% to $46.35 a barrel on Tuesday.  Cheesecake Factory Inc. (CAKE) fell almost 10% after lowering its second-quarter forecasts. The restaurant chain anticipates same-restaurant sales will decline by roughly 1% over its second quarter, down from previous guidance for a 1% to 2% rise. CEO David Overton said the company has experienced "volatility in the week-to-week sales trends, indicative of uncertainty on the part of many consumers" and "pockets of softness as we moved through the quarter."  Sears Holding Corp. (SHLD)  fell 2% after announcing plans to cut 400 jobs. The strategic restructuring plans are designed to reduce annual costs by $1.25 billion.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) officially closed its deal to acquire Yahoo! Inc.'s (YHOO) core Internet assets on Tuesday. The $4.48 billion sees Yahoo! absorbed with Verizon's AOL to form a new media entity, Oath. Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer has resigned from her position.  Foot Locker Inc. (FL) moved higher even after a downgrade from Argus. Analyst John Staszak reduced his rating to hold from buy and said it would be "difficult" for the retailer to achieve mid-single-digit comparables growth in the second half of fiscal 2018. Staszak said Foot Locker has a "heavy reliance" on Nike products, the sales of which had recently softened.  Visit here for the latest business headlines.

 Here are the top 100 companies' revenue and profit visualized Jeff Desjardins, Visual Capitalist Jun. 13, 2017, 7:33 PM 3,079 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook Getty Images/Andrew Burton Just over a month ago, we published a very tidy data visualization that summed up the top 50 companies in the world by revenue, based on data from Forbes. But, just looking at revenue numbers doesn’t give a full picture on how these companies compare – and many investors care much more about a different performance metric: profit. Thankfully, today’s data visualization from Ishtyaq Habib shows the top 100 biggest companies by market value, but uses circles to represent both the revenue and profit for each company. There’s also an interactive version of the same chart here as well, which highlights the specific numbers for each company highlighted. APPLE = A MONEY-MAKING MACHINE The first noticeable difference in this version? It’s that Apple is unparalleled in its ability to make money. In fact, Apple’s 2016 profit of $45 billion is far bigger than any other company, including Berkshire Hathaway ($24 billion), JPMorgan Chase ($24 billion), Wells Fargo ($22 billion), Alphabet ($19 billion), Samsung ($19 billion), Toyota ($17 billion), Johnson & Johnson ($16 billion), or Walmart ($14 billion). The only companies that can compare with Apple were Chinese banks like ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China, or China Construction Bank, but in many ways these state-owned enterprises are on an entirely different playing field, anyways. Also impressive: Apple’s profits are bigger than the revenues of massive companies like Coca-Cola ($41.5 billion) or Facebook ($27.6 billion). MARGINS, SCHMARGINS Unfortunately, not every company can make a 21% profit margin on $217 billion of revenue like Apple. Other organizations need to rely on razor-thin margins and volume to make things work. Walmart only brought in $14 billion of profit off of a whopping $485 billion of revenue – a margin of just 2.8%. Meanwhile, fast-growing Amazon was in a similar boat with margins of 1.7%, largely provided by its wildly successful AWS service. Lastly, it is also worth noting that some on the list did not make a margin at all. These are mostly companies that are suffering from the challenges of down cycles in natural resources. Chevron and mining giant Glencore, for example, were two of the Top 100 Companies that both lost money in 2016, while BP essentially broke even.

Marquez-Greene criticized NBC host Megyn Kelly for interviewing Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has said that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax. #ShameonNBC trended as people urged the network to cancel the upcoming segment, and JPMorgan Chase pulled some ads. Here’s the start of Marquez-Greene’s tweets: You do not "shine a light" on someone with such dangerous ideals and ideas.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Megyn Kelly is defending her NBC interview with Sandy Hook shooting denier Alex Jones, arguing it's important to show why the controversial Infowars founder is respected by many – including President Donald Trump. Pressure is building on NBC to pull the "Sunday Night" interview; relatives of those who died in Feb. 14, 2012, slaughter have objected, a gun control nonprofit, Sandy Hook Promise, canceled its invite to Kelly to host a fundraiser, and JPMorgan Chase reportedly plans to pull local ads on NBC News until after the interview airs. "I find Alex Jones's suggestion that Sandy Hook was 'a hoax' as personally revolting as every other rational person does," Kelly, a former Fox News Channel host said in a statement, Fox analyst Howard Kurtz reported. "It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: how does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions?" "President Trump, by praising and citing him, appearing on his show, and giving him White House press credentials, has helped elevate Jones, to the alarm of many," she said. "Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light – as journalists are supposed to do – on this influential figure, and yes – to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity." Kelly added that she was "disappointed" to be dropped from the fundraiser but that "I understand and respect the decision of the event organizers." In a preview clip of the Jones interview, the controversial radio host called the horrific shooting at the Newton, Conn., elementary school "complex," Kurtz reported. "I have had debates where, we devil's advocates have said the whole story is true, and then I have had debates where I have said, that none of it is true," he said. Kelly responded: "When you say parents faked their children's death, people get very angry." "Well I know, but they don't get angry about the half million dead Iraqis from the sanctions, or they don't get angry about…" Kelly interrupted to call that "a dodge," Kurtz reported. Jones replied he'd "looked at all the angles of Newtown, and I made my statements long before the media even picked up on it." Kurtz reported that after the interview, Jones slammed Kelly as "not feminine" and "cold, robotic, dead." He argues NBC should cancel the segment because it is a "rigged" report that misrepresents his views. "They're scared of what we're doing," he said, Kurtz reported. Reuters contributed to this report.

The structural vulnerability could allow for the easy spread of an initial attack that ripples into other sectors such as energy or water systems, says the bank's June financial review. The report urges banks to co-operate on countering the threats that are not going away any time soon. The former head of the U.S. National Security Agency made the same recommendation earlier this month, saying private-sector companies — including banks — have to do a better job of sharing data on attempted hacks in real time to counter the ongoing challenge. Retired Gen. Keith Alexander told a defence industry trade show that banks have valuable metadata on attempted hacks embedded in the logs of their firewalls and sharing that information can allow them to more successfully fend them off. He suggested the 2014 cyberattack on the U.S. bank JPMorgan Chase that affected an estimated 80 million accounts could have been prevented if banks had shared information. Canada's central bank expressed a similar concern in its most recent update. "The interconnectedness of the financial system could lead to rapid transmission of stress from a cyberattack," the report said. "This is a structural vulnerability that is unlikely to go away. And because of the interconnections in the system, the public sector has a role in co-ordinating cyber defences." While those same connected platforms allow the financial services sector to deliver efficient service, they also leave several sectors of the economy vulnerable to attack, said the bank's report. "Contagion could occur through financial interconnections or common critical infrastructures in non-financial sectors, such as telecommunications, energy and utilities," it said. "A prolonged interruption in financial services, compromised data integrity or a loss of confidence could harm the financial system with knock-on effects to the real economy." There were eight high-profile cyberattacks on banks in 2016, the report said, including an $81-million heist at the Bangladesh Bank. The report urges private-sector players to work together because protecting against an attack "has benefits beyond an individual institution and can be considered a public good." The Canadian Bankers Association recently urged bank customers to avoid opening suspicious emails and exposing themselves to ransomware, malicious software that locks a user out of their data and demands a ransom for its release. "Canadian banks are leaders in cybersecurity and continue to invest in cybersecurity infrastructure to protect the financial system and the personal information of their customers from cyber threats," the association said in a May 31 statement. However, the federal government has expressed concerns. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is mindful of cybersecurity in the financial sector, making a point of meeting on the issue in London last year with former Canadian colleague Mark Carney, now governor of the Bank of England. "Although banks tend to be more resourced and mature than other sectors in dealing with cyber threats, there are still a number of recognized gaps throughout the sector," said an internal Public Safety note to prepare Goodale for the meeting. It pointed out that the theft from Bangladesh's central bank was carried out by breaching the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or SWIFT, used to authorize payments between accounts. "This is a clear example of where the system was vulnerable," said the briefing note, obtained through the Access to Information Act.

Megyn Kelly got roasted on social media this week for giving airtime to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, a radio shock-jock who has suggested the 2012 Newtown, Conn. massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax. JP Morgan Chase pulled digital advertisements from Kelly’s news show, which airs on Sunday on NBC. In a statement, Kelly said she found Jones’s suggestion that Sandy Hook was a hoax “personally revolting” and said Jones was of public interest given his friendship with President Trump. (J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, -0.60%  declined to comment; NBC CMCSA, +0.85%  did not return request for comment.) On Sunday, Delta Air Lines and Bank of America dropped their sponsorships of New York’s Public Theater over a production of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” that depicts the title character, who resembles Trump, assassinated. The play itself is a cautionary tale about the consequences of political violence. “Their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste,” Delta said. Similarly, Bank of America BAC, -0.93%  also withdrew funding for the production, saying the production was designed to “provoke and offend.” And last month, CNN said it would not renew its contract with comedienne Kathy Griffin, who posed for a photograph with what appeared to be a severed head of President Donald Trump. A rake of venues canceled upcoming gigs and Griffin lost a contract with SquattyPotty bathroom products. Griffin apologized after a backlash that included other comedians and even friends like CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who regularly co-hosted a New Year’s Eve show from Times Square with Griffin. (In fact, Alec Baldwin was among the few boldfaced names who publicly supported Griffin.) As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why? https://t.co/luwyCwP7Ti— Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017 In this highly politicized environment where stories go global on social media in a matter of hours or even minutes, advertisers are taking a stand. “Corporate America has been a little on edge since the election,” says Marcus Messner, social media professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. “A tweet from the president can impact market prices in the short term. “That’s why we have these sensitivities. There’s a lot of pressure from the far right media outlets and the far left, so it’s almost like a no-win situation. The safest thing for them is to retreat to the sidelines.” Some companies have successfully appealed to one social demographic, but banks, airlines and media companies have a more difficult challenge, says Aram Sinnreich, an associate professor at American University’s School of Communication in Washington, D.C. “It’s coming to a head now that our nation’s divided halves are barely on speaking terms. Brands that have historically stayed out of the political fray, aiming for that increasingly elusive ‘mass’ in the middle, are finding it more and more difficult to discover ’safe’ celebrities, events and institutions to partner with.” Don’t miss: When Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg sound the same dire warning about jobs, it’s time to listen There is less room in today’s highly divisive political environment for balanced discussion between those at opposite ends of the political spectrum, studies suggest. There is little overlap in the news sources that people on social networks turn to and trust, according to the Pew Research Center, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, D.C. People are more likely to interact with like-minded individuals. Roughly half of Facebook FB, -0.30%  users (53%) and less than half (39%) of Twitter TWTR, +0.42%  users say that there is a mix of political views among the people in their networks. Political liberals who use social media are more likely than conservatives to change their settings to see less of someone (41% versus 26%) as well as to block or unfriend someone (35% versus 26%) because of something related to politics, Pew found. In addition, social media users under the age of 50 are more likely to take these steps than older users. So the two sides rarely meet, and when they do, it’s often not pretty. When asked about the political interactions they see on social media, many politically engaged users are dismayed at the negativity and tone of political discourse. As for “Julius Caesar,” Delta and Bank of America are in the business of promoting good corporate citizenship rather than freedom of expression, says Jane Kirtley, professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota Law School. (Bank of America said it was not made aware of the nature of this production in advance and was taken by surprise.) Ideally, she says, companies should give artists and cultural institutions money “and let them do what they say they’re going to do and not pull the rug out from under them in the middle of a performance.” More from MarketWatch More Coverage Billionaire predicts blue chips to double by 2030 ... and Tesla shares to do even better This Iranian refugee took an NFL player on a 500-mile Uber ride Stay away from bitcoin — it’s complete garbage Quote References JPM -0.52 -0.60% CMCSA +0.35 +0.85% BAC -0.22 -0.93% FB -0.45 -0.30% TWTR +0.07 +0.42% Show all references Most Popular Stay away from bitcoin — it’s complete garbage The smart money is refusing to buy big tech stocks now Bitcoin is suddenly on pace to have its worst week since 2015 Trump won’t be removed from office — and that’s why the Trump Trade is over How Asia Tech Titans Are Gaining Ground on U.S. Rivals Mortgage Rates Powered by This advertisement is provided by Bankrate, which compiles rate data from more than 4,800 financial institutions.

Megyn Kelly got roasted on social media this week for giving airtime to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, a radio shock-jock who has suggested the 2012 Newtown, Conn. massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax. JP Morgan Chase pulled digital advertisements from Kelly’s news show, which airs on Sunday on NBC. In a statement, Kelly said she found Jones’s suggestion that Sandy Hook was a hoax “personally revolting” and said Jones was of public interest given his friendship with President Trump. (J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, -0.60%  declined to comment; NBC CMCSA, +0.85%  did not return request for comment.) On Sunday, Delta Air Lines and Bank of America dropped their sponsorships of New York’s Public Theater over a production of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” that depicts the title character, who resembles Trump, assassinated. The play itself is a cautionary tale about the consequences of political violence. “Their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste,” Delta said. Similarly, Bank of America BAC, -0.93%  also withdrew funding for the production, saying the production was designed to “provoke and offend.” And last month, CNN said it would not renew its contract with comedienne Kathy Griffin, who posed for a photograph with what appeared to be a severed head of President Donald Trump. A rake of venues canceled upcoming gigs and Griffin lost a contract with SquattyPotty bathroom products. Griffin apologized after a backlash that included other comedians and even friends like CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who regularly co-hosted a New Year’s Eve show from Times Square with Griffin. (In fact, Alec Baldwin was among the few boldfaced names who publicly supported Griffin.) As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegr By Bernie Woodall (Reuters) - NBC's Megyn Kelly on Tuesday defended her interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, saying it was important to show why a person who calls the Sandy Hook school massacre a hoax is respected by many Americans, including President Donald Trump. The decision to interview Jones, whose ideas are widely discredited, angered some relatives of those who died in 2012 when a 20-year-old man fatally shot 20 first-graders and six educators at the elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. It prompted a gun control nonprofit linked to some of the victims' families to cancel its invitation for Kelly to host a fundraising gala on Wednesday in Washington. And JPMorgan Chase will pull its local advertisements on NBC News programming until after the interview airs on Sunday, according to the Wall Street Journal. Kelly said in a statement she understood and respected the concerns and she found Jones' suggestion that Sandy Hook was a hoax "personally revolting" as does "every other rational person." But she said it left many wondering how Jones and his "outrageous conspiracy theories" have the respect of millions including Trump, who she said has elevated Jones by praising him and appearing on his show. "Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light - as journalists are supposed to do - on this influential figure, and yes - to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity," Kelly said. The NBC television network is part of NBC Universal, which is owned by Comcast Corp. Jones founded the ultra conservative website Infowars. In a statement on Sunday rescinding Kelly's invite to host their gala, the Sandy Hook Promise nonprofit said it hoped she and NBC would reconsider and not broadcast the interview. A JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report. But a senior bank executive spoke out on Twitter. "As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why?" Kristin Lemkau, chief marketing officer at JPMorgan Chase, tweeted on Monday. Her reference to Aurora regarded the murder of a dozen people by a gunman who opened fire inside a packed movie theater in the Denver suburb in 2012.

Megyn Kelly got roasted on social media this week for giving airtime to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, a radio shock-jock who has suggested the 2012 Newtown, Conn. massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax. JP Morgan Chase pulled digital advertisements from Kelly’s news show, which airs on Sunday on NBC. In a statement, Kelly said she found Jones’s suggestion that Sandy Hook was a hoax “personally revolting” and said Jones was of public interest given his friendship with President Trump. (J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, -0.60%  declined to comment; NBC CMCSA, +0.85%  did not return request for comment.) On Sunday, Delta Air Lines and Bank of America dropped their sponsorships of New York’s Public Theater over a production of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” that depicts the title character, who resembles Trump, assassinated. The play itself is a cautionary tale about the consequences of political violence. “Their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste,” Delta said. Similarly, Bank of America BAC, -0.93%  also withdrew funding for the production, saying the production was designed to “provoke and offend.” And last month, CNN said it would not renew its contract with comedienne Kathy Griffin, who posed for a photograph with what appeared to be a severed head of President Donald Trump. A rake of venues canceled upcoming gigs and Griffin lost a contract with SquattyPotty bathroom products. Griffin apologized after a backlash that included other comedians and even friends like CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who regularly co-hosted a New Year’s Eve show from Times Square with Griffin. (In fact, Alec Baldwin was among the few boldfaced names who publicly supported Griffin.) As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why? https://t.co/luwyCwP7Ti— Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017 In this highly politicized environment where stories go global on social media in a matter of hours or even minutes, advertisers are taking a stand. “Corporate America has been a little on edge since the election,” says Marcus Messner, social media professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. “A tweet from the president can impact market prices in the short term. “That’s why we have these sensitivities. There’s a lot of pressure from the far right media outlets and the far left, so it’s almost like a no-win situation. The safest thing for them is to retreat to the sidelines.” Some companies have successfully appealed to one social demographic, but banks, airlines and media companies have a more difficult challenge, says Aram Sinnreich, an associate professor at American University’s School of Communication in Washington, D.C. “It’s coming to a head now that our nation’s divided halves are barely on speaking terms. Brands that have historically stayed out of the political fray, aiming for that increasingly elusive ‘mass’ in the middle, are finding it more and more difficult to discover ’safe’ celebrities, events and institutions to partner with.” Don’t miss: When Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg sound the same dire warning about jobs, it’s time to listen There is less room in today’s highly divisive political environment for balanced discussion between those at opposite ends of the political spectrum, studies suggest. There is little overlap in the news sources that people on social networks turn to and trust, according to the Pew Research Center, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, D.C. People are more likely to interact with like-minded individuals. Roughly half of Facebook FB, -0.30%  users (53%) and less than half (39%) of Twitter TWTR, +0.42%  users say that there is a mix of political views among the people in their networks. Political liberals who use social media are more likely than conservatives to change their settings to see less of someone (41% versus 26%) as well as to block or unfriend someone (35% versus 26%) because of something related to politics, Pew found. In addition, social media users under the age of 50 are more likely to take these steps than older users. So the two sides rarely meet, and when they do, it’s often not pretty. When asked about the political interactions they see on social media, many politically engaged users are dismayed at the negativity and tone of political discourse. As for “Julius Caesar,” Delta and Bank of America are in the business of promoting good corporate citizenship rather than freedom of expression, says Jane Kirtley, professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota Law School. (Bank of America said it was not made aware of the nature of this production in advance and was taken by surprise.) Ideally, she says, companies should give artists and cultural institutions money “and let them do what they say they’re going to do and not pull the rug out from under them in the middle of a performance.” More from MarketWatch More Coverage How cryptocurrency ethereum looks set to overtake bitcoin — in one chart The smart money is refusing to buy big tech stocks now Trump won’t be removed from office — and that’s why the Trump Trade is over Quote References JPM -0.52 -0.60% CMCSA +0.35 +0.85% BAC -0.22 -0.93% FB -0.45 -0.30% TWTR +0.07 +0.42% Show all references Most Popular Stay away from bitcoin — it’s complete garbage The smart money is refusing to buy big tech stocks now Bitcoin is suddenly on pace to have its worst week since 2015 Trump won’t be removed from office — and that’s why the Trump Trade is over How Asia Tech Titans Are Gaining Ground on U.S. Rivals Mortgage Rates Powered by This advertisement is provided by Bankrate, which compiles rate data from more than 4,800 financial institutions.

Political liberals who use social media are more likely than conservatives to change their settings to see less of someone (41% versus 26%) as well as to block or unfriend someone (35% versus 26%) because of something related to politics, Pew found. In addition, social media users under the age of 50 are more likely to take these steps than older users. So the two sides rarely meet, and when they do, it’s often not pretty. When asked about the political interactions they see on social media, many politically engaged users are dismayed at the negativity and tone of political discourse. As for “Julius Caesar,” Delta and Bank of America are in the business of promoting good corporate citizenship rather than freedom of expression, says Jane Kirtley, professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota Law School. (Bank of America said it was not made aware of the nature of this production in advance and was taken by surprise.) Ideally, she says, companies should give artists and cultural institutions money “and let them do what they say they’re going to do and not pull the rug out from under them in the middle of a performance.” More from MarketWatch More Coverage Costco’s online prices are lower than Amazon’s, study finds Sex in an airplane seat?

Brent Lewin/Bloomberg As if there weren’t enough for stock investors to worry about given the recent wobble in technology shares and whether that represents something more ominous for the equity markets as a whole, a new report was published that only added to the angst. So even though investors enjoyed a reprieve from the sell-off of the last few days, with the S&P 500 rising to a new closing high, they still couldn’t stop talking about a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report that found a record 44 percent of fund managers polled in a monthly survey see equities as overvalued, up from 37 percent in May. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was named the most crowded trade, with 57 percent of investors saying internet stocks are expensive and 18 percent calling them “bubble-like,” according to Bloomberg News’s Julie Verhage. More than 200 panelists with a combined $596 billion under management participated in the survey, which was conducted between June 2 and June 8, right before the tech rout on June 9 where the Nasdaq tumbled almost 2 percent as tech giants such as Apple, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet Inc. led the way. “In March 2000 every waking investing individual knew the stock market was wildly overvalued, but that didn’t stop what was to follow,” said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. “In the ninth year of a bull market, things are expensive, that’s what just happens in the late stages.” FIXED-INCOME IS NO BARGAIN, EITHER Bond investors are turning more cautious heading into Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting, where policy makers are widely seen raising interest rates for the third time since December. A weekly client sentiment index from JPMorgan Chase, which happens to be the world’s biggest bond underwriter, fell to its lowest level since the start of the year. Those respondents who described themselves as being long bonds dropped to the lowest since 2015. Binky Chadha, the chief global strategist at Deutsche Bank’s U.S. securities unit, is part of a group of die-hard bond bears who say Treasuries have become unhinged from reality and yields have nowhere to go but up, according to Bloomberg News’s Liz Capo McCormick. He points to all the obvious signs investors seem to be ignoring: higher benchmark interest rates, wage pressures that will lead to faster inflation, worsening budget deficits that will result in more debt issuance. FINANCIAL CHIEFS LOOKING LESS OPTIMISTIC That didn’t last long. U.S. chief financial officers are coming to grips with the reality of politics in the nation’s capital, according to Bloomberg News’s Vince Golle. The share of CFOs who are more optimistic about the economy is the lowest since before the presidential election, and more are less upbeat, results of a second-quarter survey by Duke University/CFO Magazine showed Tuesday. A jump in sentiment about near-term fixes to tax and health-care policy has given way to increased doubt as Congress stays fixated on investigating Russia’s role in the U.S. election. Separately, a monthly survey by the National Federation of Independent Business showed that the percentage of respondents expecting a better economy has been trending lower in recent months, to 38 percent for May from 50 percent in December. The percentage forecasting higher sales has dropped to 22 percent from 31 percent in the same period. LOONIE TAKES FLIGHT Canada’s dollar has rapidly become the big story in the foreign-exchange market, sending the currency to its biggest four-day gain since March 2016. That’s because investors betting against the Canadian economy lost a key support Monday when the country’s central bank indicated it’s turned bullish enough to consider raising interest rates -- a surprise policy change that the Bank of Montreal called a “potential watershed,” according to Bloomberg News’s Theophilos Argitis and Maciej Onoszko. Governor Stephen Poloz added to the bullish tone in a CBC interview Tuesday by saying rates have been “extraordinarily low,” and that rate cuts “have done their job.” The comments are a rebuke to pessimists who say unprecedented household debt and record home prices will trigger a disorderly unwind of Canada’s housing markets, some of which may have entered into bubble territory. Speculators held a near-record bearish position on the Canadian dollar as of last week, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. OIL MARKET TURNS UPSIDE DOWN Can the oil market get any crazier? Crude tumbled in early trading on a report that at the same time as OPEC and its partners agreed last month on prolonging production cuts, the group’s output was climbing the most since November as members exempt from the deal restored lost supply. Oil then reversed and gained amid estimates that U.S. supplies declined. Recall that it was U.S. producers flooding the market that had caused a glut of oil and helped send prices below $50 a barrel. At about $46, oil is a long way from last month’s $52 peak, though investors are positioning themselves for slightly better news in Wednesday’s Energy Information Administration report, according to Bloomberg News’s Jessica Summers. “The market’s been leaning pretty hard bearish,” said Bill O’Grady, the chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management. "If last week turns out to be kind of a weird outlier, you don’t really want to be short going into this number. You’ve got enough Saudi support to prevent the market from really falling apart, but you just don’t have enough to really get you above $55.” TEA LEAVES It’s a foregone conclusion, or at least according to the action in the money markets, that the Fed will raise its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent from the current 0.75 percent to 1 percent. More important to markets is what the central bank says in the statement accompanying the rate hike and what Chair Janet Yellen says in her press conference. Many investors and strategists are looking for what they refer to as a “dovish hike,” which means the Fed raises rates but also sounds a cautious tone given the recent slowdown in the economy and inflation. Although the retirement of dovish Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo means the median expectation in the central bank’s so-called dot plot will move higher, Bank of America economists say that will likely be offset by other officials lowering the overall trajectory slightly. Investors will also be listening for clues about how the Fed is thinking about unwinding its $4.5 billion balance sheet, a process many expect to start later this year.

An anti-gun violence organization founded by parents of children killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School has dumped Kelly as host of an event in Washington this week because of her planned interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Kelly said Tuesday, June 13, 2017, that she understands and respects the decision but is disappointed she won't be there. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........NEW YORK — An anti-gun violence organization founded by parents of children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School has dumped Megyn Kelly as host of an event in Washington this week because of her plans to broadcast an interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Kelly said Tuesday that she understands and respects the decision by Sandy Hook Promise to disinvite her as host of its Wednesday gala, but is disappointed. She said reporting on Jones’ falsehoods is what journalists are supposed to do. NBC is taking considerable heat on social media for its Father’s Day broadcast of Kelly’s interview with “Infowars” host Alex Jones, who has questioned whether the killing of 26 people in 2012 at the school in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax. The firm JPMorgan Chase has asked that its advertisement not run on the broadcast. “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” said Nicole Hockley, co-founder and managing director. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” Hockley, whose 6-year-old son Dylan was killed at Sandy Hook, founded the group with Mark Barden, who lost his 7-year-old son Daniel. Kelly said that she found Jones’ suggestion that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax “as personally revolting as every other rational person does. “It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: How does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions?” Advertisement Continue reading Trump, she said, has helped elevate Jones with his attention and letting “Infowars” in some White House events, she said. “Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light, as journalists are supposed to do, on this influential figure and, yes, to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity,” she said. The interview is the planned centerpiece of her third broadcast of the newsmagazine “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly.” The interview has put Kelly, who jumped to NBC from Fox News Channel earlier this year, squarely back in the headlines. She was one of Trump’s favorite targets during the presidential campaign because he was annoyed at tough questions she asked him at a Fox-broadcast debate. The New York Daily News put the story on its front page Tuesday, with the headline “Nutwork News.” Jones, for his part, has already denounced the interview as “fake news.” Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Nation Suggested Stories: Trump's criticism of TV host popular with GOP stirs backlash – Aug 10, 2015 How Alex Jones, conspiracy theorist extraordinaire, got Donald Trump's ear – Nov 17, 2016 Megyn Kelly leaving Fox News for NBC – Jan 3, 2017 Megyn Kelly leaving Fox News, will host 2 shows on NBC – Jan 3, 2017 Advertisement Load comments Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

BUSINESS COMPANY TOWN Advertisers are in the hot seat as activists both for and against Trump call for boycotts Activist groups have long employed boycotts to pressure major media outlets to conform to their political agendas, but what distinguishes the campaigns of 2017 is the speed at which they propagate across social media.

(June 14, 2017) (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR) David NgContact Reporter It has come to feel like a weekly, even daily occurrence. Following a media firestorm, usually related in some way to President Trump, advertisers face calls to sever ties with the company at the center of the outrage du jour, or else suffer a publicity crisis. In the days leading up to Megyn Kelly’s interview with Alex Jones, activists are demanding advertisers dump the NBC broadcast, claiming the show is giving a platform to the pro-Trump host of Infowars. The Web-based video and radio network has been criticized by many as a promoter of conspiracy theories, including repeatedly suggesting the shooting that killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 was a hoax. Earlier this week, Bank of America and Delta Air Lines dropped their sponsorships of the Public Theater’s staging of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” in New York, following an online furor over a scene in which the title character, dressed to resemble Trump, is stabbed to death. Last month, USAA, the insurance and consumer finance company, pulled its commercials from “Hannity” on Fox News, only to reverse its decision days later following intense blowback from its core customer base of military families and veterans, many of whom also are loyal viewers of pro-Trump commentator Sean Hannity. Advertisers find themselves in an increasingly precarious position as activists pressure them to pull ads from conservative media outlets that are sympathetic to the Trump administration, particularly Breitbart News and Fox News. That list is expanding, with NBC being the latest target as JP Morgan Chase pulled back its local TV advertising on Kelly’s show and other NBC News programming until after the Jones segment airs Sunday night. In a hyperpolarized media landscape, companies that previously saw themselves as apolitical now find that their ads and promotions generate instant political heat based simply on where they appear. “There is no easy decision here. The country is divided right down the middle,” said Chris Riccobono, founder of Untuckit, the New York-based men’s clothing retailer. The company was one of many to pull its commercials from Fox News’ “The O’Reilly Factor” following the sexual harassment scandal surrounding host Bill O’Reilly. But it has resisted pressure to remove its ads from “Hannity.” “We advertise across the full range of the political spectrum because, frankly, our customers fall along the full range of the political spectrum,” Riccobono said. “We are ardent supporters of free speech.” A representative for Viking Cruises, which runs commercials on “Hannity,” added: “The objective of Viking’s television advertising is to reach our customers on the channels that they are watching. … It does not mean that we advocate for any of the content portrayed on these news networks.” Advertiser boycott campaigns aren’t new. Activist groups have long employed the tactic to pressure major media outlets to conform to their political agendas. “I’ve had to deal with this since the day I walked in the door,” said Lisa Herdman, a senior vice president at RPA, a Santa Monica-based advertising and marketing agency. But what distinguishes the campaigns of recent months is the speed at which they propagate across Twitter and Facebook, fueled by partisan passions about Trump. Jennifer S. Altman / For The Times Fox News host Sean Hannity has seen calls for advertisers to cut ties with his show. Fox News host Sean Hannity has seen calls for advertisers to cut ties with his show. (Jennifer S. Altman / For The Times) Some advertisers said they are in a reactive position because they rely on third-party ad exchange networks to place their content and aren’t always aware where their ads appear. The legal referral site Avvo told exchanges to remove its online ads from Breitbart in November after company leaders were alerted by activists, including the anonymous social media group Sleeping Giants, which has aggressively targeted the conservative news site. “I’m sure there are people who visit Breitbart who could benefit from services we provide,” said Josh King, chief legal officer at Avvo. “But it’s a site we’re not comfortable our brand being associated with.” He said Avvo concluded that Breitbart promotes racist and sexist views and traffics in fake news, but he didn’t cite specific articles. Breitbart, which declined to comment, has previously refused such claims. The site has published incendiary articles with provocative headlines like a recent series on terrorist attacks titled “Ramadan Rage” and a story on the European refugee crisis titled “Political Correctness Protects Muslim Rape Culture.” Stephen Bannon, Breitbart’s former executive chairman, serves as chief strategist to Trump. Avvo, which is based in Seattle, noted that the political beliefs of its employees played a role in its decision. “Our employees are pretty progressive,” King said. Advertisers often will take cues from the political leanings of their own staff when weighing whether to participate in a boycott, said Brayden King, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. “These decisions are made by real people, with ideological points of view,” he said. “Companies that have more liberal executives tend to support more liberal causes.” There is also a brand safety motivation, he said. “When you see advertisers pull their ads from shows, it reflects their need to avoid controversies. They don’t want to be associated with a political figure or personality who is extreme or contentious at the moment.” USAA, which declined to be interviewed, said in a statement that “the lines between news and editorial are increasingly blurred.” The San Antonio company said it is reviewing its advertising policy. The company is one of many to be pressured by Media Matters for America, a liberal activist group that has long targeted Fox News. The nonprofit organization, which was a key player in the firing of O’Reilly and the effort to unseat Hannity, noted that advertiser boycott campaigns have devolved into wars of attrition between opposing sides. “At some point, you make it so that no one can sponsor anything,” said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters. “A lot of campaigns are lose-lose for everyone.” But he said contacting advertisers still can be an effective tool for activists when other means have been exhausted, such as putting pressure on the parent company of a media outlet. Companies that have more liberal executives tend to support more liberal causes. — Brayden King, professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University Advertiser boycotts can have significant financial impact. The Gateway Pundit, a popular right-wing news site, said that ad exchanges began dropping it this year following pressure from activist groups. The site, which critics have blasted as racist and a purveyor of fake news, relies almost entirely on online ad revenue for income, according to founder Jim Hoft. He said the exchanges described the site as “undesirable.” “I may have a different view on immigration, but that doesn't make me a racist,” he said. Breitbart has seen exchanges including AppNexus cut ties, but the financial impact on the privately held, L.A.-based outlet remains unclear. A recent study from MediaRadar, a New York ad sales tracker, said Breitbart has seen a nearly 90% drop in ads in recent months. But the firm said the study doesn’t count sponsored content that also generates revenue for Breitbart. Advertising platforms like Taboola currently partner with Breitbart to display sponsored content on its site. Taboola didn’t respond to a request for comment, but CEO Adam Singolda wrote in a company blog post shortly after the presidential election that “it is important to accept and include all opinions on the web.” Conservative activists have just started getting in the ad boycott game, with groups like the Media Equality Project calling for advertisers to yank their commercials from CNN and MSNBC. But their resources are small compared to groups on the left. They were part of a growing army of online conservative agitators who recently contacted CNN’s advertisers in an effort to target Kathy Griffin and Reza Aslan, both of whom were subsequently fired by the cable news network. “You can organize these things quickly and efficiently now,” said Brian Maloney, a co-founder of Media Equality. “Companies freak out pretty quickly.” CAPTION Justin Chang reviews 'Wonder Woman', directed by Patty Jenkins, starring Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Connie Nielsen, Elena Anaya, Lucy Davis, and Ewen Bremner.

(A version of this column originally appeared on Poynter.org.) by James Warren, Chief Media Writer, Poynter.orgJune 13, 2017 9:30 am Email Facebook Twitter Greg Gianforte won election, now avoids a yellow jump suit. By Janie Osborne/Getty Images. So Greg Gianforte, Montana's congressman-elect cum thug, "pleaded guilty Monday to a charge of misdemeanor assault after body-slamming a reporter from The Guardian on the eve of Gianforte's election to the U.S. House" and got a six-month deferred sentence and no jail time. Lucky guy. If only he'd inhaled nail polish remover on a street corner in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as opposed to hurling a guy to the ground in Bozeman, Montana! He'd be in bigger trouble than merely bashing bespectacled Ben Jacobs. For starters, "According to Whitney Bermes, a reporter for the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, the judge initially gave Gianforte four days in jail, where under the terms of a jail work program he would be able to spend two of those days working." (Montana Public Radio) But then: "After consulting with prosecution and defense lawyers, the judge changed the initial sentence minutes later, Bermes reported: 'NO jail time for Gianforte. But has to do 40 hours of community service, 20 hours anger management.'" Well, my perusal of the vagaries of nearby Wyoming law came across this legal treatise that was urging a variety of reforms. Along the way, it informed: "Wyoming law criminalizes inhaling nail polish remover and deodorant. A Peeping Tom, if prosecuted, will be a felon. It is a misdemeanor offense to ski on a snow slope posted 'closed.'" "Charging a person a fee to use the toilet in Wyoming is a crime. If school administrators fail to conduct a fire drill once a month they are subject to a sentence in county jail for not less than three nor more than six months." Well, it's not way much better in Montana, where it's you can get five years in prison for guiding sheep onto a railroad track with intent to injure the train; get in trouble for having more than one alarm clock ring simultaneously; be arrested for throwing something across a street; or do time for operating a billiards hall where the pool tables aren't visible from the street. (Only in Your State) Poor Jacobs. He'd been better off if Gianforte had led him to a hidden pool table in a billiards hall, then thrown him to the ground. Then the congressman-elect might have done some time. J.P Morgan Chase pulls ads J.P. Morgan Chase is apparently not happy with an upcoming Megyn Kelly interview with right-wing provocateur Alex Jones for her new NBC News show. Her first effort, an interview with Vladimir Putin, was not a creative success but got lots of attention, as would this for sure. (The Wall Street Journal) The financial firm should not be associated with the term "moral indignation" but is yanking NBC News ads until after the show airs Sunday. NBC defends the news value of the show in what's a smidgen short of a surprise. (CNN) Facebook to hawk print subs "Facebook Inc. may soon help its users do something unfamiliar on the platform: pay for news." (The Wall Street Journal) "I think this is like a chicken soup thing," Alan Mutter, a newspaper industry analyst and journalism teacher at the University of California, told Poynter about the deal Monday. "It couldn't hurt, but it's not going to be a transformational business model for publishers to sell subscriptions through Facebook." Heart-breaking Detroit Free-Press columnist Mitch Albom and wife just endured one of life's seemingly unbearable losses: the death of a child whom they adopted from a Haitian orphanage while knowing she had an incurable cancer. That razor-thin line between the greatest joy and heartbreak are found in this epic personal saga of a childless couple that's invested great energy and passion in Haiti — and a wonderful 7-year-old girl whom they brought back home. If you read one story today, this is it. And make sure to hug your own kids, if they're around, or give them a call if they're not. Immelt's ignominy General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt got rich through poor performance, a point noted as his retirement was disclosed. In particular, there was the godawful state of the company's stock during his tenure, all the more reason folks at NBC and MSNBC should knock on wood that Comcast bought them from GE. All in the family First, PBS host Judy Woodruff got Trump chum Chris Ruddy to say that, yes, Trump has mulled canning special counsel Robert Mueller. Then, her spouse Al Hunt columnized on the revelation, and its obvious Watergate-era resonance, for Bloomberg. Art and politics The Tony Awards did not allude to the controversy over a new New York production of Julius Caesar inspired by Trump. But the hubbub, and a smart look at clashing artistic critiques, are found in a New York Times opus that notes: "But the production is also explicit and graphic, featuring a blond, Trump-like Caesar in a red tie, whose bloody stabbing is seen as offensive and inappropriate to some who have seen it. They, along with Breitbart News and Fox News, have driven a campaign on social media against the Public that has prompted two corporate sponsors — Delta Air Lines and Bank of America — to withdraw their support of the production, and a third, American Express, to distance itself." Dwindling access to abortion HBO's Vice News Tonight did a solid job last night on how only a single abortion clinic remains in the states of Missouri, Kentucky, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, West Virginia and Mississippi. And it previewed today's Democratic gubernatorial primaries in Virginia, with the question whether mainstream candidates will be upended by pro-Sanders forces on one side, pro-Trump ones on the other. A headline of the day "The latest trend I loathe in restaurants: No space between tables" (The Washington Post) Earth to Jeff Sessions Approving the proposed sale of the money-losing Chicago Sun-Times to Tronc, owner the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, shouldn't be hard, especially given pre-existing Sun-Times/Tribune dealings. But, as noted here yesterday, the Justice Department antitrust division wants more time to pursue a late offer from another group. On Monday Sun-Times Editor-Publisher Jim Kirk told staff: "We are working through the due diligence phase of the process with interested parties. That work will continue through this week. We have agreed with the Department of Justice that bids for the company would be due at the end of business on Monday, June 19." But perhaps Sessions can take time off from losing immigration appeals to fish or cut bait on this melancholy, even easier matter. Best video of the day It's got to be Danny DeVito demonstrating how he peels and eats a hard-boiled rough egg while saying his lines during the Broadway production of Arthur Miller's The Price. Lying about a liar No, that was a fake Time magazine cover making the rounds of the internet with a "Liar in Chief headline" over Trump's picture. Well, there's this unrelated good news for Time's parent: "Time Warner cable actually made itself less awful — now it’s called Spectrum, and customers suddenly love it. What happened?" (Bloomberg) Wagering on changing sports habits Tom Rogers, former boss of Tivo, now heads WinView, which is an app that would let you answer questions and compete for cash prizes as you watch live sports events. Such interactions, which are not called gambling, are well-known in Europe, with mobile devices synced to TVs and significant revenues generated by an advertising-backed business model. This is direct competition to sports gaming sites like DraftKings, has accumulated a lot of early investment and the support of Major League Baseball. Rogers explained all yesterday on CNBC before briefly interrupted by the live look-in at the start of Trump's cabinet meeting. Sports journalism at its finest (not) Amid the disclosure that Oregon State Beavers pitcher Luke Heimlich, considered the best pitcher on the best college team, sexually abused a young family member in Washington as a teenager, "some news outlets are trying to find appropriate ways to cover the story." (Oregonian) "Sports news website Deadspin has obtained an internal memo from the Pac-12 Networks instructing employees and on-air personalities not to discuss anything regarding Heimlich. The memo even goes as far as suggesting ways to avoid the discussion." "Under the header 'Your messaging and positioning:' the first line instructs reporters, 'Do not engage in the discussion.'" Kevin Spacey The New Yorker's Michael Schulman is funny on how Kevin Spacey, a last-minute pick to host the Tony Awards, ran amok creatively. "It was like being at a workshop of his multi-character solo show: there were uncomfortable jokes about being 'in the closet,' endless references to his movie credits, and even a Bobby Darin song to close out the evening. When the announcer introduced Jill Biden, to talk about a veterans’ initiative with the musical Bandstand, you may have been relieved to discover that it was actually her, not Spacey in a wig." The morning babble Fox's Trump & Friends (a better name) beat up on Obama-era Attorney General Loretta Lynch in its alternate universe (no initial mention of perhaps booting Robert Mueller), heralded Ivanka Trump heading to Wisconsin with weenie Speaker Paul Ryan on the topic of jobs, while wondering if Attorney General Jeff Sessions will invoke the Fifth Amendment during testimony today (we get exclusive post-Badger State interview with Ivanka tomorrow!). Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg mulled Democrats' working class challenges, while the show beat up on that Julius Caesar production. Amid a fair bit of unproductive cross talk among pundits, CNN's New Day did touch upon Mueller dismissal rumors before moving to Sessions in the Senate dock, with New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman suggesting little will surface about Sessions' contacts with the Russian ambassador. New pundit Chris Cillizza, whose energy can override his insight, contends that Sessions' loyalty to Trump will be manifested in what will not be "Comey II." MSNBC's Morning Joe devoted itself to the same themes as the others, notably Sessions, but did a drive-by of legislative substance, like a healthcare bill. It evinced a sense that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will strain to push forward a bill different than the House's version in coming weeks. Obama's big memoir With thanks to Publisher's Weekly: "Saying the finished work would become the 'definitive take' on his time in the White House, Barack Obama reportedly submitted a collection of pages from his presidential graphic novel, Barack Obama: Renegade, to publisher Image Comics on Thursday."

Analyst Natalia Corfield wrote in a client note that a still sluggish economy and weaker prospects for a proposed pension reform could delay efforts to bolster loan book quality. Lenders have wrestled with record provisions since Brazil slumped into a deep recession almost three years ago. Late last month, meatpacker JBS SA's controlling shareholder J&F Investimentos agreed to pay a record-setting 10.3 billion real ($3.2 billion) fine for its role in a corruption scandal that seemed to implicate Brazilian President Michel Temer. Shares of Brazil's largest banks have dropped an average of 13 percent since mid-May, when allegations first surfaced that Temer had endorsed the payment of hush money to silence a potential witness and took bribes from JBS. Temer has denied the allegations. Lenders could suffer from their exposure to other companies facing hefty fines as part of a fresh wave of expected plea bargains and leniency deals, some investors fear. "Despite the mitigating factors, we maintain our view that expected asset quality improvements have become less likely given the recent political crisis," New York-based Corfield said in the note. Banking sector officials, by contrast, have argued that the events leading to the J&F plea deal are unlikely to pose any serious risk for the nation's banking system. Some Brazilian banks have held preliminary consultations with prosecutors over how plea deals work, the online service of Valor Economico newspaper reported on Tuesday. The report did not disclose the names of the banks due to concerns about how investors would react to the news, ValorPRO said, citing a person familiar with the matter. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor-general's office declined to comment. A presidential decree announced last week would allow Brazil's central bank to strike plea-bargain agreements with lenders that admit breaching the law in exchange for softer fines or more lenient prison terms for their executives. An index grouping all financial shares in Sao Paulo's B3 exchange rose 0.4 percent in midafternoon Tuesday trading, reversing earlier losses. PROTEIN SECTOR Preferred shares of Banco Bradesco SA, the country's No. 3 listed bank, shed 0.3 percent, while those of Itau Unibanco Holding SA - the country's biggest lender by assets - added 0.9 percent. State-controlled Banco do Brasil SA rose 1.1 percent, while units of Banco Santander Brasil SA dropped 0.1 percent. The government may have to amend parts of the decree to include prosecutors in the structuring of plea deals along with the central bank and the securities industry watchdog, Valor said. According to Corfield, one aspect of concern is the banking industry's exposure to meatpackers including JBS. Overall, JBS and J&F appear to pose the largest risk to Brazil's banking system, the note said. Together they account for about two-thirds of estimated bank loans to the protein sector. JPMorgan estimates J&F's total bank debt at 33.6 billion reais, of which 21.1 billion reais mature within the next 12 months. Most of that comes from JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, the note said. "Despite this sizeable amount, an important mitigating factor is the composition of the JBS's short-term debt, which is largely comprised of trade finance lines," Corfield wrote in the note. J&F did not comment.

One push and the car’s wheels transfer energy to its flywheel, which, spinning continuously, powers the car for a greater distance than what one might expect. Setting the flywheel into motion converts a finite boost of energy into lasting momentum. It’s fitting that revitalization efforts in Detroit—the Motor City—are testing the potential of this concept. Author Amy Liu Vice President and Director - Metropolitan Policy Program Twitter amy_liuw Some of Detroit’s leaders have described the unprecedented series of reforms and investments in the city following the Great Recession as attempts to create “economic flywheels” there. As the thinking goes, given the size and scope of the city’s challenges, including its mammoth physical footprint of 139 square miles, concentrating investments along key corridors can generate needed market activity and spur momentum—a flywheel effect—to the point where the market takes over and continues to propel communities toward broader prosperity. As of this writing, there are promising signs that this approach is working. Thanks to numerous strategic investments by the philanthropic, private, and public sectors, the Detroit region is on the rebound. It has often been said that Detroit’s unique history and unprecedented level of investment in its post-recession recovery defy easy comparison. However, the city is not alone in grappling with industrial restructuring, abundant vacant land, and extreme poverty. Detroit’s resurgence also results from a new and creative approach to problem solving that is emerging in many US cities—one that depends upon actors from multiple sectors coming together to move communities forward. If the Motor City can evolve from economic fragility to health via flywheels, it can offer important lessons in urban revitalization for others experimenting with or considering the same sorts of collaborative actions. This article begins with a brief summary of Detroit’s economic crisis that spurred leaders to think anew about their economic strategy. It then describes the series of interventions that comprise the flywheel and their effect to date in Detroit. It closes with thoughts about what the city and its stakeholders need to do in the coming months and years to ensure that market momentum continues and results in wider gains for residents and neighborhoods throughout Detroit. Detroit’s Economic Tsunami Like many older industrial cities, greater Detroit had been working hard to strengthen its manufacturing-based economy amid greater global competition and technological change. The Great Recession—with the simultaneous collapse of the automotive, financial, and real estate industries—dealt a major setback to these efforts, devastating the region’s economy. Related Cities & Regions Metro Monitor – 2017 Richard Shearer, Alec Friedhoff, Isha Shah, and Alan Berube March 2, 2017 The Avenue The top 10 metropolitan port complexes in the U.S. Adie Tomer and Joseph Kane Wednesday, July 1, 2015 The Avenue How US states rely on the NAFTA supply chain Joseph Parilla Thursday, March 30, 2017 Metropolitan Detroit lost an astounding 463,000 jobs between 2000 and 2009, more than 20 percent of the total jobs in the region. The region’s economy shrank by nearly 18 percent during that time period, even as the broader US economy expanded by 13 percent. Only five other metro areas among the nation’s 100 largest also saw their economies contract—Grand Rapids, Mich., and Cleveland, Dayton, Toledo, and Youngstown, Ohio. The mix of job loss, declining wages, and foreclosures hit the city of Detroit especially hard. During the first decade of the 21st century, the number of Detroit residents living in poverty increased by more than 25 percent—an additional 60,000 residents. Local leaders and many national philanthropies knew it was time to be bold. They knew that given the complexity of the challenge, they needed to work collectively and collaboratively, and that their efforts had to be transformative. The Turning Point To create a flywheel effect, investments need to exert a sizable force on the economy. With weak business and consumer spending in the wake of the Great Recession, Detroit needed its own stimulus package. And such spending could not be scattershot. To have maximum impact, it had to be targeted in purpose and geography. The Herculean efforts of philanthropic, corporate, and other local leaders cannot be adequately captured in this short article. Recent philanthropic efforts began in 2007 when 10 local and national foundations came together to create the New Economy Initiative (NEI). NEI launched with an initial $100 million investment to “return Detroit to its position as a global economic leader.” The initiative placed an emphasis on innovation, entrepreneurship, and creative industries. Then, in 2010, the city launched a visioning process with strong support from the philanthropic community that resulted in Detroit Future City—a plan and an implementation office within the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation to advance community objectives for decades to come. At each opportunity, leaders focused investments primarily on key corridors in the urban core, from Downtown and Midtown Detroit to the Riverfront. Rather than grow regional industry clusters through business attraction, their efforts supported start-ups and existing small businesses. Philanthropic investors hoped that such entrepreneurs could create jobs in the near term, populate abandoned buildings, revitalize neighborhoods, and produce next generation products and services. Initiatives to revitalize Downtown Detroit have varied greatly in approach. One early strategy was to designate Downtown and Midtown Detroit as an Innovation District. The announcement by Detroit’s mayor and the governor of Michigan reflected a commitment to establish and nurture startups in technology, health, and the arts. The innovation would play off key anchor institutions in the urban core, such as the business incubator TechTown Detroit, Wayne State University, and the Henry Ford Innovation Institute, which researches ways to improve health-care delivery within a system of affiliated hospitals. Reflecting the city’s long-standing need for better public transportation, another priority was the M-1 RAIL, a new light rail line that will run along Woodward Avenue, Detroit’s central commercial corridor. M-1 RAIL was made possible by philanthropy, with close coordination and assistance from federal leaders. Just east of this area is Eastern Market, which has become a bustling hub of fresh food, culinary arts, and entrepreneurship thanks to philanthropic investment. Eastern Market is undergoing expansion, with plans for a Food Innovation Zone for food manufacturers and a regional food accelerator for entrepreneurs in the food business. Spurring economic growth through small businesses and entrepreneurship has been a central part of revitalization efforts Goldman Sachs’s 10,000 Small Businesses program offered loans to fledgling companies and, perhaps more important, helped create a learning network for entrepreneurs in the city. JPMorgan Chase pledged to invest $100 million in Detroit, including support for TechTown Detroit, Eastern Market, and a new fund specifically directed toward entrepreneurs of color. One program, Motor City Match, connects aspiring entrepreneurs with available real estate. The organization offers financial and technical assistance to entrepreneurs and, using federal community development dollars, gives them vacant properties and the resources to design and modernize spaces for commercial use. After four rounds of financing, 72 percent of businesses receiving grants from Motor City Match are minority owned, and two-thirds of business owners are Detroit residents.9 The program has the promise to generate new income for households and neighborhoods and to increase foot traffic and commercial activity in the city, which ranks among the least walkable in the United States. Corporations have also been major players in making the flywheel possible. Dan Gilbert, founder of Quicken Loans, moved the company’s headquarters from the suburbs into Downtown in 2010. Quicken Loans now employs 15,000 people in Downtown Detroit. Gilbert and his partners bought or gained the rights to more than 90 underutilized Downtown properties, including dozens of skyscrapers, and have invested an estimated $2.2 billion in the city.12 Other corporations have jumped at the opportunity to move into Detroit as well. In 2011, Shinola, a luxury watch and goods manufacturer whose financial backers hail from Texas, opened its manufacturing facility Downtown. Shinola uses a space provided by the College for Creative Studies in a building that was a former automotive research lab. When the City of Detroit declared bankruptcy in July 2013, hobbled by steep pension obligations and a severely eroded tax base, nonprofit and corporate philanthropies and the state stepped in. Dubbed the “Grand Bargain,” this pledge of hundreds of millions of dollars helped stabilize the city’s finances. But more important, this pledge helped protect these early flywheel investments in Detroit’s core, shoring up market confidence in the city’s future. Detroit’s Economic Recovery These philanthropic and private sector investments are taking hold. The Detroit economy has reversed direction and, like a flywheel, is picking up speed. The Detroit metro economy expanded by 18.1 percent between 2009 and 2014, ranking ninth best among US metro areas, a stark contrast to the decade prior. During that time, the region’s employment rate rose 7.7 percent, the largest increase of any large US metro area. Detroit’s output per capita, a common measure of standard of living, rose 18.5 percent, which trailed only San Jose among all large metro areas. There are also signs that benefits are reaching lower-income residents, as the share of workers earning extremely low wages in the region dropped 2.4 percent. Wayne County, which encompasses Detroit, is also on the road to recovery. The county lost jobs every year between 2000 and 2010; between 2010 and 2014, the county gained jobs each year.16 Similarly, the county’s economy grew by 12.7 percent in the five years since 2009, after having continuously shrunk in the years leading up to the financial crash. These macro signs indicate that the market is responding positively to the surge of concentrated investments in central Detroit. The rebirth of the auto industry, enabled by the early federal bailout, has also been essential to the region’s recovery. Creating Wider Market Demand Detroit’s progress is remarkable but still nascent. The renewed market activity in Downtown and Midtown Detroit has yet to spill over to other neighborhoods or workers. Indeed, local leaders understand the urgency of investing outside of Downtown, and many worthwhile efforts are under way to eliminate neighborhood blight, reform schools, and open up opportunities for residents to acquire marketable skills. But in order for economic progress to broaden and accelerate, there simply must be more market demand. To that end, Detroit’s leaders should consider setting the following three goals: Increase resident income levels | Entrepreneurs and small business owners need customers with disposable income to buy their products and services so they can thrive. And if new investments improve neighborhoods and property values increase, existing residents need sufficient earnings to be able to afford to stay. Detroit’s progress is remarkable but still nascent. The renewed market activity in Downtown and Midtown Detroit has yet to spill over to other neighborhoods or workers. Unfortunately, between 2009 and 2014, the region’s median wage shrank by 1.4 percent. This figure actually compares favorably with the figure for the nation as a whole, which saw the median wage drop by 5 percent during that period, but in Detroit there’s another, more pressing issue: wages have moved in different directions for people of color and whites. The share of working-age people of color in metropolitan Detroit who have jobs rose from 52 percent to 60 percent between 2009 and 2014, but as more people of color entered the labor market and found jobs, their median wage dropped by 3.7 percent to $25,211. In contrast, white workers, whose employment rate increased to 73 percent, saw their median wage grow by 7.4 percent during that period, widening income disparities in the region. Similarly, a disproportionately large share of workers of color are employed in low-wage jobs. In 2014, more than one in three workers of color in metropolitan Detroit earned extremely low wages, compared with one in four white workers. Furthermore, our research finds that in metropolitan Detroit, nearly 12 percent of black teens ages 16 to 19, and a quarter of all black adults ages 20 to 24, are neither working nor in school.21 These figures are higher than the national averages of 8 percent and 17 percent for black youth, respectively. Local philanthropies, such as the Skillman Foundation, are already deeply involved in addressing these issues through their collective investments in training, minority entrepreneurship, and early childhood education. But ultimately, the city needs an even more muscular effort, one that partners with employers to help residents acquire the skills they need to get good-paying jobs. Those jobs, in turn, will allow residents to spend more money locally to sustain neighborhood economies. Connect to specialized industries | Firms in global industries, such as automotive manufacturing and financial services, drive the bulk of income growth in a region. They seek new technology capabilities, high-quality materials, process solutions, and skilled labor in order to innovate and expand. The opportunity is meeting that demand with local businesses and workers. Detroit Future City has prioritized the growth of digital and creative industries, entrepreneurship, and traditional manufacturing as part of its economic strategies. The good news is that the future of innovation requires the blending of these capabilities, and metropolitan Detroit is emerging as a leader. Over one-quarter of metropolitan Detroit’s economic output is generated by its advanced industries—the tech- and research-oriented sectors that power the global economy—placing Detroit seventh among all US metro areas. In addition to automotive parts and vehicle production, greater Detroit’s advanced industry specializations include engineering, computer systems design, R&D services, and data processing. What’s more, the Michigan manufacturing industry has sought to hire more computer programmers than mechanical engineers since 2010, demonstrating a sizable shift toward digital skills.24 It is estimated that the advanced industry ecosystem in greater Detroit directly employs more than 300,000 full-time workers, and an additional 240,000 people indirectly due to their multiplier effect. But more work can be done to connect that demand to the supply of workers and entrepreneurs in the core city. Detroit could be the center of “autotech” and “fintech,” connecting its emergent start-up scene and small business networks—as well as its digital skills training programs—to legacy manufacturers and the financial services industry. Bizdom, a Detroit-based start-up incubator and tech accelerator developed by Quicken Loans’ Gilbert, is an emerging example. And model programs in other cities offer inspiration. FirstBuild, for example, is a collaboration between GE Appliances and Lighting and the University of Louisville that allows community members to work alongside company and university engineers to design and develop ideas for the home appliances industry. One light on the horizon: Ford Motor Company’s collaboration with TechShop, a makers space and incubator, could expand its presence in Dearborn to Detroit, broadening its engagement with the city’s entrepreneurs and tinkerers. Invest more fully in neighborhoods | At an event at The Brookings Institution earlier this year, Stephen Henderson, an editorial page editor for the Detroit Free Press, highlighted the need to help Detroit residents who live in high-poverty, isolated neighborhoods. Research has shown that high-poverty neighborhoods exacerbate inequities and lower the prospects of all residents, not just those who live in poverty. And our research shows that over the past 15 years, poverty has not only increased in Detroit but become more concentrated. In 2000, there were 35 neighborhoods in the city in which 40 percent or more of residents lived below the poverty line; a decade later, the number of extremely poor neighborhoods increased more than fourfold, to 159. Revitalizing such neighborhoods requires a delicate balance of top-down and bottom-up engagement, where city and private sector actors work together alongside neighborhood organizations and residents to promote new avenues for growth. Getting to market scale is not easy, but a few emerging approaches, such as the Greater Chatham Initiative in Chicago, are showing great potential as models for other neighborhoods. The Greater Chatham Initiative is a comprehensive neighborhood development plan that seeks to link four historically middle-class, black neighborhoods on the South Side of Chicago to the regional economy. The initiative brings together disparate economic, workforce, and community development efforts—including small business and industry cluster strategies, youth summer jobs programs, workforce training, housing and commercial redevelopment funds, and public transportation linkages—and applies them to these neighborhoods to improve residents’ opportunities and well-being. Detroit is still one of the poorest cities in the United States. About one in four properties in the city—95,000 lots—remain abandoned. Approximately 23 square miles of the city’s 139-square-mile footprint is vacant, more than the size of the island of Manhattan. There is a long way to go. And yet the seismic, targeted investments by the private and public sectors are creating market traction where there was once none. If leaders in philanthropy, government, and business continue their work apace, the flywheel momentum will reach more residents and neighborhoods until Detroit achieves self-sustaining, inclusive growth.

On Tuesday, the iPhone maker issued a $1 billion green bond to fund renewable energy generation. It builds on $1.5 billion worth of bonds the Cupertino, California-based company sold a year ago to further its goal of running 100 percent of its operations on renewable energy. The bonds, maturing in 2027, will yield 95 to 100 basis points more than Treasuries, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because the deal is private. They are expected to be rated Aa1, the person said. The sale was arranged by Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. While companies in recent years have issued tens of billions of dollars in green bonds for projects that cut global-warming emissions, the size of Apple’s first issuance fueled speculation that other companies would follow. Business Channel Its latest bond comes less than two weeks after President Donald Trump decided to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, an international pact to curb greenhouse-gas emissions signed by almost 200 countries. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said last week he sought to persuade the president not to withdraw. “Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change,” Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said in the statement. The company was among those that signed an open letter pledging to continue supporting efforts to meet the Paris agreement. Apple said it plans to use the proceeds to finance projects involving renewable energy resources and energy efficiency, among other things. The latest bond offering includes a focus on advancing Apple’s goal of a closed-loop supply chain, through which products are made using only renewable resources and recycled material. The debt issuance means Apple doesn’t have to tap its vast offshore cash reserves to fund its renewables projects. The company is investing in solar energy, hydroelectric plants and biogas facilities in Oregon, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and California, including $850 million on a 130-megawatt solar farm near San Francisco over the next quarter century, and has received permission to sell power to the wholesale energy markets. Even with cash and equivalents totaling $257 billion, Apple has issued debt totaling $99 billion to fund stock buybacks and dividends, because most of that money is held outside the U.S. and would be subject to a 35 percent corporate income tax if it were repatriated.    Catch every San Antonio area moment!

Benzinga Hosts Fintech's Future With Venture Firm Village Capital Hopeful fintech startups have proliferated over the years without deposing Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL)’s trendy Venmo payment platform. But new threats have emerged, and Paypal investors have taken notice. Following Monday news that a consortium of major banks will soon launch collaborative venture, Zelle, Paypal closed down 2.3 percent and continued trading lower Tuesday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC), Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) and Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE: COF) announced their coordinated rollout of Zelle over the next week and the impending participation of more than 25 other banks. The platform, an Early Warning Services LLC product that took six years to develop, will link consumer checking accounts across participating banks to facilitate free and instantaneous person-to-person transactions.The current model offers a standard interface embedded directly in bank mobile apps, but a specific Zelle app will be available later this year. “We think the simplicity and shared experience around this will magnify the network effect,” Wells Fargo Executive Brett Pitts told The New York Times. The Zelle collaborators already dominate the targeted financial service, having processed a total $55 billion in person-to-person transfers last year compared to Venmo’s $17.6 billion, according to Early Warning. However, the Venmo team appears unshaken. “Cash is the common enemy,” spokesperson Josh Criscoe told the Times.

Jones has long dismissed a gunman's shooting rampage that killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. The gunman also killed his mother and himself. Jones has called the massacre a government hoax. Some affected by the shooting decried both Kelly and NBC. Now, several organizations appear to be following suit. Kelly will no longer host Wednesday's Promise Champions Gala in Washington, an annual event for the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation, a nonprofit gun violence prevention group founded by relatives of some of the Sandy Hook victims. "Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host," said Nicole Hockley, co-founder and managing director of the organization whose 6-year-old son Dylan was killed at Sandy Hook. "It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview." The Wall Street Journal reported that JPMorgan Chase pulled its ads from all NBC News programming until after Sunday's interview airs. Even Jones questioned the interview, calling it "fake news" and asked for it to be canceled. He said of his views, "I played devil's advocate by saying maybe none of it happened and it was all fake. The other side of me believes those parents I've seen on TV, and real mass shootings happen, so it probably did happen." Stiles Kelly defended her decision on Twitter, stating it was important for her to "shine a light" on Jones. Kelly said that she found Jones' suggestion that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax "as personally revolting as every other rational person does. "It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: How does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions?" Julia Stiles expecting her first child Julia Stiles confirmed that she is expecting her first child with fiancé Preston Cook. The couple will welcome their child toward the end of the year, her rep said. The 36-year-old "Bourne" and "Dexter" actress is in London promoting her new TV show, "Riviera," an 10-part thriller. Stiles announced her engagement to Cook, a camera assistant, with an Instagram post in early January 2016. partners for kindness: Starbucks has teamed up with Lady Gaga for a set of brightly colored summer drinks that will raise money for the singer's foundation. The "Cups of Kindness" campaign begins Tuesday and runs through Monday. Starbucks says 25 cents from every drink will be donated to Gaga's "Born This Way" foundation, which has a campaign to encourage kindness. Starbucks is contributing a minimum of $250,000 to Gaga's foundation. on top: Sean "Diddy" Combs is the top earner on Forbes' list of the 100 highest-paid celebrities. The magazine said the artist formerly known as Puff Daddy brought in $130 million from June 1, 2016, to June 1, 2017. Forbes said Diddy's Bad Boy Family Reunion Tour, a stake in Ciroc vodka and the $70 million sale of one-third of his Sean John clothing line all contributed to his earnings. No. 2 on the list is Beyoncé, with $105 million in earnings. Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling brought in $95 million. Rapper Drake and Portuguese soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo round out the top five. Last year's top earner, Taylor Swift, dropped to No. 49. The singer brought in $44 million, down from $170 million.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon OTTAWA — Canada’s interconnected banks are vulnerable to a cascading series of cyberattacks that could undermine broad confidence in the financial system, the Bank of Canada warns. The structural vulnerability could allow for the easy spread of an initial attack that ripples into other sectors such as energy or water systems, says the bank’s June financial review. The report urges banks to co-operate on countering the threats that are not going away any time soon. The former head of the U.S. National Security Agency made the same recommendation earlier this month, saying private-sector companies — including banks — have to do a better job of sharing data on attempted hacks in real time to counter the ongoing challenge. Retired Gen. Keith Alexander told a defence industry trade show that banks have valuable metadata on attempted hacks embedded in the logs of their firewalls and sharing that information can allow them to more successfully fend them off. Related Bell Canada ignored hacker’s demand for ransom — then the private data of 1.9 million customers was breached Microsoft and the NSA are playing the blame game with each other over the WannaCry ransomware hack Alexander suggested the 2014 cyberattack on the American bank JPMorgan Chase that affected an estimated 80 million accounts could have been prevented if banks had shared information. Canada’s central bank expressed a similar concern in its most recent update. “The interconnectedness of the financial system could lead to rapid transmission of stress from a cyberattack,” the report said. “This is a structural vulnerability that is unlikely to go away. And because of the interconnections in the system, the public sector has a role in co-ordinating cyber defences.” While those same connected platforms allow the financial services sector to deliver efficient service, they also leave several sectors of the economy vulnerable to attack, said the bank’s report. “Contagion could occur through financial interconnections or common critical infrastructures in non-financial sectors, such as telecommunications, energy and utilities,” it said. “A prolonged interruption in financial services, compromised data integrity or a loss of confidence could harm the financial system with knock-on effects to the real economy.” There were eight high-profile cyberattacks on banks in 2016, the report said, including an $81-million heist at the Bangladesh Bank. The report urges private-sector players to work together because protecting against an attack “has benefits beyond an individual institution and can be considered a public good.” The Canadian Bankers Association said recently that its members “constantly update their security systems and protocols to stay ahead of potential threats.” The association urged customers to avoid opening suspicious emails and exposing themselves to ransomware, malicious software that locks a user out of their data and demands a ransom for its release. “Canadian banks are leaders in cybersecurity and continue to invest in cybersecurity infrastructure to protect the financial system and the personal information of their customers from cyber threats,” the association said in a May 31 statement. However, the federal government has expressed concerns. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is mindful of cybersecurity in the financial sector, making a point of meeting on the issue in London last year with former Canadian colleague Mark Carney, now governor of the Bank of England. “Although banks tend to be more resourced and mature than other sectors in dealing with cyber threats, there are still a number of recognized gaps throughout the sector,” said an internal Public Safety note to prepare Goodale for the meeting. It pointed out that the theft from Bangladesh’s central bank was carried out by breaching the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or SWIFT, used to authorize payments between accounts. “This is a clear example of where the system was vulnerable,” said the briefing note, obtained through the Access to Information Act. The note also underscored the importance of identifying threats and improving the sharing of incident information. In that vein, the independent, not-for-profit Canadian Cyber Threat Exchange aims to promptly share threat information between Canadian businesses and government agencies, as well as provide cyber threat analysis and advice for reducing risk.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon An NBC executive has defended its new star’s upcoming interview with Alex Jones, saying people shouldn’t make any judgments until they see it in full. Megyn Kelly’s sit-down interview with Jones, scheduled to air Sunday, was immediately met with backlash, particularly from relatives of those who died in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, which Jones has dismissed as a government hoax to push for tougher gun laws. Liz Cole, executive producer of “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly,” told CNN’s Dylan Byers that the interview with Jones was meant to challenge the right-wing provocateur about his conspiracy theories. “We’re not just giving him a platform,” Cole said, adding that “viewers will see Megyn do a strong interview where she challenges him appropriately. … That’s the benefit of putting him out there. When someone actually sits down and asks him questions and he has to come up with answers – there’s value to that.” Cole challenged critics to watch the interview before slamming Kelly or NBC: “Judge it when you see it.” NBC released a 90-second preview of the interview Sunday. As criticism poured in, JPMorgan Chase reportedly pulled its local television and digital ads from all NBC News programming until after the interview airs, according to the Wall Street Journal. Related ‘Disgusting’: Sandy Hook families call out Megyn Kelly for interviewing conspiracy theorist Seat belt on, an imperious Putin steers the car and conversation with Oliver Stone in new documentary Sandy Hook Promise, a foundation created by relatives of some of the victims of the 2012 shooting, also dropped Kelly as a host for its gala, scheduled for Wednesday in Washington, D.C. “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” Nicole Hockley, the group’s co-founder and managing director, said in a statement. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” Jones himself wants NBC to pull the plug on the interview, saying the network used deceptive editing to misrepresent his views on Sandy Hook. Jones, a star in the alternative conservative media universe, reaches millions through his radio show and his website, Infowars.com. The site had 4.5 million unique page views in the past month, and more than 5 million from mid-April to mid-May, according to Quantcast. His YouTube channel has more than 2 million subscribers. President Donald Trump, who has appeared on Infowars, once called Jones a “nice guy” and hinted that their mind-set align. Infowars was even given a temporary press credential last month. Cole, Kelly’s executive producer, said that level of influence is one of the reasons the new show interviewed Jones. “He’s a controversial figure for sure, but as journalists it’s our job to interview newsmakers and people of influence no matter how abhorrent their views may be,” she told CNN. Responding to critics Sunday, before the backlash swelled, Kelly said the media needed to “shine a light” on who Jones is, particularly because of the layer of legitimacy he’s receiving from the White House. But critics see the interview as a way of normalizing Jones, a polarizing figure who has said the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were an inside job and peddled a conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, ran a child sex-abuse ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant. Others say airing the interview on Father’s Day is an insult to parents who lost their children on Dec. 14, 2012, in Newtown, Connecticut. Erica Lafferty, daughter of slain Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung, called the interview “sickening.” Her sister, Cristina Hassinger, tweeted this on Monday: “This is what happens when you put the spotlight on conspiracy theorists, @megynkelly. Harassment of victims. Riveting, isn’t it?” Nelba Márquez-Greene, whose 6-year-old daughter was killed, doesn’t buy NBC’s pre-emptive defense. “Sounds like something you say when you put profit and controversy over people,” she told The Washington Post via text message on Tuesday. “And the fact that Megyn Kelly hasn’t responded speaks volumes.” Márquez-Greene told The Post on Monday that she wants to speak personally with Kelly, either on or off the air. Sounds like something you say when you put profit and controversy over people “If they’re going to do the interview, fine,” she said. “But then give us equal airtime to express how dismaying this is.” She also said she doesn’t plan to watch the interview on Sunday. “Sunday is Father’s Day. On Sunday, I’ll be watching my husband perform a concert in my daughter’s honor for thousands of people,” she said. “Now that is love winning.” The Jones interview is Kelly’s third since NBC launched her new show earlier this month. The former Fox News anchor previously interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin, and “Dancing With the Stars” co-host and Fox Sports reporter Erin Andrews for NBC. The Washington Post’s Travis M.

Last year the company, based in Cupertino, Calf., sold $1.5 billion worth of bonds in its quest to run 100 percent of its operations on renewable energy. The latest bond, which matures in 2027, will yield 95 to 100 basis points more than U.S. Treasuries, according to a Bloomberg source. And they are expected to be rated Aa1. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase set up the sale. Apple said the bond sale will also help support its plan for a closed-loop supply chain -- products made entirely using recycled materials. The company is investing in several non-fossil fuel projects: solar energy, hydroelectric plants and biogas facilities in Oregon, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and California. That includes $850 million on a 130-megawatt solar farm near San Francisco over the next quarter century. Apple says its new Cupertino headquarters, Apple Park, runs entirely on renewable energy and includes rooftop solar panels supplemented by fuel cells. The 2.8 million-square-foot main building, which is ring-shaped in curved glass. Apple also has received permission to sell power to the wholesale energy markets. Two weeks ago, Apple criticized President Donald Trump's decision to pull the the United States out of the Paris climate accord to curb greenhouse-gas emissions signed by almost 200 countries. "Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change," Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said in the statement. The company was among several companies pledging to continue supporting efforts to meet the Paris agreement. Apple has cash and equivalents totaling $257 billion. But Apple has issued $99 billion to fund stock buybacks and dividends, because most resources are held outside the United States and would be subject to a 35 percent corporate income tax if it moved to the United States.

The nearly 150-page report suggested more than 100 changes, most of which would be made through regulators rather than Congress, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview. "We were very focused on, what we can do by executive order and through regulators," he said. "We think about 80 percent of the substance in the report can be accomplished by regulatory changes, and about 20 percent by legislation." Republican President Donald Trump has gradually been nominating heads of financial agencies to carry out his agenda, but only Mnuchin and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton have been approved by Congress. Other agencies are operating under "acting" chiefs or have leaders appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Changes proposed by the Treasury Department include easing up on restrictions big banks now face in their trading operations, lightening the annual stress tests they must undergo, and reducing the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has been aggressively pursuing bad behavior by financial institutions. The plan would also expand the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is chaired by Mnuchin, and change the way global capital standards are implemented to give U.S. banks a leg up against foreign rivals. Smaller banks would get some relief as well: Lenders with $50 billion or less in assets would have to jump through fewer regulatory hoops than rivals with multitrillion-dollar balance sheets.

By Pete Schroeder and Lisa Lambert (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department unveiled a sweeping plan on Monday to upend the country's financial regulatory framework, which, if successful, would grant many items on Wall Street's wishlist. The nearly 150-page report suggested more than 100 changes, most of which would be made through regulators rather than Congress, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview. "We were very focused on, what we can do by executive order and through regulators," he said. "We think about 80 percent of the substance in the report can be accomplished by regulatory changes, and about 20 percent by legislation." Republican President Donald Trump has gradually been nominating heads of financial agencies to carry out his agenda, but only Mnuchin and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton have been approved by Congress. Other agencies are operating under "acting" chiefs or have leaders appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Changes proposed by the Treasury Department include easing up on restrictions big banks now face in their trading operations, lightening the annual stress tests they must undergo, and reducing the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has been aggressively pursuing bad behavior by financial institutions. The plan would also expand the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is chaired by Mnuchin, and change the way global capital standards are implemented to give U.S. banks a leg up against foreign rivals. Smaller banks would get some relief as well: Lenders with $50 billion or less in assets would have to jump through fewer regulatory hoops than rivals with multitrillion-dollar balance sheets.

Megyn Kelly’s sit-down interview with Jones, scheduled to air Sunday, was immediately met with backlash, particularly from relatives of those who died in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, which Jones has dismissed as a government hoax to push for tougher gun laws. Liz Cole, executive producer of “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly,” told CNN’s Dylan Byers that the interview with Jones was meant to challenge the right-wing provocateur about his conspiracy theories. “We’re not just giving him a platform,” Cole said, adding that “viewers will see Megyn do a strong interview where she challenges him appropriately. … That’s the benefit of putting him out there. When someone actually sits down and asks him questions and he has to come up with answers – there’s value to that.” Cole challenged critics to watch the interview before slamming Kelly or NBC: “Judge it when you see it.” NBC released a 90-second preview of the interview Sunday. As criticism poured in, JPMorgan Chase reportedly pulled its local television and digital ads from all NBC News programming until after the interview airs, according to the Wall Street Journal. Sandy Hook Promise, a foundation created by relatives of some of the victims of the 2012 shooting, also dropped Kelly as a host for its gala, scheduled for Wednesday in Washington, D.C. “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” Nicole Hockley, the group’s co-founder and managing director, said in a statement. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” Jones himself wants NBC to pull the plug on the interview, saying the network used deceptive editing to misrepresent his views on Sandy Hook. Jones, a star in the alternative conservative media universe, reaches millions through his radio show and his website, Infowars.com. The site had 4.5 million unique page views in the past month, and more than 5 million from mid-April to mid-May, according to Quantcast. His YouTube channel has more than 2 million subscribers. President Donald Trump, who has appeared on Infowars, once called Jones a “nice guy” and hinted that their mind-set align. Infowars was even given a temporary press credential last month. Cole, Kelly’s executive producer, said that level of influence is one of the reasons the new show interviewed Jones. “He’s a controversial figure for sure, but as journalists it’s our job to interview newsmakers and people of influence no matter how abhorrent their views may be,” she told CNN. Responding to critics Sunday, before the backlash swelled, Kelly said the media needed to “shine a light” on who Jones is, particularly because of the layer of legitimacy he’s receiving from the White House. But critics see the interview as a way of normalizing Jones, a polarizing figure who has said the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were an inside job and peddled a conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, ran a child sex-abuse ring out of a Washington pizza restaurant. Others say airing the interview on Father’s Day is an insult to parents who lost their children on Dec. 14, 2012, in Newtown, Connecticut. Erica Lafferty, daughter of slain Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung, called the interview “sickening.” Her sister, Cristina Hassinger, tweeted this on Monday: “This is what happens when you put the spotlight on conspiracy theorists, @megynkelly. Harassment of victims. Riveting, isn’t it?” Nelba Márquez-Greene, whose 6-year-old daughter was killed, doesn’t buy NBC’s pre-emptive defense. “Sounds like something you say when you put profit and controversy over people,” she told The Washington Post via text message on Tuesday. “And the fact that Megyn Kelly hasn’t responded speaks volumes.” Márquez-Greene told The Post on Monday that she wants to speak personally with Kelly, either on or off the air. Sounds like something you say when you put profit and controversy over people “If they’re going to do the interview, fine,” she said. “But then give us equal airtime to express how dismaying this is.” She also said she doesn’t plan to watch the interview on Sunday. “Sunday is Father’s Day. On Sunday, I’ll be watching my husband perform a concert in my daughter’s honor for thousands of people,” she said. “Now that is love winning.” The Jones interview is Kelly’s third since NBC launched her new show earlier this month. The former Fox News anchor previously interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin, and “Dancing With the Stars” co-host and Fox Sports reporter Erin Andrews for NBC. The Washington Post’s Travis M.

CarterMatt.com TV News, Interviews, Spoilers, Reviews, and Features TV News Spoilers Reviews Interviews Features Premiere Guide Subscribe Mrs Carter TV Quick Hits: Megyn Kelly – Alex Jones drama; Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt renewed, Goliath season 2 scoop June 13, 2017 by Leave a Comment We begin today’s edition of TV Quick Hits in the most controversial way imaginable, and that means mostly discussing Megyn Kelly and Alex Jones. Kelly is featuring an interview with the infamous InfoWars personality on her Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly this coming weekend, and as a result of that (and Jones’ horrific statements about Sandy Hook and other incidents), one advertiser in JP Morgan Chase has already backed out. Meanwhile, there is a public backlash over her decision, and she is no longer set to host the Sandy Hook Promise Champions Gala. Some consider this to be her relying on someone famous for conspiracy theories and fear-mongering as a way to draw in ratings for the show. In a statement (per People Magazine), Kelly defended her decision to air the interview, and also discussed losing the hosting opportunity: “I understand and respect the decision of the event organizers but I’m of course disappointed that I won’t be there to support them on Wednesday night … I find Alex Jones’s suggestion that Sandy Hook was ‘a hoax’ as personally revolting as every other rational person does. It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: how does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions?” Kelly’s argument seems to be to show the horrific nature of some of Jones’ beliefs on a larger platform; however, the criticism by others is that he simply doesn’t deserve it. (Personally, we do tend to side with the latter; if this interview gets even one person believing some of the same stuff that Jones spouts off, it’s harmful for the country and the human race.) As for some other news… Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt renewed – As if this is a surprise to anyone, Netflix has renewed the Ellie Kemper comedy for a fourth season. While still certainly funny, this is a show that may need a little bit of a further spark to get it back in the public discourse. Morris Chestnut joins Goliath season 2 – Following the cancellation of Rosewood, Chestnut has joined the Billy Bob Thornton series for its upcoming second season as chief deputy D.A. Hakeem Rashad, a man with a history of clashing with Thornton’s defense attorney. This news was first reported by Deadline; it’s great to see him back on another show so quickly.

Big banks are rolling out a Venmo rival called Zelle. Elise Amendola AP Banking June 13, 2017 1:23 PM Banks are rolling out new rival for Venmo. Here’s when it will hit your app. By Rick Rothacker rrothacker@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Bank of America and Wells Fargo are among the U.S. banks rolling out a new money-transfer service in coming weeks that’s designed to compete with Venmo and other payment apps. The service, called Zelle, has been in the works for month, but it will soon become more widely available in the mobile apps that bank customers already use to check balances and deposit checks. The person-to-person payments network, developed by a bank-owned company called Early Warning Services, will be available to more than 86 million mobile bank customers beginning this month. Zelle is an effort by big banks to regain territory lost to non-bank payment services such as PayPal’s Venmo, which allow users to send each other money for rent, restaurant checks and anything else. Venmo has become particularly popular with younger users and includes social media features. Tech giant Apple last week announced a money-transfer service that will zip money through texts. Banks have been developing various person-to-person payment services for years, but they haven’t gained the buzz of other rivals. One advantage of Zelle is that it will be part of existing apps. More than 30 banks, including the likes of JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, will begin debuting the service over the next 12 months. Early Warning Services also has relationships with various payments processors, which will allow additional community banks and credit unions to offer the program. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo announced this week that it will make Zelle available June 24 to its 28 million mobile and online customers. Customers can send money using a recipient’s mobile phone number or email address, and funds will be available typically within minutes, the bank said. “The rollout of Zelle at banks across the country represents an advance in the speed, connectivity and security of P2P payments,” said Brett Pitts, head of digital for Wells Fargo virtual channels in a statement. Charlotte-based Bank of America first introduced the features of Zelle into its mobile app in February, but the purple Zelle branding will become noticeable in starting June 28. Bank of America says it has 22 million active mobile users. Other banks that have a Charlotte presence will also be deploying Zelle in coming months. Fifth Third said it will join the network June 23, while PNC said it will launch in coming weeks. SunTrust is targeting the third quarter of this year, and Ally Financial expect to go live later this year. BB&T said it will share more details in coming months. While Zelle will be more widely available in coming weeks, it’s already moving money. In the first quarter of the year, more than 51 million transactions totaling more than $16 billion flowed through the network.

Photo: AP; Getty Images On Sunday night, Megyn Kelly’s new NBC show is planning to air an interview she conducted with prominent conspiracy theorist and Infowars founder Alex Jones. That decision has already caused immense blowback: many (including Jones himself) have called on Kelly to not run the interview, J.P. Morgan Chase pulled their NBC News advertising, and Kelly has been dropped as the host for an anti-gun-violence group’s event. Kelly was slated to host the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation’s annual Promise Champions Gala on Wednesday night. In a statement released on Monday evening, the nonprofit’s co-founder, Nicole Hockley, explained that, “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones.” Jones has been instrumental in promoting the conspiracy theory that 2012’s Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting — in which 20 children were killed — was a hoax. He’s both inspired and given a platform to fellow truthers, some of whom have gone on to harass the families who lost their children, as detailed in this 2016 New York Magazine story. On Tuesday morning, CNN’s Brian Stelter posted a statement from Kelly regarding the gala news, in which she says that she is “disappointed” that she won’t be at the event. Still, she goes on to defend her interview with the explanation that, “Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light — as journalists are supposed to do — on this influential figure, and yes — to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity.” The Washington Post Tags: love and war media megyn kelly alex jones sunday night with megyn kelly sandy hook More Megyn Kelly Dropped From Sandy Hook Event Over Alex Jones Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Cat-Eyes Are Boring.

Kelly said Tuesday that she understands and respects the decision by Sandy Hook Promise to disinvite her as host of its Wednesday gala, but is disappointed. She said reporting on Jones’ falsehoods is what journalists are supposed to do. NBC is taking considerable heat on social media for its Father’s Day broadcast of Kelly’s interview with “Infowars” host Alex Jones, who has questioned whether the killing of 26 people in 2012 at the school in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax. The firm JPMorgan Chase has asked that its advertisement not run on the broadcast. Related: Newtown families upset by interview with conspiracy theorist “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” said Nicole Hockley, co-founder and managing director. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” Hockley, whose 6-year-old son Dylan was killed at Sandy Hook, founded the group with Mark Barden, who lost his 7-year-old son Daniel. Kelly said that she found Jones’ suggestion that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax “as personally revolting as every other rational person does. “It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: How does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions?” Trump, she said, has helped elevate Jones with his attention and letting “Infowars” in some White House events, she said. “Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light, as journalists are supposed to do, on this influential figure and, yes, to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity,” she said. The interview is the planned centerpiece of her third broadcast of the newsmagazine “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly.” The interview has put Kelly, who jumped to NBC from Fox News Channel earlier this year, squarely back in the headlines. She was one of Trump’s favorite targets during the presidential campaign because he was annoyed at tough questions she asked him at a Fox-broadcast debate. The New York Daily News put the story on its front page Tuesday, with the headline “Nutwork News.” Jones, for his part, has already denounced the interview as “fake news.” Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Jones’ promotion of several controversial conspiracy theories has also resulted in JP Morgan Chase pulling ads from the network, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” added Sandy Hook Promise co-founder Nicole Hockley. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” Also Read: Megyn Kelly's NBC Plan: 'Tune Out the Nonsense and Work Really Damn Hard' (Exclusive) Ironically, Alex Jones doesn’t want the interview to air either — he claims Kelly misrepresented his thoughts on Sandy Hook. In a live stream on Monday afternoon, Jones said that Kelly lied to him, and promised that the interview would not be about Sandy Hook or other conspiracies. “Megyn Kelly lied to me several weeks before she came here,” he said. “She said that the interview was not going to be about Sandy Hook and the mass shooting there, and it was not going to be about Pizzagate and these other issues that the media always obsesses on and misrepresents what I’ve said and what I’ve done.” During the promo for the interview that has caused such a firestorm, Jones said that they did not include him saying he believed children died at Sandy Hook. “They had it edited where it sounded like I said nobody [died]… and that’s why I’m calling for the piece not to air next Sunday on Father’s Day.” Read original story Megyn Kelly Defends Alex Jones Interview, Calls His Sandy Hook Denial ‘Revolting’ At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Kelly said Tuesday that she understands and respects the decision by Sandy Hook Promise to disinvite her as host of its Wednesday gala, but is disappointed. She said reporting on Jones’ falsehoods is what journalists are supposed to do. NBC is taking considerable heat on social media for its Father’s Day broadcast of Kelly’s interview with “Infowars” host Jones, who has questioned whether the killing of 26 people in 2012 at the school in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax. The firm JPMorgan Chase has asked that its advertisement not run on the broadcast. “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” said Nicole Hockley, co-founder and managing director. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” Hockley, whose 6-year-old son, Dylan, was killed at Sandy Hook, founded the group with Mark Barden, who lost his 7-year-old son, Daniel. Kelly said she found Jones’ suggestion that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax “as personally revolting as every other rational person does. “It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: How does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions?” Trump, she said, has helped elevate Jones with his attention and letting “Infowars” in some White House events, she said. “Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light, as journalists are supposed to do, on this influential figure and, yes, to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity,” she said. The interview is the planned centerpiece of her third broadcast of the newsmagazine “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly.” The interview has put Kelly, who jumped to NBC from Fox News Channel earlier this year, squarely back in the headlines. She was one of Trump’s favorite targets during the presidential campaign because he was annoyed at tough questions she asked him at a Fox-broadcast debate. Jones, for his part, has already denounced the interview as “fake news.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under megyn kelly ,  nbc ,  nbc news ,  sandy hook Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Jurors in Cosby case needed clarification on his charges Read Next Jurors in Cosby case needed clarification on his charges Most Popular This Week 1 NBC holding crisis meetings over Megyn Kelly 2 'Batman' star Adam West had sex with eight women a night 3 Bill Cosby's lawyer practically gives up during closing arguments 4 Oliver Stone's 'Late Show' interview went completely off the rails 5 Demi Moore was so stressed, she lost her front teeth 6 Elle Macpherson splits from billionaire husband Share Selection Now On Obama inducts Jay-Z into Songwriters Hall of Fame LA transforms into Gotham City in touching tribute to Adam West Rumer Willis couldn't stop laughing at Demi Moore's toothless lisp Alex Jones says he secretly recorded Megyn Kelly interview, posts preview online Stevie Wonder puts on surprise performance Drew Barrymore moves on with new man Dashca Polanco sold perfume at Macy's for three years Cosby calls for mistrial as jury remains deadlocked Sandy Hook families' lawyers urge NBC not to air Megyn Kelly interview Shady Asian billionaire 'showered' Miranda Kerr with diamonds Elettra Wiedemann pregnant with first child Debi Mazar doesn't care for swag bags Famous mustaches 'on display' in NYC movie theater Megyn Kelly interview completely overhauled after backlash Linda Evangelista's advice for surviving Hollywood Dr. Dre donates $10M to Compton High School Hayley Hasselhoff pleads no contest in DUI case Ariel Winter and her boyfriend get matching tattoos 'OITNB' star visits a real prison for the first time Karrueche Tran granted 5-year restraining order against Chris Brown SEE ALL Sightings Usher and his family having dinner at Esther & Carol . . .

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and her fellow policymakers kicked off their two-day meeting Tuesday. Economists expect the U.S. central bank to raise its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point. It would be the second rate hike this year following a move in March. JPMorgan Chase head economist Jim Glassman: SOUNDBITE: JIM GLASSMAN, HEAD ECONOMIST FOR COMMERCIAL BANKING, JPMORGAN CHASE, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "The Federal Reserve sort of laid out this game plan awhile ago. The market is priced for that. If the Fed didn't go it would really confuse the market because they would wonder what's the issue and they would start thinking, oh, was it about that May job report or was it about the CPI?" A rate move would come amid mixed economic signals. Economic rowth appears to have reaccelerated, but jobs growth slowed in May, and inflation - a key focus of the Fed - has retreated. Investors will also be watching Wednesday for the Fed's outlook. Few economists expect big changes in its economic forecasts. But markets will be looking for details on the timing of the Fed's plan to shrink its $4.2 trillion portfolio of debt and mortgage-backed securities.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Just how toxic is Alex Jones these days in terms of sponsors? Jazz ShawPosted at 12:01 pm on June 13, 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter If you’re looking to get into a new field of work there seems to be an emerging business opportunity opening up at major corporations across the country. Every large company will very likely soon need a person whose sole job is to monitor which television and radio shows their advertisements air on and match those up against breaking news on social media. Any broadcasts which are deemed too controversial can then be immediately pulled, followed by a corresponding corporate virtue signaling announcement. The latest to come to light is the case of J.P. Morgan, who had to quickly yank their advertising from an upcoming Megyn Kelly interview with Alex Jones, the always controversial host of Infowars. (Wall Street Journal) NBC anchor Megyn Kelly’s plan to air an interview with right-wing provocateur Alex Jones has caused a firestorm to erupt on social media, but so far advertisers have remained quiet—with at least one notable exception. J.P. Morgan Chase JPM & Co. has asked for its local TV ads and digital ads to be removed from Ms. Kelly’s show and from all NBC news programming until after the show airs, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company doesn’t want any of its ads to appear adjacent to any promotions for the interview, the person added. NBC declined to comment. On Monday, Kristin Lemkau, J.P. Morgan’s chief marketing officer, questioned why Ms. Kelly would conduct the interview. “As an advertiser, I’m repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes,” she tweeted. As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why? https://t.co/luwyCwP7Ti — Kristin Lemkau (@KLemkau) June 12, 2017 To be clear, I’d just like to state up front that where, when and how J.P. Morgan chooses to spend their advertising dollars is completely up to them. But with that said, how far are we going to be riding this train of punishing news shows who choose to interview controversial subjects? It’s not as if NBC hired Alex Jones to give him his own show on their network. Kelly is trying to make a big splash and draw the maximum number of eyeballs with her current string of interviews and let’s face it… the name Alex Jones stops people in their tracks and gets heads turning. And precisely how controversial or awful or whatever other adjective you’d care to employ is Jones? He called himself an entertainer during some recent family court hearings. I don’t think anyone is in danger of seeing a clip from Infowars airing on NBC and mistaking it for the latest item pulled off the Associated Press wires. In terms of complete disclosure, while I probably hear his name or see some reference to him several times every week, I really don’t know all that much about Jones’ content stream. I’m not a subscriber or regular consumer, and as my wife is fond of saying, I do not sing the songs of his people. I mostly know him from memes and funny sound bites, such as the one which seems to pop up on every podcast or Comedy Central show, where he’s yelling about someone putting something in the water that turned all the frogs gay. (In perhaps the biggest bit of irony of all, it turns out that Jones was pretty close on that one. Some fragrance enhancing chemicals in a number of products have been shown to induce gender dysphoria in aquatic creatures. So they’re not gay, but trans is pretty close, no?) The point is, I’m aware that Alex Jones frequently takes strolls far past where the buses run in terms of current news. His conspiracy ideas about things like the Sandy Hook shooting being faked are so far out there that they’re not really dangerous so much as a spectacle causing bewilderment in most observers. Of course, those are just the most extreme examples and I have no idea if he actually believes that stuff or just does it to crank up the ratings dial. His network regularly covers other news which turns out to not be crazy at all. (They just found MSNBC trying to pass off an interview with a “random Los Angeles resident” who turned out to be an Obama campaign director.) So if Jones starts talking about Sandy Hook being faked, or even the moon landing for that matter, I think J.P. Morgan could trust Megyn Kelly to call him out and say that it’s nonsense. Did anyone really need to pull their advertising from this interview? Are we seriously worried that those sorts of ideas will suddenly take hold and swing the next election?

Contract negotiations between Kelly and Fox News are reportedly heating up. (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Fortune/Time Inc) Megyn Kelly, the host of NBC’s “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly,” was slammed for interviewing InfoWars’ host Alex Jones during her upcoming show. Kelly was pulled from hosting an annual gala put on by the family members of the Sandy Hook victims. “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” Nicole Hockley, who is the co-founder and managing director, said in a statement, reported the Daily Caller. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” The Sandy Hook gala is slated to be held in Washington D.C., on Tuesday. (Screenshot/Twitter) JP Morgan Chase said it has pulled advertising from NBC News until the Jones interview airs on Sunday. Kelly on Sunday previewed an interview with Jones, asking him about his alleged denial that the Sandy Hook massacre, which left 26 people dead, was a false flag. “When you say parents faked their children’s death, people get very angry,” Kelly says in the clip. “Well, Sandy Hook’s complex because I have had debates where, we devil’s advocates have said the whole story is true, and then I have had debates where I have said, that none of it is true,” he said. Jones added that he had “looked at all the angles of Newtown, and I made my statements long before the media even picked up on it.” Kelly issued a statement on the interview, Fox News reported. Megyn Kelly speaks onstage at Tina Brown’s 7th Annual Women In The World Summit Opening Night at David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center on April 6, 2016 in New York City. (Jemal Countess/Getty Images) “I find Alex Jones’s suggestion that Sandy Hook was ‘a hoax’ as personally revolting as every other rational person does. It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: how does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions? Infowars’ Alex Jones (Si Gross/Ben Dome) She added: ” Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light – as journalists are supposed to do—on this influential figure, and yes – to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity.” Months ago, Kelly left her lucrative position at Fox News and joined NBC News.

Speaking at the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference, Citigroup CFO John Gerspach said he expected that fixed-income, currencies and commodities revenue as well as equities trading revenue combined could be down around 12%-13%. That forecast would be comparable to those offered by JPMorgan and Bank of America (BAC) last month. Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs also have said they were seeing weaker trading revenue. But shares of Citigroup were up 0.6% at 64.69 in the stock market today, still in buy range after breaking out last week as markets expect another rate hike from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. Citi is at its best levels since early 2009. Morgan Stanley rose 0.7% to 45.17, closing above a 44.96 cup-with-handle buy point after crossing the entry intraday in the prior two sessions. Morgan Stanley's volume was only about average, though. Bank of America fell 1 cent to 23.77, while JPMorgan added 0.4% and Goldman Sachs rose 1%. All are above their 50-day moving averages and are building the right side of bases. The weaker trends in the second quarter come a year after the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union and a tumultuous U.S. election led to massive market turnover. While bank stocks stand to benefit from higher interest rates, they've been gridlocked as Wall Street waits for the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress to push through bank-friendly legislation such as tax and regulatory reform. The Federal Reserve is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. With another rate hike widely expected Wednesday afternoon, Wall Street will likely turn its attention to how bullish the central bank will be on rates for the rest of the year. Goldman's trading woes actually started earlier than Q2. In contrast to Citigroup, JPMorgan and BofA, the investment bank saw Q1 trading revenue drop on a mix of subdued client activity, politics and misplaying the market.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Jun 14, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp US Fed likely to hike rates today EXPECTATIONS:Economists think the US central bank will raise its benchmark rate to between 1% and 1.25%. It is also to release its growth and inflation projections Reuters, WASHINGTON The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate this week due to a tightening labor market and may also provide more detail on its plans to shrink the mammoth bond portfolio it amassed to nurse the economic recovery. The central bank is scheduled to release its decision later today at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to hold a news conference after the meeting. “The expectation of a rate hike ... is widely held, and has been reinforced by the most recent round of Fed communications,” JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli said. Economists polled by Reuters overwhelmingly see the Fed raising its benchmark rate to a target range of 1 to 1.25 percent this week. The Fed embarked on its first tightening cycle in more than a decade in December 2015. A quarter percentage point interest rate rise today would be the second nudge upwards this year following a similar move in March. Since then, the unemployment rate has fallen to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent and economic growth appears to have reaccelerated following a lackluster first quarter. However, other indicators of the economy’s health have been more mixed. The Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 percent from 1.8 percent earlier this year and investors are growing increasingly doubtful policymakers will be able to stick to their anticipated pace of tightening of three interest rate rises this year and next. There are also growing doubts on the size and scope of fiscal stimulus US President Donald Trump’s administration might inject into the US economy with campaign promises on tax reform, financial regulation rollbacks and infrastructure spending either still on the drawing board or facing hurdles in the US Congress. Fed policymakers’ confidence in their outlook will be on show today when they release their latest set of quarterly projections on growth, unemployment and inflation as well as their expected rate hike path. Few economists expect major changes in the Fed’s overall forecasts this time around, although the extent of jitters on inflation moving away from the Fed’s 2 percent goal will likely be reflected at an individual level. However, markets are increasingly anxious for the Fed to give a clearer steer on the timing and details of its previously announced plan to reduce its US$4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the financial crisis to help keep rates low and bolster the economy. “If the Fed is serious about reducing the size of its balance sheet this year and wishes to communicate those plans well in advance, it is running out of time to do so,” Capital Economics economist Michael Pearce said. The Fed has yet to indicate the size of the monthly caps or their quarterly increases. After this week’s meeting, policymakers meet four more times this year, with the Fed seen actually reducing its holdings either in September or December. This story has been viewed 1331 times.

Published on June 13, 2017. Ad Age "Media Guy" columnist Simon Dumenco's media roundup for the morning of Tuesday, June 13: Lots going on in today's media scan -- only some of it is Russia-related (see Nos. 1 and 2, below) -- but I'm guessing you're maybe here for the meeting tip? In that case, skip ahead to No. 7. Anyway, let's get started ... 1. USA Today, among other media outlets, will be livestreaming Attorney General Jeff Sessions' testimony before the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee starting at 2:30 p.m. ET this afternoon. As Vox's Dara Lind notes, the stakes are particularly high for Sessions today because, The possibility that Sessions failed to mention repeated contacts with the Russian ambassador in his vetting forms and confirmation hearings raises the possibility that it was a deliberate omission on Sessions's part -- which means he may have committed perjury when he testified under oath in his confirmation hearing that he'd had no contact with the Russian government. 2. A story getting major play on the homepage of The Daily Beast this morning: Marlow Stern's "Megyn Kelly Is Getting Played. And America Is the Big Loser" (subhead: "Her sit-down interviews with contemptible trolls Vladimir Putin and Alex Jones are ratings grabs, pure and simple -- grieving Sandy Hook parents be damned"). + "JPMorgan Chase Pulls Megyn Kelly Ads Over Interview With Alex Jones," per Variety. 3. "Less than a year after Condé Nast relaunched Style.com as a fashion e-commerce site, the company is closing the business and forging a new strategic partnership with Farfetch," reports Vikram Alexei Kansara of The Business of Fashion. "Style.com will discontinue operations, effective immediately, and the site's URL will redirect to Farfetch.com. Farfetch has acquired Style.com's trademark, intellectual property and customer database." 4. Well done, Fortune! McDonald's is using Snapchat to recruit young employees https://t.co/KRv1lAhgrp pic.twitter.com/PTrZg1H5Pj — Fortune (@FortuneMagazine) June 13, 2017 5. Noted: The brutal, ceaseless PR crisis that is Uber right now has its own module on Recode's homepage under the package headline "Uber's culture crisis" -- with 43 stories published to date. 6. In a post titled "Comments Welcome at N.Y. Times, With Troll-Blocking Tech Tool," Bloomberg's Gerry Smith and Jeremy Kahn report, The New York Times is using technology from an Alphabet Inc. unit to let online readers comment on more stories, betting that machine-learning software will make it easier to encourage civil debate while avoiding insults, abuse and trolling. Starting Tuesday, the newspaper will open the comments section to about one-fourth of its stories, up from 10 percent before, and the goal is to reach 80 percent by year-end. 7. And finally, remember when Dunder Mifflin's Michael Scott created a "Do Not Mock" list (see below) in a sensitivity-training meeting on NBC's "The Office"? Well, it turns out that for his meetings, the president of the United States has a sort of "Only Praise" list with just one thing on it: Donald Trump. Imagine if all your meetings were about everybody in the room singing your praises -- kind of like a reverse roast. Best meetings ever! (Well, for you, at least.) See CNN Editor-at-large Chris Cillizza's post titled "Donald Trump just held the weirdest Cabinet meeting ever," which is must-read not only for Cillizza's decription of said meeting but for his comically incredulous tone: Once Trump finished touting his administration's accomplishments, he turned to several of his newly-minted Cabinet secretaries like Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. Each of those Cabinet secretaries lavished praise on Trump, which he accepted without comment but with a broad smile. At first, I thought Trump was just going to have the new members of the Cabinet spend a few minutes praising him. NOPE! It soon became clear that Trump planned to have every Cabinet member speak. And when I say "speak" what I really mean is "praise Trump for his accomplishments, his foresight, his just being awesome." You think I am exaggerating. I am not. Read on for the rather astonishing thing that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said to the president. Cillizza notes that New York Senator Chuck Schumer didn't take long to parody Trump's cabinet meeting: GREAT meeting today with the best staff in the history of the world!!! pic.twitter.com/ocE1xhEAac — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) June 12, 2017 And on that note, I leave you with this classic clip from "The Office": Thank you to Ann-Christine Diaz, George Slefo, Laurel Wentz and Chen Wu for their roundup suggestions.

Since the interview was announced, Kelly has faced a considerable amount of backlash for booking Jones on her new NBC show “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly” — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said on Monday that it would pull all ads and digital spots from the show until after the interview airs, and earlier Tuesday morning Kelly was dropped as the host of Sandy Hook Promise’s gala. “I understand and respect the decision of the event organizers but I’m of course disappointed that I won’t be there to support them on Wednesday night,” Kelly wrote. “I find Alex Jones’s suggestion that Sandy Hook was ‘a hoax’ as personally revolting as every other rational person does.” Related TV Review: ‘Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly’ Kelly went on to defend her decision to proceed with the interview, especially considering the far-right media personality’s affiliation with President Donald Trump. “President Trump, by praising and citing him, appearing on his show, and giving him White House press credentials, has helped elevate Jones, to the alarm of many,” Kelly wrote. “Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light — as journalists are supposed to do — on this influential figure, and yes — to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity.” Jones is a familiar subject of controversy, and has promoted many conspiracy theories, including that the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Conn. was a government hoax. Kelly was scheduled to host the annual gala of Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit gun violence prevention group that has strong ties to the Newtown shooting. The organization’s co-founder and managing director Nicole Hockley said Tuesday that Kelly had agreed to “step down.” “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones,” Hockley said in a statement. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” Read Kelly’s full statement below: Here is my statement regarding Sunday night’s interview: pic.twitter.com/iS2VfyLt6S — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 13, 2017 Kelly expressed similar sentiments in a tweet sent on Sunday. “[Trump has] been on and praises Alex Jones’ show,” she wrote. “He’s giving Infowars a White House press credential. Many don’t know him; our job is to shine a light.” POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light. https://t.co/5e88BJyqnz — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 12, 2017 Kelly drew more tempered ire for her show’s debut interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In her review for Variety, critic Maureen Ryan called the first installment of Kelly’s show “a long way from must-see TV.” Filed Under: Alex Jones Megyn Kelly Want to read more articles like this one?

Personally hiding from it doesn’t mean he doesn’t have any listeners or viewers. Playing the emotion card about it isn’t going to solve the fact that when you google about Sandy Hook Hoax, you get FAR more propagating that BS. It needs to be shot down. By your rationale, NBC shouldn’t have an DEBUNKING interview with some guy who gets Millions of people believing we never went to moon…. falsely thinking that “giving him a platform that doesn’t exist” will somehow make more people believe it. No, you DeBunk them and make them look like idiots… so enough people will BASH the idiot to keep others from believing his nonsense!

Good luck with that MK, you pretty much blew it with the phony nice girl act at Fox. This is also just more oil she can pour on her President Trump hate fire.

Reply Andre Gastinato says: June 13, 2017 at 9:07 am There is no defense of giving Alex Jones, the originator of the “Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting Hoax” fake news a place on network TV. We do not need Megyn Kelly to bring Fox News scripted propaganda to NBC. The fact that the President watches garbage like Alex Jones is NO excuse to give Jones an even larger platform to spew his hate rhetoric. Yeah, yeah we know it’s all about ratings and revenue but I can’t believe any quality product or service would want to be associated with Alex Jones and at some point NBC should seriously question their logic in hiring a non journalist like Megyn Kelly.

PHOTO: AFP [SAN FRANCISCO] Apple Inc, which issued the biggest green bond ever sold by a US corporation last year to finance projects fighting global warming, is doing it again. On Tuesday, the iPhone maker issued a US$1 billion green bond to fund renewable energy generation. It builds on US$1.5 billion worth of bonds the Cupertino, California-based company sold a year ago to further its goal of running 100 per cent of its operations on renewable energy. The bonds, maturing in 2027, will yield 95 to 100 basis points more than Treasuries, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because the deal is private. They are expected to be rated Aa1, the person said. The sale was arranged by Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Powered by GET.com sentifi.com Market voices on: While companies in recent years have issued tens of billions of dollars in green bonds for projects that cut global-warming emissions, the size of Apple's first issuance fueled speculation that other companies would follow.  Its latest bond comes less than two weeks after President Donald Trump decided to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord, an international pact to curb greenhouse-gas emissions signed by almost 200 countries. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said last week he sought to persuade the president not to withdraw. SEE ALSO: Apple, Dell joining Foxconn's bid for Toshiba chip business "Leadership from the business community is essential to address the threat of climate change," Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said in the statement. The company was among those that signed an open letter pledging to continue supporting efforts to meet the Paris agreement. Apple said it plans to use the proceeds to finance projects involving renewable energy resources and energy efficiency, among other things. The latest bond offering includes a focus on advancing Apple's goal of a closed-loop supply chain, through which products are made using only renewable resources and recycled material. The debt issuance means Apple doesn't have to tap its vast offshore cash reserves to fund its renewables projects. The company is investing in solar energy, hydroelectric plants and biogas facilities in Oregon, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and California, including US$850 million on a 130-megawatt solar farm near San Francisco over the next quarter century, and has received permission to sell power to the wholesale energy markets. Even with cash and equivalents totaling US$257 billion, Apple has issued debt totaling US$99 billion to fund stock buybacks and dividends, because most of that money is held outside the US and would be subject to a 35 per cent corporate income tax if it were repatriated.

The U.S. Treasury Department unveiled a sweeping plan on Monday to upend the country's financial regulatory framework, which, if successful, would grant many items on Wall Street's wish list. The nearly 150-page report suggested more than 100 changes, most of which would be made through regulators rather than Congress, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview. "We were very focused on, what we can do by executive order and through regulators," he said. "We think about 80 percent of the substance in the report can be accomplished by regulatory changes, and about 20 percent by legislation." Republican President Donald Trump has gradually been nominating heads of financial agencies to carry out his agenda, but only Mnuchin and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton have been approved by Congress. Other agencies are operating under "acting" chiefs or have leaders appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Changes proposed by the Treasury Department include easing up on restrictions big banks now face in their trading operations, lightening the annual stress tests they must undergo, and reducing the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has been aggressively pursuing bad behavior by financial institutions. The plan would also expand the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is chaired by Mnuchin, and change the way global capital standards are implemented to give U.S. banks a leg up against foreign rivals. Smaller banks would get some relief as well: Lenders with $50 billion or less in assets would have to jump through fewer regulatory hoops than rivals with multitrillion-dollar balance sheets. The industry has long sought many of the proposed changes, which would mostly benefit banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley. Industry trade groups applauded the proposal on Monday evening, though some said they wished there were more specifics on tricky questions, such as what level regulators should set for banks' assets before subjecting them to stricter rules. "This is the first time in a while where there's been an official undertaking where our concerns resonated with the folks in the driver's seat," said Rich Foster, senior counsel for regulatory and legal affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable, a trade group. Representatives of the six largest U.S. banks declined to comment, did not immediately respond or said they were reviewing the document. Reform advocates and Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the plan as a handout to Wall Street and a dangerous one for U.S. consumers who lost homes and jobs during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a critic of Wall Street, said it would "make it easier for big banks to cheat their customers and spark another financial meltdown." Her Democratic colleague Senator Sherrod Brown noted that Treasury consulted with industry groups more than consumer groups, by a ratio of 17-to-1, while developing its report. "The Treasury proposal advances ideas that have been pushed by industry lobbyists since Dodd-Frank was passed," said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform. "We need more effective regulation and enforcement, not rollbacks driven by Wall Street and predatory lenders." Mnuchin said the regulatory overhaul is needed to grow the economy, give consumers more choices and ensure U.S. taxpayers would not have to bail out big banks again. While the Trump administration has said it wants to protect consumers, existing rules limit their access to loans and investment products they want. By trying to make many of the changes through regulatory agencies, the Trump administration may avoid a lengthy and perhaps futile battle with Democratic lawmakers. Although the White House and Congress are led by Republicans, Democrats in the Senate can block legislation and are unlikely to support any overhaul that eases rules on big banks. Some of the Treasury's proposals, like defanging the CFPB, would require new laws to be written and therefore face an uphill political battle. The report, which focused on banks, is the first of four examinations being carried out by the Treasury Department after Trump pledged to do a "big number" on the Dodd-Frank reform law.Proposals on capital markets, clearing houses and derivatives as well as the insurance and asset management industries and financial innovation and banking technology will come later. tags #US Treasury Department #World News Related news Business Last month was second hottest May on record: NASA Jun 16, 2017 11:34 AM Business Bank of Japan keeps monetary policy steady Jun 16, 2017 08:34 AM Business Eurozone agrees Greek bailout payment, IMF comes on board Jun 16, 2017 08:00 AM Business Britain, EU to begin Brexit negotiations on Monday: Official Jun 16, 2017 07:45 AM Business Nike to slash 1,400 jobs, cut sneaker styles in shakeup Jun 16, 2017 07:40 AM Business Is the Fed ready to consider lifting its inflation target?

BUSINESS COMPANY TOWN Megyn Kelly's interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones becomes a headache for NBC News Chris Pizzello / Invision/AP Megyn Kelly has stood by the decision to present Alex Jones on her show, saying it's her job to "shine a light" on newsmakers. Megyn Kelly has stood by the decision to present Alex Jones on her show, saying it's her job to "shine a light" on newsmakers. (Chris Pizzello / Invision/AP) Stephen BattaglioContact Reporter The social media backlash against Megyn Kelly’s NBC News interview with far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is showing how the transition from cable to broadcast news can be a tricky one. Kelly, who joined NBC after 12 years at Fox News, is the highest-profile cable star to cross over to broadcast news. While controversy often drives viewers to cable news personalities, it’s generally eschewed in the more buttoned-down environment of a broadcast network news division. NBC News poached Kelly from Fox News with the hope of making her a bigger star. But many TV news industry observers believe the negative publicity over an interview with a subject who isn’t considered a big TV “get” is not the formula for turning her new show into a hit. The network is feeling the heat in only the second week of its new newsmagazine “Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly,” the prime-time platform for the anchor reportedly earning $17 million a year. As a Fox News anchor, Kelly regularly received criticism from liberal media watchdogs and occasionally the ire of conservatives who grew disdainful of her tough coverage of President Donald Trump. Provocative political talk is what drives viewers to watch cable news every night as minute-to-minute ratings are often broken down to measure audience interest in every segment. But broadcast news programs — even with their diminished ratings — still have a level of stature that isn’t appropriate for a fringe figure such as Jones, said Joe Peyronnin, former network news executive and journalism professor at Hofstra University. “There is no journalistic reason to give him a prime-time network platform,” Peyronnin said. “While the controversy around the Alex Jones interview may draw higher viewer tune in, it will not benefit the American people, and has opened NBC News and Megyn Kelly to enormous criticism.“ In its second week on the air, “Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly” averaged 3.608 million viewers — down 2.5 million viewers from its June 4 debut. Jones — head of Infowars, a Web-based radio and video network that has relentlessly pushed conspiracy theories — has repeatedly suggested the shooting that killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 was a hoax staged to alter the country’s gun laws. He has made similar suggestions about the mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., the same year. After NBC aired a lengthy teaser Sunday that showed Kelly interviewing Jones for a segment scheduled to air this coming weekend on her program “Sunday Night,” hundreds of angry messages appeared on social media. “A new low,” Dianne Sherman posted on Twitter with a photo of the 20 children killed by gunman Adam Lanza in the shooting. “Have u no integrity or shame @megynkelly @NBC?” The negative response led JPMorgan Chase to pull back its local TV advertising on “Sunday Night” and other NBC News programming until after the Jones segment airs. NBC News did not respond to an inquiry on whether other advertisers are opting out of the episode. Kelly was also dropped as the host of a gala sponsored by Sandy Hook Promise, an anti-gun violence organization founded by the parents of children killed in the school shooting. The organizers cited the interview as a reason for dumping Kelly from the event scheduled for Wednesday. Kelly responded with a statement posted on her Twitter account that said she is disappointed with the organization’s decision. But she defended the interview, which is still scheduled to air. “I find Alex Jones’ suggestion that Sandy Hook was ‘a hoax’ as personally revolting as every other rational person does,” she said. Kelly’s statement went on to say that her interview is aimed at learning how Jones, “who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, has the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions…. Our goal in sitting down with him was to shine a light — as journalists are supposed to do — on this influential figure, and yes — to discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity.” David Montero Alex Jones backed down. Again. The far-right conspiracy theorist agreed Wednesday to settle a defamation lawsuit filed against him by Greek yogurt manufacturer Chobani. The key component of the settlement agreement required him to retract inflammatory comments about refugees and the company he... Alex Jones backed down. Again.

President Trump and his former national security advisor, Michael T. Flynn, have been open enthusiasts of Jones’ Infowars. Kelly was also defended Monday night by Liz Cole, an executive producer for NBC News, in an interview with CNN. "Viewers will see Megyn do a strong interview where she challenges [Jones] appropriately,” Cole said. “That's the benefit of putting him out there. When someone actually sits down and asks him questions and he has to come up with answers — there's value to that."

J.P. Morgan Chase has already pulled all ads from NBC News in the wake of Kelly’s sit-down with the megalomaniacal conspiracy theorist; in a tweet explaining the move, Chase’s chief marketing officer said she chose to pull the ads due to Jones’ repeated and soulless assertion that the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre—in which 20 children under the age of seven and six adults were brutally murdered—was a hoax. And now Kelly, who seems to have thought that Jones’ no-doubt musky stink wouldn’t rub off on her, has been dropped as the host of a Sandy Hook fundraiser, according to The Washington Post. Kelly was set to host the Promise Champions Gala, an annual event for the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation, in DC tomorrow night, an invitation that was withdrawn this morning. In a statement, co-founder and managing director Nicole Hockley says: “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host. It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” As for Jones, he doesn’t want the interview aired, either—presumably for different reasons—an objection he expressed the only way he knows how: by asserting her unfuckability. Meanwhile, Kelly asserts that it’s important to “shine a light” on Jones, given his buddy-buddy relationship with a certain would-be dictator currently occupying the White House. POTUS’s been on & praises @RealAlexJones’ show. He’s giving Infowars a WH press credential.

After word surfaced Monday that J.P. Morgan Chase does not want its advertising associated with a coming “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly” broadcast in which the star anchor will interview Jones, a nonprofit gun violence prevention group that has strong ties to the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Conn., has asked her not to appear at its annual gala. Among the specious theories Jones has promoted is that the Newtown shootings were a hoax. Lenny Pozner, the father of Jewish victim Noah Pozner, has been targeted by so-called “hoaxers” like Jones. Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit gun violence prevention group founded by families of the Newtown shooting victims, said Kelly had agreed that she will no longer host the organization’s annual Promise Champions Gala on Wednesday. The group said in a statement that the “decision was spurred by NBC’s planned broadcast of Kelly’s interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who believes the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT, was a hoax.” “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones,” said Nicole Hockley, the organization’s co-founder and managing director, in the statement.

Getty Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email NEW YORK -- An anti-gun violence organization founded by parents of children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School has dumped Megyn Kelly as host of an event in Washington this week because of her plans to broadcast an interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Kelly said Tuesday that she understands and respects the decision by Sandy Hook Promise to disinvite her as host of its Wednesday gala, but is disappointed. She said reporting on Jones' falsehoods is what journalists are supposed to do. NBC is taking considerable heat on social media for its Father's Day broadcast of Kelly's interview with "Infowars" host Alex Jones, who has questioned whether the killing of 26 people -- including 20 children -- in 2012 at the school in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax. The firm JPMorgan Chase has asked that its advertisements not run on the broadcast. "Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host," said Nicole Hockley, co-founder and managing director. "It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview." 31 Photos Sandy Hook shooting: One month later Newtown, Conn., marked the one month anniversary since the massacre of 26 children and adults at the school, the second-worst such shooting in U.... Hockley, whose 6-year-old son Dylan was killed at Sandy Hook, founded the group with Mark Barden, who lost his 7-year-old son Daniel. Kelly said that she found Jones' suggestion that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax "as personally revolting as every other rational person does. It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: How does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions?" Trump, she said, has helped elevate Jones with his attention and by granting "Infowars" press credentials to cover some White House events, she said. On Twitter, Kelly explained it was her obligation as a journalist to "shine a light" on Jones. POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential.

The interview has put Kelly, who jumped to NBC from Fox News Channel earlier this year, squarely back in the headlines. She was one of Trump's favorite targets during the presidential campaign because he was annoyed at tough questions she asked him at a debate. The New York Daily News put the controversy over the Alex Jones interview on its front page Tuesday, with the headline "Nutwork News." Jones, for his part, has already denounced the interview as "fake news." © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Contact me: zford@thinkprogress.org. Jun 13 Megyn Kelly and Alex Jones are playing each other. Megyn Kelly is losing. She’s lost an advertiser and a speaking gig, but he’s as pumped up as ever. CREDIT: Infowars Megyn Kelly’s upcoming interview with Alex Jones may not break any new ground, but it’s certainly creating drama. While Kelly seems to be hoping the radical conspiracy theorist will bolster ratings for her new show at NBC News, Jones is using the interview to further galvanize his followers’ distrust of the mainstream media. They’re both trying to play each other, and Kelly is clearly losing. The backlash from Sandy Hook family members, upset she would give airtime to someone who believes they faked their loved ones’ deaths, has already created real consequences for Kelly. JP Morgan has pulled all of its ads from not just Kelly’s show, but all NBC News programming this week — not wanting their ads to appear within any vicinity of promotions for the interview. JP Morgan’s chief marketing officer, Kristin Lemkau, said she was repulsed that Kelly would give Jones any airtime. Remarkably, Kelly was supposed to host a fundraising gala this week for the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation, a gun violence prevention non-profit founded by a group of family members who lost loved ones in the shooting. That’s no longer happening. “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” co-founder and managing director Nicole Hockley said in a statement. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” Kelly issued a statement Tuesday morning expressing disappointment that the organization had uninvited her but standing by her previous statement that the interview will “shine a light” on “the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity.” Meanwhile, Jones is capitalizing on the drama with a variety of strange content about his interactions with Kelly. He is simultaneously reveling that he scored a prime-time broadcast interview and attacking Kelly for being part of the “globalist” mainstream media. Even last week, before Kelly started promoting the interview, Jones was highlighting how cozy they got during her visit, even while expressing his contempt and mistrust. “I felt zero attraction to Megyn Kelly,” he said, “because you’re dealing with a sociopath? A psychopath? I don’t know. But I wanted to see it for myself: the girl next door sitting there with the toad creature.” In this clip, posted Monday, Jones opines, “Megyn Kelly’s playing with fire obviously. Nothing can save her show, nothing can save mainstream media.” He proceeded to compare her to Medusa the Gorgon, complete with side-by-side footage of Kelly visiting his studio and footage from an old Medusa film. Insisting the interview was clearly designed to be a hit piece against him, he explained, “I win by going into the gorgon’s pit, and I survive. I survive going into that lair, and that’s what it’s all about.” In another clip, Jones asserted, “Megyn Kelly lied to me several weeks before she came here, and she said that the interview was not going to be about Sandy Hook and the mass shooting there, and it was not going to be about Pizzagate and these other issues that the media always obsesses on and misrepresents what I’ve said and what I’ve done.” Based on the clip of the interview that’s been posted, Jones believes that Kelly has edited his answers out of context. He claims to have his own recordings of all their conversations, but he is now calling for Kelly to cancel airing the interview because he expects to be misrepresented. (This, of course, complicates the ability of NBC News to cancel the interview.) Jones now insists that he believes the Sandy Hook shooting “probably” did happen and that he was just playing devil’s advocate in the past. He still takes no responsibility for his followers who continue to harass those families, but he’s using the ambiguity to look like a victim and to further demonize Kelly. It’s thus unclear what good can come from the Kelly interview except to help Jones reach a wider audience. No matter how hard-hitting Kelly’s questions truly are — and that remains to be seen — they’ll still likely do nothing but raise Jones’ profile. She might be using him for ratings, but he’s getting the better end of the deal.
