A Yale-educated investment banker was convicted of insider trading charges Wednesday after a jury concluded he gave tips about mergers and acquisitions to his father, enabling over $1 million in illegal profits. Sean Stewart, 35, testified during the two-week Manhattan federal court trial, insisting he had no idea his father was sharing secrets with a broker to make trades ahead of public announcements on five separate deals that he oversaw while working at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Perella Weinberg Partners LP. As the verdict was read, Stewart was stoic, though he turned to look at his mother on a bench behind him. Sentencing was set for Feb. 17 for the Manhattan resident. Stewart's lawyer, Mark Gombiner, said the defense was damaged when Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled that Stewart's father could use the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying. "We have a lot of issues on appeal," he said. In a release, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: "Time and time again, Sean Stewart took his clients' most sensitive corporate secrets and fed them to his father on a silver platter for quick and illegal profits." The father, Robert Stewart, was sentenced to one year of home detention after pleading guilty to an insider trading charge. Prosecutors said evidence, including the timing of pivotal meetings regarding the corporate deals and subsequent trades in securities by the father and communications between the father and son soon afterward, made it obvious the son tipped his father intentionally. The father received about $150,000 while the stock broker got the rest of $1.1 million in profits, though prosecutors say the son benefited when his father used some of proceeds to pay for Stewart's wedding rehearsal dinner and for a wedding photographer. Richard Cunniffe, who executed some of the securities trades for Stewart's father, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and testified at the trial. The effort to show Sean Stewart received something in return for sharing secrets was important after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December 2014 changed the landscape of insider trading law by saying prosecutors needed to show that the person supplying secrets received something of value in return. Stewart's trial was the first to occur in Manhattan since that ruling. Testifying over two days, Stewart insisted he did nothing wrong, though he acknowledged breaking the rules of his employers when he talked openly and casually about secret deals with his family. He said he never told his father the dates that mergers would occur or the size of the deals, though he said he told his father that the timing of one of the deals conflicted with his scheduled spring 2001 wedding date. "I am innocent," Stewart testified. "I never ever gave my father information expecting him to trade." Prosecutors told jurors that Stewart continued to tell his father inside information even after he was confronted by JPMorgan lawyers about stock trades his father made surrounding a merger of companies the son helped arrange in early 2011. They said the father traded based on information he received from his son about four additional mergers afterward. Throughout the trial, defense lawyers blamed the father. Sean Stewart had testified that his father's bad acts "resulted in the loss of my career and reputation." In her closing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah McCallum said Stewart "five times ... handed his father tomorrow's news today."

Subsidized Employment Training Gives a Head Start SAMMinistries and JPMorgan Chase offer SET program to homeless SAMM-Logo-2014-Large   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Job Training * Jp Morgan Chase * SAMMinistries By Industry: * Non-profitSAN ANTONIO - Aug. 17, 2016 - PRLog -- SAMMinistries and JP Morgan Chase have joined forces to help the homeless break the unemployment cycle through the Subsidized Employment Training (SET) Program. In a two-part initiative, SAMMinistries recruits and screens appropriate candidates. Partnering employers then provide a 12-week training period with a consideration of permanent employment after. Through a generous grant from JP Morgan Chase, SAMMinistries reimburses employers for 50% of the trainee's wage during the initial period and oversees the employee's progress. "We provide screened candidates and partial wage reimbursement, so that businesses can spend less time searching and lower their training expenses, while at the same helping someone earn a living wage" said Navarra Williams, SAMMinistries President and CEO. "This program helps everyone succeed." This win-win program is designed to bridge the "skills gap" by training and preparing individuals for employment in the high-demand fields of healthcare, information technology, and manufacturing. These skills offer hope and open the door to living-wage employment, enabling individuals to support their families. Local businesses have a unique opportunity to partner with the non-profit sector—meeting their employment needs while giving back to the community. If your company is interested in this program, please contact Robert Mendoza, Senior Manager of Workforce Development, at 210-321-5663 or rmendoza@samm.org. About SAMMinistries: Overcoming Homelessness San Antonio Metropolitan Ministries, founded in 1983, is an interfaith ministry whose mission is to help the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless attain self-sufficiency by offering with dignity and compassion, shelter, housing, and services.

Battle for Talent Heats Up as Digital Banking Becomes Paramount By Robert Barba August 16, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Point-counterpoint: Citi said Tuesday that it had hired Gavin Michael from JPM to be its new head of tech for global consumer banking; JPMorgan is replacing him with Bill Wallace, a move that may have been in the works. Related JPM Names Digital Boss; Memo Implies Predecessor Forced Out of Role Citi Recruits JPM's Gavin Michael to Lead Consumer Technology Citi's Heather Cox Joining USAA as Chief Tech and Digital Officer How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue The battle among big banks for talented executives, especially technology execs, is rough and tumble, though usually behind the scenes. But it spilled out into the open Tuesday after two major banks — JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup — announced major changes in the ranks of their digital operations. Citi said that it had hired Gavin Michael, the digital chief for JPMorgan's consumer bank, to be its head of technology for global consumer banking. Michael was American Banker's Digital Banker of the Year for 2016. Then a JPMorgan Chase memo surfaced that said it was promoting Bill Wallace to take the job held by Michael. Wallace had been the head of operations for JPMorgan's consumer bank and ran its customer-experience council. The two announcements followed news late last week that Heather Cox, chief executive of Citi FinTech, will join USAA as chief technology and digital officer this fall. Whether Citigroup or JPMorgan Chase was the company in reactive mode Tuesday was uncertain, as a flurry of information and statements began to circulate that sought to put each company in the best light. Nonetheless, all the shuffling and the narratives made one thing apparent: scoring top digital talent has become incredibly important to the largest banks as they see mobile banking as the future of their businesses. The JPMorgan memo, dated Aug. 11 and obtained by American Banker on Tuesday, was written by Gordon Smith, the chief executive of the consumer bank. It says Smith had informed Michael that he was planning to move Michael out of his job. "Gavin Michael and I have discussed that he will be looking at other opportunities," Smith said in the memo following the passage that said Wallace had replaced him. "Gavin and I are working together to identify potential roles at JPMorgan Chase, and he's expressed an interest in looking outside as well." JPMorgan has a reputation for frequently shuffling managers, with executives often reassigned to various parts of the business. Smith noted that practice in the memo. "Customers look at us as one firm, and we have learned time and again that the best way to institutionalize a customer-first view, not business or product view, is to have people move across businesses and functions," Smith wrote. But Citigroup quickly countered. It said Michael replaced Mark Torkos as the head of technology. Citi announced in May that Torkos was planning to retire in July. At the time, Citi said it would quickly establish a slate of candidates to fill the role. On Tuesday, a spokeswoman said Michael was on that list. "We've been running our process since early summer and have been speaking to Gavin for some time," the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman also provided this statement from Michael. "Citi's Consumer Bank is well positioned to be a digital leader globally with scale and scope that present tremendous opportunities," Michael said. "As consumer behavior rapidly evolves, technology is a fundamentally transformative factor in how we engage, serve and acquire customers today and in the future. I am excited to join the Citi team and harness the power of new technologies to deliver a better, simpler, and safer customer experience." Under Michael's direction, JPMorgan launched a new mobile app and website and recruited key talent, Smith wrote in the memo. JPMorgan's mobile app has more active users (25 million) than any other bank in the U.S. A JPMorgan spokeswoman added Tuesday that Michael "helped us to build a foundation in digital and mobile banking that's put us well ahead of our competitors" but that "it's now time for us to build on that foundation, and Bill [Wallace] is a tremendously effective leader that can bring us to the next level. Meanwhile, JPMorgan said that Mike Ashworth, chief information officer of the consumer bank, succeeds Wallace as head of operations for the consumer bank. Saul Van Buerden is set to become chief information officer of the consumer bank. "These moves are designed to broaden our leadership team with new assignments," Smith said in the memo. "We know mobility creates stronger, end-to-end leaders and these changes will help strengthen our focus on three essential areas."

When Chase Pay goes live later this year, Phillips 66 will support mobile payments service through the Chase Pay app at its Phillips 66, Conoco and 76-branded fuel stations and stores.

Roz Edward, Michigan Chronicle Managing Editor Leave a comment Cities of Service will support the City of Detroit, alongside two other cities, in building local capacity and increasing citizen engagement  The City of Detroit will receive $100,000 in grant funding, along with consulting services and other assistance from Cities of Service, to support the installation of a Chief Service Officer. The Chief Service Officer is a senior-level administration staff member who will plan, direct, coordinate, and evaluate the implementation of a comprehensive, citywide service plan that engages citizen volunteers in communities where they can have significant impact. Supported with $450,000 from JPMorgan Chase, Cities of Service is establishing a new cohort of Chief Service Officers in three major US cities, selected through a competitive review process. Detroit is one of the selected cities, along with Miami and Phoenix. The chosen Chief Service Officer for Detroit is Victoria Kovari, who previously served as General Manager for Mayor Mike Duggan’s Department of Neighborhoods. Victoria Kovari will combine her two roles as General Manager and Chief Service Officer in order to strengthen the city’s neighborhoods by engaging citizens. The Chief Service Officer role is instrumental in building the city’s capacity to address its most pressing challenges. The role serves as a champion for citizen volunteers, a voice for the mayor, a partner to city agencies, and a conduit for businesses and community groups. This model has been proven in multiple cities, including in Orlando, where a 2010 Cities of Service Leadership Grant helped the city launch Orlando Cares, which features six volunteer programs developed with community input. Since 2011, these programs have resulted in more than 6,310 youth served, more than 2,200 volunteers engaged, and more than 35 community partnerships. “Chief Service Officers are force multipliers, forging relationships and engaging partners across sectors to help local government address their city’s most pressing problems,” said Cities of Service Executive Director Myung J. Lee. “The support from JPMorgan Chase will enable us to help Detroit, Miami, and Phoenix partner with residents to tackle some of their cities’ major challenges, including hunger, school success, and urban blight.” In Detroit, Kovari will leverage the strength of the Department of Neighborhoods to coordinate all community engagement and volunteering activities in the city, aiming to reduce blight and prevent crime. She will lead the city’s efforts to further engage Detroit’s citizens, including partnering with neighborhood leaders, clergy, youth, educators, and small business owners to determine which volunteering initiatives will have the greatest positive impact on quality of life in the city. “We thank Cities of Service for its commitment to helping Detroit meet its challenges,” Mayor Mike Duggan said. “This grant, made possible with support from JPMorgan Chase, will go a long way to helping our citizens get more engaged, leading to stronger neighborhoods and a more active community.” About Cities of Service Founded in September 2009 in New York City by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and 16 other mayors from across the nation, Cities of Service is a national nonprofit organization that supports mayors and city chief executives in their efforts to engage local communities and residents, identify challenges, and solve problems together. Today, the Cities of Service coalition is comprised of over 215 cities in the US and UK, representing nearly 55 million people in 45 states, and more than 10 million people in the UK. Cities of Service works with cities to build city-led, citizen-powered initiatives that target specific needs, achieve long-term and measurable outcomes, improve the quality of life for residents, and build stronger cities.

People Moves Regulation Halls of Justice Institutional Tech & Services Indices In Depth Contributors Lifestyle Banks Ask Fed For Five-Year Extension On Volcker Rule Compliance Aug 12 2016 | 2:04pm ET By Olivia Oran (Reuters) - Big Wall Street banks are asking the U.S. Federal Reserve to grant them an additional five-year grace period to comply with a financial reform regulation known as the Volcker rule, people familiar with the matter said. If the Fed agrees, the extension would give banks more time to exit fund investments that are difficult to sell, but no longer allowed by the law. The added grace period, which follows three one-year extensions, would start next year and run through 2022. The law on Volcker rule implementation says banks can ask for an extra five-year extension for "illiquid" funds, where banks had contractual commitments to invest. In deciding whether to grant Wall Street more leeway, the Fed has asked banks to provide details on their specific investments to prove that they fall under the statutory definition of "illiquid," said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss non-public regulatory discussions. Those seeking the extension include Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and some other banks, the sources said. They are making their push in part through Wall Street lobbying group the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). "SIFMA is working with our members to ensure that regulators have the data they need to adequately appraise the situation," the association said in a statement to Reuters. Congress intended to provide "an appropriate transition period" so that banks could exit illiquid funds without disrupting markets, SIFMA added. The banks and the Federal Reserve declined to comment. The Volcker rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, is part of the sweeping 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. It aims to reduce risk-taking by preventing banks from using their own capital to make speculative bets. Critics say its many loopholes – with exemptions for activities like merchant banking and foreign exchange trading – have made it less effective than it was intended to be. "It's laughable that the biggest, most sophisticated financial firms in the world claim they can't sell the stakes year after year," said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of non-profit Better Markets. "Everyone else in America has to comply with the law and Wall Street should also." TOUGH CALL The Fed has already granted three one-year extensions for compliance with a broader provision of the Volcker rule regarding stakes in hedge funds and private equity funds – the maximum number of extensions it could provide in that context. The new requests, which were widely expected, concern only "illiquid" fund investments. The Fed risks criticism for giving Wall Street more wiggle room, but also risks blame for fire-sale losses or for banks and their investor clients getting tied up in court if they are forced to exit certain contractual agreements quickly. Before the crisis, big banks had proprietary trading desks that made bets on market direction, as well as in-house hedge funds, investments in external hedge funds and co-investments alongside clients in internal private-equity funds. Underlying assets could range from investments in private companies to real estate and long-dated derivatives. While the regulated banks have spun off much of that activity, bankers say there are still some investments that do not contractually expire for years or lack a liquid market for an immediate sale. But disclosures are few and far between, making it difficult to independently discern how truly illiquid the investments are. Banks are now asking the Fed for more time to exit stakes in funds they deem to be illiquid, sources said. In response, the Fed is demanding more details about why the funds, or their underlying assets, are considered illiquid, how much time it would take to exit the investments and what efforts have been made to exit investments sooner, sources said. In granting banks its final one-year extension last month, the Fed said it would soon provide details on how it will address illiquid funds. Banks have been selling down non-compliant investments over the last several years, with Goldman having reduced its exposure by more than half since mid-2013. Yet in regulatory filings, banks have said they may face difficulty in getting rid of those investments by upcoming deadlines. As of June 30, Goldman Sachs held $7 billion worth of private equity investments, real estate holdings and hedge funds affected by the Volcker rule. In March, Goldman said it expected to sell the majority of those stakes before the July 2017 deadline, but it removed that language in its most recent quarterly filing. Morgan Stanley, which has about $3.2 billion in real estate and private equity funds, recently said it expected to be able to divest much of those investments. But the bank said in a second-quarter filing that it expected to ask for further extensions "for certain illiquid funds." JPMorgan has around $1 billion in hedge funds, private equity and real estate investments. E-mail This Print This Order Reprints Twitter LinkedIn Facebook.

JPM Names Digital Boss; Memo Implies Predecessor Forced Out of Role By Robert Barba August 16, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related The Aussie Behind the App JPMorgan Chase Takes Site Remodel Beyond Login Page Chase's Website Redesign Focuses on Customers, Not Sales Citi's Heather Cox Joining USAA as Chief Tech and Digital Officer How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue Longtime JPMorgan Chase veteran Bill Wallace is set to become digital chief for its consumer bank. Wallace's new role was announced by Gordon Smith, the chief executive of the consumer bank, in an Aug. 11 internal memo reviewed by American Banker. Wallace most recently served as the head of operations for JPMorgan's consumer bank and runs its customer-experience council. In the memo, Smith says that he had discussed the changes with Gavin Michael, the current head of digital. On Tuesday, Citi announced that Michael would be joining that company as its head of technology for global consumer banking. [Update: Read our follow-up story on the recent digital-banking-executive shuffle here.] Smith said in the memo that he and Michael discussed some other potential roles for Michael at the company, but that Michael had also expressed an interest in "outside" opportunities. Smith noted in the memo that under Michael's direction, the company launched a new mobile app and website. He also recruited and developed "some fabulous talent on the digital team who are helping shape the future of our customer experience." JPMorgan's mobile app has more active users (25 million) than any other bank in the U.S. Alongside Wallace's promotion, Smith announced that Mike Ashworth, chief information officer of the consumer bank, would succeed Wallace as head of operations for the consumer bank. Saul Van Buerden is set to become chief information officer of the consumer bank. "These moves are designed to broaden our leadership team with new assignments," Smith said in the memo. "We know mobility creates stronger, end-to-end leaders and these changes will help strengthen our focus on three essential areas."

'Show Me' Quality "While we're bullish, there's a 'show me' element in play as management focuses on improving sales force productivity and as recent shifts in product mix toward SaaS/ Online delay revenue recognition and weigh on profitability. We see this shift as necessary and positive longer-term," analyst Ittai Kidron wrote in a note. Kidron, who started coverage of the stock with an Outperform rating and $62 price target, noted that Tableau helped usher in Modern BIA and democratized analytics for all users with its Tableau Desktop. Related Link: Rosenblatt Initiates Coverage On Tableau Software At Buy The company's products currently support over 46,000 customers in over 160 countries and enjoy strong user loyalty given their compelling value proposition and attractive total cost of ownership. "We estimate Tableau's total '15 TAM at ~$17.8 billion (vs. '15 sales of $654 million) and growing to $24.1 billion by 2019, which reflects a 7.8 percent CAGR," Kidron highlighted. Making Its Own Way However, the analyst acknowledged that the competition is improving and becoming more price aggressive. But, Tableau is also making its own price moves. "While a risk, Modern BIA is still at a life-cycle point where discounting likely drives higher growth/penetration than compromises Tableau's business model," Kidron continued. As such, the analyst expects the shares to remain volatile over the next few quarters as Tableau's revenue model evolves and as investors gradually gain confidence in its model transformation. Kidron expects 2016/2017 EPS of $0.27/$0.46 on revenue of $832 million/$1 billion. At the time of writing, shares of Tableau were down 0.59 percent to $54.31.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 16, 2016 2:05pm   Comments Share: Related IBM Expect Hewlett Packard Enterprise Shares To Stay Under Pressure Near Term Short Sellers' Sizzling 6: The 6 Hottest Stocks Among These Investors IBM Makes Case For More Upside, But Is It A Strong One? (Investor's Business Daily) Oppenheimer said International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) is "turning a corner, slowly" as it initiated coverage of the stock with a Perform rating. The brokerage said IBM has refocused its business on key initiatives to return to consistent revenue and FCF growth after several years of decline. IBM's SI focuses on analytics, cloud, mobile, security, and social, through both organic as well as acquisitions. "Based on our analysis, we believe IBM could stabilize revenue in 2016 and drive marginal growth (0%-2%) in 2017 and beyond, as its transformation takes hold," analyst Ittai Kidron wrote in a note. The analyst sees SI revenue growth at a 7.6-11.5 percent CAGR through 2019 (reaching $38.9 billion-$44.8 billion in 2019), driven by growth in cognitive and predictive analytics (4-8 percent), and in cloud (14-20 percent). Kidron expects if IBM is able to grow the SI revenue at the estimated rate, it would account for 52 percent of IBM's total revenue. For context, growth in SI revenue stood at a 16.7 percent CAGR (2012-2015), making for revenue of $29.0 billion in 2015 (about 36 percent of IBM's total revenue), up from $18.3 billion in 2012 (about 18 percent of IBM's total revenue). The analyst believes IBM has potential to deliver significant EPS upside on consistent execution, and noted that one percentage point increase in revenue growth or operating margin can boost EPS by 4-5 percent. To become more constructive on the stock, Kidron says SI should get closer to 50 percent of revenue, an event that would propel IBM to deliver more consistent upside and see multiple expansion. "While we have a positive bias, we believe IBM is not far enough along in its transformation to deliver upside on a consistent basis, a needed element for multiple expansion. This leads to our neutral view," Kidron added.

JPM Names Digital Boss; Memo Implies Predecessor Forced Out of Role By Robert Barba August 16, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related The Aussie Behind the App JPMorgan Chase Takes Site Remodel Beyond Login Page Chase's Website Redesign Focuses on Customers, Not Sales Citi's Heather Cox Joining USAA as Chief Tech and Digital Officer How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue Longtime JPMorgan Chase veteran Bill Wallace is set to become digital chief for its consumer bank. Wallace's new role was announced by Gordon Smith, the chief executive of the consumer bank, in an Aug. 11 internal memo reviewed by American Banker. Wallace most recently served as the head of operations for JPMorgan's consumer bank and runs its customer-experience council. In the memo, Smith says that he had discussed the changes with Gavin Michael, the current head of digital. On Tuesday, Citi announced that Michael would be joining that company as its head of technology for global consumer banking. [Update: Read our follow-up story on the recent digital-banking-executive shuffle here.] Smith said in the memo that he and Michael discussed some other potential roles for Michael at the company, but that Michael had also expressed an interest in "outside" opportunities. Smith noted in the memo that under Michael's direction, the company launched a new mobile app and website. He also recruited and developed "some fabulous talent on the digital team who are helping shape the future of our customer experience." JPMorgan's mobile app has more active users (25 million) than any other bank in the U.S. Alongside Wallace's promotion, Smith announced that Mike Ashworth, chief information officer of the consumer bank, would succeed Wallace as head of operations for the consumer bank. Saul Van Buerden is set to become chief information officer of the consumer bank. "These moves are designed to broaden our leadership team with new assignments," Smith said in the memo. "We know mobility creates stronger, end-to-end leaders and these changes will help strengthen our focus on three essential areas."

Citi Recruits JPM's Gavin Michael to Lead Consumer Technology By Tanaya Macheel August 16, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Gavin Michael IMAGE: Jordan Hollender Related Digital Banker of the Year: JPMorgan Chase's Gavin Michael The Aussie Behind the App JPMorgan Chase Takes Site Remodel Beyond Login Page Chase's Website Redesign Focuses on Customers, Not Sales How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue Gavin Michael, head of digital banking for JPMorgan Chase's retail unit, is moving to Citigroup. Michael will replace Mark Torkos as head of technology for global consumer banking, which includes branded cards and retail services, retail banking and mortgages, commercial banking and Citi FinTech. Torkos retired in July. The news follows the announcement that Heather Cox, chief executive of Citi FinTech, will join USAA as chief technology and digital officer this fall. In his new role Michael will lead the long-term strategic direction, planning and management of Citi's technology organization and oversee its cloud architecture and data and services strategies. Michael "brings a depth of international experience driving an enterprise-wide digital agenda and a unique blend of expertise across branch technology innovation, data analytics, product design, engineering and core and consumer technology," Stephen Bird, the CEO of the global consumer bank, said in a staff memo shared with American Banker. Michael joined JPMorgan in 2013 and helped launch its digital revolution, beginning with an overhaul of its mobile app. Last June, JPMorgan became the first large bank to adopt Touch ID for customers who use Apple devices. He also led an in-house team through a complete redesign of its website — the first in a decade — unveiled this March. Shortly afterward, he was named American Banker's 2016 Digital Banker of the Year. Michael will begin his new role Nov. 14. Anil Wadhwani, head of operations for global consumer banking, will lead the technology organization in the interim.

There was a brief stint as operations supervisor for a Steak 'n Shake restaurant in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio. There were jobs at several call centers, selling phones at AT&T and Verizon stores, and as a customer service rep at JPMorgan Chase. In between, he started (and didn’t finish) a handful of college degree programs, completed a certificate in broadcasting, and even joined the Air Force.

He finally hit his stride last year after completing a free training program in information technology (IT) skills. There was a high demand for such skills from local businesses; before even receiving his certification, Easley was entertaining possible jobs at Time Warner Cable and with a defense contractor. Salary offers were coming in at $43,000 per year – twice as much as he had ever earned. Easley’s story is far from unique. A growing body of evidence is showing promising career results for people who train in moderately technical skills that employers in manufacturing, IT, and healthcare say they desperately need.   Called “sector-based” or "skills-based" training, this model – of finding out what jobs community businesses need to fill and training people for them – has the potential to re-invigorate workforce development at a precarious time in the country’s economy, supporters say. According to employers and economists, there aren’t enough workers with the right skills to fill the plethora of jobs, from machinists to health technicians, that don’t require a college degree. That's why twenty-one states now use sector-based training to plug those skills gaps in their local labor markets.   The model also has gained national political traction in recent years. President Obama, once a staunch proponent of college-for-all, has devoted more attention to training workers for existing, unfilled jobs in his second term.  As a Virginia senator, vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine introduced legislation last year to make more Pell Grant dollars, which help fund education for low-income students, available for short-term skills training. Hillary Clinton has a set of proposals for skills training , and said in her DNC speech in July that training for existing jobs would be a priority.  The model is by no means perfect. It can serve only a limited number of workers who have certain qualities, such as an aptitude for math, or the constitution to work in certain medical jobs. There’s also the threat of training people for specific skills that may not easily transfer to other industries if the labor market changes. “There are some major challenges involved in bringing these programs to a scale sufficient to really improve outcomes for less-educated workers, while maintaining program quality,” Georgetown University economist Harry J. Holzer wrote in a 2015 analysis for the US Department of Labor. Still, he concluded, those challenges can be overcome. Filling a void According to the National Skills Coalition, a Washington-based career-training advocacy group, the need for workers in middle-skilled jobs in the US will remain one of the economy’s most pronounced in the near term. Indeed, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data show a surplus of bachelor’s degrees  in the workforce, while moderately skilled positions languish.  Middle-skill jobs — jobs that require more than a high school diploma but not a four-year degree — make up 54 percent of jobs in the US economy. But only 44 percent of US workers are trained at the middle-skill level. National Skills Coalition Through 2022, the share of high-skill jobs, including lawyers and doctors, is expected to stay stagnant at 31 percent, the skills coalition estimates. The number of middle-skilled jobs, which call for training but no college degree, will continue to make up the bulk of work , though dropping slightly from 54 to 49 percent in the next six years. “There was an ideology and philosophy that the only good job out there is one for which you need a four-year degree,” Andy Van Kleunen, chief executive officer of the coalition, tells the Monitor. “The data never showed that.” Besides helping employers, studies show that skills-based training gives an earnings boost to workers in the middle of the economy, which has been hardest-hit by a shift in the labor market that makes it much harder to earn a living wage without post-secondary education.  For instance, a June brief describing a controlled study of 2,600 low-wage workers reported a 14-percent rise, on average, in annual earnings – or $1,945 – for those who completed a skills-based training program. Researchers from MDRC, the public-policy organization that conducted the survey, characterized the findings as an “encouraging” indicator of their effectiveness. Easley had the kind of success the model was built for. His free, eight-week training in A+, a certification for computer technicians, was organized by the Ohio branch of New York City-based nonprofit Per Scholas, a pioneer in the field of IT career training for low-income workers. Besides computer skills, Per Scholas teaches how to evaluate benefits packages, ask for raises, and navigate the uncertain path of career advancement. Per Scholas was one of four nonprofits in New York City, Cleveland, and Tulsa, Okla. to participate in MDRC’s research . The nonprofit raised annual earnings for its workers by 26 percent, or about $3,700. Other nonprofits showed weaker results, partly because it took them time to build relationships with local businesses, says MDRC. In some cases, it was because they trained people for jobs that were plentiful when the study began, but disappeared by the time it was over.  Pivoting careers That’s what happened to Austin Rhine, a participant in the MDRC study based in Tulsa. Less than a year after training and getting placed in a job as a CNC (computer numeric controlled) machinist at McKissick, a manufacturer of equipment for the oil and gas industry, he was laid off with a wave of cutbacks. “I was just kind of bummed,” says Mr. Rhine. The oil glut that has sent oil prices plummeting in recent years has devastated the oil and gas industry in Oklahoma, which drives the local economy. Thousands of people have lost jobs in the Tulsa region as energy companies have downsized or gone bust. “Our model was based on training and placing people when oil and gas was on this huge boom,” says Karen Pennington, the managing director of Madison Strategies Group, the nonprofit that trained Rhine. “And a year-and-a-half ago it [went] crashing down.” Rhine is emblematic of one of the biggest drawbacks to sector-based training: the threat of training people for very specific jobs skills that may not be transferable to other industries. “That’s one caveat about the strategy,” says Richard Hendra, a senior researcher at MDRC. “With specialization comes risk, so you’re going to have to be nimble.”             Happily, Rhine’s skills proved useful beyond oil and gas. He was a good at math and a hard worker, impressing his instructors so much that he snagged the McKissick position just a couple of months into his four-month training program. Madison was able to find him a job as a machinist for an aerospace manufacturer within a couple of weeks of his being laid off. The nonprofit now is steering its CNC machinist training program towards aerospace manufacturing, an industry expected to grow for years in the region. “I think there’s no greater sin than training people that desperately need a higher income and better career opportunities in an industry where they can’t work,” says Ms. Pennington.  Working with employers  Responding to the changing needs of local businesses is key to the success of demand-based training programs, say advocates of the model. But until recently, it wasn’t standard practice in the workforce development field. In past decades, such training programs “focused so much on the worker,” explains MDRC’s Dr. Hendra. “They weren’t very good at working with employers.” Meanwhile, although the number of college graduates has grown, businesses have complained they can’t find workers for moderately technical jobs. “I spent an entire year going to high schools and junior high schools talking to classes and explaining that you don’t have to go to college if you’re not on the college path,” says Kenneth Statton, who hired Madison’s trainees at M&M Manufacturing, an aerospace manufacturer in Tulsa, which he sold last year.  Mr. Statton was part of a coalition of local business leaders working with high schools, nonprofits like Madison, and community colleges to build a pipeline of workers for the manufacturing industry. They targeted kids who weren’t likely to go to college. “The realization came in 2008 to 2009 that if we were going to, as a group of manufacturers in this region, get the qualified help we needed, we were going to have to train it ourselves,” says Statton. Another challenge: funding  In addition to keeping up with the twists and turns of the labor market, modern skills training programs face another major challenge: funding. Federal investment in skills training has declined by an estimated 83 percent between 1980 and 2008, largely because federal programs from past decades, which taught general skills and polished resumes, were found to be ineffective.  In 2014, President Obama signed a renewal of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), which made sector training a requirement for states. But the law allocated 43 percent less funding than the previous renewal, 16 years earlier. Today, the government doles out $2.7 billion for workforce development annually, compared with $4.74 billion in 2000, adjusted for inflation. At the same time, increasing access to college has become more of a priority. In today's dollars, subsidies in the form of federal Pell Grants have ballooned from about $10 billion distributed every year to students in 2000 to about $30 billion in 2016. Only 4 percent of this money goes to middle-skill career training, estimates the National Skills Coalition. Skills-training advocates say that while they don’t propose cutting funding for college, they would like to see more grants available for people for whom college might not be an option. But some, including Donald E. Heller, dean of the college of education at Michigan State University, worry that diverting more Pell funds to technical training programs could mean less money going to help low-income students fund college . “In an ideal world, you’d like to be able to support people in some short-term programs to upgrade their skills,” Dr. Heller told the New York Times in 2013. “In a world where it’s a zero-sum game , if you’re talking about taking away money from traditional financial aid programs, it’s hard for me to support that.”  On an individual level, at least, skills training has been a vital source of encouragement for the workers they have reached. Though Easley still hopes to finish college some day, he says the support he got from Per Scholas was life-changing.  “One thing that a lot of people don’t understand is that if you grow up in a low-income situation you may not have that home support, that mom or dad that says, ‘You can do it, Johnny, you can do whatever you put your mind to, I believe in you,'” he says.

The biggest element in the loss was one-off charges booked after the collapse of a dam at the Samarco iron ore site in Brazil in November. The site was run as a joint venture with Brazil's Vale and the dam's collapse killed 19 people. The flooding wrecked farm land and reached towns, preventing people from returning to their homes. "I think it is worthwhile putting that loss into perspective ... most of it is due to exceptional charges that we took for the Samarco dam, for our onshore U.S. business and some tax matters," BHP Billiton CEO Andrew Mackenzie told CNBC after the company's earnings were out. The Anglo-Australian firm said in its earnings statement that it had recognized a provision of $1.2 billion before tax and after discounting on June 30. Energy prices Symbol Price   Change %Change Volume OIL --- BRENT --- NAT GAS --- RBOB GAS --- Even excluding $7.7 billion in writedowns and charges, underlying profit slumped 81 percent to $1.2 billion for the year to June 2016 from $6.4 billion a year ago, hit by weak iron ore, copper, coal, oil and gas prices. The underlying profit was better than analysts' expectations of around $1.1 billion. As a result of the profit beat, BHP Billiton shares listed on the London Stock Exchange rose by 3.6 percent on Tuesday morning before paring some gains. UBS confirmed on Tuesday this was BHP Billiton's worst-ever loss since the merger of of BHP Limited and Billiton Plc in 2001. It is believed to also be the largest reported loss for BHP since the company's inception in 1851. "What kind of bothered me when I saw the numbers (from BHP Billiton) come out was that specifically, even in the second half of the year, all of the commodity prices that they sell fell down by double-digits, as far as what they were receiving is concerned and debt actually rose a little bit here on the annual numbers," Paul Renken, senior geologist and mining analyst at VSA Capital, told CNBC on Tuesday. "That tells me they are a little bit behind the curve, as far as cost of provisions and so forth ... Other mining companies are being able to see ... improvements in margins and you see that with Antofagasta, for instance." Metal prices Symbol Price   Change %Change Volume GOLD --- SILVER --- COPPER --- PLATINUM --- Mackenzie concurred debt levels could be lower. "I think there is confidence in the business and the reforms and the simplification that we have driven over the last three or four years has made us much more efficient and we are now using that efficiency in slightly improving markets. But at the same time, we do acknowledge that we would like to have slightly lower debt and therefore we have kept some back for the balance sheet and I think we will continue to do that until our debt is a little bit lower," he told CNBC. BHP Billiton Group is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia. It is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, with a secondary listing in Johannesburg. The London-listed stock is a component of the benchmark FTSE 100. It has jumped by over 40 percent this year, but remains far-below levels traded at prior to the commodities rout of July 2014 onward. —Reuters contributed to this article.

By Theresa W. Carey Biography March 7, 2015 Methodology: “How We Ranked Our Best Online Brokers” Tables: “How the Brokers Stack Up” The Nasdaq Composite cracked 5000 last Monday for the first time since March of 2000, stoking reminiscences about sock puppets, Internet follies, and 20-something day traders trying to get rich in their parents’ basements. Thankfully, these memories have mostly faded in the last 15 years. Unmentioned were fears about the Y2K computer glitch that was supposed to empty brokerage accounts and grab airplanes out of the sky. It never came to pass, but the issue of computer security hasn’t gone away. Data breaches reached a record high of 783 in the U.S. during 2014, according to the Identity Theft Research Center, which tracks the figures. In the highest profile case, hackers got access to personal information on 76 million households from JPMorgan Chase computers.

Ilustration: Scott Pollack for Barron's In our preparation for the 20th anniversary of Barron’s Annual Broker Survey, we still were a little surprised to see how high concerns about both their accounts and their brokers’ data had risen on investors’ worry list in the last year. Although financial institutions are just a small target for computer hackers generally, some respondents said they’re constantly worried that data such as Social Security numbers could be pilfered outside the financial system and then used to steal their money from a bank or brokerage. (See related story: “Best Online Brokers: Fidelity Wins in Barron’s 2016 Survey”, March 19, 2016.) Barron’s top online brokers of 2015 are trying to respond to these threats. Many devote space on their Websites to security issues. Charles Schwab SCHW 2.301255230125523% Charles Schwab Corp.

Firstrade Securities CEO John Liu says he’s trying to weave security consciousness into his firm’s culture: “We are training all of our employees to be security aware, and that attacks can come from anywhere at any time.” Liu notes that the highest-profile data breaches are almost always the result of a lack of security-focused discipline in the corporate culture Among the initiatives the brokers and the Securities and Exchange Commission are pushing is the use of two-step verification, something half of the brokers in this year’s review offer (for all the encryption and authorization features available, such as secure HTTP sites and extended validation, see our “How the Brokers Stack Up” tables). In two-factor authentication, a customer receives a random number available for just a minute or two that he or she has to enter, along with user ID and password, to log in. RSA Security, the company that makes most of the two-factor authentication devices in use, last year introduced SecurID Software Tokens that work with an increasingly popular trading venue, mobile devices. Enlarge Image Close Brokers are putting new systems in place that monitor customers’ accounts for unusual behavior, or for logins from suspect geographical areas. EOption’s COO, Shawn Herrin, tells of a customer who logged into his account from a library in Budapest while traveling. His user ID and password were picked up by a bad guy using a packet sniffer that can detect unencrypted messages across a network. The firm’s monitoring software was able to intervene and cancel a transaction before it settled, but the incident prompted eOption to hire an outside firm to run a stress test on its entire operation. “They reported back to us on our vulnerabilities, and we fixed them,” says Herrin. Key to maintaining the privacy of your financial and personal data is your own behavior. Scottrade is one of several firms that are providing more security information to clients. The basic idea, says Erik Merkau, senior vice president of brokerage strategy and products, is to educate investors about “remaining vigilant and checking their account statements regularly as well as taking advantage of available resources, such as the ability to receive one free credit report annually from credit bureaus” that can alert them to problems. Another possibility is limiting access to your brokerage account to just one device at a time, an option that Capital One ShareBuilder and Interactive Brokers now offer. That’s one way to prevent outsiders from stealing your personal data. ShareBuilder and Interactive Brokers also are among the brokers that will give you a “read-only” password, an idea supported by a Barron’s reader we contacted. These are helpful when you’re using Websites such as SigFig or apps like Mint, which evaluate portfolio holdings and transactions and try to provide you with financial advice and reports. Read-only passwords, which allow either an app or an advisor to look at your account but not to make any changes, are still pretty rare for brokerage accounts. But if you think one might be useful, ask your broker to add this service; squeaky wheels do get greased. In a missive issued a month ago, the SEC put forth some common-sense recommendations: Use a strong password, create different passwords for your various accounts, avoid public computers, and be careful with wireless connections—including a wireless home network. Some of the latest trends in online brokerage put even more stress on personal and brokerage securities systems. As noted last year (“When All Screens Lead to the Bull,” March 17, 2014), mobile applications have proliferated so that you can connect with virtually any broker via your iPhone, or an Android or Windows-powered smartphone as well as their related tablets. Late last week Apple (AAPL) disclosed that it new mobile-payment system, Apple Pay, had been hit by a number of fraudulent transaction using credit-card data stolen from big retail chains such as Home Depot HD 0.007634753397465262% Home Depot Inc.

Enlarge Image Close Brokers expect mobile to continue to grow, both in terms of trading activity and platform capabilities. “Increased adoption by consumers of more-powerful mobile devices, both phones and tablets, means consumers will want more enhanced features and powerful trading tools only recently available on the desktop,” says Steve Claussen, chief investment strategist at OptionsHouse. Charles Schwab’s Kelli Keough, senior vice president of trading services, says, “We expect to see more firms providing traders with visual, synthesized information and a simple, easy-to-use work flow with a consistent experience whether they are using a mobile app, downloadable software, or a Web application.” We saw several excellent examples of responsive Web design this year. The intent is to adapt your view to the size of your current device, whether you’ve got three monitors blazing away on your desktop or you’re peering at your account data on your smartphone. TradeKing, which is taking a mobile-first approach to its site redesign, wants to create a similar experience with its services, no matter which device you’re using. Investors continue to gain more confidence in Nasdaq’s newest darlings, social-media companies. It “has become an integral part of day-to-day life for many of our clients, not just as a community for investors, but also as a way to share information and uncover useful investing insights,” says Steve Quirk, senior vice president of TD Ameritrade’s Trader Group. The broker giant has integrated Twitter into its platform, which tracks social-media sentiment and tries to capitalize on its ability to share information via its thinkorswim unit. “We believe these innovations can help our clients become better informed investors and we will continue to leverage the power of social media as we develop new features and tools,” says Quirk. To pinpoint 2015’s top brokers, we analyzed not just their security, mobility, and social media features but the depth of their investment tools and their trading capabilities. Our primary consideration in judging these 18 firms is how they work for our readers, who are high-net-worth active investors. Customization, especially of reports, is a particular focus, as is the ability to move smoothly from idea generation to a trade ticket. We think it’s important for investors and traders to understand which of their strategies work—and which need a little more work. Consolidation continues to whittle away at the number of online brokers. Last year’s No. 2, tradeMonster, is now running successfully under the banner of OptionsHouse (“OptionsHouse Rebuilt,” Feb. 2). We’re happy to report that a former participant, Firstrade, which took last year off from our review, has returned. We decided not to include any of the 100 or so firms that utilize the Interactive Brokers platform as-is, a practice known as white labeling, which meant we had to say goodbye to Place Trade and could not include newcomer ZacksTrade. Still, a dozen-and-a-half online brokers make for a very competitive marketplace. The recent launch of zero-commission mobile app trading by Robinhood Markets has sparked a lot of conversations, but no followers as yet. “There’s no such thing as a free lunch,” says Catherine Clay, CEO of Livevol. She adds, “You’ll not find a nonprofit brokerage company. They will make their money one way or another.” Ram Subramaniam, president of Fidelity’s retail brokerage business, says his firm looks at more than commission rates in its appeal to retail investors. It also wants to offer customers price improvement on their trades so they are getting a better deal when they buy or sell securities. In a recent study by Barron’s (“The Little Guy Wins,” March 2), Fidelity ranked No. 1 by this measure. The firm’s retail customers saved $8.40 in price improvement on average for a 1,000-share marketable order, which essentially makes their commissions net-negative. A “free” trade could cost quite a bit if the broker is relying on payment for order flow rather than trying to create price improvement opportunities. Regardless of their approach, online brokers do seem to be winning more business. Of the brokers who report customer activity, the number of retail accounts grew by 5.1% between December 2013 and December 2014. Reflecting the overall market rise as well as account growth, assets held at these brokers grew 17.8%. Total retail trades increased 9.4% across all asset classes for our group of brokers, showing healthy activity. Mobile trades, which comprised 5.5% of all retail trades placed during December 2013, exceeded 7% in December 2014, a gain of 43.7%. With Nasdaq and other exchanges all near or at record highs, the more innovative brokers in our list are enjoying more activity. But let’s see which brokers are doing the best job to deserve all this business. Three of them received 4½ stars (out of 5) and sit atop this year’s ranking. Interactive Brokers, No. 1 for the fourth year in a row, edged out newly launched OptionsHouse, in second, and TD Ameritrade, third. These three firms offer very different online experiences and are meant to appeal to different types of investors and traders. Recognizing the breadth of these styles, Barron’s also identifies top online brokers in six categories—frequent trading, in-person service, international investing, long-term investing, services for novices, and options trading—to help you decide where you should open (or transfer) an account. We show the brokers that were at the extremes when we calculated the monthly cost of trading for infrequent traders, as well as for those who trade multiple times per day. (Read about our methodology in “How We Ranked Our Best Online Brokers,” and review the seven categories that informed our analysis in the tables: Barron’s Online Broker Survey 2015: How They Stack Up.) We have expanded our descriptions of each broker. These side-by-side comparisons allow you to see how numerical totals were arrived at and stars awarded. You can see not only our firm grading for, say mobile offerings, but a breakdown of what specific mobile platforms an individual online broker supports or whether the platform allows trading of foreign stocks, for instance. We start with our top, 4½-star brokers and then proceed to the rest, each grouped by its ranking. Interactive Brokers, our leader, just launched its latest upgrade, Investors’ Marketplace. This new feature lets customers find advisors and third-party software that’s connected to its platform. “Current clients and the broader investment community can search the marketplace and easily find a service provider to match their needs, while partner-service providers find the marketplace a more efficient way to advertise and reach individual and institutional users worldwide,” explains Steve Sanders, an executive vice president. Although the technology for registered investment advisors is beyond our purview, Interactive’s is among the most complete and flexible for management of multiple accounts. On the mobile front, Interactive redesigned its order-entry system, making it easier to place complex orders on a smartphone or tablet. It added a suite of fundamental data and research reports, linked to trade tickets should a stock strike your fancy. Sanders estimates that mobile transactions account for about 10% of retail orders, so the firm continues to look for enhancements. For many years, Interactive was best known as a broker for international portfolios. More recently it’s pushed into new areas. In the past year, Interactive expanded its mutual-fund product line, giving it more appeal for high-net-worth investors. If you have $100,000 or more in your accounts at Interactive, the $10-per-month minimum commission charge is waived. The firm also was among the first retail brokers to allow customers to direct orders to IEX, a new exchange designed to thwart predatory traders. Interactive has incorporated the bourse, lauded in Michael Lewis’ best-seller Flash Boys, into its smart-order router (“How To Slow Flash Boys,” April 14, 2014). It’s even connected to the Shanghai Stock Exchange in advance of U.S.-based trading there. Displaying its flexibility, Interactive added a read-only password capability about two weeks after we mentioned it as a priority of readers. Enlarge Image Close New clients are introduced to the platform’s capabilities in an extensive welcoming process, and are encouraged to use the many videos on file in the Education Center. Interactive has added an Ask the Experts Q&A Webinar series on topics such as its Option Strategy Lab and Volatility Lab, which take place in a Google+ chat room. Customers submit questions in advance, which are answered by senior management during the session. Low costs are a key component of trading, and Interactive’s price-improvement statistics are impressive. It also boasts the lowest margin fees in Barron’s survey. We believe this is an appropriate brokerage experience for intermediate to advanced investors and traders who want to stay engaged in the markets. Second-place OptionsHouse, also with 4½ stars but a slightly lower score, boasts a platform that offers the sophisticated technology of its recent merger partner, tradeMonster, at low commission rates. One feature, Trade Journal, is best in class. When you place a trade, you can capture the market statistics and a variety of graphs, plus the type of options spread (if applicable) back to the journal in case you want to review your underlying assumptions later on. This is a great idea for helping a trader figure out which strategies and market conditions work in one’s favor, and which ones need additional attention (or perhaps abandonment). OptionsHouse also has a terrific alert system. New this year are Follow Alerts, which bring you news about companies in your portfolio or on your watch list, delivered according to your specified method—popup, mobile, or e-mail, among others. You can choose what type of news to receive, say insider trades and earnings announcements, while filtering out those you’d rather not see. Order-management tools allow you to nest conditional orders to be triggered when pre-selected market factors are in play, such as a certain price relationship. They can also be triggered when another order is filled. The firm’s risk profiles, which help you understand the potential impact of a trade, have been enhanced with added choices for customization. The OptionsHouse Website also lets you configure the appearance of up and down ticks throughout the platform. Do you want them to flash or display in different colors? It’s your call. A charting feature includes many new calculations, including some esoteric ones like Ichimoku clouds (which can forecast price action) and Keltner channels (to determine whether prices are ranging outside of resistance and support relative to a moving average). OptionsHouse has adapted several features previously available only on its Web platform to be used on the go. The adjustTrade tool gives clients the ability to adjust or close a position quickly, which is a remarkably easy way to roll a spread, or just close out a long or short position. Through the Bid Ask Trading feature, mobile traders can quickly set up a spread just by tapping on any bid or ask price in an option chain. Also meriting 4½ stars is TD Ameritrade, for which we evaluated only its standard Website and its sophisticated thinkorswim platform. Following its acquisition by TD Ameritrade, thinkorswim last year was relaunched with added charting tools and pattern-recognition capabilities. It provides more opportunities for investors to share capabilities and experiences with others. You can send charts, scans, studies, or watch lists to a fellow thinkorswim user. TD Ameritrade’s Mobile Trader can find advanced orders (one-triggers-another, among many others) for clients as well as additional options statistics. The charting tools were overhauled last year, and its tablet apps rival those of a desktop platform. Option scanning and trading tools are also well designed and almost as powerful as the thinkorswim platform. “Our ongoing goal is to make it easier for investors to effectively manage their financial lives in the palm of their hands,” says TD Ameritrade’s Quirk. Included are mobile videos from CNBC and Thomson Reuters, and many custom filtering capabilities, as well as related news and calendar events. TD Ameritrade’s pricing is on the high end of the current range, but commissions are straightforward and without gimmick. In return, you’ll get access to streaming data and analyst research that you’re likely to be charged for elsewhere. Says Quirk, “This simple and easy-to-understand structure helps us fund the significant investment required to build and maintain a comprehensive offering for our clients that includes, among other things, access to all of our trading platforms and mobile apps, multiple charting packages, third-party research reports, and valuable data such as options time and sales and options statistics.” Apparently this approach is working. TD Ameritrade set new records for daily average revenue trades, total client assets, and net new client assets in 2014. The following group of eight brokers each earns four stars. Their particular strengths vary a good deal, and one of them could be the right choice for you. TradeStation serves the active trader market in a number of admirable ways. Clients trade, on average, 46 times per month and hold a large chunk of investable assets with the firm. The $99.95 platform fee is waived for those with over $100,000 in household assets; there are also trading minimums that give you access to the platform for free. With the support of parent Monex, TradeStation introduced three major version upgrades and 19 updates to its downloadable platform, as well as 25 new releases for the Web trading and mobile trading apps. The firm also has three pricing plans, aimed at different styles of trading; the most active traders migrate to the “unbundled” plan, with its per-share pricing. Those who understand market structure, and know whether they are “makers” or “takers” for a particular trade, can lower their trading fees significantly. But the unbundled plan is not for amateurs. When it comes to trading tools, the sky is the limit at TradeStation. Not only is the platform incredibly powerful, with numerous scanning and analysis tools, but the TradingApp store allows customers to subscribe to over 800 products. TradeStation offers terrific tools to those who want to develop a trading strategy based on technical and/or fundamental data, plus the ability to backtest it and improve it. TradeStation’s reporting features, helping you learn which strategies are working and under what market conditions, are especially educational, and help you improve your strategies. The Strategy Hound lets you run multiple strategies across a large number of stocks, returning a table that details whether a strategy is successful or not. Strategy Hound is currently available for free. You still can’t use the mobile apps, which are now developed in-house, to design a trading system, but the firm is building one. All of the firm’s education offerings are available outside the login, so non-customers can get a taste of the power of the platform. Fidelity offers a powerful suite of tools that is designed to appeal to all levels of investors, and includes cash management and a wealth of screening tools and third-party research. Its trade-routing engine seeks out price improvement for customers, and the firm tells us that an average 1,000-share market order receives $8.40 in price improvement, paying back the $7.95 commission and some change. A particular strength of the research available on the Web is the ETF Center, which gives you deep insight into a fund’s underlying holdings, expenses, fees, and performance. Most ETF research lets you check out a fund’s top 10 holdings, but the Fidelity ETF Center offers a complete list of all underlying securities for most U.S.-based ETFs. There’s an ETF Portfolio Builder, and a market tracker tool that displays trends by sector and location in a colorful heat map. Fidelity’s Learning Center offers top-notch education and tools. Active traders can take advantage of the Trading Strategy Desk, which offers coaching sessions on a variety of subjects with small groups of customers. You can find Webinars devoted to technical and fundamental analysis, complex options strategies, and planning tools. The Portfolio Review tool helps define goals and portfolio rebalancing guidance, and there are a variety of retirement and college planning capabilities. Premium services are available to those with over $250,000 in combined assets, or who trade frequently. These allow customers to develop a one-on-one relationship with an account executive, as well as a personal rate of return report. Premium customers using a Fidelity debit card have their ATM fees reimbursed. New active trading customers can take advantage of the Onboarding Wizard, which helps set up a default trading layout and gets you over that first hurdle. Trade Armor helps you set an exit strategy, similar to OptionsHouse’s tradeCycle, which is a great feature. Fidelity is a good all-around broker that can grow with most investors and active traders. Merrill Edge is in its third year of investing in its platforms and in personal service, adding personnel to parent Bank of America’s branches. They have a terrific suite of research tools free to customers, including Bank of America/Merrill Lynch reports. Customers who also bank with BofA will see a more consistent look and feel across the two platforms. The firm reworked the site’s navigation features over the last year, making it much easier to move from one place to another. There is a pulldown menu choice labeled, “I want to…” that lets customers quickly find the more frequently used parts of the platform, eliminating quite a few mouse clicks. The portfolio page can now be extensively customized, and you can generate a report every day that looks like a monthly statement, with gains, losses, and balances displayed clearly. The MarketPro tool has Recognia and OptionsPlay built in; you can trade directly from an OptionsPlay analysis screen. When viewing market research for a particular stock, you’ll get a lot of information on a single page, including proprietary and third-party research, and real-time news. Novice investors can take advantage of a variety of planning tools and education, including content from Kahn Academy. You’ll find streaming quotes on all platforms, including mobile. The tablet platform has a particular focus on retirement planning, including the Face Retirement feature, which can be used outside the login. Try this one out if you’re not afraid to see what you might look like in a few decades. OptionsXpress has added its Walk Limit order feature to the mobile platform, which lets you set up a spread trade at a particular limit price, taking gradual steps toward a price that will execute. This is an incredibly popular feature both on the Web and on mobile, with usage nearly doubling from year to year; the firms says that 85% of Walk Limit trade volume is now from repeat users. The broker has also added the Idea Hub to its mobile platform, letting you check out covered call, income generation, and futures trading ideas. The All-in-One Trade Ticket, one of the easier ways to trade on any Web or mobile platform, also lets you set up advanced and contingent orders. OptionsXpress hosts a huge number of Webinars; last year it had over 15,000 attendees for over 240 events. Futures and futures options trading has grown significantly—these two asset classes now comprise 20% of transactions for optionsXpress—so you’ll also find a lot of education features intended to guide you into that fold. It’s possible that this is the last year we’ll have optionsXpress as a separate brokerage for this story, as features continue to migrate over to parent Charles Schwab’s Website. We shall see. E*Trade overhauled its Website and mobile apps, vastly reducing the number of clicks it takes to get from one spot to another. Both Website and mobile experiences are among the more customizable setups we saw this year, a most welcome change. Kunal Vaed, an E*Trade vice president, says, “Our guiding principles for the redesign were: intuitive, hassle free, helpful, trusted (touch ID on smartphone), engaging, insightful, personalized, and seamless.” E*Trade offers an account application that you can start on mobile, and finish on a Website (or vice versa) as the data is stored on its servers. New customers are invited to attend in-person events in New York, San Francisco, or Chicago, or check out the New to Trading track on the education page. The Pro platform added streaming options Greeks, and when setting up a trade, the midpoint between bid and ask is preloaded as a limit price. You’ll also find a strategy risk analyzer and a great options screener. The trade ticket lets you pull in a canned strategy, such as a butterfly, or create your own. As you add a leg to the ticket, the risk graph is updated with streaming data to let you analyze the potential trade. Those who are not yet E*Trade customers can check out a lot of the tools and education content; quotes are delayed, but you can get a feel for what is possible. It’s great to see E*Trade rethink its entire navigation scheme, both on the desktop and on mobile. In the past, it often felt as though new features were just tacked on. It’s a much smoother experience now. E*Trade continues to cling to a tiered commission structure, however, and it is among the highest cost brokers in the review. Livevol is a fascinating platform for the very active options trader. Skip to the next broker description if that’s not your game. The firm added futures and futures options trading last year, and built new risk charts for single positions and for total portfolio risk. You’ll find measurements of volatility, sliced and diced from a dizzying array of views. Orders can be staged, and a basket of orders can be launched all at once. The extremely customizable options strategy scanners are the heart of this platform. There is a covered call scan that shows the top four by sector based on yield and call-away return, which includes dividends. This is a very agile development company. CEO Clay says that 40% of LiveVol employees are engineers, who are constantly creating new products that are rigorously tested before they’re released. Costs are relatively low and are executed and cleared through Interactive Brokers. TradeKing also earns four stars. Its new platform, launched in November and still being rolled out across the customer base, was developed with mobile in mind. Active traders can fully customize the experience to fit their needs, using various “widgets” and placing them where they work best. Customizations are stored on TradeKing’s servers, so you get the same experience no matter which device you use to log in. The responsive design quickly resizes your view depending on the size of your monitor or device. Anywhere you go on the Website or app, you can easily pop open a trade ticket, which rolls out across the right side of the screen. Options traders can set up the desired strike range and expiration dates using a slider bar on the top of the quote screen. Pretty slick. There are quite a few connections to social media throughout the platform as well. A Twitter feed built off TradeKing customers’ so-called “cashtags” are built into the news feed. TradeKing recently acquired Trader|OS which is now operating under its TradeKing Media subsidiary, which will generate trading ideas on curated TradeKing channels. Options guru Brian Overby will have his own channel. Don Montanaro, TradeKing’s CEO, explains: “The idea is to instantly collaborate with people on that channel. Share live charts and news items, engage in live chats, and share watch lists among the community.” There’s even a live order ticket capability. Charles Schwab rounds out our list of four-star brokers. Tools from its acquisition, optionsXpress, continue to make their way over, including the excellent All-in-One Trade Ticket and Idea Hub on the Website. The active trader platform, StreetSmart Edge, is extremely customizable, while mobile usage is growing rapidly. The firm says it’s seeing more trading activity from those who use mobile – their trade activity increases by about 20% once they are engaged. Schwab continues to offer in-branch workshops; regional managers hosted more than 2,600 events and conducted more than 3,000 one-on-one, in-person consultations in the last year. The Schwab Trading Services Live Online Webinars, 464 in number, reached 12,000 live attendees and have been popular as playbacks as well. Commission-free ETFs now total 198, and the entire universe of mutual funds is available for trading. Schwab is also continuing to build out its multi-leg options capabilities in advance of the eventual folding in of optionsXpress; you can now trade four-legged options on the Web platform and in StreetSmart Edge. As Schwab builds out its options capability, the firm enhanced trade and probability calculators, and launched a new daily market commentary series that focuses on options. We don’t have any 3½ star brokers this year, but we did find three brokers who merit three stars. Scottrade worked over the last year to expand its online capabilities, and enhanced its equity, ETF and mutual fund screeners. The Portfolio Review Tool was beefed up, and can be used independently or in conjunction with an investment consultant in a branch office. Active traders can access the ScottradeELITE platform, which allows basic (single leg) options strategies. The Elite platform was updated with more customization possibilities and a streamlined order-entry system. You can add notes on watch lists, and options analytic tools were added to help traders play with potential scenarios. We remain confused by Scottrade’s approach to complex options trading, however. For the last few years, those who wanted to trade multi-leg strategies had to use a separate platform powered by OptionsHouse. That deal is being phased out in favor of a white-label implementation of the Interactive Brokers platform. We have not seen this live yet, but find it a little strange to require a separate account for multi-leg options trades. Lightspeed Trading is aimed at extremely active traders, hedge funds, and institutions. These peripatetic traders can use the proprietary platform to trade equities, complex options, and futures from a single screen. All quotes are streaming, and customers can automate a trading strategy. Traders also control the order-routing logic, and direct orders to multiple market centers for better execution. They can also take advantage of Lightspeed’s newly introduced smart route, which offers lower execution costs. Our wide-ranging ranking criteria are not geared toward such a focused offering, especially since the firm’s mobile app was not yet available when we were wrapping up the calculations. I suspect Lightspeed will move up in the rankings once we can get our hands on the mobile app. Sogotrade integrated OptionsPlay into its platform, including a way to open a pre-filled trade ticket from the ideas generated. Multi-leg options traders will appreciate the single charge plus per-contract charges; most brokers apply a base charge per leg to complex options trades, which can make them more expensive. Investment support was a focus for the firm’s development over the last year. Customers can elect to receive the firm’s Morning Call report, which is based on institutional grade research using technical indicators. It gives customers both trading ideas as well as education on the various indicators used. There is a Stock Analyzer on the Website that displays rating reports and a variety of fundamentals, plus a look at the share’s industry sector. This feature would be much improved by an ability to automatically add a stock to a watch list; at present, customers must do that manually. Another little issue is that watch lists are all stored locally, so if you set one up on your desktop, you won’t be able to see that same watch list on your mobile device unless you go through the trouble of recreating it there. Our final group earns 2½ stars. These are brokers with particular niches; one might fit your style. TradingBlock took on the full-service brokers released by tradeMonster following its merger with OptionsHouse, integrating them into its MoneyBlock platform. Individuals can use their TradeBuilder strategy scanner, which takes an investor’s most basic outlook for an equity or ETF and ranks the top 40 options strategies by potential profit or loss, and the strategy’s probability of breaking even or better. Investors can compare strategies to buying the stock long or selling it short. The Trade Analyzer feature graphs a strategy’s P&L over a range of prices, dates, Greeks, and volatilities. Another feature, Portfolio Hedger, scans for collar strategies to protect existing stock or ETF positions. Investors can also enter underlying symbols to model possible collar strategies on theoretical or held-away or positions, and rank them by cost or upside potential. For an additional fee of $199/month, customers can make use of EdgeFinder, which is a real time customizable strategy scanner. Most of what is possible with EdgeFinder can be found on other brokers’ Websites for no additional charge, but the intriguing component here is the ability to find mispriced contracts, which can result in more profitable trades. The site itself is fairly basic, and portfolio analysis is limited. Firstrade returns to the survey this year after taking a year off for a site rebuild. New to the suite of services is a mobile app, which was developed in-house and features streaming quotes. There are basic charting capabilities; a pending update will add 70 or more technical studies, but it was not available for the survey. On the Website, much of the development effort went to options trading. While looking at an options quote screen, clicking on a bid or ask populates a trade ticket and builds your strategy. The order status display has an interesting meter feature that shows the status of the order fill graphically. Another feature added this year is the ability to edit an open order rather than having to cancel it and replace it with a new order. The stock screener is easy to use; you can choose from a predefined screener or create your own. Most stock screeners show how many stocks fit your current criteria, but the Firstrade screener displays the top results as you go. Clicking on a symbol brings you to a page where you can get additional fundamental details, or place a trade. This is a much better implementation of the Website, which can be translated to Chinese with a click. Fees are reasonable though the experience is still pretty basic compared to competitors further up the list. Capital One Sharebuilder, a unit of the big bank Capital One, has added features that help you understand your portfolio allocation. This is a nicely designed, very secure Website with reasonable mobile planning tools that is hurt in our ratings scheme by the limited range of assets you can trade online. This broker was built on the idea of automatic investing. Set up dollar-based investments, say $100 per week of Google stock (GOOG), and it executes on a weekly schedule. When you exit the position, you can place a regular limit order. The Portfolio Builder tool is one of the original “robo advisors,” and walks you through a quiz to determine your ideal asset allocation. Then you can choose from a variety of ETFs that fall within each asset type. One of the most helpful features is True Value, which can show you concentrations of stocks and sectors in your ETF and mutual fund holdings. You may think you’re diversified by holding a portfolio of ETFs, but it’s possible you’re not. The IPO Center lets you queue limit orders the day an initial public offering is priced, so you can get in on the secondary action quickly. Sharebuilder’s mobile tools are nicely laid out and easy to use, which has paid off with a large uptick in mobile-originated trades. It doesn’t offer streaming quotes, though; you’ll have to refresh the screen to get updated prices. eOption rounds out our list this year. Its Web platform is white-labeled by Scivantage and very basic. The firm has, however, recently integrated the OptionsPlay tools into the platform, and vice president Herrin says, “Our clients are using OptionsPlay, and we’re very excited to offer it.” Their newly launched mobile offering, also by Scivantage, displays your watchlist before you log in so you can get quotes on the fly. Those quotes are delayed, however; you’ll have to log in to get real-time quotes. This broker offers low commissions that make frequent option trading more cost-effective. Herrin says eOption is working to enhance the front end of its platform; we look forward to seeing how those efforts pan out. Before you log in to any of these sites, you might want to change your brokerage password first, just to be safe.

NBC helps them hear it STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) — Two people deep inside a Connecticut office park are helping millions of blind Americans enjoy the Olympics like never before. For the first time in the U.S., NBC is airing the Olympics in prime time with additional narrators who simply report what’s happening on screen — a sort of closed captioning for the visually impaired. Most viewers won’t even know the additional narrators are there; to hear them, you need to turn on special cable-box or TV settings to activate their audio track. But their running blow-by-blow can open things up for the blind, who at best get an incomplete picture from traditional sportscasting. ___ US stocks get modest lift from Federal Reserve comments NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks closed barely higher Wednesday as big gains for utilities balanced out losses for retailers like Lowe’s, Target and Staples. Stocks fell in morning trading as a recent slump in phone company and utility stocks continued. But the indexes reversed directions after noon as those stocks turned higher, as did banks and household goods makers. Investors scrutinized the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s late July meeting and found no suggestion the central bank’s in any hurry to raise interest rates. ___ Fed minutes: Conditions could ‘soon warrant’ a rate hike WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve officials believed last month that near-term risks to the U.S. economy had subsided and that an interest rate increase could soon be warranted. But they did not indicate when they would likely raise rates. The minutes of their July 26-27 meeting show that officials were encouraged by a rebound in job growth. They also took note of a stabilization of financial markets after a bout of turbulence triggered by Britain’s June 23 vote to leave the European Union. But a key factor holding the Fed officials back was the stubbornly slow rate of inflation. ___ Jury finds investment banker guilty of insider trading NEW YORK (AP) — An investment banker was convicted of insider trading charges Wednesday after a jury concluded he gave tips about mergers and acquisitions to his father, enabling over $1 million in illegal profits. Sean Stewart, 35, testified during the two-week federal court trial, insisting he had no idea his father was sharing secrets with a broker to make trades ahead of public announcements on five separate deals that he oversaw while working at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Perella Weinberg partners LP. Sentencing was set for Feb. 17 for the Manhattan resident. ___ Target cuts outlook as it sees fewer customers in stores NEW YORK (AP) — Target Corp. cut its profit forecast and a key sales outlook Wednesday as it saw fewer customers in its stores and acknowledged it didn’t push the second part of its “Expect More, Pay Less” slogan. The Minneapolis-based discounter’s second-quarter net income fell nearly 10 per cent, though that was better than what most had expected. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.1 per cent, reversing seven straight quarters of gains. Its main competitor, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., reports results Thursday. ___ Lowe’s cashes in on housing rally, just not as much as rival MOORESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — The nation’s biggest home improvement stores may sell many of the same goods, but the benefits of a sustained U.S. housing recovery seems to be streaming mostly toward one of them. Lowe’s reported disappointing sales growth at existing stores, its second-quarter profit was short of most expectations and the company cut its profit expectations for the year. The quarter looked even more lacklustre because it came one day after U.S. data revealed a housing sector in full rebound mode and a quarterly earnings report from Home Depot, which posted record second-quarter sales and profits. The contrast sent shares of Lowe’s tumbling. ___ In June, airlines improved on-time performance from 2015 WASHINGTON (AP) — Airlines were running on time more often in June than they did last summer and travellers seemed to be finding less to complain about. But that was before computer outages this month at Delta and last month at Southwest led to more than 4,000 flight cancellations, widespread delays and travel nightmares. The Transportation Department said Wednesday that 78 per cent of flights on major U.S. airlines arrived on time in June, up from 74.8 per cent in June 2015. Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines had the best on-time ratings. American Airlines had the worst. ___ Cisco laying off 5,500 employees, or 7 per cent of workforce SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Cisco Systems says it will lay off 5,500 employees as the internet gear maker scrambles to adapt to technology changes that have reduced demand for its main products. The shake-up announced Wednesday means about 7 per cent of Cisco’s roughly 74,000 workers will lose their jobs beginning this summer. The purge is the latest example of the upheaval that has rocked some of the world’s oldest and biggest technology companies as the relentless march of innovation forces them to head in new directions in search of revenue growth. ___ AT&T hikes prices for some plans, but raises data caps NEW YORK (AP) — AT&T is joining Verizon in raising the prices of some of its data plans. As with Verizon, AT&T is going to great lengths to avoid calling the changes a price hike, as the higher prices come with more data, reducing the cost per gigabyte for many customers. Indeed many customers will benefit, and those who won’t can keep their existing plans. The price increase underscores how wireless companies see data as a way to boost revenue. Most plans now come with unlimited calls and texts. The new rates take effect Sunday. ___ Railroads show little progress on key safety technology WASHINGTON (AP) — Many commuter and freight railroads have made little progress installing safety technology designed to prevent deadly collisions and derailments despite a mandate from Congress, according to a government report released Wednesday. The technology, called positive train control or PTC, uses digital radio communications, GPS and signals alongside tracks to monitor train positions. It can automatically stop or slow trains to prevent them from disobeying signals, derailing due to excessive speed, colliding with another train or entering track that is off-limits. The Federal Railroad Administration report shows that while some railroads have made substantial progress, others have yet to equip a single locomotive or track segment with the technology, or install a single radio tower. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.92 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 18,573.94. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 4.07 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,182.22. The Nasdaq composite inched up 1.55 points to 5,228.66. Benchmark U.S. crude added 21 cents to $46.79 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, inched up 62 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $49.85 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 3 cents to $1.45 a gallon and heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Natural gas held steady a $2.62 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

 Ex-Wall Street banker convicted for giving father insider tips Nate Raymond, Reuters Aug. 17, 2016, 4:25 PM 3,692 facebook linkedin twitter email print Former Perella Weinberg investment banker Sean Stewart exits the Manhattan federal court house in New York City, U.S., July 27, 2016. Thomson Reuters An ex-Wall Street investment banker was convicted on Wednesday of engaging in insider trading by tipping his father off to unannounced healthcare mergers, a victory for prosecutors after an appellate ruling made it harder to pursue such cases harder. Sean Stewart, who previously worked at Perella Weinberg Partners and JPMorgan Chase, was found guilty by a federal jury in Manhattan on all nine counts he faced, including securities fraud. Stewart, 35, a Yale University graduate, displayed no emotion as the forewoman read the verdict, which came on the sixth day of deliberations following prior signs the jury was struggling to reach a consensus. "I think it's fair to say this is a family tragedy," said Carmela Raiti, one of the jurors. Martin Cohen, a lawyer for Stewart, said: "We're obviously very disappointed. We think the jury got it wrong." Stewart had testified in his own defense. He was one of 107 people accused of insider trading since 2009 by prosecutors under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. His trial was Bharara's first since a 2014 appellate ruling narrowed the scope of insider trading laws. Prosecutors said that from 2011 to 2014, Stewart provided his father Robert tips about five mergers, including INC Research's acquisition of Kendle International Inc, so his father could make lucrative trades before the deals were announced. Robert Stewart, 61, in some instances had a friend he met working at a real estate firm, Richard Cunniffe, conduct trades in his own accounts, because of concern he was too close to the source, prosecutors said. The trading enabled the elder Stewart and Cunniffe, 62, to make $1.16 million, prosecutors said. Robert Stewart, an accountant in Long Island, was sentenced in May to a year of home detention after pleading guilty in August 2015. Cunniffe pleaded guilty in May 2015. Previously, prosecutors said, he secretly recorded Robert Stewart saying his son criticized him for not trading on a tip he handed him on a "silver platter." Lawyers for Sean Stewart acknowledged he spoke with his father about companies involved in mergers, but said he did so while discussing his work, and that Robert Stewart betrayed him by trading on the information. "I never gave my father information so he could trade on it," Stewart testified. While jurors heardrecordings of Robert Stewart, he did not testify at trial, after he invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination following a subpoena from his son. The case is U.S. v. Stewart, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00287. (Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Bill Trott and David Gregorio) Read the original article on Reuters.

Getty Images Advertisement Cisco Systems Inc. shares fell after a report in CRN said the largest maker of networking equipment will cut as many as 14,000 employees worldwide, or about 20% of its workforce. San Jose, Calif.-based Cisco will announce the cuts in the next few weeks, technology website CRN said on August 16, without naming its sources. Andrea Duffy, a spokeswoman for Cisco, declined to comment on the report. Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins, who took over in July 2015, has been working to boost growth by shifting Cisco’s offerings toward software-based networking, security and management products, which customers increasingly prefer because they’re less expensive and more versatile. The job cuts stem from Cisco’s transition away from its hardware roots, according to the CRN article. Cisco has been facing a “day of reckoning” for a while now as the commoditization of its switching business reduces profit over time, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Rod Hall. Popular Now Millennial Recruiting Magic: Solutions from Manufacturers Large and Small Trump Takes on Legal Immigration First with H-1B, Skilled Guest Worker Programs The Great Manufacturing Employment Challenge Cisco fell 1.8 percent to $30.58 at 9:56 a.m. in New York. The shares were up 15 percent this year through the close of trading Tuesday, before the report was published. In the near term, the deep job cuts could could have a “large potential positive impact” on the company’s results, boosting 2017 earnings by 9 percent to 13 percent per share, Hall wrote in a note. Cisco will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday after the close in New York. Analysts project a 2 percent decline in sales to $12.6 billion. The job cuts will overshadow the earnings results, Hall said. If confirmed “we would see it as a sign that Cisco is finally beginning to behave like a company facing technological disruption,” Hall said. The move implies “that the new management team is willing to make the tough decisions necessary to navigate what we believe are going to be very choppy waters in the next 3-5 years.” Cisco had about 73,100 employees as of April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company last announced a large round of firings in August 2014, when it eliminated 6,000 positions. The new emphasis on software is requiring staff with a different set of skills, CRN reported. Many early retirement plans have already been offered to employees, according to the website. Cisco has shown its appetite for software with recent acquisitions, such as Jasper Technologies, which makes programs that let companies connect all manner of electronic devices. Results released in May showed that Robbins is making headway in rejiggering Cisco’s businesses. The company projected sales growth of as much as 3 percent in the period that ended in July, compared with analysts’ projections for a revenue decline. Even so, Robbins said the company still has a long way to go and that earnings are not where they should be. Cisco’s biggest division, switching, had third-quarter sales of $3.45 billion, a decline of 3% from a year earlier. Its second-largest division, routing, suffered a 5% drop in sales to $1.89 billion, the company said. Newer units including security, service-provider video and collaboration all posted sales increases of more than 10%.

According to a research report published today, Blacks and Latinos are “severely underrepresented” among borrowers who obtained a loan from a major bank to purchase a home in the city of Oakland. The report, by the Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council, also found that banks issued a much smaller total number of home mortgage loans in Oakland compared to Fresno and Long Beach, two other cities analyzed in the study. And Black and Latino borrowers in Oakland applied for home loans at very low rates, and were approved at lower rates than whites. This dearth in mortgage lending by major banks in Oakland, compounded by low numbers of mortgage loan applications from Black and Latino customers, and lower loan approval rates, is perpetuating and exacerbating wealth disparities, the authors of the study concluded. See also: JP Morgan Chase's Home Loans in Oakland Mostly Went to White and Wealthy Residents The study analyzed bank lending data for the year 2013 that was obtained from the federal government. The twelve largest banks, measured by the total dollar amount of loans originated in California, were included in the study. The authors compared Oakland, Fresno, and Long Beach because these cities are of similar size and have racially diverse populations, and they represent different geographic areas of the state with different economies. The data analyzed by the Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council showed that major banks are making far fewer total mortgage loans in Oakland compared to Fresno and Long Beach. “Despite comparable populations, Oakland had less than one quarter as many loan applications and originations as Long Beach and Fresno,” the report states. It’s unclear why major banks are approving fewer home loans in Oakland, but it may be due to Oakland’s increasingly unaffordable prices, and the presence of cash investors who crowd out buyers who need bank loans to close a deal. Whatever the cause, this lower level of bank lending in Oakland is compounded by racial disparities. According to the report, Black and Latino residents make up 56 percent of Oakland’s total population, but they received just 10 percent of the total dollars lent by major banks for home purchases. “Across the board, what the report shows is that Black and Latino communities were way under-represented when it comes to obtaining mortgage loans,” said Zachary Murray of the Greenlining Institute, one of the authors of the report. Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council found that in 2013 the top twelve banks only approved a total of four loans for Black borrowers to purchase homes in the city of Oakland. The other 44 home mortgage loans made to Black borrowers in Oakland were refinance loans. In the same year, Latinos only obtained sixty mortgage loans in Oakland, and just seven of these were to purchase a home. By contrast, white borrowers obtained 358 mortgage loans in 2013 and 40 of these were to purchase homes. Asians obtained 186 mortgage loans, and 37 of these were to buy a home. Particular banks exhibited wide racial disparities in their mortgage lending activities. According to the report, Wells Fargo Bank, US Bank, and CashCall all exhibited much lower loan origination rates for Blacks and Latinos than for Asians and whites. A loan origination rate measures what percent of applicants for a loan are approved and receive the loan. Some banks, including Chase and Bank of America did better, originating loans at almost equal rates for Black and Latino customers as they did for white and Asian customers. But for all of the twelve banks analyzed in the report, white and Asian customers were more likely to have their loans approved than Black and Latino customers. Sasha Werblin of Greenlining, one of the authors of the study, said that lower average household wealth and income could be one reason that Blacks and Latinos are less able to obtain home loans. The economic crisis and recession of 2007-2010, and the foreclosure crisis that peaked in 2011-2012 reduced the savings of many families, and had a disproportionately harmful impact on Black and Latino households in California. But Werblin said that it is also incumbent on banks to offer sustainable and quality financial products that help them build wealth and secure housing. “What are banks doing to market to these individuals? Do they have products that would fit the needs of these individuals?” said Weblin in a previous interview.
