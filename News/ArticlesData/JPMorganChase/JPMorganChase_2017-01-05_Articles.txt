Politics played a role in many of their advances. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Jan 6, 2017 at 3:02PM Compared against historical standards, 2016 was a better-than-average year for the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI), which advanced 15% on the year.  But a select few did lots of the heavy lifting for the index, helping it gain over 2,330 points. Two energy and materials companies -- Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) -- joined two banks -- Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) -- as four of the top five Dow Jones stocks of 2016. United Healthcare (NYSE:UNH) rounded out the list of this year's top performers. ^DJI data by YCharts. A nice election bump for the banks If we dig a little deeper, we can easily see that both Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan -- while not having awful years before the presidential election -- saw huge swings in their fortunes after the election of Donald Trump as the country's next president. In fact, between Election Day and the end of the year, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan saw their stocks advance 34% and 24%, respectively. Investors should be careful about reading too much into these moves since the companies themselves reported no substantial news to warrant such advances. Instead, investors viewed the election of Trump as a sign that regulations might be eased on large banks, and that interest rates would finally move upwards after years at near-historic low levels. While only time will tell if the former comes to fruition, the latter has already begun in earnest, with the Federal Reserve deciding to raise interest rates in December. Image credit: Getty Images. A recovery in the energy sector While the banks' advances were political in nature, Caterpillar and Chevron had been trending upwards for most of the year -- though they too benefited from the post-election bump. Chevron suffered its first quarterly loss in over a decade earlier in the year, and things weren't looking too bright when the price of a barrel of crude oil fell below $30 in February. But since then, the landscape has shifted -- albeit slightly. The company's cost-cutting measures and restrained capital spending, combined with the fact that oil jumped to over $50 per barrel, helped it return to profitability by the end of the third quarter. Caterpillar was buoyed by optimism throughout the year, but as fellow Fool Daniel Miller has shown, it's difficult to understand why. Energy, transportation, and machine retail divisions at the company are continuing to show weaknesses. The company has a large employee benefit payment coming due in 2017, and management has openly said that analyst estimates for the year are overly optimistic. Rising energy prices are likely helping the company, as well as its current dividend yield of 3.3%. What will healthcare look like? Finally, we have UnitedHealth. The company has already announced it would be leaving most of the states where it was offering individual coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but the election of Trump -- and his promise to make serious changes to the law -- may make the point moot. Even without the Affordable Care Act, UNH is easily the largest health insurer in the country, with over 48 million individuals enrolled with the company. That's a big deal, because it gives UNH bargaining power with healthcare providers to lower prices, which makes its ecosystem even more appealing for those seeking health insurance. During 2016, the growth of the company's Optum division was the real star. While growth rates in the division -- especially OptumRx -- may have slowed, it still provides the best margins in the business. Looking ahead to 2017, I caution investors not to read too much into these gains. Advances by banks and healthcare companies were predicated on assumed changes in how our government approaches these industries -- which can be blind optimism at best. And while it's hard to envision a future where oil and energy prices don't eventually rise, no one knows which direction those prices will head either. My main point: Forces that these companies have little control over could be huge catalysts in 2017 and beyond. Stay diversified and stay invested so you can roll with the punches over time.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Business News | Sat Jan 7, 2017 | 1:37am EST Indonesia plans regulation to ensure bond dealers produce 'factual' research By Hidayat Setiaji and Gayatri Suroyo | JAKARTA JAKARTA Indonesia is planning regulation to ensure primary bond dealers produce only "factual" research, senior government officials said, in a move that is likely to add to bankers' concerns about a growing backlash over negative investment commentary. The officials' remarks came after the Indonesian government cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) following a November downgrade by the U.S. bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to "underweight" from "overweight". While Indonesia has subsequently sought to reassure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is "credible", some Jakarta-based analysts at foreign banks have said they were becoming more cautious. Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry's head of fiscal policy office, said on Friday that primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system. "The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data," Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. The regulation will "hopefully" be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director-general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. "The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed," Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the U.S. bank's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. JPMorgan said in response that the impact on its clients was minimal and that it continued to operate its business as usual in Indonesia. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP Indonesia's sensitivity to negative commentary is likely enhanced due to the relatively high foreign ownership of its sovereign bonds and broader concerns over potential capital outflows, analysts have said. Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster U.S. interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah ($1.5 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. JPMorgan's skirmish with the Indonesian government also highlights the conflicts that banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in China to Banco Santander (SAN.MC) in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JPMorgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run-of-the-mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities. David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA), said the "fire-wall" between the bank's business and research divisions had been reinforced since the global financial crisis in 2008. Sumual said his research is based on the data that is available to him, but "there's still a disclaimer that this can change from time to time and the ultimate decision still lies with the investors." BCA (BBCA.JK) is Indonesia's biggest bank by market value and one of the country's primary dealers.

The finance ministry may ask top management at global banks which hold primary dealerships in Indonesian sovereign bonds to sign pledges to refrain from issuing research that could destabilize local financial markets, according to Loto Srinaita Ginting, the ministry’s director of government securities. The proposal was discussed with some primary bond dealers at a meeting in mid-December, according to a person familiar with the matter. It would require approval by Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, another person said. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Indonesia this week said it stopped using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and underwriter of sovereign bonds, a retaliation for a November report downgrading the country’s equities to “underweight” from “overweight” following Donald Trump’s U.S. election victory. Commenting on the decision to cut government ties with JPMorgan, Mulyani said Tuesday that banks should take responsibility for economic reports that "could influence fundamentals and psychology." Global banks which hold primary dealerships in Indonesian government bonds include Standard Chartered Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc, Deutsche Bank AG and Citigroup Inc. HSBC Indonesia’s head of communications, Daisy Primayanti, declined to comment on the proposed curbs, as did representatives of the other three banks. Other Warnings Official attempts to deter critical research are nothing new in developing economies. In July, Turkey’s banking regulator issued an industry-wide warning to avoid negative reports. In 2014, then Brazil President Dilma Rousseff chastised an analyst for suggesting her election would hurt the economy. As money managers around the world pull capital from developing economies on concerns over rising U.S. interest rates and a stronger dollar, policy makers are becoming especially sensitive to critical analyst opinions, according to Medley Global Advisors. Foreign investors sold a net $2.8 billion of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as investors dumped emerging-market assets following Trump’s victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policy makers to intervene to stabilize the currency. JPMorgan’s business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal and the bank is working with the finance ministry to resolve the matter, it said in e-mailed statement Tuesday. The November research report issued by the bank was not “accurate or credible,” Robert Pakpahan, the Indonesian finance ministry’s director-general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters in Jakarta. Bond Offerings The biggest U.S. bank was part of a underwriting syndicate when Indonesia sold 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) of bonds in June. The lender wasn’t listed as a member of syndicates for two more recent offerings denominated in yen and U.S. dollars, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan provides investment and commercial banking services to the public and private sectors in Indonesia, according to the bank’s website. It obtained an Indonesian banking license in 1968 in the name of Chase Manhattan, and opened a branch in Jakarta, followed by a representative office in 1978.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 January 20175 January 2017 by Final Results LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE ANNOUNCEMENT   JPMORGAN ASIAN INVESTMENT TRUST PLC   FINAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30TH SEPTEMBER 2016 The Directors of JPMorgan Asian Investment Trust plc announce the Company’s results for the year ended 30th September 2016.   CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT   Performance I am very pleased to report that in the year to 30th September 2016 the Company’s return on net assets was +41.3%. The return to shareholders was +38.7%, reflecting a disappointing widening of the Company’s discount from 11.7% to 13.4%. These results marked a continuation of the positive turnaround in the Company’s performance, with the return on net assets representing an outperformance against its benchmark, the MSCI Asia ex Japan Index, of 5.1 percentage points, building on the 3.4 percentage points outperformance in 2015. It is also a point of pride to note that our recent investment returns have been accomplished with the lowest total charges ratio of all our peers in the Asia ex-Japan sector. Continuing Appointment of the Manager Earlier in the year JPMorgan Funds Limited (‘JPMF’) informed the Board that one of the Company’s investment managers, Sonia Yu, had left JPMorgan Asset Management (‘JPMAM’) to pursue other interests. The Board subsequently approved the appointment of Ayaz Ebrahim, a managing director and portfolio manager at JPMAM, as her replacement. Mr Ebrahim, who is based in Hong Kong, chairs JPMAM’s Asia Pacific Asset Allocation Committee within the Emerging Markets and Asia Pacific (‘EMAP’) equities team. Although he has only been in the role for a short period, Mr Ebrahim has already proved to be a valuable addition to the investment team managing the assets of your Company. Richard Titherington, the Chief Investment Officer of EMAP, continues to manage the Company’s portfolio alongside Mr Ebrahim. The Company’s Manager, JPMF, has now delivered two consecutive years of strong relative investment performance. The Board is confident in its continuing ability to deliver satisfactory results and has therefore resolved that JPMF remain as the Company’s Manager. Continuation Vote Pursuant to the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board is required to put a triennial continuation vote to shareholders. Since the last time this requirement was enacted by the Company was in 2014, a continuation vote will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 2nd February 2017. Given the performance returns highlighted above, your Board has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that they vote in favour of the Company continuing as an investment trust for a further three year period. Revenue and Final Dividend Revenue per share for the year amounted to 3.48p and the Board is recommending a final dividend of 3.0p which, if approved by shareholders, will be payable on 6th February 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 13th January 2017. Proposed Change in Discount Management and Dividend Policy Subject to the relevant shareholder approvals at the Annual General Meeting in 2017, the Board has approved the implementation of changes aimed at narrowing the Company’s discount. It has been the Board’s stated objective for a number of years to stabilise the discount at a level no wider than between 8 and 10 per cent. under normal market conditions. The Board has been disappointed and concerned by the widening of the Company’s discount over the year, particularly against the background of strong investment performance. Widening of discounts has been a feature not only of Asian regional funds this year but also across the investment trust industry generally for many non-income focused funds. The Company’s discount was consistently higher than 10 per cent. over the financial year and we have therefore, for some time, been actively considering our current discount control policy. We believe that, over the longer term, an effective discount control policy must address the concerns of current investors and make the Company more attractive to new investors at the same time. The two major mechanisms we have deployed over the past few years to try to reduce the discount have been periodic, semi-annual tender offers and more regular share buybacks. On the subject of tenders, our experience has been that, whilst offering liquidity to those shareholders electing to participate, tenders per se at tight discounts were not having a measurable effect in reducing the discount, were mainly subscribed by larger institutional holders and not favoured by most shareholders, were delivering nugatory NAV uplift to remaining shareholders and at the same time were shrinking the size and consequently the market attractiveness of the Company. Our issued share capital has contracted significantly over recent years, mainly as a result of tender offers, and we believe that this contraction has been detrimental to the attractiveness of the Company in the market. Turning to buybacks, the Board and its advisers concluded, over the course of the past year, that market conditions were such that there was no certainty that conducting share buybacks on a standalone basis would have a lasting, or even temporary, impact in reducing the Company’s discount.  Accordingly, no share buybacks were enacted by the Company in this financial year.  The Directors nonetheless continue to see the merits of buybacks as a means of addressing imbalances in supply and demand and of reducing the discount and will again propose a resolution at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to authorise the Company to repurchase its Ordinary shares. The overall objective will remain, namely stabilising the discount at a level no wider than between 8 to 10 per cent. in normal market conditions.   As the Board remains dissatisfied with the Company’s current discount level, it has been actively considering other approaches for reducing the discount on a sustainable basis and has been considering the views of our shareholders as provided to our advisers. One point that became clear was that the bulk of new demand for investment trust shares now comes from retail investors. Against the background of the low yields now available from many asset classes, these new investors are particularly interested in shares that offer an attractive, predictable and regular dividend. With this in mind, and as previously announced to shareholders on 21st December 2016, the Board is proposing a new dividend policy under which it aims to pay, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, a regular quarterly dividend equivalent to 1% of the Company’s NAV on the last business day of each financial quarter, being the end of December, March, June and September. This dividend will be paid from a combination of the revenue and capital reserves. The Board will propose a resolution at the Annual General Meeting to amend the Company’s Articles of Association to allow the Company to distribute capital as dividends, to allow for the long-term implementation of the new dividend policy. The proposed changes to the Company’s Articles of Association are explained in the Director’s Report on page 26.  This proposed change in dividend policy will not be accompanied by a change in the investment policy of the Company. The Board takes the view that any demand placed on the investment managers to seek a higher income yield from the portfolio may be at the expense of the total returns available to shareholders.  By dissociating the dividend policy of the Company from the split of capital and revenue returns generated from its current investment policy, the Board expects to attract new buyers for the Company’s shares, whilst maintaining the portfolio’s ability to generate attractive total returns with a low level of attrition to the capital base of the Company.    As part of its deliberations, the Board asked its advisers to secure feedback from shareholders (on a no names basis) as to their views on increasing the dividend yield by paying dividends out of capital. Whilst there was a broad spectrum of opinion, we believe that our shareholders are generally supportive of a move designed to stimulate new buying interest in the Company and hence lead to a reduction in the discount. The Board expects this change of policy to be permanent. However, it will keep the policy (and its expected positive impact on discount level) under constant review and may amend it in the light of potential changes in the expected total returns to be earned from the portfolio or changes in the nature of returns desired by shareholders. Should the Resolution to permit the necessary changes to the Company’s Articles of Association be approved, the new distribution policy will be effective for the year that commenced on 1st October 2016 and the first dividend payable on the new basis will be calculated by reference to the Company’s net assets on 31st December 2016. This first quarterly dividend will be payable on 6th February 2017, at the same time as the 2016 final dividend, to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 13th January 2017. As the Company’s cum income NAV on 31st December 2016 was 309.90 pence per share, this first new quarterly dividend will amount to 3.1 pence per share, resulting in a total distribution of 6.1 pence per share on 6th February 2017. The Board expects that a combination of this new distribution policy, alongside the more traditional and consistent use of share buybacks, will be effective in tightening the discount at which your Company trades at a level no wider than between 8 to 10 per cent. The Board therefore recommends these proposals to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting. Gearing The Company’s £25 million three year multicurrency loan facility with Scotiabank expired in December 2016. The facility was renewed with Scotiabank at the level of £40 million, with the option of further increasing the facility to £60 million. In agreement with the Board, the investment managers increased gearing during the year and it stood at 5% at the year end. Gearing remains one of the key benefits of the closed end structure of investment trusts and, if implemented well, can enhance returns to shareholders. The investment management team has developed a model to assist with gearing decisions and the signals from the model are discussed with Directors at each Board meeting. Board of Directors As previously reported, I will retire at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. I have had the privilege of serving on the Board of JPMorgan Asian Investment Trust since 1997 and although the Company has faced some challenging periods during my tenure, I am pleased to be leaving the Board with a strong investment team in charge, much improved performance and a dedicated Board of Directors to take the Company forward. I would like to thank shareholders, my fellow Directors and the team at JPMorgan for their many years of support. I am delighted that Bronwyn Curtis, a Director since 2013, will be appointed Chairman upon my retirement, subject to her reappointment by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Having served as a Director since 2009, James Strachan has decided also to retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. I thank James for his strong contribution to the deliberations of the Board during his tenure and wish him well for the future. The implementation of the Company’s succession plan to refresh the Board has continued with the appointment of Peter Moon as a Director from 3rd August 2016. Peter has a strong background in investment management, notably as the former chief investment officer of the Universities Superannuation Scheme. He will stand for reappointment at the Annual General Meeting and I look forward to introducing him to shareholders at this event. There is a formal process each year for evaluating the performance of the Board, its Committees, individual Directors and myself as Chairman. The performance reviews this year having been completed. Mrs Curtis and Messrs. Buckley, Gould and Moon will stand for reappointment at the Annual General Meeting and I warmly endorse and recommend them. Annual General Meeting This year’s Meeting will be held at 60 Victoria Embankment, London EC4Y 0JP on Thursday, 2nd February 2017 at 12.00 noon. In addition to the formal proceedings, shareholders will have the opportunity to meet Richard Titherington, who will be presenting and will be available to respond to questions on the Company’s portfolio, the investment team’s strategy and the outlook for Asian markets. Following the Meeting there will be an opportunity for shareholders to meet the Board, investment management personnel and other Company advisers informally and I look forward to seeing as many of you as possible. Conclusion It is customary in Japan, upon news of the demise of the Emperor, for stock markets to dip slightly out of respect. Since I announced my intention to retire from the Company, by contrast, our share price has raced to all-time highs. I like to think that this is on the back of our recent excellent absolute and relative returns, but I can also happily live with the notion that the market believes that the Company is now set fair to accomplish even better things under my successor’s leadership. The one aspect that gives more than a tinge of lingering disappointment to my term, however, is the seemingly remorseless rise of the discount over recent years. In rough terms, the Company is valued by the market at some £50 million less than its break-up value: that is c.£50 million we have constantly to try to recoup, if for no other reason than that it is a loss of value for shareholders that dwarfs our average annual total return. I have seen such impressive and positive changes in the processes and people at our investment manager in recent years and am so pleased that these are now being translated into solid delivery of outperformance. And yet, the discount stubbornly remains wide. As that can, ultimately, only be because there are more sellers than buyers, I commend the new dividend policy to shareholders, for outperformance alone cannot be relied upon to generate buying interest in an acceptable time frame: we have to attract new retail buyers. I hope and expect that the increased dividend yield, coupled with the more consistent use of share buybacks will be effective, in that regard for the benefit of all shareholders. I am delighted that Bronwyn Curtis is taking over from me as Chairman and, although I sometimes like to think that the Company is now simply going to move smoothly upwards, with turbulence and underperformance a thing of the past, I know that Asia will continue to be an exciting investment ride for her and the Board and I will continue to watch the market swings, from elation to despair, with keen interest going forward. I leave the Company in very good hands, in very good shape and with my very best wishes.   James M Long Chairman                                                                                                                                              5 January 2017   INVESTMENT MANAGERS’ REPORT Summary During the year under review, the Company’s return on net assets was +41.3%, outperforming Asian stock markets, as measured by the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan Index, which delivered a +36.2% return in sterling terms. In this report, we discuss the market backdrop, examine the drivers of the Company’s performance and then consider the outlook for Asian stock markets in 2017. Market Review Asian equities rose over the 12 months to 30th September 2016, however, the period was characterised by high levels of volatility with a strong rally from October 2015 followed by a sharp sell-off at the beginning of 2016 from which the market rose steadily. Key catalysts for this volatility include the ever-changing outlook for US interest rates and the resulting direction of the US dollar, commodity prices including oil, iron ore and coal, the UK leaving the European Union, and importantly, the trajectory of economic growth and policy changes in China. The calendar year 2016 began with a sharp drop in the oil price with Brent Crude Oil falling to 34 US dollars per barrel and resulting deflationary worries weighed on emerging market and Asian economies. As markets and commodity prices corrected, expectations of rate hikes in the US were reduced and by February markets priced the probability of less than one additional hike in 2016 which, ultimately contributed to a correction in the US dollar, a favourable development for many markets in Asia. Importantly, this coincided with policy stimulus in China and a stabilisation of the Renminbi following a period of depreciation in the summer of 2016 which market participants interpreted as a reactive move to slowing growth. Explicit commitments to reinforce stronger fixings in the exchange rate were taken positively. Despite the challenging conditions for the Chinese economy overall, the shift from central bank rate cuts to more explicit fiscal stimulus and policy measures led to a strong recovery in areas such as auto sales. With 10 year government bond rates stabilising at 3% and a slowing of non-performing loans, bank shares outperformed the market. The ‘new economy’ also continued to perform well with some of China’s leading internet companies posting strong revenue and earnings growth. Overall, the Chinese government is trying to adjust to a slower rate of economic growth and they have found it challenging to design policies to address excessive capacity in manufacturing industries without leading to even slower economic growth. Reform across the region was a major theme and positive change that also contributed to a re-rating of equity markets. In India the passing of the goods and services tax bill (GST) was an important step for the Narendra Modi-led government and removes a big road block in implementing what is possibly the biggest structural reform in India since 1992. Although economic growth in India has taken longer to recover than the market has expected, sentiment was also boosted by the appointment of Dr. Urjit Patel as the new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor. This appointment helped reassure investors that the RBI would continue with its macro stability policy focus and inflation targeting. In Indonesia, the passing of the tax amnesty bill was a major achievement for the Joko Widodo led government. With a low and falling tax take in the Indonesian economy, the bill is key to helping reduce the budget deficit and ultimately leading to the government’s ability to fund more infrastructure projects, of which the country is badly in need. In addition, the reappointment of Ms. Sri Mulyani Indrawati as Minister of Finance, who previously held the role from 2005 to 2010, was seen as further evidence that the Joko Widodo government is seriously addressing reform issues. Minister Indrawati has a distinguished record, having also worked as a Chief Operating Officer at the World Bank. Asian markets continued to rally towards the end of the reporting year. The Chinese Insurance Regulatory Commission approved mainland insurance companies to invest directly in Hong Kong shares via the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect. Furthermore it was confirmed that the connect programme would be extended to the Shenzhen exchange. Such developments were positive and important in China’s long but challenging journey of structural reform. The strong rebound in commodity prices helped alleviate deflationary concerns and also contributed to a broad reversal of company profit expectations. Performance For the Company’s financial year ended September 2016, the portfolio outperformed its benchmark index. Positive relative performance was driven by both country allocation and stock selection, with positions in Taiwan, India and China being the stand out contributors. PERFORMANCE ATTRIBUTION FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30TH SEPTEMBER 2016 % % Contributions to total returns Benchmark return +36.2   Stock selection +4.6   Currency effect +0.8   Gearing/(net cash) +0.7 Investment Manager contribution +6.1   Dividends/residual -0.2 Portfolio return +42.1   Management fee/other expenses -0.8 Return on net assets +41.3 Effect of movement in discount over the year -2.6 Return to shareholders +38.7   In Taiwan, overweight positions in leading technology companies were the primary contributors to good stock selection. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), Silicon Motion and Largan Precision all benefited from strong trends in the mobile handset and memory segments of the technology sector. Although the outlook for growth in the global handset market is slowing, speciality firms are taking a higher share of content per client device because of technology upgrades, including more advanced cameras and faster processing speeds. In addition, the shift from hard disk drives to solid-state memory and NAND memory drove earnings growth at firms including Silicon Motion, Samsung and SK Hynix. In China, our holdings in the property sector, utilities and health care performed well over the period under review. China Vanke was the top performing stock within the broader financial sector due to accelerating property prices in major cities. Elsewhere, our positions in the technology sector, including Tencent and AAC Technology, continued to deliver positive returns with strong top line growth throughout the year. We continue to believe that there are growth opportunities in consumption in China. In India, the main contributor to performance came from the holdings in Maruti Suzuki, Ambuja Cement and HDFC Bank. The outlook for certain cyclical sectors has gradually improved, including the auto and cement markets. In Maruti Suzuki’s case, the company has also taken market share in new segments including cross-over vehicles, where investors were sceptical that consumers would trade up within the Maruti Suzuki brand. The company’s market share at the end of September was nearly 50%. HDFC Bank, the largest overweight position in India, again delivered upbeat earnings with strong loan and fee income growth. The secular growth story in quality Indian private banks remains intact and we continue to prefer them over government owned banks. The holding in the JP Morgan Vietnam Opportunities fund was also an important contributor to performance. Sentiment in Vietnam has gradually improved on the back of important reform measures. However, stock selection was poor in Hong Kong, with our position in CK Hutchinson underperforming for a variety of reasons, including the negative impact from the weaker sterling exchange rate and the European Commission’s decision to prohibit the proposed 3UK/O2 merger. Other areas of weakness in the portfolio included Chinese life insurers and Korean retailers. The underweight in Alibaba also negatively contributed to performance over the period under review. Outlook Looking ahead, we expect the outlook for Asian markets to be characterised by numerous opportunities for growth against a backdrop of periodic volatility driven by events inside and outside the region. In China, policy makers are confronted by overall slower growth with oversupply in many manufacturing and commodity sectors, but at the same time an overheating property sector where prices in major cities have rapidly increased over the last year and they are responding with measures to cool this sector. How successful policy makers will be in terms of balancing the economy without unintended consequences remains to be seen but it is clear that the divergence between ‘new’ industries like the internet and ‘old’ industries should widen over time. The longer term outlook in India remains broadly positive, driven by our belief that economic growth and earnings are set for a strong cyclical recovery, with falling interest rates a key catalyst. Reform continues to be in focus and, importantly, events such as the passing of the GST are the first in an upcoming series of legislative reforms which required constitutional amendment as opposed to simply procedural reform, which had previously been the prior driver. In addition to the positive reform developments in India and Indonesia, the removal of foreign ownership caps in Vietnam’s largest listed company, Vietnam Dairy Products, marks an important turning point for the opening of the country’s stock market to further foreign investment. Our investment philosophy is to own high quality growth companies in undervalued countries. Against that backdrop, our three key positions in the portfolio include overweight allocations to the information technology sector, the insurance sector, particularly in China, and selected private sector banks in India.   Richard Titherington Ayaz Ebrahim Investment Managers                                                                                                                           5th January 2017   PRINCIPAL RISKS The Directors confirm that they have carried out a thorough assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. Three key risks have been identified and the ways in which they are managed or mitigated are summarised as follows: •   Investment and Strategy: An inappropriate investment decision, in areas such as asset allocation or the level of gearing, may lead to underperformance against the Company’s benchmark index and peer companies, and may result in the Company’s shares trading on a wider discount. The Board seeks to mitigate these risks by diversification of investments through its investment restrictions and guidelines which are monitored and reported on by the Manager. The Manager provides the Directors with timely and accurate management information, including performance data and attribution analysis, revenue estimates and shareholder analysis. The Board monitors the implementation and results of the investment process with the investment managers, who attend all Board meetings, and reviews data which show statistical measures of the Company’s risk profile. The Manager employs the Company’s gearing tactically, within a strategic range set by the Board. The Board holds a separate meeting devoted to strategy each year. •   Political and Economic: Changes in financial or tax legislation, may adversely affect the Company. The Manager makes recommendations to the Board on accounting, dividend and tax policies and the Board seeks external advice where appropriate. In addition, the Company is subject to political risks, such as the imposition of restrictions on the free movement of capital. •   Operational Risk and Cybercrime: Disruption to, or failure of, the Manager’s accounting, dealing or payments systems or the custodian’s records could prevent accurate reporting and monitoring of the Company’s financial position. Details of how the Board monitors the services provided by the Manager and its associates and the key elements designed to provide effective internal control are included with the Internal Control section of the Corporate Governance report on pages 29 and 30 of the 2016 Annual Report. The threat of cyber attack, in all its guises, is regarded as at least as important as more traditional physical threats to business continuity and security. The Company benefits directly or indirectly from all elements of JPMorgan’s Cyber Security programme. The information technology controls around the physical security of JPMorgan’s data centres, security of its networks and security of its trading applications are tested by Deloitte and reported every six months against the AAF Standard. The following risks, although not viewed as critical, have also been identified as important in our risk matrix: •   Change of Corporate Control of the Manager: The Board holds regular meetings with senior representatives of JPMF and JPMAM in order to obtain assurance that the Manager continues to demonstrate a high degree of commitment to its investment trusts business through the provision of significant resources. •   Market: Market risk arises from uncertainty about the future prices of the Company’s investments. It represents the potential loss that the Company might suffer through holding investments in the face of negative market movements. The Board considers asset allocation, stock selection and levels of gearing on a regular basis and has set investment restrictions and guidelines, which are monitored and reported on by the Manager. The Board monitors the implementation and results of the investment process with the Manager. •   Loss of Investment Team: A sudden departure of several members of the investment management team could result in a deterioration in investment performance. The Manager takes steps to reduce the likelihood of such an event by ensuring appropriate succession planning and the adoption of a team-based approach. •   Financial: The financial risks faced by the Company include market risk (comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), liquidity risk, credit risk and the failure of any counterparty. Further details are disclosed in note 22 on pages 55 to 61 of the 2016 Annual Report.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During the financial year, no transactions with related parties have taken place which have materially affected the financial position or the performance of the Company during the year.   STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and accounts in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising Financial Reporting Standard 102. The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) and applicable law).

"Biotech has historically outperformed the broader market during The J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference," biotech analysts at the firm wrote in a note to clients ahead of the event, which will take place Jan. 9-12 in San Francisco. In the past 16 years, the NYSE Arca Biotechnology index (BTK), which measures the performance of 30 biotechnology firms, has outperformed the S&P 500 index by nearly 3 percent during JPMorgan's conference, research by the firm shows. "We observed that the BTK has outperformed the S&P 500 during JPM week ~81 percent of the time (all but three years)," the report said.

Even by the rough-and-tumble standards of emerging markets, Indonesia’s punishment of JPMorgan Chase & Co. this week for a bearish analysis of the nation’s stock market stands out. The country’s finance ministry cut business ties with America’s biggest bank, telling reporters Tuesday that the firm’s November research note wasn’t “accurate or credible.” Official attempts to deter such research are nothing new in developing economies, but rarely do governments retaliate against a Wall Street powerhouse for publishing opinions that contradict official views. The move builds on a trend: In July, Turkey’s banking regulator issued an industry-wide warning to avoid negative reports. In 2014, Brazil President Dilma Rousseff chastised an analyst for suggesting her election would hurt the economy. “It’s definitely been getting more aggressive recently,” said Paul McNamara, a London-based emerging markets fund manager at GAM Ltd., which oversees client assets of about $65 billion. As money managers around the world pull capital from developing economies on concerns over rising U.S. interest rates and a stronger dollar, policy makers are becoming especially sensitive to critical analyst opinions, according to Medley Global Advisors. The risk for Indonesian authorities is that their actions backfire by undermining investor confidence in the country’s market research. “Published research is already a diluted view, but these kinds of actions will make it even more bland,” McNamara said. “Retail investors will have no idea what analysts are really thinking because the written reports won’t say anything real.” JPMorgan downgraded Indonesia’s equity market by two notches to underweight from overweight in a Nov. 13 report, calling it a “tactical response” to Donald Trump’s election win. The bank also cut its rating on Brazil, while noting that both countries may provide a "better buying opportunity” later. Indonesia’s finance ministry said Tuesday it will stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and as an underwriter of its sovereign bonds. While Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the government is open to improvement and respects the assessments of research providers, she said banks should take responsibility for economic reports that “could influence fundamentals and psychology.” “The finance ministry and the government are very open to criticism, but JPMorgan’s research result was pretty weird and unfair,” Sofjan Wanandi, head of the experts team at the vice president’s office, said in an interview on Wednesday. JPMorgan’s business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an e-mailed statement Tuesday. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” the bank said. On Wednesday, the finance ministry clarified that it won’t stop JPMorgan from conducting private-sector business in the country. Government retaliation for negative research can have a chilling effect on market analysis. Some investment banks in Turkey scaled back commentary on sensitive political subjects after the banking regulator warned brokerages last July against publishing “reports that would turn expectations and the atmosphere negative.” That same month, the head of research at one of Turkey’s largest brokerages was stripped of his professional license and charged criminally over a report analyzing the impact of a failed July 15 coup targeting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The criminal charge was later dropped, but an investigation started by the capital markets regulator is still ongoing. An official for the Ankara-based market regulator SPK, who asked not to be named citing the institution’s policy, declined to comment on the investigation. In 2014, Rousseff publicly shamed an analyst at Banco Santander Brasil SA for forecasting a deterioration in the country’s currency and stock markets if she were re-elected. The firm later said it fired the analyst, disowning the remarks as that person’s opinion, not necessarily reflecting the company’s view. The episode spooked other analysts, according to Klaus Spielkamp, head of fixed-income sales at Bulltick LLC. “If anybody had anything bad to say about Brazil at the time, they wouldn’t say it,” he said. “Everybody was afraid.” Rousseff’s campaign press office declined to comment at the time, as did the nation’s banking association, Febraban. Rousseff was replaced as president last year after being impeached for breaking budget laws. Other governments’ moves also have stoked concerns among research analysts. China’s crackdown on hedge funds and broker-dealers for alleged trading abuses during its 2015 stock market rout was seen by some as targeting negative financial views. And in Italy prosecutors accused Fitch in 2012 of mismanaging its analysis of the euro-zone debt crisis. The firm disputed the claim, and the case against it was later dismissed. While governments usually go after negative research during political or economic turbulence at home, the biggest concern for emerging markets today is capital outflows tied to the prospect of faster interest rate increases under a Trump presidency. International investors pulled $23 billion from developing-nation funds from the start of October through mid-December, according to the Institute of International Finance. “Governments are sensitive to criticism, especially in countries where there are large capital inflows that can quickly turn into outflows and prompt a currency sell-off,” said Nigel Rendell, London-based senior analyst at Medley Global Advisors. Yet even the most developed market isn’t immune to concerns that free speech is being stifled. S&P Global Ratings initially claimed that the U.S. government’s 2013 lawsuit against the firm for allegedly inflating ratings on subprime-mortgage bonds was in retaliation for S&P’s downgrade of America’s sovereign credit rating. The firm dropped that accusation when settling the government’s case in 2015, acknowledging in a statement of facts that it hadn’t found evidence to support the claim. The company didn’t admit wrongdoing in agreeing to pay $1.375 billion to federal and state authorities. For Andre Spicer, a professor at the Cass Business School at City University in London, the increased willingness of governments to challenge big banks like JPMorgan reflects the industry’s diminished reputation in the wake of the global financial crisis. “In the past, large investment banks were masters of the universe,” Spicer said. “Now, nation-states are flexing their muscles.” Still, Indonesia relies on international securities firms to market its sovereign bonds to overseas investors, who accounted for about 40 percent of local government debt holdings as of September, according to the Asian Development Bank. If policy makers were to alienate more banks with similar spats, they might undermine the government’s ability to finance its spending plans. “JPMorgan has been in the country for a very long time,” said Christopher Wheeler, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. “It will blow over them, but probably do more harm to Indonesia.”   Related News Indonesia challenges Google to disclose financial reports OJK shuts down operations of six illegal investment firms Finance Ministry welcomes KPK support in internal reform JPMorgan undeterred by Finance Ministry's partnership termination You might also like : Anies shifting toward conservatism Indonesia pledges leeway for obedient miners Young children killed in Cipali fatal crash not yet identified Jokowi, Abe pledge to strengthen bilateral ties most viewed most shared Govt arrests 32 alleged sex workers in Jakarta, mostly from Vietnam Thousands of fans meet Park Bo-gum in Jakarta Tasty 'nasi uduk' is talk of town Kidman says comments about Trump support weren't endorsement Mattel launches smart baby device to lure tech-savvy parents Dolce&Gabbana court millennials, Plein launches activewear Extremism becoming more common: Muhammadiyah Jokowi, Abe pledge to strengthen bilateral ties Indonesia sees Japan as model for infrastructure development Young children killed in Cipali fatal crash not yet identified follow us       NEWS     JOBS   TRAVEL   LIFE   More Stories SE Asia Kerry visits Vietnam on last trip as US secretary of state Academia Ibnu Budiman and Hannah Barrowman Researcher at PT Sustainability and Resilience (Su-re.co) and PhD Scholar at the Australian National University Climate justice for smallholder farmers Life Mattel launches smart baby device to lure tech-savvy parents Travel Garuda Indonesia taps into charter flight demand in China TRY A DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTION Subscribe to our Newspaper Join the discussions Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) President-elect Donald Trump's choice to be the next top cop of Wall Street is Jay Clayton, an elite lawyer who has defended big banks for their financial crisis-era misbehavior. Clayton has extensive ties to Wall Street. He advised Goldman Sachs on its government bailout and his wife Gretchen currently works at the bank as a private wealth advisor. Trump announced his SEC pick on Wednesday and explained that Clayton's background as a Wall Street lawyer will help unleash the "job-creating power" of the economy while still providing strong oversight. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers," Trump said in a statement. The appointment rankled some Democrats, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren. She told CNNMoney in a statement that Trump's selection of Clayton is another sign that "his administration will put Wall Street first and working families last." "Mr. Clayton's selection is great news if you happen to run a big bank or manage a hedge fund," Warren said, "but you're out of luck if you want to see tough rules on Wall Street and bankers held accountable when they break the law." The SEC is responsible for rooting out financial crime such as fraud as well as ensuring capital markets are fair for all investors. "Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority," the Trump statement said. Clayton is currently a partner at the powerful law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and has advised on a slew of major deals, including the record-breaking Alibaba IPO and the sale of the NBA's Atlanta Hawks. His law firm bio also notes that Clayton helped secure mortgage settlements on behalf of large financial institutions with the government. It's not clear which specific banks Clayton defended. However, Sullivan & Cromwell's website said the firm represented Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and other banks against allegations that they fraudulently issued or underwrote hundreds of toxic mortgage deals prior to the subprime collapse. Sullivan & Cromwell similarly helped JPMorgan reach its $13 billion toxic mortgage settlement with the Department of Justice in 2013. Clayton also has ties to Bear Stearns, the investment bank that collapsed during the financial crisis as its toxic loan portfolio spiraled out of control. He represented Bear in its fire sale to JPMorgan. Additionally, Goldman Sachs hired Clayton to advise on the Wall Street firm's TARP bailout as well as the crucial $5 billion investment it received from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway during the crisis. Clayton already has experience working with the SEC, albeit on the other side. In 2010, Clayton helped secure a $365 million bribery settlement with the SEC on behalf of Italian oil giant Eni. If confirmed, Clayton said he wants the SEC to strike a balance between providing oversight and helping the economy. "We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs," Clayton said. Clayton would replace Mary Jo White, who is stepping down on January 20 even though her term doesn't expire until June 2019. Some liberal critics, led by Senator Warren, have claimed White didn't do enough to prevent business from pouring cash into politics. While White spent her tenure trying to implement a wave of rules coming from Dodd-Frank, Clayton could be charged with helping Trump carry out his pledge to "dismantle" the reform law. Clayton beat out former federal prosecutor Debra Wong Yang for the SEC job. While Yang is a star corporate lawyer like Clayton, she earned a reputation for toughness as a prosecutor by taking down a violent drug-dealing gang and investigating financial fraud. Democrats strongly criticized Trump's selection of Clayton. Senator Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, knocked Clayton as an "attorney who's spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap." Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, compared Clayton's nomination to allowing the "fox guard the henhouse on Wall Street." On the other hand, the Investment Adviser Association, which represents SEC-registered firms, praised Clayton as a "highly regarded, respected and accomplished" lawyer who has a "deep understanding" of complex transactions and regulations. Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen & Co., called Trump's selection of Clayton a "conventional choice" for a Republican president given his background at a high-profile law firm. "He almost is from central casting," Seiberg wrote in a note. --CNNMoney's Cristina Alesci contributed to this report. Copyright 2017 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

McAdams May 16, 2016 Conor Friedersdorf Jan 6, 2017 Politics Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Wells Fargo. JPMorgan Chase. Fidelity Investments. Prudential PLC. Vanguard Group. These are among the major financial institutions that own business debt held by Donald Trump, according to an investigation just published by the Wall Street Journal. While the president-elect’s finances remain murky, due largely to his refusal to release his tax returns, the newspaper reports that he owes at least hundreds of millions of dollars, that the debt is held by more than 150 institutions, and that some of it is backed by his personal guarantee. “As a result, a broader array of financial institutions now are in a potentially powerful position over the incoming president,” it states. “If the Trump businesses were to default on their debts, the giant financial institutions that serve as so-called special servicers of these loan pools would have the power to foreclose on some of Mr. Trump’s marquee properties or seek the tens of millions of dollars that Mr. Trump personally guaranteed on the loans.” One wonders whether to be more worried about Big Finance using its leverage to influence the president or the president abusing his power in order to thwart his creditors. Either way, Trump’s decision to hold on to his opaque business empire while president, rather than liquidating his interests to focus on the good of the country, has created unprecedented conflicts of interest that even a saint would have difficulty navigating in office. In a prior column, I noted a New York Times investigation into a portion of Trump’s business dealings in foreign countries, arguing that in India, China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, and other countries besides, there will be countless occasions where the interests of the United States and the interests of the Trump organization diverge. If the Times story was the best look we’ve gotten at specific conflicts of interest abroad, the Wall Street Journal article is the domestic analog, highlighting facts like this: Wells Fargo & Co., for example, runs at least five mutual funds that own portions of Trump businesses’ securitized debt, according to an analysis of mutual-fund data conducted by Morningstar Inc. for the Journal. The bank also is a trustee or administrator for pools of securitized loans that include $282 million of loans to Mr. Trump. And Wells acts as a special servicer for $950 million of loans to a property that one of Mr. Trump’s companies partly owns, according to securities and property filings. Wells Fargo is currently facing scrutiny from federal regulators surrounding its fraudulent sales practices and other issues. Once he takes office, Mr. Trump will appoint the heads of many of the regulators that police the bank. The article lists other specific conflicts. And then there’s this alarming detail: “It is impossible to identify all the firms or individuals that now hold Trump businesses’ securitized debt, as these investments often don’t have to be disclosed.” As a result, it is easy to imagine Trump covertly benefitting or punishing one of his creditors (depending on his analysis of what’s preferable). He needn’t be in a position to directly appoint regulators to do so. He often posts tweets that laud or vilify corporations with huge consequences for their stockholders. How many corporate leaders would quietly forgive debt if the stock of their biggest competitor would be tanked, rather than their own? This should concern even Americans who voted for Donald Trump. The underlying case here isn’t that he is unusually corrupt, but that the extreme power of the presidency requires a responsible country to put anyone who rises to the position under a microscope. Trump’s unusually big business conflicts create even more problems than usual, temptations to which the vast majority of humans might succumb. If Trump merely behaves as most people would, the country will lose, bigly. Tens of millions of people will be harmed. Trump is nevertheless offering less transparency than any predecessor in the modern era, and entering office with both houses of Congress controlled by Republicans who show no inclination to fulfill their responsibility to scrutinize his conflicts. Until members of Congress launch a full probe into Trump’s financial assets and debts, so that at the very least they can understand where his interests and America’s interests diverge, there is no way that they can adequately represent their constituents. And it is particularly ironic that their historic abdication of responsibility is rooted in partisanship, given that it will benefit a man with no loyalty to the Republican Party.

Twitter Email previousThe Desire to Live-Stream ViolencenextPutin and the Populists Most Popular Presented by Chelsea Beck Seeking an Escape Hatch From Trump’s America Emma Green Why some Americans are withdrawing from mainstream society into “intentional communities”—and what the rest of the country can learn from them VIRGINIA— For the last eight years, Nicolas and Rachel Sarah have been slowly weaning themselves off fossil fuels. They don’t own a refrigerator or a car; their year-old baby and four-year-old toddler play by candlelight rather than electricity at night. They identify as Christian anarchists, and have given an official name to their search for an alternative to consumption-heavy American life: the Downstream Project, with the motto to “do unto those downstream as you would have those upstream do unto you.” As it turns out, exiting the system is a challenging, time-consuming, and surprisingly technical process. Here in the Shenandoahs and central Virginia, a handful of tiny communities are experimenting with what it means to reject the norms of contemporary life and exist in a radically different way. They seem to share Americans’ pervasive sense of political alienation, which arguably reached an apotheosis with the election of Donald Trump: a sense of division from their peers, a distrust of government. The challenges of modern politics—dealing with issues like climate change, poverty, mass migration, and war on a global scale—are so vast and abstract that it’s difficult not to find them overwhelming. But instead of continuing in passive despair, as many Americans seem to do, the people in these communities decided to overhaul their lives. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Goodbye, American Apparel Bourree Lam The 19-year old company has been purchased for $88 million, which may be the brand’s last great marketing feat. It’s finally over for American Apparel, the trendy turned-scandal plagued clothing brand whose first store opened in 1997. On Thursday, a bankruptcy court in Delaware approved an $88 million sale of the brand’s intellectual property and manufacturing equipment to Gildan, a Canadian apparel company that focuses on wholesale. Gildan will pay an additional $15 million to acquire American Apparel’s purchase orders and inventory, effectively giving the buyer all the tools it needs to launch a new clothing line from the ruins of the now defunct brand. Millennials—especially those who identify with the term hipsters—likely remember a time in the early naughts when American Apparel’s snug, expensive t-shirts were emblematic of made-in-America cool. The company’s marketing blended the feel-good altruistic mission of making things in America while its advertising featured over-the-top sex appeal of one of America’s favorite traits: youth. Continue Reading Bettmann / Getty The Curse of Econ 101 James Kwak When it comes to basic policy questions such as the minimum wage, introductory economics can be more misleading than it is helpful. In a rich, post-industrial society, where most people walk around with supercomputers in their pockets and a person can have virtually anything delivered to his or her doorstep overnight, it seems wrong that people who work should have to live in poverty. Yet in America, there are more than ten million members of the working poor: people in the workforce whose household income is below the poverty line. Looking around, it isn’t hard to understand why. The two most common occupations in the United States are retail salesperson and cashier. Eight million people have one of those two jobs, which typically pay about $9–$10 per hour. It’s hard to make ends meet on such meager wages. A few years ago, McDonald’s was embarrassed by the revelation that its internal help line was recommending that even a full-time restaurant employee apply for various forms of public assistance. Continue Reading Ian Allen My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates A history of the first African American White House—and of what came next In the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Paul Windle Machiavelli Was Right Michael Ignatieff The shocking lesson of The Prince isn’t that politics demands dirty hands, but that politicians shouldn’t care. You remember the photograph: President Obama hunched in a corner of the Situation Room with his national-security staff, including Hillary Clinton with a hand over her mouth, watching the live feed from the compound in Pakistan where the killing of Osama bin Laden is under way. This is a Machiavellian moment: a political leader taking the ultimate risks that go with the exercise of power, now awaiting the judgment of fate. He knows that if the mission fails, his presidency is over, while if it succeeds, no one should ever again question his willingness to risk all. It’s a Machiavellian moment in a second sense: an instance when public necessity requires actions that private ethics and religious values might condemn as unjust and immoral. We call these moments Machiavellian because it was Niccolò Machiavelli’s The Prince, written in 1513, that first laid bare the moral world of politics and the gulf between private conscience and the demands of public action. Continue Reading Mike Segar/Reuters Will Mike Pence Be Trump’s Bridge to Democrats? Alex Wagner Indiana Democrats weigh in on their experience with the former governor. Though he has not yet been installed in the Oval Office, Donald Trump has already made life fairly complex for his Republican brethren in Congress. Most recently, in an interview with the New York Times this week, Trump singlehandedly threw the GOP’s Obamacare repeal process into chaos, insisting that a repeal vote would come “probably some time next week” and a replacement “very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.” Neither was correct, but especially the replacement timeline: Congressional Republicans  are quietly insisting that it will be weeks before a replacement bill is ready—maybe even months (or years!).   The only person in the administration who seemed willing to acknowledge this reality is Vice President-elect Mike Pence.  In a press conference earlier this month, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers, Pence said: “The architecture of the replacement of Obamacare will come together, as it should, through the legislative process in the weeks and months ahead.” Continue Reading Morgan Heim / Day’s Edge Production The Hermit Who Inadvertently Shaped Climate-Change Science J. Weston Phippen Billy Barr moved to the Rocky Mountains four decades ago, got bored one winter, and decided to keep a notebook that has become the stuff of legend. It was a year into his life alone in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains when Billy Barr began his recordings. It started as a curiosity, a task to busy his mind during the winter. By no means, Barr told me, having skied down from his cabin to use the nearest phone, did he set out to make a vital database for climate change scientists. “Hell no!” he said. “I didn’t know anything about climate change at the time.” In 1973 Barr had dropped out of college and made his home an abandoned mining shack at the base of Gothic Mountain, a 12,600-foot stone buttress. The cold winds blew through the shack’s wood slat walls as if they didn’t exist; he shared the bare dirt floor with a skunk and pine marten, his only regular company for much of the year. Barr had moved from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains precisely because of the solitude, but he couldn’t escape boredom. Especially that first winter. So he measured snow levels, animal tracks, and in spring the first jubilant calls of birds returning. He filled a notebook with these observations; then another notebook. This has continued now for 44 years. Continue Reading WIkimedia Commons Why More Writers Should Talk About Money Joseph Frankel A new collection of essays and interviews breaks one of the biggest taboos of the literary world. Money makes people anxious—perhaps even more so with writers. The relationship between commerce and writing is commonly sketched out in caricatures: the starving artist, the hapless student, the privileged few who “make it.” More often, it’s not addressed at all. In the past few years, some writers have begun to more openly approach questions of class. The internet has seen a profusion of such pieces: A writer who is “sponsored” by her husband calls on other writers to be more transparent about where their money comes from. Another outlines the clear advantages that being born rich, connected, and able to attend expensive schools furnishes to becoming a successful writer. In another case, a woman who wrote a well-received debut novel details how she went broke after a single advance. Continue Reading Chris Wattie / Reuters How State-Sponsored Blackmail Works in Russia Julia Ioffe The art of kompromat In January 1999, Prosecutor General Yury Skuratov was summoned to the Kremlin by then-President Boris Yeltsin’s chief of staff, who showed him a videotape of “a man who looked like” Skuratov frolicking in bed with two prostitutes. Then he asked Skuratov to resign, even though the prosecutor was in the middle of investigating Yeltsin’s administration for taking bribes from a Swiss firm trying to secure lucrative contracts for Kremlin renovations. It was a grainy tape and Skuratov would later say it was fake, but he submitted his resignation nonetheless. What happened next was one of the most decisive battles in determining who would replace Yeltsin when his second presidential term expired in 2000. Skuratov’s resignation had to be confirmed by the Federation Council, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament—back when it had not yet become a Kremlin rubber stamp. The Federation Council balked and asked Skuratov to testify, but the day before he appeared on the floor, RTR TV ran the tape on its evening news, calling the segment “Three in a Bed.” When the Federation Council continued to resist the Kremlin, and Skuratov tried to go back to work as if nothing happened, the tape was played on TV again, this time on the program of the notorious media hit man Sergei Dorenko. Allowing children to see the tape, Dorenko said, would make it harder for parents to raise them patriotically; this was, after all, the prosecutor general of the Russian Federation, “not Mick Jagger, who can run around the beach with a naked behind.” Continue Reading Against Empathy Caitlin Cadieux and Paul Bloom From a moral standpoint, it makes the world worse.

"I expect the drug stocks will be a mixed bag, but the banks should be in hog heaven," the "Mad Money" host said. Before diving into bank earnings on Friday, Cramer will have his eye on the drug stocks, kicking the week off with the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Usually conferences aren't powerful enough to move the tape, but the JPMorgan conference is the biggest and most important of its kind and could provide powerful insight to the drug stocks. Cramer will be focused specifically on the drug stocks that can break news. With this in mind, he reviewed the stocks and events on his radar next week: Time to bet on Trump stocks? Monday: Celgene, Amgen Celgene: Investors are looking for the company to guide up numbers. The real question is how much. In an era of Trump tweets, Cramer was willing to bet that Trump will put any drug company under the microscope that raises the price of its cancer treatment. Thus, he'll have his eye on how Celgene handles its best-selling Revlimid anti-cancer franchise. Amgen: Watch this stock, Cramer said. The company just snuffed Sanofi and Regeneron in a patent case on its new anti-cholesterol drug. It also has a large amount of cash overseas, which could be good news if Trump can enact relief on repatriation. "I think Amgen can go much higher, perhaps on comments coming out of this healthcare conference," Cramer said. Tuesday: Bristol-Myers Squibb, Valeant Bristol-Myers: Cramer is looking to find out if there will be job cuts surrounding its Opdivo anti-cancer franchise that failed to hit some key clinical trial endpoints. Valeant: With $30 billion in debt, it needs to do something to boost its cash flow. Cramer will be waiting to see if it announces a sale of a division or will roll back some of its unpopular price hikes. Wednesday: KB Home Unfortunately, KB Home is one of the most despised home builders out there for investors. But Cramer doesn't hate it, and wants to see what it has to say about orders with mortgage rates rising. Thursday: Delta Delta is one of the cheapest of the airline options among the group. Known for its transparency, Cramer wants to see what could be moving the stock. Friday: Bank earnings In Cramer's 37 years of investing, he's never seen a good rally with staying power unless it's being led by the banks. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report, and they are all winners of Trump's anticipated lowered regulation and rising interest rates. Cramer is most interested in Wells Fargo, and believe it or not, he thinks it could have a very good quarter. Questions for Cramer?

Bonus Season Nightmares! And Goldman Sachs Is Doing Just Fine! Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Levin Report Millennials Fear Wall Street Is a Dumpster Fire! Bonus Season Nightmares! And Goldman Sachs Is Doing Just Fine! Plus: Dow 19,963.80, a trader tries the “used-car salesman” defense, and JPMorgan says bring on the immigrants. by Bess LevinJanuary 6, 2017 4:00 pm Email Facebook Twitter Left, by Mark Walheiser, right, from Bloomberg, both from Getty Images. For a few fleeting moments today, it looked as though the Dow was going to finally hit 20,000, which would have meant the people wearing Dow 20,000 hats could stop feeling like their headgear was making a mockery of them. CNBC, for its part, stopped going to commercials out of the absolute blood-curdling fear that it might be on break when the historic-ish moment went down. Alas it it was not to be. The world is a cruel dark place, and we finished today at 19,963.80. The Goldman rally continues Before Donald Trump was elected president on November 8, Goldman Sachs C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein said the idea of that guy having his “finger on the button blows my mind.” Shortly after November 8, Blankfein changed his tune. Now, in addition to the fact that the president-elect has stocked his inner circle with top Goldman brass, Blankfein has another reason to suddenly be all about the Donald: according to an analysis by UBS, the most gilded bank in all the land, after rallying 35 percent since Trump’s election, is set to get even more rich: The potential for Goldman Sachs to deliver better-than-expected earnings over the next two years should prompt investors to get behind the stock, according to analysts at UBS, who boosted their 12-month price forecast on the shares Friday. “We believe we are entering a period where earnings power may inflect for bulge bracket investment banks due to lesser regulatory constraints,” equity analyst Brennan Hawken wrote in a note to clients. So, that’s nice for them. Unfortunately, in news Trump probably won’t print out and add to his scrapbook, millennials think he’s going to destroy the economy: In the days following the election, Country Financial Group, an insurance and investment firm, conducted its annual financial security index and found that the score was lowest for millennials, defined as those between 18 and 34 years old, at 60.9 (the highest score is 100). Asked about economic outlook, millennials were the only generation to predict 2017 would be worse than 2016. Generation X wasn't too optimistic, with 34 percent of those polled saying this year would be better than the last, compared to 31 who felt the opposite. What do millennials know that the rest of Wall Street doesn’t? Perhaps they’re paying attention to China, which is not-so-casually signaling that Trump had better check himself before he wrecks himself, or bilateral trade relations, anyway: China is prepared to retaliate should President-elect Donald Trump take punitive measures against Chinese goods and trigger a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, according to people familiar with the matter. Options include subjecting well-known U.S. companies or ones with large Chinese operations to tax or antitrust probes, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. Other possible measures include anti-dumping investigations and scaling back government purchases of American products, the people said. Bad news for bonuses This month, Wall Street banks will inform employees what they can expect for bonuses, with the money hitting their accounts in February. So far, Morgan Stanley is not making any friends here. Per Bloomberg: Morgan Stanley, Wall Street’s biggest stock-trading firm by revenue, is cutting its global bonus pool for the equities division by as much as 4 percent and dismissing some employees after the industry’s results flagged last year, according to people with knowledge of the plans. If anyone is thinking about complaining, know that C.E.O. James Gorman has, historically, not wanted to hear it. Donald “Benito Mussolini” Trump? Donald Trump reminds a lot of people of a lot of things: a petulant child who kicks and screams when he doesn’t get what he wants; a high-school bully who stuffs ”nerds” in lockers; the figure that’s not yet walking upright on one of those “evolution of man” t-shirts. According to legendary bond manager Bill Gross, the next president of the United States also calls to mind Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. ”Some of these pre-term policies, where he’s cajoling companies to move production back into the United States—that’s fine—but it reminds me to some extent of policies in Italy long ago associated with Mussolini and government control of corporate interests,” Gross said in an interview Friday on Bloomberg Radio. ”I don’t want it to go too far.” Wells Fargo tries to move on Before the Trump election maelstrom overshadowed every other scandal, a little bank called Wells Fargo was in a bit of hot water over the small matter of creating 2 million fake accounts in customers’ names. Management, which initially tried to paint the issue as the fault of just 5,300 rogue employees, eventually took a small measure of blame itself and conceded that its impossibly high sales goals (eight financial products per household) might have been a small part of the problem. So, they’re changing things up in 2017. While the details have not yet been revealed, the overarching theme is to get to a place wherein employees don’t feel compelled to take actions that make Wells look really, really bad. Per The Wall Street Journal: Wells Fargo & Co. is planning to roll out a new retail-banking compensation structure next week in an attempt to fix what many believe was one cause of its sales-tactics scandal, people familiar with the matter said. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo is in the process of completing the final parts of the new plan, which will focus on customer service, customer usage and growth in primary balances, some of these people said. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Mary Eshet said the bank’s priority is to share with employees the new plan, which “eliminates sales goals, measures performance based on customer experience and adds more oversight and risk” management. She added that the prior sales goals drove the bank’s culture, and that changes will take time to filter through the workforce. You say “used-car salesman” like it’s a bad thing Jesse Litvak is a former Jefferies bond trader, currently being retried on securities-fraud charges. The way the prosecution sees it, Litvak misled customers by inflating “the price he paid for residential mortgage-backed bonds,” causing them to overpay and ultimately “bilking” them out of $2 million. According to Litvak’s legal team, stuff like this happens all the time and Litvak’s clients—hedge funds and other professional investment managers—should have been sophisticated enough to know what they were getting into. To our absolute delight, this is how the people defending him kicked off the new trial: “Working it for you, bro,” an attorney for Mr. Litvak said to the jury during his opening remarks, reading from messages the attorney said Mr. Litvak sent while negotiating a trade. “I’m riding my seller like Seabiscuit,” the attorney, Dane Butswinkas, continued. “Winner, bro.” In Mr. Butswinkas’s telling, the messages reflected tactics that verged on pathetic—attempts to hoodwink savvy institutional investors whose “special, secret, computer-driven” ways to calculate their desired prices always overrode whatever Mr. Litvak told them. Mr. Litvak’s techniques, Mr. Butswinkas said, were akin to those of “your local used-car salesman. The kind of statements we have learned—and these sophisticated investment companies have learned—to take with a grain of salt.” Never have we ever more wished for highlights of a securities-fraud trial to be available on YouTube. Vous êtes viré! As you may have heard, the U.K.’s decision to leave the European Union is not only sad for liberals who would prefer not see their quaint island nation transformed into an isolationist wasteland, but also deeply inconvenient for a lot of banks. Companies with lots of employees in London—which is to say, every big bank—are now considering where to move, with Frankfurt, Dublin, and Paris all putting on the hard sell. What could help tip the odds in the City of Light‘s favor? Promising to make it easy for banks to fire people, for one: Since mid-September, senior executives from banks in the U.S., Asia and the Persian Gulf have held confidential talks with French government officials about relocating some businesses after Brexit, according to the people familiar with the matter. During the meetings, U.S. banking executives shared their concerns about the country’s strict labor laws, which would make it hard for them to hire and fire high-paid bankers and traders, according to these people. One option, a French official said, would involve allowing banks to easily fire employees that fall into certain European Banking Authority classifications. “It’s necessary if we want to be attractive,” the official said.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 06, 2017 1:37pm   Comments Share: In 1963, there were less than 300 candidates to sit for the CFA exam. Now, with CFA salaries soaring, there are expected to be more than 180,000 candidates sitting for these exams in the coming years, as more and more people try to get jobs at big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), UBS Group AG (NYSE: UBS) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC).  The CFA Institute membership can be seen as a microcosm of the global investment profession, with virtually every type of professional at every type of firm represented. People holding the CFA designation can be found working as portfolio managers, research analysts, and chief level executives.  Based on density of job offerings, here are the best cities to work in if you have a CFA designation.  New York City Considered the financial capital of the world, NYC is the beginning for many CFA professionals. We're currently seeing demand in the financial service, healthcare, nonprofit, real estate, advertising/media, retail, and insurance industries. Many of the largest investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), JP Morgan, and Merrill Lynch are headquartered there. Nearly every large, global financial institution has an office in New York. The city has lost a large number of jobs due to the credit crisis, but Wall Street is still the place to be. London, England London is the finance capital of the United Kingdom and some would say the European world. Home to nearly all of the large international banks and brokerage firms, London is particularly strong in currency trading, commanding more than twice the market share of its closest rivals. Boston, Massachusetts  Boston is known for its asset-management business and large money managers, such as Fidelity Investments and Putnam Investments. The job market for asset management tends to be relatively more stable than that for investment banking or trading. This makes Boston a relatively appealing financial job market during economic recessions or market pullbacks. Dallas, Texas The Big D’s core industries (energy and anything relating to it) have a heavy need for CFAs. And, energy companies can hire two to three times the accounting and finance staff a non-energy client would be able to. Currently, all sectors within energy are trending, including oil and gas, production and exploration, shale plays, energy trading, utilities, oilfield service, and energy-related technology. San Francisco, California San Fran’s unique advantage is that its technology innovative environment is balanced by many privately-held “traditional” financial and professional service firms. This provides the foundation for high-risk companies to thrive and an aggressive job market. This city has some of the highest salaries in the nation. There are many brokerage and banking firms with offices in the San Francisco area, and companies such as Charles Schwab and Franklin Templeton Investments have their headquarters there. As the gateway to Silicon Valley, San Francisco has a particular focus on the technology sector. Dubai, United Arab Emirates As one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, Dubai is rapidly increasing in importance as a financial capital of the Middle East. Many global financial institutions are rushing to open and staff regional offices here. Even if you don’t speak Arabic, many international applicants are able to find a job here.  Tokyo, Japan As the capital of the world’s third largest economy, Tokyo is the headquarters for most Japanese financial institutions as well as the regional headquarters for many international firms. Tokyo rivals New York for the title of world financial capital. While there are opportunities available, Tokyo is a difficult place to get a job if you don't speak the language.  Houston, Texas Houston has a large concentration of Fortune 500 companies across a diverse set of industries, especially in the energy sector, including oil and gas, and real estate. As with Dallas, the city is extremely livable, with many attracted to its relatively low cost of living. Frankfurt, Germany Argued to be the finance capital of mainland Europe, Frankfurt is home to many large German companies such as Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE: DG). Many international firms also keep their European headquarters in Frankfurt. Frankfurt may be the destination for banks and other financial institutions that are relocating from London after the Brexit vote. Zurich, Switzerland Zurich is a great place to find a wide variety of finance jobs for CFAs. As the capital of the Swiss banking industry, global giants like UBS and Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE: CS) have their headquarters here. Zurich is known for wealth management and private banking. You will have more success if you speak some German or French.

Morgan Chase, BlackRock and Vanguard are among the institutions that own portions of Trump businesses’ securitized debt Reuters U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. By JeanEaglesham LisaSchwartz The debts of President-elect Donald Trump and his businesses are scattered across Wall Street banks, mutual funds and other financial institutions, broadening the tangle of interests that pose potential conflicts for the incoming president’s administration. Hundreds of millions of dollars of debt attached to Trump’s properties, some of them backed by Trump’s personal guarantee, were packaged into securities and sold to investors over the past five years, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of legal and property documents. Trump has previously disclosed that his businesses owe at least $315 million to 10 companies. According to the Journal’s analysis, Trump businesses’ debts are held by more than 150 institutions. They bought the debt after it was sliced up and repackaged into bonds—a process known as securitization, which has been used for more than $1 billion of debt connected to Trump’s companies. As a result, a broader array of financial institutions now are in a potentially powerful position over the incoming president. If the Trump businesses were to default on their debts, the giant financial institutions that serve as so-called special servicers of these loan pools would have the power to foreclose on some of Trump’s marquee properties or seek the tens of millions of dollars that Trump personally guaranteed on the loans.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 January 20175 January 2017 by JPMorgan Chase Institute’s Local Consumer Commerce Index Shows a 1.5 Percent Decrease in Consumer Spending Growth in September 2016 WASHINGTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Today, the JPMorgan Chase Institute released its Local Consumer Commerce Index (LCCI) for September 2016, which showed that only one-third of the 15 major U.S. cities studied experienced positive growth in year-over-year spending. Overall, year-over-year consumer spending growth declined by 1.5 percent in September – the third largest decline in year-over-year growth since October 2013. Like in August 2016, Denver experienced the fastest growth of all cities studied, this time at 6.9 percent year-over-year. Although restaurant spending across the 15 cities added 0.6 percentage points in September, it was the only product type to see an increase in year-over-year spending growth. This report provides a timely view of how the following cities and surrounding metro areas are faring economically both individually and in aggregate: Atlanta, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, Portland (OR), San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle. By looking at actual anonymized financial transactions, LCCI offers an ongoing, dynamic view of the health and vibrancy of the U.S. consumer and the places where businesses operate. “While we see continued declines in spending growth, there are a few bright spots in year-over-year local consumer commerce for September 2016,” said Diana Farrell, President and CEO of the JPMorgan Chase Institute. “For example, spending at neighborhood small businesses can have a multiplier effect on nearby businesses and the community overall – it’s an important contributor to the vibrancy of local commerce.” The key highlights from the latest Index include: All five of the largest cities in our sample – New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas and Houston – experienced reductions in spending. Spending at small businesses grew notably, adding 2.5 percentage points to year-over-year growth. However, these gains were more than offset by declines in spending growth at mid-sized and large businesses. Fuel spending recovered significantly in September 2016, subtracting only 0.2 percentage points from growth. This level of growth departs strongly from a downward trend that began at the beginning of 2016. Year-over-year spending growth on nondurables declined in September, in contrast to virtually flat growth in August. Spending contractions for these goods have been relatively rare events; September marks the third instance in our series. Spending by customers that live in the same neighborhood as the merchant has experienced a downward trend throughout much of 2016. The LCCI offers unique advantages over existing measures of consumer spending. The LCCI captures actual transactions, instead of self-reported measures of how consumers think they spend. The LCCI provides timely data on spending in 15 major metropolitan areas; such geographic granularity is unavailable in most other spending measures. These 15 cities mirror the geographic and economic diversity of larger metropolitan areas in the United States and account for 32 percent of retail sales nationwide. The index also presents a more granular view of local consumer commerce through five important lenses: consumer age, consumer income, business size, product type, and consumer residence relative to the location of the business. For each lens, we show how different segments contributed to year-over-year spending growth. The LCCI captures economic activity in sectors that previously have not been well understood by other data sources. These include sectors such as food trucks, new merchants, and personal services. Each release of the LCCI will describe the economic picture of local communities and provide a powerful tool for city development officials, businesses, investors, and statistical agencies to better understand the everyday economic health of consumers, businesses, and the places they care about. About the JPMorgan Chase Institute The JPMorgan Chase Institute is a global think tank dedicated to delivering data-rich analyses and expert insights for the public good. Its aim is to help decision makers – policymakers, businesses, and nonprofit leaders – appreciate the scale, granularity, diversity, and interconnectedness of the global economic system and use better facts, timely data, and thoughtful analysis to make smarter decisions to advance global prosperity. Drawing on JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s unique proprietary data, expertise, and market access, the Institute develops analyses and insights on the inner workings of the global economy, frames critical problems, and convenes stakeholders and leading thinkers.

 JPMorgan Chase reduces Sapphire Reserve rewards BI Intelligence Jan. 5, 2017, 10:41 AM 3,599 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY EXPLAINED: The Trends Creating New Winners And Losers In The Card-Processing Ecosystem Credit cards are going the way of fax machines THE MOBILE PAYMENTS REPORT: Market forecasts, consumer trends, and the barriers and benefits that will influence adoption This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. JPMorgan Chase will be cutting back some of the lucrative rewards associated with its Sapphire Reserve card, which took the credit card rewards market by storm last summer, according to The New York Times. The card originally offered users who spent $4,000 in the first three months the points equivalent of roughly $1,500 in travel credits. Now, it will offer just half that to consumers who apply online after January 11. Although this cutback may hurt the card's extreme popularity with consumers, the benefits to JPMorgan will likely outweigh any negative sentiment. Consumers are likely to continue to find the card appealing even if it sees a small decline in popularity. The lucrative offers associated with the Sapphire Reserve card are in part responsible for the 35% increase in new Chase card accounts in Q3 2016. But though the cutback could decrease popularity, the card's other offerings will likely still draw in the 60% of consumers that rank rewards as a major reason for credit card adoption.  The cutback will also help the issuer to save millions on costs. Offering lucrative rewards on credit cards can have a dramatic impact on costs — the firm's Sapphire Reserve credit card could end up reducing the bank’s profit by $200 million to $300 million in Q4 2016, according to Bloomberg. By reducing how much the Sapphire Reserve card will cost the firm, it will be able to regain millions in profits.  This cutback could be the beginning of a major slow down in credit card reward offerings by card issuers. In the last year, there has been an aggressive increase in credit card reward offerings, which has been fueled in part by the release of the Sapphire Reserve card. This aggressive push in offerings has led to a steady increase in costs for many major issuers. However, with this recent cutback, card issuers could begin to follow JPMorgan's lead by pushing similar cutbacks because they no longer have to match the firm's impressive offer. In the US, when customers make payments via banks, they’re completed in two ways: via wire transfer, or through the Automated Clearing House (ACH). ACH transactions, which are less expensive for customers and which accounted for 18% of total noncash US payments volume in 2012, can take up to five days to settle because of the way that they are processed. That’s problematic, because it interferes with consumer demand for convenience and could slow the supply chain or make it more challenging for banks and businesses to get paid in the way they need to conduct operations. As a result, the US Fed looked into the ACH system in 2013, and found that there was no “ubiquitous, convenient, and cost-effective way for US consumers and businesses to make fast payments between banks.  In response, the Fed, NACHA, and private institutions have begun to find ways, together and separately, to modernize the US payments system in order to increase convenience and catch up to many of the country’s trade partners. The Fed has formed a task force, which will resolve potential solutions, while NACHA and private institutions are pushing banks to hit a set of three same-day settlement deadlines through late 2016 and into 2017. Such a system will particularly benefit high-growth spaces in the electronic payments ecosystem, like P2P and B2B payments, which could magnify its impact over time. Though it’s likely the system could grow ACH volume by making it a more appealing option in these high-growth areas, it could become a hindrance to banks. That’s because the implementation is costly and time-consuming — the Fed find that the business impact is net-neutral to negative for these firms. Instead, the parties that reap these benefits are providers of services in these high growth areas, like mobile bill pay firms or P2P vendors, which means that banks are actually aiding their competitors. That means that Faster Payments could ultimately enhance the impact of digital disruption in the payments ecosystem, rather than mitigate it. Jaime Toplin, research associate for BI Intelligence, Business Insider’s premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on faster payments that looks at why the US needs a Faster Payments system, explains how the country plans to implement it, evaluates the different areas that are most likely to be impacted by Faster Payments, and determines which parties benefit from such a system and which are hindered by it. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Sluggish settlement of payments in the US is pushing NACHA, the national electronic payments trade group, and the Federal Reserve to reform the system. US payments made via ACH can take three to five days to settle.The Fed's Faster Payments Task Force and NACHA are looking to implement a same-day settlement program in the US by 2017 in order to increase consumer convenience.  The number of transactions affected by faster payments will increase over time.Four key areas — P2P, B2B, C2B, and B2C payments — will gain the most from such a system. And these areas, which comprised 12% of US payments volume in 2014, will grow rapidly over time, therefore magnifying the impact of such a system. Faster payments implementation will be a mixed bag for banks, because of additional costs associated with the burden of implementation. And the platform is likely to actually boost third-party providers, like P2P app vendors or mobile bill pay firms, by giving them an easy way to increase efficiency, engagement, and volume, without a substantial rise in transaction costs.

Katz appeared in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, where he admitted to participating in a conspiracy with other bankers to manipulate emerging-market currency trades while working at three different financial institutions from 2007 to 2013. Katz’s conviction comes one day before five banks are scheduled to be sentenced in connection with the Justice Department’s three-year investigation. The banks - Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Company, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland Group - pleaded guilty in May 2015 to charges that their traders conspired to manipulate trading in U.S. dollars and euros. UBS Group also pleaded guilty to a related charge. Bloomberg previously reported that the currency-rigging investigation had expanded to additional chatrooms involving trading in emerging market currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble and the South African rand. Trading history Katz spent a year as director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading at Barclays beginning in 2010, according to regulatory filings and his LinkedIn profile. He joined BNP Paribas in September 2011 as its director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading, before leaving for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group two years later, the documents show. Before joining Barclays, Katz spent more than nine years at Standard Bank, where he was head of foreign exchange, according to his LinkedIn profile. Prosecutors say Katz was a dealer of central and eastern European, Middle Eastern and African currencies and conspired to manipulate prices through "non-bona fide trades," coordinating the placement of bids and offers, and agreeing on currency prices they would quote specific customers. Katz has agreed to cooperate with the government’s investigation. The conspiracy charge Katz admitted to has a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine, which may be increased based on the proceeds gained or the loss to investors.

It isn’t clear whether Katz had any interaction with Ashton or other members of The Cartel.

Barclays, JPMorgan and Citigroup provided evidence of a potential new antitrust conspiracy in the currency spot market that prosecutors say involves different currencies than the ones at the centre of their 2015 guilty pleas.

(AAPL) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU) 2 Trades to Play the Exxon Mobil (XOM) Stock Breakout (or Breakdown) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are retreating this morning, as Wall Street takes a breather ahead of a wealth of economic data, including key employment reports. Specifically, the ADP private-sector payrolls report and weekly jobless claims are due out today, followed by December’s non-farm payrolls report tomorrow. Meanwhile, the December purchasing manager’s index is also due to hit the Street later this morning. Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have retreated 0.08%, S&P 500 futures have fallen 0.14% and Nasdaq-100 futures have dropped 0.18%. On the options front, volume remained strong on Wednesday, with about 15.1 million calls and 12.1 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio extended its recent decline to rest at 0.64, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.67. Turning to Wednesday’s volume leaders, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) options traders are gearing up for next Friday’s fourth-quarter earnings report. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) came up short in full-year deliveries but was initiated at “buy” at Guggenheim, and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) lifted its fourth-quarter passenger unit revenue. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) Ahead of the open next Friday, Bank of America will slip into the earnings confessional. Analysts are expecting a profit of 38 cents per share on revenue of $20.99 billion — up 40% and 7.3% year-over-year, respectively. Expectations appear to be a bit higher, however, as EarningsWhispers.com reports a whisper number of 39 cents per share for BofA earnings. 5 Stocks to Buy for a Big January Options traders are also quite bullish on BAC stock. During Wednesday’s trading, speculative traders pushed more than 673,000 contracts across the tape on BAC, with calls gobbling up 73% of the day’s take. Among yesterday’s most interesting trades, however, was what appeared to be a short-strangle at the January 2017 20 series $22.50 and $23 strikes. According to Trade-Alert.com, 10,000 contracts traded at each of the January $22.50 put and $23 call for the bid prices of 49 cents and 46 cents, respectively. Taking the trade at face value, the trader received a credit of 95 cents, or $95 per pair of contracts, which he will only keep if BAC stock closes between $22.50 and $23 when January options expire.

(iStock) Related Articles Barclays awarded in Middle East Barclays severs ties with 7 000 clients to boost returns Barclays sells off French retail division Barclays to save millions with office sublet to govt Barclays posts 35% jump in profit Barclays channels 'new deal' lesson in shaky commodities world   Manhattan - Jason Katz, a former Barclays currency trader, admitted conspiring to fix prices in the foreign-exchange market, the third individual to be charged and the first to plead guilty in a long-running US criminal investigation into the rigging of currency rates. Katz appeared in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, where he admitted to participating in a conspiracy with other bankers to manipulate emerging-market currency trades while working at three different financial institutions from 2007 to 2013. Separately, the Federal Reserve Board said it banned Katz from the banking industry. Katz’s conviction comes one day before five banks are scheduled to be sentenced in connection with the Justice Department’s three-year investigation. The banks - Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Company, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland Group - pleaded guilty in May 2015 to charges that their traders conspired to manipulate trading in US dollars and euros. UBS Group also pleaded guilty to a related charge. Bloomberg previously reported that the currency-rigging investigation had expanded to additional chat rooms involving trading in emerging market currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Russian rouble and the South African rand. Katz was released on a $150 000 bond to be secured by property in New York’s Delaware County. His travel is limited to New York, Connecticut and London until April 1 when he is to turn over his passport and remain in the US. Trading history Katz spent a year as director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading at Barclays beginning in 2010, according to regulatory filings and his LinkedIn profile. He joined BNP Paribas in September 2011 as its director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading, before leaving for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group two years later, the documents show. Before joining Barclays, Katz spent more than nine years at Standard Bank, where he was head of foreign exchange, according to his LinkedIn profile. Prosecutors say Katz was a dealer of central and eastern European, Middle Eastern and African currencies and conspired to manipulate prices through "non-bona fide trades," coordinating the placement of bids and offers, and agreeing on currency prices quoted to specific customers. Katz has agreed to cooperate with the government’s investigation. The conspiracy charge Katz admitted to a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1m fine, which may be increased based on the proceeds gained or the loss to investors. "These conspirators engaged in blatant collusion and succeeded in manipulating exchange rates for multiple currencies to their advantage," said Brent Snyder, a deputy assistant attorney general with the department’s antitrust division. "Conspiracies such as this undermine the integrity of our financial markets, and the Antitrust Division is committed to ensuring that they are pursued and punished.' Currency chats Katz’s time at Barclays coincides with that of Chris Ashton, the former global head of spot trading at the London-based bank. Prosecutors have been investigating allegations that Ashton and a group of other traders participated in an electronic chatroom called The Cartel where they conspired to rig currency prices. Ashton was permanently banned from US banking by the US Federal Reserve in August. It isn’t clear whether Katz had any interaction with Ashton or other members of The Cartel. Those chatroom discussions formed the basis of guilty pleas by four of the banks, which are scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday in Connecticut. Barclays, JPMorgan and Citigroup provided evidence of a potential new antitrust conspiracy in the currency spot market that prosecutors say involves different currencies than the ones at the centre of their 2015 guilty pleas. The case is US v. Katz, 17-cr-00003, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Follow Fin24 on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

Predictably, there will be tears, upset, relief and joy (for some). As a general rule, the longer a bonus advisory meeting takes, the more likely that the bonus itself is not quite up to scratch. Bonus advisory meetings become protracted usually for two reasons only - a subordinate is pushing back in a futile attempt to increase his / her award, or an embarrassed line manager is trying his best to justify the unjustifiable. But in all honesty, there should be relatively few surprises this bonus season (unless an employee is completely deluded, of course, or been living on the moon). We all know that 2016 was a tough for the industry - revenues were under pressure, job losses continued, etc. Against this background, year-end bonuses for most individuals will be flat to down (although there will always be some 'hot spots' that will see big payouts and hit the headlines). There will be some, however, who will be shocked about the paucity of their awards (and tears will flow), thinking that the relatively small bonus they have been allocated for 2016 means that they are being given a subtle message by their employer - it's time for you to move on. You can rest assure, however, that this is not the case - banks don't send subtle messages any more; they don't have the luxury. If your face doesn't fit, or you're no longer delivering the goods, then you'll simply be fired - you won't have even made it to bonus advisory day. A word of caution, though: you'll need to survive another 12 months to bag another bonus, and 12 months is now a very long time in the industry. image: © Aiden And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

 GLOBAL MARKETS-World stocks rise; dollar dips on U.S. labor data, yuan surge Reuters Jan. 5, 2017, 4:41 PM 29 facebook linkedin twitter email print * Amazon leads Nasdaq to record; S&P off on banks, retail * U.S. Treasury debt yields drop for third straight session * Chinese numbers add to upbeat factory data in Europe, U.S. * Dollar falls after unimpressive U.S. labor data, yuan surge * Oil rebounds as Saudi output cuts offset U.S. products build (Updates to U.S. market close) By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Global equity prices shrugged off weakness on Wall Street to cling to gains after hitting their highest level since mid-2015 on Thursday, bolstered by strong Chinese data that added to optimism about global growth and inflation. The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies after U.S. inflation and unemployment data failed to reverse a downtrend that followed some of the biggest gains on record for China's yuan. U.S. Treasury debt yields slipped as investors grew risk-averse amid uncertainty about the incoming Trump administration. MSCI's world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, rose 0.55 percent for a third straight day of gains. The index has been riding a wave of upbeat factory and service sector surveys out of the United States, Europe and Asia this week. Growth in China's services sector accelerated to a 17-month high in December, a private sector survey showed. The index, however, got little support from Wall Street as the S&P 500 closed slightly lower, weighed by financial shares and as investors dumped traditional retailers Macy's and Kohl's on dismal holiday sales numbers. Amazon powered the Nasdaq Composite to a record closing high. The S&P 500 financial index fell 1.02 percent due to declines in JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. "Financials coming down probably had something to do with bond yields coming down. A lot of the post-election rally was predicated on yields moving higher," said Jimmy Chang, chief investment strategist at Rockefeller & Co. Adding to the downbeat sentiment was a report by a payrolls processor which showed that U.S. private employers added fewer jobs than expected in December even as the U.S. labor market remained solid. Thursday's ADP report precedes Friday's nonfarm payrolls data, which includes hiring in both private and public sectors. "Overall it looks like investors will be in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the Labor Department report tomorrow," said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.87 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 19,899.29, the S&P 500 lost 1.75 points, or 0.08 percent, to finish at 2,269 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.93 points, or 0.2 percent, to finish at 5,487.94. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.12 percent at 1,445.57. U.S. Treasury debt yields dropped broadly, falling for a third straight session. Yields should rise again despite weakness early in the year, although for the next few weeks they likely will be range-bound as investors wait to see results from the incoming Trump administration, said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. "There's a lot of uncertainty until the next administration takes place," Lederer said. "We'll be in ranges until we know more about the Trump presidency." Buying in Treasuries also accelerated after the disappointing private sector payrolls data. The U.S. 10-year note was up 29/32 in price to yield 2.348 percent, compared with 2.452 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar slipped to a three-week low against a basket of currencies. China stepped into both its onshore and offshore yuan markets to shore up the faltering yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 1.26 percent to 101.41. The dollar's retreat helped push gold to its highest in a month. Spot gold rose 1.43 percent to $1,180.01 an ounce. Oil prices rose in a choppy session, lifted by news that Saudi Arabia had cut production to meet OPEC's agreement to cut output. Prices had fallen earlier on data showing a surprisingly large increase in U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories. Brent crude settled up 43 cents, or 0.76 percent, at $56.89 a barrel, and U.S. crude settled up 50 cents, or 0.94 percent, at $53.76.

Average hourly earnings jumped by 2.9 percent in the 12 months through December, the most since the last recession ended in June 2009, according to the Labor Department's employment report released Friday in Washington. Workers in almost every category, from mining and construction to retail and education, saw paychecks rise from November. The 4.7 percent jobless rate remains close to a nine-year low, even with a tick up last month. Job and wage prospects would improve even more following any successful legislation aimed at stirring growth, such as tax cuts and infrastructure investment, as President-elect Donald Trump has promised. "The trend is clearly moving toward firmer wage growth," said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. "The labor market is tight and getting tighter. I expect to see continued acceleration in wages this year." The encouraging news on worker pay underscores the next stage of the labor-market recovery, which was defined by years of wage stagnation amid strong growth in payrolls. Now, the economy is adding jobs at a slower pace and measures of slack are diminishing, meaning labor shortages may become more common. That makes a sustained acceleration in paychecks critical to boosting household income and supporting spending. Some cooling in the job market was apparent in the latest report. Payrolls climbed by 156,000 in December after 204,000 in November, and the participation rate increased to 62.7 percent, which may continue as more people are drawn into the labor force and find work. Other measures of slack improved, including a drop in the number of Americans working part-time who would rather have a full-time position. Calendar Quirk The December increase in wages followed a 2.5 percent advance the prior month. The improvement may have, in part, reflected the unwinding of a calendar quirk that muffled the November tally. Since the 15th of the month fell within the employment survey week, increases in bi-monthly pay are more likely to have been captured. Even so, year-over-year hourly earnings have accelerated in three of the past four months, and wages were up 0.4 percent from November, matching the fastest pace since last January. Among industries that posted the biggest hourly wage gains were mining and logging, rising 0.8 percent from the previous month, and retail, up 0.6 percent. Construction workers saw earnings increase 0.4 percent, as did Americans in leisure and hospitality. Production Workers Not everyone is getting excited just yet. Barclays Plc economists Rob Martin and Michael Gapen pointed out the more modest 2.5 percent year-over-year December gain in earnings for production and non-supervisory workers, which exclude managers. "Although the solid wage numbers in December are welcome, this month's data followed several months of relatively weak prints and do not change our view on wage growth," Martin and Gapen said in a note. "We continue to expect modest wage gains over the next year, as we see little slack in labor markets and expect the unemployment rate to continue its long-term trend decline." The pickup in wages, sustained over time, would also feed into broader price pressures. That would be consistent with the view that inflation continues to move toward the goal of the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates last month and expects to lift them three times this year. The strong wage gain for 2016 "strengthens the position of policy makers that think the Fed needs to get on with its normalization of official rates," Joe Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein LP, wrote in a note. Potential fiscal stimulus from Congress and the new administration in 2017 "should raise expectations of more wage and price gains. In short, the Fed is falling behind the curve and even more so if fiscal stimulus is enacted soon," he said.   ---   Bloomberg's Michelle Jamrisko and Patricia Laya contributed.

The strong wage gain for 2016 “strengthens the position of policy makers that think the Fed needs to get on with its normalization of official rates,” Joe Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein LP, wrote in a note. Potential fiscal stimulus from Congress and the new administration in 2017 “should raise expectations of more wage and price gains. In short, the Fed is falling behind the curve and even more so if fiscal stimulus is enacted soon,” he said.

The Finance Ministry said it may ask top management at global banks which hold primary dealerships in Indonesian sovereign bonds to sign pledges to refrain from issuing research that could destabilise local financial markets. BLOOMBERG Fall in Bank Negara's foreign reserves KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia's central bank yesterday said its gross international reserves stood at US$94.6 billion (S$135.6 billion) as of Dec 30, lower than the US$96.4 billion on Dec 15. The reserves were enough to finance 8.8 months of retained imports and were 1.3 times the short-term external debt, said Bank Negara. The reserve levels took into account adjustments for forex revaluation and were supported by the current account surplus and inflows of foreign direct investment.

Business Higher wages lift stocks to record highs; Dow almost touches 20,000 New York Stock Exchange Richard Drew / Associated Press The Wall Street entrance of the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. The Wall Street entrance of the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. (Richard Drew / Associated Press) Associated Press The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. The Standard & Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq composite rose to new record highs. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Read more: U.S. economy creates a modest 156,000 jobs in December » Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. Sam Stovall, a U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said there was good news for most industries. That's because workers are being paid more, but not enough to push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates quickly to stave off inflation. “Consumers are earning a bit more and as a result can spend more,” he said. “But people are not too worried the Fed will have to slam on the brakes.” The Dow peaked at 19,999.63 but then lost steam. It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3%, at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4%, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6%, to 5,521.06. The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3%, to 1,367.28. Stocks finished the week with a big gain as investors remained optimistic about the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7%. That was a marked change from the first week of last year, when the index lost 6% as the market got off to its worst opening week in history. Neiman Marcus won't go public after all Shan Li High-end retailer Neiman Marcus has backed out of an initial public offering. The Dallas chain initially filed in 2015 to go public, but later said it would delay its plans until 2016. On Friday, Neiman Marcus said it has abandoned an IPO altogether after deciding that “it is not in its best interests.”... High-end retailer Neiman Marcus has backed out of an initial public offering. The Dallas chain initially filed in 2015 to go public, but later said it would delay its plans until 2016. On Friday, Neiman Marcus said it has abandoned an IPO altogether after deciding that “it is not in its best interests.”... (Shan Li) The biggest gains went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose 2.3% to $123.41 and Apple rose 1.1% to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row, climbing 2% to $795.99, and travel website TripAdvisor jumped 3.2% to $50.77. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the November election, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose 1.5% to $118.53. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42% from 2.35%. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which enable banks to make more money on lending. Investment banks and other financial firms did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. SunTrust Banks rose 1.1% to $55.53 and Goldman Sachs climbed 1.5% to $244.90. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged behind the overall market as bond yields rose. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T fell 2% to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell 2% to $85.50. Amgen climbed 2.5% to $156.78, Sanofi fell 2.8% to $40.32 and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals sank 5.8% to $358.68 after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they would appeal the ruling, which came in U.S. District Court in Delaware. ICU Medical slumped 10.5% to $131.88 after the San Clemente maker of medical devices said sales at a business it is buying are still falling. Gap ticked up 0.4% to $23.34 after the San Francisco clothier reported improved sales in November and December.

The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. Sam Stovall, a U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said there was good news for most industries. That's because workers are being paid more, but the report won't push the Fed to raise rates quickly in order to stave off inflation. "Consumers are earning a bit more and as a result can spend more," he said. "But ... people are not too worried the Fed will have to slam on the brakes." At about 12:40 p.m. the Dow peaked at 19,999.63, but later lost steam. It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,367.28. Stocks finished the week with a big gain as investors remained optimistic about the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent. That was a marked change from last year, when the index lost 6 percent as the market got off to its worst opening week in history. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, which was solid but slightly disappointing. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest monthly increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. The biggest gains went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose $2.74, or 2.3 percent, to $123.41 and Apple gained $1.30, or 1.1 percent, to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row and added $15.54, or 2 percent, to $795.99 while travel website TripAdvisor picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $50.77. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose $1.77, or 1.5 percent, to $118.53. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Investment banks and other financial firms did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. SunTrust Banks rose 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $55.53 and Goldman Sachs jumped $3.58, or 1.5 percent, to $244.90. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged the market as bond yields rose. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 84 cents, or 2 percent, to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell $1.74, or 2 percent, to $85.50. Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $3.80, or 2.5 percent, to $156.78 while Regeneron slid $22.24, or 5.8 percent, to $358.68 and Sanofi lost $1.18, or 2.8 percent, to $40.32. The dollar rose to 117.02 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0532 from $1.0590. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $7.90 to $1,173.40 an ounce. Silver sank 12 cents to $16.52 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.55 a pound. The FTSE 100 index in Britain inched up 0.2 percent. It's risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. Germany's DAX edged up 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 of France rose 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 percent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 percent.

The Telegraph reports that the boss of Wall Street giant JP Morgan has warned the French president that the country is unlikely to lure banking jobs away from London after Brexit unless the nation overhauls employment legislation. Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s respected chief executive, is said to have told Francois Hollande in October that France must loosen its tight labour laws, which currently make it difficult for banks to recruit and shed staff, if Paris is to rival London as a financial hub. Dimon is believed to have been seeking a change of legislation specifically regarding the employment of high-paid staff at financial firms. The comments were made in a meeting between Mr Hollande, Mr Dimon, and a host of advisers to JP Morgan. They are significant as competition is now hotting up among cities around the world to attract financial services jobs away from the City in the wake of the June vote for the UK to leave the European Union.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The Dow Jones industrial average is trading closer than ever to the 20,000 mark Friday as U.S. stock indexes close in on all-time highs following a shaky start. The federal government's December jobs report showed that wages jumped by the largest amount in seven years, though hiring was a bit weaker than expected. Technology and industrial companies are making the biggest gains. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 88 points, or 0.4 percent, to 19,987 as of 12:50 p.m. Eastern time. It traded above 19,999 earlier. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,280. The Nasdaq composite jumped 42 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,530. All three indexes are on pace for record closes. The small-cap Russell 2000 index added 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,373. US JOBS: The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, slightly less than analysts expected. That follows a private payrolls report Thursday that also didn't quite meet expectations. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. LEADING: Big names in technology moved higher after an initial stumble. Facebook rose $2.81, or 2.3 percent, to $123.48 while Apple gained $1.39, or 1.2 percent, to $118. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. General Electric rose 20 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $31.72 and Honeywell rose $1.76, or 1.5 percent, to $118.52. Johnson Controls climbed $1.04, or 2.5 percent, to $42.98. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.41 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Banks did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. JPMorgan Chase added 39 cents to $86.50. Among other financial firms, Goldman Sachs jumped $4, or 1.7 percent, to $245.32. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies, utilities and household goods makers, lagged the market. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 69 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $41.47 and Wal-Mart fell 92 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $68.29. DAY IN COURT: Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $5.20, or 3.4 percent, to $158.18 while Regeneron slid $21.62, or 5.7 percent, to $39.30 and Sanofi lost $1.07, or 2. percent, to $40.43. ICU FALLING: Medical device maker ICU Medical sank as the company said a business it is buying continues to weaken. It agreed to buy an infusion systems business from Pfizer in October. ICU will pay less money, but it said the division's sales are still falling, so it expects less profit from the deal. Its stock lost $14.50, or 9.8 percent, to $132.85. INTO THE GAP: Gap climbed after reporting that its sales improved over the holidays. The company said sales at older Gap and Old Navy stores both improved in December and said its annual profit should be a bit higher than it expected. The stock rose 31 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $23.56. Gap and other retailers slumped Thursday after Macy's and Kohl's posted weak November and December sales and cut their forecasts. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 116.97 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip on Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0542 from $1.0590. The stronger dollar sent precious metals prices a bit lower. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 25 cents to $54.01 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 18 cents to $57.07 a barrel in London. OVERSEAS: Germany's DAX edged up 0.1 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain inched up 0.2 percent. It's risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. The CAC-40 of France was 0.1 percent lower. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 percent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 percent.   © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

You will now receive the Pursuits newsletter Average hourly earnings jumped by 2.9 percent in the 12 months through December, the most since the last recession ended in June 2009, according to the Labor Department’s employment report released Friday in Washington. Workers in almost every category, from mining and construction to retail and education, saw paychecks rise from November. The 4.7 percent jobless rate remains close to a nine-year low, even with a tick up last month. Job and wage prospects would improve even more following any successful legislation aimed at stirring growth, such as tax cuts and infrastructure investment, as President-elect Donald Trump has promised. “The trend is clearly moving toward firmer wage growth,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. “The labor market is tight and getting tighter. I expect to see continued acceleration in wages this year.” The encouraging news on worker pay underscores the next stage of the labor-market recovery, which was defined by years of wage stagnation amid strong growth in payrolls. Now, the economy is adding jobs at a slower pace and measures of slack are diminishing, meaning labor shortages may become more common. That makes a sustained acceleration in paychecks critical to boosting household income and supporting spending. Some cooling in the job market was apparent in the latest report. Payrolls climbed by 156,000 in December after 204,000 in November, and the participation rate increased to 62.7 percent, which may continue as more people are drawn into the labor force and find work. Other measures of slack improved, including a drop in the number of Americans working part-time who would rather have a full-time position. The December report revealed that the uptick in the unemployment rate was a positive: More Americans joined the labor force but had not yet found jobs, according to the government’s labor flows data. The number of people who were jobless and gave up looking for work declined to a three-month low. One caveat: fewer people who were already in the labor force but unemployed were able to find jobs. Calendar Quirk The December increase in wages followed a 2.5 percent advance the prior month. The improvement may have, in part, reflected the unwinding of a calendar quirk that muffled the November tally. Since the 15th of the month fell within the employment survey week, increases in bi-monthly pay are more likely to have been captured. Even so, year-over-year hourly earnings have accelerated in three of the past four months, and wages were up 0.4 percent from November, matching the fastest pace since last January. Among industries that posted the biggest hourly wage gains were mining and logging, rising 0.8 percent from the previous month, and retail, up 0.6 percent. Construction workers saw earnings increase 0.4 percent, as did Americans in leisure and hospitality. Production Workers Not everyone is getting excited just yet. Barclays Plc economists Rob Martin and Michael Gapen pointed out the more modest 2.5 percent year-over-year December gain in earnings for production and non-supervisory workers, which exclude managers. “Although the solid wage numbers in December are welcome, this month’s data followed several months of relatively weak prints and do not change our view on wage growth,” Martin and Gapen said in a note. “We continue to expect modest wage gains over the next year, as we see little slack in labor markets and expect the unemployment rate to continue its long-term trend decline.” The pickup in wages, sustained over time, would also feed into broader price pressures. That would be consistent with the view that inflation continues to move toward the goal of the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates last month and expects to lift them three times this year. The strong wage gain for 2016 “strengthens the position of policy makers that think the Fed needs to get on with its normalization of official rates,” Joe Carson, director of global economic research at AllianceBernstein LP, wrote in a note. Potential fiscal stimulus from Congress and the new administration in 2017 “should raise expectations of more wage and price gains. In short, the Fed is falling behind the curve and even more so if fiscal stimulus is enacted soon,” he said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

U.S. stocks are dipping Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, after a solid but unspectacular hiring report for the month of December. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Posted: Friday, January 6, 2017 11:39 am | Updated: 7:27 am, Sat Jan 7, 2017. Higher wages push stocks to records, but Dow misses 20,000 Associated Press | 0 comments NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. Sam Stovall, a U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said there was good news for most industries. That's because workers are being paid more, but the report won't push the Fed to raise rates quickly in order to stave off inflation. "Consumers are earning a bit more and as a result can spend more," he said. "But ... people are not too worried the Fed will have to slam on the brakes." At about 12:40 p.m. the Dow peaked at 19,999.63, but later lost steam. It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,367.28. Stocks finished the week with a big gain as investors remained optimistic about the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent. That was a marked change from last year, when the index lost 6 percent as the market got off to its worst opening week in history. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, which was solid but slightly disappointing. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest monthly increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. The biggest gains went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose $2.74, or 2.3 percent, to $123.41 and Apple gained $1.30, or 1.1 percent, to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row and added $15.54, or 2 percent, to $795.99 while travel website TripAdvisor picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $50.77. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose $1.77, or 1.5 percent, to $118.53. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Investment banks and other financial firms did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. SunTrust Banks rose 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $55.53 and Goldman Sachs jumped $3.58, or 1.5 percent, to $244.90. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged the market as bond yields rose. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 84 cents, or 2 percent, to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell $1.74, or 2 percent, to $85.50. Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $3.80, or 2.5 percent, to $156.78 while Regeneron slid $22.24, or 5.8 percent, to $358.68 and Sanofi lost $1.18, or 2.8 percent, to $40.32. The dollar rose to 117.02 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0532 from $1.0590. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $7.90 to $1,173.40 an ounce. Silver sank 12 cents to $16.52 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.55 a pound. The FTSE 100 index in Britain inched up 0.2 percent. It's risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. Germany's DAX edged up 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 of France rose 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 percent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay © 2017 The Associated Press.

Ever since the U.S. presidential election, Ed Dahlberg has pretty much had a smile on his face. He brokers the sale of private jets, and already he's seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5 percent more than anticipated. "My phone is ringing off the hook" from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation in the Washington suburb of Manassas, Virginia. "Just the business climate feels like it's getting better." The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business. Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who'll be an advocate for the industry but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong an almost-decade-long sales slump. "You'll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet," said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business. Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12 percent since November 2015, the bank said. It's far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump's victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron gained 19 percent, General Dynamics rose 12 percent and Bombardier jumped 22 percent. Aircraft sales amount to about 30 percent of their revenue. "The Trump win looks positive for bizjet demand given the post-election stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama's anti-bizjet rhetoric," Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month. Alain Bellemare, chief executive officer of Canadian planemaker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees "somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates." "Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure -- it's all good for our business," he said. "So I hear the tone now and I'm optimistic." Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump's theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron's Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kansas. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Georgia. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer SA manufactures planes in Melbourne, Florida. Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multi-city visits they otherwise couldn't with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane. That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup, which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation. In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing "disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation." But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it. "I've noticed that while there's still a huge amount of inventory, people just don't keep dropping the price every week," he said. "You can really feel the floor in the market right now." × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

FILE - This Thursday, Oct. 2, 2014, file photo shows the Wall Street entrance of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are dipping Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, after a solid but unspectacular hiring report for the month of December. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK – The Dow Jones industrial average is trading closer than ever to the 20,000 mark Friday as U.S. stock indexes close in on all-time highs following a shaky start. The federal government’s December jobs report showed that wages jumped by the largest amount in seven years, though hiring was a bit weaker than expected. Technology and industrial companies are making the biggest gains. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 88 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 19,987 as of 12:50 p.m. Eastern time. It traded above 19,999 earlier. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 12 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,280. The Nasdaq composite jumped 42 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 5,530. All three indexes are on pace for record closes. The small-cap Russell 2000 index added 2 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 1,373. US JOBS: The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, slightly less than analysts expected. That follows a private payrolls report Thursday that also didn’t quite meet expectations. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 per cent from December 2015, the biggest increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. LEADING: Big names in technology moved higher after an initial stumble. Facebook rose $2.81, or 2.3 per cent, to $123.48 while Apple gained $1.39, or 1.2 per cent, to $118. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. General Electric rose 20 cents, or 0.6 per cent, to $31.72 and Honeywell rose $1.76, or 1.5 per cent, to $118.52. Johnson Controls climbed $1.04, or 2.5 per cent, to $42.98. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.41 per cent from 2.35 per cent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Banks did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. JPMorgan Chase added 39 cents to $86.50. Among other financial firms, Goldman Sachs jumped $4, or 1.7 per cent, to $245.32. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies, utilities and household goods makers, lagged the market. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 69 cents, or 1.6 per cent, to $41.47 and Wal-Mart fell 92 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $68.29. DAY IN COURT: Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron’s cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $5.20, or 3.4 per cent, to $158.18 while Regeneron slid $21.62, or 5.7 per cent, to $39.30 and Sanofi lost $1.07, or 2. per cent, to $40.43. ICU FALLING: Medical device maker ICU Medical sank as the company said a business it is buying continues to weaken. It agreed to buy an infusion systems business from Pfizer in October. ICU will pay less money, but it said the division’s sales are still falling, so it expects less profit from the deal. Its stock lost $14.50, or 9.8 per cent, to $132.85. INTO THE GAP: Gap climbed after reporting that its sales improved over the holidays. The company said sales at older Gap and Old Navy stores both improved in December and said its annual profit should be a bit higher than it expected. The stock rose 31 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $23.56. Gap and other retailers slumped Thursday after Macy’s and Kohl’s posted weak November and December sales and cut their forecasts. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 116.97 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip on Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0542 from $1.0590. The stronger dollar sent precious metals prices a bit lower. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 25 cents to $54.01 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 18 cents to $57.07 a barrel in London. OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX edged up 0.1 per cent and the FTSE 100 in Britain inched up 0.2 per cent. It’s risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. The CAC-40 of France was 0.1 per cent lower. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 per cent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 per cent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 per cent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

U.S. stocks are dipping Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, after a solid but unspectacular hiring report for the month of December. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Share story By MARLEY JAY The Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) — So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point Friday as U.S. stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records. Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages will lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth. Sam Stovall, a U.S. equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said there was good news for most industries. That’s because workers are being paid more, but the report won’t push the Fed to raise rates quickly in order to stave off inflation.

It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, at 19,963.80. The S&P 500 rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06. The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,367.28. Stocks finished the week with a big gain as investors remained optimistic about the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent. That was a marked change from last year, when the index lost 6 percent as the market got off to its worst opening week in history. The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, which was solid but slightly disappointing. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 percent from December 2015, the biggest monthly increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. The biggest gains went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose $2.74, or 2.3 percent, to $123.41 and Apple gained $1.30, or 1.1 percent, to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row and added $15.54, or 2 percent, to $795.99 while travel website TripAdvisor picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $50.77. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose $1.77, or 1.5 percent, to $118.53. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42 percent from 2.35 percent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Investment banks and other financial firms did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. SunTrust Banks rose 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $55.53 and Goldman Sachs jumped $3.58, or 1.5 percent, to $244.90. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged the market as bond yields rose. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 84 cents, or 2 percent, to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell $1.74, or 2 percent, to $85.50. Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron’s cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $3.80, or 2.5 percent, to $156.78 while Regeneron slid $22.24, or 5.8 percent, to $358.68 and Sanofi lost $1.18, or 2.8 percent, to $40.32. The dollar rose to 117.02 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0532 from $1.0590. U.S. crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline slipped less than 1 cent to $1.63 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.70 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1 cent to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $7.90 to $1,173.40 an ounce. Silver sank 12 cents to $16.52 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.55 a pound. The FTSE 100 index in Britain inched up 0.2 percent. It’s risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. Germany’s DAX edged up 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 of France rose 0.2 percent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 percent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 percent.

FILE - This Thursday, Oct. 2, 2014, file photo shows the Wall Street entrance of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are dipping Friday, Jan. 6, 2017, after a solid but unspectacular hiring report for the month of December. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) 00000 NEW YORK – The Dow Jones industrial average is trading closer than ever to the 20,000 mark Friday as U.S. stock indexes close in on all-time highs following a shaky start. The federal government’s December jobs report showed that wages jumped by the largest amount in seven years, though hiring was a bit weaker than expected. Technology and industrial companies are making the biggest gains. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 88 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 19,987 as of 12:50 p.m. Eastern time. It traded above 19,999 earlier. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 12 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,280. The Nasdaq composite jumped 42 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 5,530. All three indexes are on pace for record closes. The small-cap Russell 2000 index added 2 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 1,373. US JOBS: The Labor Department said U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in December, slightly less than analysts expected. That follows a private payrolls report Thursday that also didn’t quite meet expectations. However the government said hourly pay jumped 2.9 per cent from December 2015, the biggest increase in seven years. Overall, job growth remained steady in 2016 but slowed a bit from 2015. LEADING: Big names in technology moved higher after an initial stumble. Facebook rose $2.81, or 2.3 per cent, to $123.48 while Apple gained $1.39, or 1.2 per cent, to $118. Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election two months ago, also fared well. General Electric rose 20 cents, or 0.6 per cent, to $31.72 and Honeywell rose $1.76, or 1.5 per cent, to $118.52. Johnson Controls climbed $1.04, or 2.5 per cent, to $42.98. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.41 per cent from 2.35 per cent. Higher bond yields mean higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money on lending. Banks did better than the rest of the market Friday afternoon. JPMorgan Chase added 39 cents to $86.50. Among other financial firms, Goldman Sachs jumped $4, or 1.7 per cent, to $245.32. Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies, utilities and household goods makers, lagged the market. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because of the steady income they provide. AT&T gave up 69 cents, or 1.6 per cent, to $41.47 and Wal-Mart fell 92 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $68.29. DAY IN COURT: Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron’s cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling, which came from U.S. District Court in Delaware. Amgen stock gained $5.20, or 3.4 per cent, to $158.18 while Regeneron slid $21.62, or 5.7 per cent, to $39.30 and Sanofi lost $1.07, or 2. per cent, to $40.43. ICU FALLING: Medical device maker ICU Medical sank as the company said a business it is buying continues to weaken. It agreed to buy an infusion systems business from Pfizer in October. ICU will pay less money, but it said the division’s sales are still falling, so it expects less profit from the deal. Its stock lost $14.50, or 9.8 per cent, to $132.85. INTO THE GAP: Gap climbed after reporting that its sales improved over the holidays. The company said sales at older Gap and Old Navy stores both improved in December and said its annual profit should be a bit higher than it expected. The stock rose 31 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $23.56. Gap and other retailers slumped Thursday after Macy’s and Kohl’s posted weak November and December sales and cut their forecasts. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 116.97 yen from 115.62 yen after a dip on Thursday. The euro slipped to $1.0542 from $1.0590. The stronger dollar sent precious metals prices a bit lower. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 25 cents to $54.01 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 18 cents to $57.07 a barrel in London. OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX edged up 0.1 per cent and the FTSE 100 in Britain inched up 0.2 per cent. It’s risen nine days in a row and is at all-time highs. The CAC-40 of France was 0.1 per cent lower. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3 per cent while the Kospi in South Korea added 0.4 per cent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng advanced 0.2 per cent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay 00000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

That is fourth-quarter earnings results. While the true benefits of the Trump administration initiatives are yet to be realized, the increase in interest rates is a positive, and any increase in overall business could push earnings above current expectations. In a new Deutsche Bank research report from Matt O’Connor and his outstanding team, they make the case that a strong finish to the year in both fixed-income trading and the debt capital markets could present upside possibilities, versus management comments made last month. We screened the Deutsche Bank bank research universe and found four companies that may be just the kind of institutions that could benefit from a solid debt-trading scenario. All are rated Buy at Deutsche Bank. Goldman Sachs This continues to be the gold standard of Wall Street banks and trades at a reasonable 13 times estimated 2017 earnings. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) has a gigantic institutional equity, debt and derivatives business, an ultra-high net worth clientele, top investment banking and capital markets expertise. The bank continues to be a dominant force around the world and is one of the most sought after in the world. And it is one of the very few that dictate who can be a client at the firm. In investment banking, the company has the preeminent client franchise. Goldman Sachs advised on more than $1.5 trillion of announced mergers and acquisitions transactions last year, the highest level the bank has ever recorded. It also has maintained a leading market share over the past 25 years. It maintained a market position when merger and acquisition activity was dominated by technology in 1999, by financials in 2008 and by natural resources in 2014. The bottom line is, regardless of where market strength is in any given year, Goldman Sachs is up to the task. Goldman Sachs reported third-quarter numbers that hammered analysts’ estimates. And an improving capital market bodes well for a firm that is a leader in the IPO world. Goldman Sachs shareholders receive a 1.09% dividend. The Deutsche Bank price target for the stock is $255, and the Wall Street consensus target is $227.12. The stock closed Thursday at $241.32 JPMorgan This stock trades at a reasonable 13.3 times estimated 2017 forward earnings and could respond well in a rising rate scenario. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) is expected to continue to benefit from commercial loan growth and an upturn in capital spending. Wall Street analysts agree that the stock seems attractively valued on estimated price-to-earnings and a very solid price-to-book value. Some on Wall Street have cautioned that last year’s divestiture of the physical commodities business could provide earnings headwinds throughout this year. The company also reported outstanding third-quarter results, and top Wall Street analysts think the results are sustainable going forward. The Deutsche Bank estimates for the bank are above the Wall Street consensus number. Despite being a crowded trade, many analysts feel that the bank’s superior earnings growth should continue stock outperformance. Improvement in loan growth, terrific equity capital markets and a steady increase in deposits will be a solid plus. Trading at a discount to many of the large cap banks on 2016 earnings estimates helps upside potential as well. With $2.6 trillion in assets on a worldwide basis, and one of Wall Street’s savviest leaders in Jamie Dimon, the stock is a solid buy for investors. Last year, Dimon put his money where his mouth was and reportedly bought a stunning 500,000 shares of JPMorgan stock for a massive $26 million. That brought his total holdings in the bank to 6.7 million shares, worth over $360 million. Investors receive a 2.25% dividend. The $90 Deutsche Bank price target compares with the consensus target of $80.45. Shares closed yesterday at $86.11.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo    5408979 Wells Fargo is the latest multinational bank to announce that it is raising its minimum wage for U.S. workers, according to recent reports. Wells Fargo is upping its minimum wage from $12 an hour to $13.50, and this change will take effect Sunday. The increase will initially impact 25,000 mid-to-entry level employees, including bank tellers, phone bankers, and customer service representatives. Minimum pay will range from just over $13 an hour, and go as high as $17 an hour. Wells Fargo’s old pay range is between $12 and $16, the Charlotte Observer reports. Many big banks are making the move towards higher minimum wages, in hopes to retain talent in an industry that is both ultra-competitive and becoming increasingly mechanized. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon announced in July that the firm would raise minimum pay for 18,000 low-tier employees somewhere “between $12 and $16.50 an hour for full-time, part-time and new employees, depending on geographic and market factors.” Dimon hopes the raise will “attract and retain talented people.” Bank of America also plans to raise its minimum wage to $15, up from $13.50 an hour. (RELATED: The Death Of The Banker) Wells Fargo insists the pay raise is not in any way a public relations response to recent scandals. “This is part of our normal course of business where we understand what’s happening in the competitive landscape and how we retain and attract top talent,” a Wells Fargo spokeswoman told reporters. Wells Fargo made a big splash when news broke that the firm may have committed fraud against thousands of customers nationwide. Bank employees issued 565,000 lines of credit and opened 1.5 million bank accounts for customers without their consent between 2011-2014, and sometimes created false email addresses to sign them up for banking services in order to pad numbers. Some 14,000 of those credit accounts accrued over $400,000 in fees alone. (RELATED: DOJ Demands Wells Fargo Whistleblower Testify In Formal Investigation) Initially, Wells Fargo was slapped by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with a $185 million fine — the largest ever imposed by the federal agency — after finding the practices in question were rampant and pervasive throughout Wells Fargo’s business model in the years since 2011. After undergoing through a lengthy investigatory process, the bank settled the scandal by removing former chief executive John Stumpf. In recent weeks, the bank launched a campaign to make good with customers and with the public.

The officials' remarks came after the Indonesian government cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co following a November downgrade by the U.S. bank in its Indonesian stocks recommendation to "underweight" from "overweight". While Indonesia has subsequently sought to reassure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is "credible", some Jakarta-based analysts at foreign banks have said they were becoming more cautious. Suahasil Nazara, the Finance Ministry's head of fiscal policy office, said on Friday that primary bond dealers have to ensure their assessments of Indonesia are based on facts and do not cause a disruption to the financial system. "The point is, the analysis has to be credible and correspond to factual data," Nazara said in a text message. A primary bond dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. The regulation will "hopefully" be released next week and will govern the accountability of analysis or the release of information, Robert Pakpahan, director-general of budget financing and risk management, said in a text message. "The publication of analysis and opinion that is inaccurate, speculative in nature and not based on facts will not be allowed," Pakpahan said, adding that the regulation has to be approved by the finance minister. In the JPMorgan case, the Finance Ministry dropped the U.S. bank's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. JPMorgan said in response that the impact on its clients was minimal and that it continued to operate its business as usual in Indonesia. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP Indonesia's sensitivity to negative commentary is likely enhanced due to the relatively high foreign ownership of its sovereign bonds and broader concerns over potential capital outflows, analysts have said. Emerging markets, including Indonesia, are vulnerable to potentially disruptive capital outflows as expectations of faster U.S. interest rate hikes and President-elect Donald Trump's promise of fiscal stimulus push the dollar higher. More protectionist trade policies under Trump could intensify that pressure. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's government bonds, while the local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for the Southeast Asian nation. Foreign investors sold 20.15 trillion rupiah ($1.5 billion) of Indonesian government bonds in the three weeks after Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. JPMorgan's skirmish with the Indonesian government also highlights the conflicts that banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or a company. Banks ranging from Morgan Stanley in China to Banco Santander in Brazil have faced rows with governments in emerging markets, although the pressure has usually been less explicit than faced by JPMorgan in Indonesia. In some cases that had led to a chilling effect where analysts cut back on even run-of-the-mill research, leaving investors in the dark as to any risks or opportunities. David Sumual, chief economist at PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA), said the "fire-wall" between the bank's business and research divisions had been reinforced since the global financial crisis in 2008. Sumual said his research is based on the data that is available to him, but "there's still a disclaimer that this can change from time to time and the ultimate decision still lies with the investors." BCA is Indonesia's biggest bank by market value and one of the country's primary dealers.

By Monica Eaton-Cardone January 6, 2017 - 10:30 am Share: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Google+ Email During 2015, UK online retailers took over £114bn in sales, a figure expected to rise to £126bn by the end of 2016. Convenience to pay and shop almost anywhere and anytime is fuelling unprecedented levels of online spending. But beneath the rose-tinted façade of such huge growth, what is happening to internet retailers behind the scenes? It’s well known that fraudsters are attracted to opportunity, and with billions to play for, it’s no surprise that internet retailing has become one of the most attractive areas to target. The threat of chargebacks: who is in danger? According to JP Morgan Chase, retailers saw 7% transaction growth last year, but chargebacks increased by a massive 20%. Aité Group reports that this results in more than £30 billion in losses for the retail industry and banking sector. However, chargebacks affect each merchant differently. Rates can fluctuate based on a business’s policies and operations, as well as the products or services being offered. Despite overall trends, when it comes to individual industries, there is still a distinct pattern. At Chargebacks911, we’ve analysed our global data across industries, enabling us to decipher the problem areas in UK retail when it comes to chargebacks. Digital goods: Following global trends, the digital goods sector is the hardest hit in the UK. Our data revealed that as much as 24% of all UK digital purchases over the final three months of 2015 were hit by chargebacks. Diet and nutrition: Chargebacks affected over 13% of purchases in the diet and nutrition product sector in the same period. Beauty: In the beauty industry, 12.1% of purchases resulted in a chargeback. These statistics are alarming. Considering card networks take punitive action when chargeback rates exceed a mere 1% of total sales, retailers in these industries can quickly breach allotted thresholds. This means that merchants will not only lose significant amounts of revenue, they’ll also pay excessive fees and suffer other processing restrictions. It is imperative for merchants to understand the causes for chargebacks and create a customised mitigation plan. Mitigating chargebacks and maintaining revenue Effective chargeback management requires both long-term and short-term aims. To achieve industry-wide results, retailers and other industry members must work together to modify current consumer behaviours. Abuse of the chargeback process through the use of illegitimate transaction disputes is a growing concern for retailers around the globe. Half of all cardholders who succeed in securing an illegitimate chargeback will seek another within 90 days. By disputing these illegitimate chargebacks, merchants challenge the faulty consumer behaviour and reduce future risks for everyone involved. In the short-term though, merchants can address chargeback threats on an individual level; it is possible to make simple yet effective process changes that demonstrably help to reduce unnecessary chargeback losses. Adhere to business best practices: it may sound obvious, but it is important to always adhere to business best practices. This involves everything from ensuring the customer receives the correct product to answering emails in a timely fashion. Learn from your experience: stay informed on the reasons behind chargebacks so that you can challenge them when appropriate. Learn from each experience to prevent future risk and respond more effectively. Be available at all times: ecommerce is a 24-hours-a-day business. If customers cannot contact you when they want, they will contact their bank instead—which often is far easier. Honour cancellation and refund requests promptly: returns may be a costly and time-consuming process, but they are actually superior in many ways to chargebacks. Prominently display your refund policies and contact information to help reduce the risk of chargebacks. Then, act in accordance with your policy and refund qualified transactions quickly to avoid unnecessary chargebacks. Make your case with the banks: keep detailed records up-to-date, from the order to the delivery confirmation. Provide necessary information to the bank promptly if a chargeback claim is initiated. Clearly outline terms of service: it is especially important for merchants who process recurring payments to outline all billing information prior to completing the sale. Communicate to maintain loyalty: in today’s age of instant gratification, consumers are often more loyal to convenience than they are to actual brands. Loyalty programs, special offers, and even regular communications help maintain satisfaction and prevent chargebacks. Create a dynamic mitigation strategy: card network rules are constantly changing and a lack of standardisation means processes vary among banks. Meanwhile, consumer behaviours evolve over time too. If you are using an automated management tool or submit one-size-fits-all disputes, it is imperative that you devise a more dynamic approach that takes advantage of agile solutions. Otherwise, you’ll be left using static, incomplete data to address the wrong problems – which will obviously produce below-par results. Effective and comprehensive strategies are available to liberate in-house resources. The mindset of “chargebacks are just a cost of doing business” is no longer true. Taking such an approach in the online world could be the death knell for any retailer.

The GBI-EM Global Diversified index is tracked by investment funds managing $185 billion, and Argentina will have an estimated 1.16 percent weight when it enters at the end of February, JPM said in a note to clients late on Thursday. That implies fairly significant inflow from index-tracking funds to Argentina which, according to JPM, will be the first country in four years to enter the GBI-EM. The news will be welcomed by Argentina's government which has struggled to attract investment, despite sweeping reforms by centre-right President Mauricio Macri who took office at the end of 2015 with a vow to revive an economy in crisis. Argentina fought a long legal battle with hedge funds over unpaid debt resulting from its record $100 billion default in 2002, which locked it out of global debt markets for years. That dispute was settled last year. But while Macri has also floated the peso, removed capital curbs and brought Argentina back to the global bond market, it remains mired in recession with 40 percent inflation. Macri sacked his finance minister last month. New Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne took fresh steps this week to revive investment, removing a mandatory 120-day holding period for foreigners wanting to repatriate funds from Latin America's third biggest economy. JPM said peso-denominated bonds maturing 2021, 2023 and 2026 would join the GBI-EM "following a series of measures implemented recently to facilitate access to the FX and government bond market for foreign investors". Argentine debt will also be eligible for inclusion in JPM's GBI-EM (Narrow) Diversified and the GBI-EM Broad Diversified series with estimated weights of 3.34 and 0.78 percent respectively, JPM said. "(Index entry) is a significant move for Argentina and it will help bring down borrowing costs. It will also provide support for the peso," said Jakob Christensen, head of emerging markets research at Danske Bank. "It's been cut out of financial markets for many years so it hasn't been able to leverage itself as (much) as other emerging markets, which is a good thing." JPM now plans to assess Argentine peso non-deliverable forwards for eligibility to enter its ELMI Plus index of emerging currency short-term rates. If the currency derivative meets liquidity and transparency criteria, Argentina will have a 1.4 percent weight in the ELMI Plus. Separately, Argentine stocks could also re-join the most widely used emerging equity benchmark from MSCI, which is tracked by around $1.4 trillion in funds. MSCI had moved Argentina out of that index to the smaller frontier market index in 2009 due to curbs on capital movement but it has proposed reclassifying the country as an emerging market again, with the outcome due to be announced in June.

Traders rejoiced as the FTSE 100 hit a record high, but will the glory be short-lived? Credit: Spencer Platt/Getty Images Laura Suter 6 January 2017 • 8:30am Britain’s blue-chip index may have started the year by reaching a succession of highs - six record closes mark its longest winning streak in two decades - but how solid are those gains? In 2016, the FTSE 100 ended the first week in January on 5,912 points, in the first week of this year it scaled to 7,208 points - a rise of 22pc. While many investors will see the record levels as reason to rejoice, the underlying causes are not so cheering. The fall in sterling is particularly significant: around 70pc of FTSE 100 companies’ earnings are made overseas and any fall in the pound makes them more valuable in sterling terms. During 2016 the FTSE 100 rose by more than 19pc. However, in US dollar terms – stripping out the positive impact of sterling’s fall – the index actually fell, by 0.2pc. The rise of the index in 2016 also hides enormous divergence. Looking at the index sector by sector shows that there were some large risers and some steady fallers. Oil and gas producers rose by 61pc last year, while the FTSE 350 mining index rose by 100pc. Basic materials, which includes the mining and refining of metals, chemical producers and forestry products, rose by 90pc, while the construction and materials industry rose by 49pc. On the other hand, retailers fell by nearly 14pc, while the telecoms sector was down 12pc and food producers lost 9pc. Real estate was hit the hardest, falling by 32pc in the year.

Capital at risk Jason Hollands from Tilney Bestinvest, the fund shop, said: “Currency moves rescued markets for UK investors last year. If you were cautious a year ago, with concerns about the uncertain geopolitical outlook, then this year has similar warnings.” He pointed to a “marathon” of European elections and the potential unpredictability of Donald Trump’s presidency. 2016 sector breakdown Chris Wyllie, chief investment officer at Connor Broadley, the wealth management firm, said he did not have concerns about the valuations of British companies but advised investors to be discerning and to “buy the dips”. “There are going to be some bloodbath sectors for medium-sized firms, retail being one. More businesses will be going to the wall,” he said. Mr Wyllie pointed to the example of Next, which this week issued a profit warning after slower Christmas sales, and said: “If Next is feeling it, what are the less good businesses out there going to be doing?” Next Plc However, investors also need to separate the fortunes of the FTSE 100 index from their feelings about the domestic economy. “The UK stock market is not that reflective of the UK economy. Investors’ view on the UK economy is not a particularly positive one,” said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. There are some big question marks hanging over Britain in 2017, said Tom Stevenson from Fidelity, the asset manager. The first is domestic earnings. “Economic growth in the UK is probably going to slow down significantly because inflation is likely to rise and that means real consumer purchasing power is going to diminish,” he said. It wouldn't surprise me to see inflation of 3-4pc later this year, which will put a squeeze on consumer spendingBen Yearsley, Wealth Club Inflation will hit the price of any goods imported, hurting UK consumers' pockets, said Ben Yearsley, investment director at Wealth Club, an investment service. "UK inflation is still relatively benign with retail prices index running at 2.2pc. As we import many goods into the UK, the depreciation in sterling will start pushing the costs of goods we import up, thus forcing inflation up. "It wouldn't surprise me to see inflation of 3-4pc later this year, which will put a squeeze on consumer spending. Normally the Bank of England would raise rates to combat inflation, but this might not happen this time," he said. The other big risk to British shares is Brexit and the associated uncertainty. Mr Bell said the fall in sterling had priced in a “hard Brexit” that might not materialise. “If so, sterling will rally and that could reverse some of the gains that we have seen as a result of its fall,” he said.

The U.S. dollar stayed near three-week lows against a basket of currencies though it bounced back a tad as the Chinese yuan gave up some of its massive gains made during the previous two days following Friday's midpoint fixing by China's central bank. "The market appears to be on risk-on mode. It could be because of stabilising U.S. yields. It could be signs of stability in Europe, or a recovery in oil. Anything that has been battered by higher U.S. rates is coming back," Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. MSCI's gauge of the world's stock markets hit its highest levels in a year and a half, having risen 1.8 percent since the start of year, helped by this week's generally upbeat economic indicators in the U.S. and China. In Asia, MSCI's ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares index rose 0.25 percent to its highest in four weeks. In contrast, Japan's Nikkei, one of the best performers since Republican Trump won the Nov. 8 election, dropped 0.4 percent as the yen gained versus the dollar. Trump's victory had sparked a major realignment in markets. Expectations that his administration will bring tax cuts, higher spending and deregulation have boosted U.S. bond yields and the dollar, to the detriment of many emerging economies that have benefitted from cheap dollar funding and had attracted trillions of dollars from investors shunning low U.S. yields. "What's going on is a correction of the 'Trump trade' since the election. The markets have been trying to fully price in his policies just based on hopes," said Koichi Yoshikawa, executive director of finance at Standard Chartered Bank in Tokyo. "From now on, it's not going to be a simple one-way bet," he said. Already under pressure from profit taking as the Trump rally wanes, the dollar extended losses on Thursday as China stepped up efforts to support the yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. The cost of borrowing the yuan in Hong Kong, the main offshore yuan trading centre, sky-rocketed, making it too costly for speculators to sell the yuan against the dollar. The offshore yuan gained more than 2 percent in the last two sessions, their biggest two-day gain on record, to a two-month high of 6.7833 per dollar before it eased back about 0.5 percent in Asia on Friday to 6.8208. The dollar also slumped to a three-week low of 115.21 yen, having shed 1.6 percent on Thursday, its biggest fall in five months. It bounced back 0.4 percent on Friday to 115.80 yen. The euro also posted its biggest gain in seven months, of 1.1 percent, on Thursday and last fetched $1.0588. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies tumbled to 101.30, falling more than two percent from its 14-year high of 103.82 set on Tuesday. Investors also rushed out of their selling positions in U.S. bonds, one of the most convincing plays since the election because Trump's policies are seen as stoking inflation. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hit a one-month low of 2.344 percent, having fallen about 30 basis points from its two-year high of 2.641 percent touched on Dec. 15. Investors also scaled back their expectations of the Fed's rate hikes this year, with Federal Funds rate futures pricing in two rate hikes compared with two and a half at the peak in December. Markets largely shrugged off U.S. economic data published on Thursday which was generally strong. The increase in private payrolls was on the weaker side of market expectations, however, raising some concerns about the upcoming jobs data due at 1330 GMT. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 Index dipped 0.1 percent as retailers such as Macy's and Kohl's slumped on weak holiday sales. Financials were also hit by a fall in U.S. bond yields but hi-tech shares, which have underperformed since Trump's victory partly on concerns about his rocky relationship with Silicon Valley, shone. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 percent to hit a record high, led by gains in online retailer Amazon.com. Oil prices held firm, supported by news that Saudi Arabia had cut production to meet OPEC's agreement to reduce output.

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK NEW YORK Stocks overcame early weakness and the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields rallied on Friday after data showed U.S. wages rose in December even as hiring slowed, setting the economy up for further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year. The stronger greenback weighed on dollar-denominated commodity prices, but oil rose slightly on increased buying ahead of the weekend. Nonfarm payrolls rose less than expected in December, the Labor Department said, but a rebound in wages highlighted sustained labor market momentum that points to stronger growth and could drive the Fed to consider raising rates as early as the first quarter. "There's still improvement to be made, especially with the labor force participation rate being low, but conditions seem to be close to what the Fed might be happy with," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. MSCI's world index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 46 countries, erased most of its earlier losses to trade little changed. U.S. stocks advanced and the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI came within one point of hitting 20,000 for the first time ever. U.S. equities have risen sharply since Donald Trump won the U.S. election in November and while Friday's gains suggested the rally is not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. "The market's advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency," said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. "But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don't think this time will be any different." The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 64.51 points, or 0.32 percent, to close at 19,963.8, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 7.98 points, or 0.351697 percent, to finish at 2,276.98 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 5,521.06. Apple (AAPL.O) shares climbed 1.1 percent after Canada's Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. European shares rallied from the day's lows after the U.S. jobs data. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 finished little changed at 1,444.97. The dollar rose, boosted by the solid U.S. jobs report, after tumbling the day before on mixed U.S. economic data and apparent action by Chinese authorities to shore up the yuan. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, was up 0.66 percent to 102.19. In bond markets, U.S. Treasury debt yields rose across the board. Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose from a five-week trough, while those on 30-year bonds recovered from a seven-week low following the jobs data. "We definitely think rates are going to continue to climb from here," said Justin Tabellione, senior fixed income portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management America in Chicago. "I would not be surprised to see 10-year yields closer to 3 percent some time this year as soon as the summer, once we get clarity on what's going to happen on the fiscal stimulus plan." In late trading, the U.S. 10-year note US10YT=RR was down 13/32 in price, yielding 2.419 percent, compared with 2.368 percent late on Thursday. Meanwhile, the stronger dollar weighed on dollar-denominated commodities. Gold prices slipped from the previous day's one-month high as the dollar strengthened. Spot gold XAU= fell 0.68 percent to $1,172.33 an ounce. Palladium however remained on track for its largest weekly gain since March on record high U.S. car sales. Oil rose slightly, ending the week higher, but gains were limited by the stronger dollar and lingering doubts about whether OPEC producers would stick to a deal to cut crude output. Brent crude LCOc1 settled up 21 cents, or 0.37 percent, at $57.10 a barrel, and U.S. crude CLc1 settled up 23 cents, or 0.43 percent, at $53.99.

MSCI's gauge of the world's stock markets hit its highest levels in a year and a half, having risen 1.8 percent since the start of year, helped by this week's generally upbeat economic indicators in the U.S. and China. In Asia, MSCI's ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares index rose 0.25 percent to its highest in four weeks. In contrast, Japan's Nikkei, one of the best performers since Republican Trump won the Nov. 8 election, dropped 0.4 percent as the yen gained versus the dollar. Trump's victory had sparked a major realignment in markets. Expectations that his administration will bring tax cuts, higher spending and deregulation have boosted U.S. bond yields and the dollar, to the detriment of many emerging economies that have benefitted from cheap dollar funding and had attracted trillions of dollars from investors shunning low U.S. yields. "What's going on is a correction of the 'Trump trade' since the election. The markets have been trying to fully price in his policies just based on hopes," said Koichi Yoshikawa, executive director of finance at Standard Chartered Bank in Tokyo. "From now on, it's not going to be a simple one-way bet," he said. Already under pressure from profit taking as the Trump rally wanes, the dollar extended losses on Thursday as China stepped up efforts to support the yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. The cost of borrowing the yuan in Hong Kong, the main offshore yuan trading centre, sky-rocketed, making it too costly for speculators to sell the yuan against the dollar. The offshore yuan gained more than 2 percent in the last two sessions, their biggest two-day gain on record, to a two-month high of 6.7833 per dollar before it eased back about 0.5 percent in Asia on Friday to 6.8208. The dollar also slumped to a three-week low of 115.21 yen, having shed 1.6 percent on Thursday, its biggest fall in five months. It bounced back 0.4 percent on Friday to 115.80 yen. The euro also posted its biggest gain in seven months, of 1.1 percent, on Thursday and last fetched $1.0588. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies tumbled to 101.30, falling more than two percent from its 14-year high of 103.82 set on Tuesday. Investors also rushed out of their selling positions in U.S. bonds, one of the most convincing plays since the election because Trump's policies are seen as stoking inflation. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hit a one-month low of 2.344 percent, having fallen about 30 basis points from its two-year high of 2.641 percent touched on Dec. 15. Investors also scaled back their expectations of the Fed's rate hikes this year, with Federal Funds rate futures pricing in two rate hikes compared with two and a half at the peak in December. Markets largely shrugged off U.S. economic data published on Thursday which was generally strong. The increase in private payrolls was on the weaker side of market expectations, however, raising some concerns about the upcoming jobs data due at 1330 GMT. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 Index dipped 0.1 percent as retailers such as Macy's and Kohl's slumped on weak holiday sales. Financials were also hit by a fall in U.S. bond yields but hi-tech shares, which have underperformed since Trump's victory partly on concerns about his rocky relationship with Silicon Valley, shone. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 percent to hit a record high, led by gains in online retailer Amazon.com. Oil prices held firm, supported by news that Saudi Arabia had cut production to meet OPEC's agreement to reduce output. International benchmark Brent crude futures stood at $56.89 a barrel, flat on the day and up 3.1 percent on the week.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Enlarge Caption  Email More A A LONDON: World stocks held near 1-1/2 year highs and the dollar moved up from a three-week low on Friday, with investors looking to upcoming U.S. jobs data to provide clues on the pace of U.S. interest rate rises this year. MSCI's gauge of the world's stock markets hit its highest since July 2015, taking its gains so far this year to 1.7 percent, helped by this week's generally upbeat economic readings in the U.S., China and Europe. Asian shares recovered to four-week highs, while the pan-European STOXX 600 dipped 0.2 percent, just 0.6 percent off a 1-year high hit this week. A Reuters survey of economists signaled that U.S. employers were likely to have maintained a solid pace of hiring in December while raising wages, putting the economy on a path to stronger growth and further interest rate increases this year. Non-farm payrolls probably increased by 178,000 jobs last month, the survey showed. Federal Reserve minutes from December released this week showed that almost all Fed policymakers thought the economy could grow more quickly because of fiscal stimulus and many were eyeing faster interest rate rises than previously expected. Despite this, investors have scaled back expectations for the number of rate rises this year since December, and the dollar is down from this week's 14-year high. The currency slumped 1.6 percent on Thursday to a three-week low of 115.04 yen , its biggest fall for five months. It bounced back 0.6 percent on Friday to 116 yen. Weaker-than-expected private-sector ADP payrolls data on Thursday contributed to the dip in the dollar, despite strong data elsewhere. Investors were looking to today's jobs figures to see if the bounceback for the dollar could be sustained. "It's likely that a stronger jobs number will, in the shorter term, strengthen the dollar. But (soon) people will start questioning how much of a strong dollar the Fed can stomach," ETF Securities' head of research and investment strategy, James Butterfill, said. "Given the sell-off in the dollar, there could be appreciation over the next few weeks, but in the coming few months we could see further dollar weakness." The recent surge in the dollar and its borrowing costs sparked by Donald Trump's election victory has eased, with the U.S. 10-year yield slipping to one-month lows. The dollar did bounce back slightly against the yuan , which gave up some of the massive gains made in the previous two days despite Friday's strong midpoint fixing by China's central bank. In Asia, MSCI's ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares index touched a four-week high, while Japan's Nikkei , one of the best performers since Trump's win on Nov. 8, dropped 0.3 percent. "What's going on is a correction of the 'Trump trade' since the election. The markets have been trying to fully price in his policies just based on hopes," Standard Chartered's executive director of finance, Koichi Yoshikawa, said. "From now on, it's not going to be a simple one-way bet." Trump's victory had sparked a major realignment in markets.

The offshore yuan has gained more than 2 percent in the last two sessions, its biggest two-day gain on record, to a two-month high of 6.7833 per dollar before it eased back about 1 percent in Asia on Friday to 6.8610. Having posted its biggest gain for 7 months, of 1.1 percent, in the previous session, it fetched US$1.0589 on Friday. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies was up 0.1 percent at 101.640, down more than two percent from Tuesday's 14-year high of 103.82. Investors also closed short positions in U.S. bonds, one of the most popular plays since the election because Trump's policies are seen as stoking inflation. Oil prices were steady as Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi stared promised supply cuts, but doubts that all producers will implement output reductions agreed in a landmark OPEC deal last year kept markets from rising further. International benchmark Brent crude futures traded up 0.2 percent at US$56.97 per barrel.

European shares were expected to be little changed, with financial spreadbetters expecting a flat to 0.1 per cent rise in Britain's FTSE and a flat to slightly weaker opening in Germany's DAX. The US dollar stayed near three-week lows against a basket of currencies though it bounced back slightly as the Chinese yuan gave up some of its massive gains made in the previous two days despite Friday's strong midpoint fixing by China's central bank.

The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hit a one-month low of 2.344 percent, having fallen about 30 basis points from its two-year high of 2.641 percent touched on Dec. 15. Investors also scaled back their expectations of the Fed's rate hikes this year, with Federal Funds rate futures <_0FF:_> pricing in two rate hikes compared with two and a half at the peak in December. Markets largely shrugged off U.S. economic data on Thursday which was generally strong. The increase in private payrolls was on the weaker side of market expectations, however, raising some concerns about the upcoming jobs data due at 1330 GMT. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 Index dipped 0.1 percent as retailers such as Macy's and Kohl's slumped on weak holiday sales. Financials were also hit by a fall in U.S. bond yields, but hi-tech shares shone. They have underperformed since Trump's victory partly on concerns about his rocky relationship with Silicon Valley. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 percent to hit a record high, led by gains in online retailer Amazon.com . Oil prices were steady as the start of supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi supported the market, but doubts that all producers will implement output reductions agreed in a landmark deal last year kept markets from rising further. International benchmark Brent crude futures traded at $56.76 per barrel, down 0.2 cents from their close the previous day.

(JPM) Stock for Earnings Riches View All Posts The turn of the year brings hope for new themes and trends to strike the Street. But if you’re a financial stock lover, more of the same will do just fine, thank you very much. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) closed out 2016 in bullish fashion with bank stocks from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) soaring into the Christmas season. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr BAC stock closed out the year with an impressive 31% gain. What’s more, BofA scored the entirety of the gains after the November election. The first 10 months of the year were a bust for the entire financial sector. With higher rates and deregulation on the horizon, the denizens of the Street are buying up bank stocks with abandon. Bank of America has now climbed to an eight-year high. Indeed, the $20 level (which was breached during the post-election buying binge) has sat untouched since BAC shares plunged beneath it during the 2008 meltdown. With mega-resistance now shattered, BAC stock holders are hoping a new bull market has begun — one with the mustard to carry shares higher for years to come. At a minimum, spectators have to admit the weekly price chart of BofA looks better than at any time over the past decade. Click to Enlarge Source: OptionsAnalytix On the daily front, the stock is in bull flag mode. Of course, the recent chop can’t be too surprising given how overbought the stock had become following the financial stock explosion. The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New Year Fortunately for would-be buyers, a lower-risk entry is now in the offing. How to Trade BAC Stock Here If you think the good times keep rolling for Bank of America, consider grabbing the BAC April 22 calls for $1.68 or better. Fear has fled in the wake of the rousing rally. And that means options can now be snatched up on the cheap. Your max loss is limited to the initial $1.68 and will be forfeited if BAC stock sits below $22 at expiration. The max gain is unlimited, which means you can continue banking coin on the back of BofA bulls. As of this writing, Tyler Craig owned bullish positions on XLF.

(AAPL) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU) 2 Trades to Play the Exxon Mobil (XOM) Stock Breakout (or Breakdown) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are on the rise again this morning, as Wall Street is once again on Dow 20K watch. The Dow Jones Industrial Average crept back above the 10,900 mark yesterday, and if investors like what they see in today’s release of last month’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, we could see the Dow challenge 20,000. What’s more, December auto sales will also begin to leak onto the Street today. Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.18%, S&P 500 futures have gained 0.19% and Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.15%. On the options front, volume finally returned to normal levels on Tuesday, with roughly 15.9 million calls and 11.2 million puts changing hands. The heavy skew toward call activity bled over into the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio hit retreated from one-week high to rest at 0.69. The 10-day moving average held at a one-month high of 0.67. Turning to Tuesday’s volume leaders, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) saw record short-term options volume on Tuesday ahead of today’s ex-dividend date and next Friday’s earnings report. Elsewhere, put activity ramped up on Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) despite Citigroup’s upgrade to “buy,” while Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) received a bullish lift in sentiment after it cancelled its plans for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) JPM stock trades ex-dividend today, with shareholders of record as of the close last night receiving a payout of 48 cents per share on Jan. 31. As with all ex-dividend dates, JPM stock was flooded with deep-in-the-money call activity as traders implemented dividend capture strategies. The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New Year That said, some of yesterday’s VZ options volume may have been geared toward next week’s quarterly earnings report. Verizon is expected to post a profit of $1.42 per share on Friday next week, with revenue seen coming in at $23.87 billion. EarningsWhispers.com places the whisper number at $1.47 per share, though given President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of decreased regulation and the Federal Reserve’s threat of three interest rate hikes in 2017, guidance may well be the real driver for JPM stock next week. Still, don’t expect to see options volume similar to yesterday’s activity, where roughly 2.1 million contracts traded with calls snapping up 95% of the day’s take.

Schumpeter The three Rs behind global banks’ recovery Soaring share prices suggest the end of the tunnel for big banks Jan 7th 2017 Add this article to your reading list by clicking this button Tweet IN THE Bible, seven years of feast were followed by seven years of famine. For banks there have been ten lean years. Subprime-loan defaults started to rise in February 2007, causing a near-collapse of the industry in America and Europe. Next came bail-outs from governments, then years of grovelling before regulators, mass firings of staff and quarter after quarter of poor results that left banks’ shareholders disappointed. Now, a decade later, the moneylenders are quietly wondering if 2017 is the year in which their industry turns a corner. Over the past six months the FTSE index of global bank shares has leapt by 24%. American banks have led the way, with the value of Bank of America rising by 67%, and that of JPMorgan Chase by 39%. In Europe BNP Paribas’ market value has risen by 52%. In Japan shares in the lumbering Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group—the rich world’s biggest bank by assets—have behaved like those of a frisky internet startup; they are up by 57%. Predictions about global banks’ future returns on equity have stopped falling, note analysts at UBS, a Swiss bank. Some of the biggest casualties of the financial crisis are even expanding. On December 20th Lloyds, bailed out by British taxpayers in 2009 at a cost of $33bn, said it would buy MBNA, a credit-card firm, for $2bn. In this section Nestlé looks for ways to boost stale growth as consumers snub unhealthy food Toshiba admits to a ruinous overpayment for an American nuclear firm Ford Motors courts Donald Trump by scrapping a planned plant in Mexico The three Rs behind global banks’ recovery Reprints Related topics Europe Japan Banking United States The excitement can be explained by three Rs: rates, regulation and returns. Consider interest rates first. The slump in rates has been terrible for banks. Between 2010 and 2015, the net interest income of the rich world’s 100 biggest banks fell by $100bn, or about half of 2010 profits. When rates across the economy rise, by contrast, banks can expand margins by charging borrowers more, while passing on only some of the benefit of higher rates to depositors. So bankers have been watching the bond market with barely concealed joy. Ten-year government yields have risen by one percentage point in America, and by 0.30-0.64 points in the big euro-zone economies and Japan over the last six months. Investors are talking about a Trump-inspired “reflation”: the president-elect promises to embark on a public-spending boom. In Germany inflation is at a three-year high of 1.7%. Banks’ CEOs are also chipper because they think that regulation has peaked. In America the new administration is likely either to repeal the Dodd-Frank act, an 848-page law from 2010, or to prod regulators to enforce it less zealously. Bank-bashing fatigue seems to have set in among the public. True, when firms misbehave, there is still a firestorm of outrage. John Stumpf, the boss of Wells Fargo, quit in October after his bank admitted creating fake accounts. But many people can see that power has migrated from banking to the technology elite in California. The brew of high pay, monopolistic tendencies and huge profits that attracts populist resentment is now more to be found in Silicon Valley than in Wall Street or the City of London. Global supervisors are still cooking up new rules, known as “Basel 4” (see article), but are unlikely to demand a big rise in the safety buffer the industry holds in the form of capital. The strongest banks are signalling that they will lay out more in dividends and buy-backs, rather than hoard even more capital (today, the top 100 rich-world banks pay out about 40% of their profits). A third reason for optimism in bank boardrooms is returns. Global banking’s return on equity (ROE) has crept back towards a respectable 10%. The worst of the fines imposed by American regulators are over. So far, “fintech” startups that use technology to compete with rich-world banks have not won much market share; banks have used technology to boost efficiency. They have also got better at working out which of their activities create value after adjusting for risk and the capital they tie up. Barclays, once known for cutting corners, says it can calculate the ROE generated by each of its trading clients. It is ditching 7,000 of them. Given the giddy mood, the big danger starts with a C, for complacency. Regulators believe that banks now pose less of a threat to taxpayers. American lenders have $1.2trn of core capital, more than twice what they held in 2007. Citigroup, the most systemically important bank to be bailed out, now has three times more capital than its cumulative losses in 2008-10. European banks’ capital buffers have risen by 50% since 2007, to $1.5trn. Yet there are still plenty of weak firms that could cause mayhem. Deutsche Bank, several Italian lenders and America’s two state-run mortgage monsters, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are examples. Mega-banks may simply be too big for any mortal to control. For every dollar of assets that General Electric’s Jeff Immelt manages, Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase looks after $5. Once bitten And banks still lack a post-crisis plan beyond cost-cutting. Despite their surging shares, most are valued at around the level they would fetch if their assets were liquidated, which hardly indicates optimism about their prospects. Before the crisis, they inflated their profits by expanding in unhealthy ways. They captured rents from state guarantees, created ever more layers of debt relative to GDP, and grew their balance-sheets by means of heavy over-borrowing. They have reversed much of this expansion over the past decade but that strategy cannot go on for ever. In 2017 banks will need to articulate a new growth mission and show that they can expand profits without prompting public outrage or a regulatory backlash. One area of promise is the drive to raise rich-world productivity. That would boost economies broadly, and their own profits. There is plenty that banks could do: get more credit to young firms, improve payments systems so that a higher proportion of midsized firms can engage in cross-border e-commerce, and harness technology to make banking as cheap and easy to use as a smartphone app. Forward-thinking bank bosses are already emphasising such goals. If they could achieve them over the next decade, they might even realise a fourth R—redemption.

Lucas Jackson, Reuters NEW YORK - Global equity prices shrugged off weakness on Wall Street to cling to gains after hitting their highest level since mid-2015 on Thursday, bolstered by strong Chinese data that added to optimism about global growth and inflation. The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies after US inflation and unemployment data failed to reverse a downtrend that followed some of the biggest gains on record for China's yuan. US Treasury debt yields slipped as investors grew risk-averse amid uncertainty about the incoming Trump administration. MSCI's world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, rose 0.55 percent for a third straight day of gains. The index has been riding a wave of upbeat factory and service sector surveys out of the United States, Europe and Asia this week. Growth in China's services sector accelerated to a 17-month high in December, a private sector survey showed. The index, however, got little support from Wall Street as the S&P 500 closed slightly lower, weighed by financial shares and as investors dumped traditional retailers Macy's and Kohl's on dismal holiday sales numbers. Amazon powered the Nasdaq Composite to a record closing high. The S&P 500 financial index fell 1.02 percent due to declines in JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. "Financials coming down probably had something to do with bond yields coming down. A lot of the post-election rally was predicated on yields moving higher," said Jimmy Chang, chief investment strategist at Rockefeller & Co. Adding to the downbeat sentiment was a report by a payrolls processor which showed that US private employers added fewer jobs than expected in December even as the US labor market remained solid. Thursday's ADP report precedes Friday's non-farm payrolls data, which includes hiring in both private and public sectors. "Overall it looks like investors will be in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the Labor Department report tomorrow," said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.87 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 19,899.29, the S&P 500 lost 1.75 points, or 0.08 percent, to finish at 2,269 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.93 points, or 0.2 percent, to finish at 5,487.94. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.12 percent at 1,445.57. US Treasury debt yields dropped broadly, falling for a third straight session. Yields should rise again despite weakness early in the year, although for the next few weeks they likely will be range-bound as investors wait to see results from the incoming Trump administration, said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. "There's a lot of uncertainty until the next administration takes place," Lederer said. "We'll be in ranges until we know more about the Trump presidency." Buying in Treasuries also accelerated after the disappointing private sector payrolls data. The US 10-year note was up 29/32 in price to yield 2.348 percent, compared with 2.452 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar slipped to a three-week low against a basket of currencies. China stepped into both its onshore and offshore yuan markets to shore up the faltering yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 1.26 percent to 101.41. The dollar's retreat helped push gold to its highest in a month. Spot gold rose 1.43 percent to $1,180.01 an ounce. Oil prices rose in a choppy session, lifted by news that Saudi Arabia had cut production to meet OPEC's agreement to cut output. Prices had fallen earlier on data showing a surprisingly large increase in U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories. Brent crude settled up 43 cents, or 0.76 percent, at $56.89 a barrel, and U.S. crude settled up 50 cents, or 0.94 percent, at $53.76.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Capital Market NAHCO, Guinness, Dangote Flour lead N98bn market loss January 6, 2017January 5, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Stanley Opara The Nigerian Aviation Handling Company Plc, Guinness Nigeria Plc and Dangote Flour Plc emerged as the top three losers at the close of trading on the floor of the Nigerian stock Exchange on Thursday as the market capitalisation slid by N98bn. A total of 137.694 million shares valued at N898.708m exchanged hands in 2,488 deals. The NSE market capitalisation dropped to N9.018tn from N9.116tn, while the All-Share Index closed at 26,212.09 basis points from 26,495.04 basis points. NAHCO shares dropped by N0.30 (9.49 per cent) to close at N2.86 from N3.16, while the share price of Guinness depreciated to N78.90 from N83.05, losing N4.15 (five per cent). Similarly, Dangote Flour share price closed at N4.04 from N4.25, losing N0.21 (4.94 per cent). The NSE continued to seek its first positive close of the year as sizeable declines in select market heavyweights pulled the NSE ASI down by 1.07 per cent. On the global scene, major bourses across Europe traded mixed amid the release of impressive full year earnings from the United Kingdom’s house building sector and JP Morgan’s decision to revise lower its valuation on a few European insurers. Also, the United States opened mixed as investors assessed a series of economic data and the Federal Reserve’s thoughts on President-elect Donald Trump’s policies. At the NSE, the industrial goods sector came as the biggest loser in Thursday’s session largely on the back of a 4.01 per cent decline in Dangote Cement Plc. The consumer goods and the oil/gas sectors also closed lower amid losses in blue-chip Guinness and Forte Oil Plc by five per cent and 3.41 per cent, respectively. The financial services sector, however, recorded its first green close of the year, buoyed by advances across a number of tier-1 banks  such as Access bank Plc, FBN Holdings Plc, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, United Bank for Africa Plc and Ecobank Transnational Incorporated Plc by 4.96 per cent, 3.30 per cent, 2.49 per cent, 2.22 per cent and 1.99 per cent, respectively.  Market breadth turned positive with 17 advances and 16 declines. “We highlight that today’s market closing position was largely distorted by the loss in market heavyweight – Danote Cement. Excluding the loss in the stock, the ASI would have closed in the green. Consequently, considering the improved market sentiment (as indicated by the positive market breadth), we foresee a positive close in Friday’s trading session,” analysts at Vetiva Capital Management Limited said in a draft. Meanwhile, there was an oversubscription of Treasury bills instruments sold as the naira depreciated at the parallel market. The results of the Primary Market Auction, which was held on Wednesday, showed oversubscription across all instruments. Treasury bills worth N172.85bn were sold in 91-day (N35bn), 182-day (N22bn) and 364-day (N115.85bn), with respective bid-to-cover ratios of 1.02, 1.05 and 1.17 and stop rates of 14 per cent, 17.5 per cent and 18.68 per cent, accordingly. Money market rates (open-buy-back and overnight rates) increased marginally by 0.50 per cent and one per cent to close at 8.50 per cent and 9.42 per cent, respectively. As a result, the average money market rate advanced by 0.75 per cent to close at 8.96 per cent at the end of the trading day . Mixed reaction, according to Meristem Securities Limited was witnessed in the Treasury bond space. However, significant demand was observed at the shorter end of the curve. The April 2017, July 2017, August 2017 and May 2018 instruments all recorded declines of 0.52 per cent, 0.03 per cent, 0.10 per cent and 0.19 per cent, respectively.

Jan 11 Fed chief advises youth to follow the Ben Franklin model Jan 13 Card deals: Amazon wants buyers to borrow Jan 13 More from Joseph N. DiStefano Arrow icon Bank stocks are up since Trump's election, and bankers and bank investors are streaming to Washington to urge laws they think will profit them. "Right now Congress will focus on tax reform," says Chris Martin, CEO of not-quite-$10 billion-asset, New Jersey-based Provident Bank, which has been making more business loans in the Philadelphia area and seeks to open an office in the city as it adds customers. A little later, with friendly Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) running the Senate Banking Committee, "there'll be conversations" about lifting the loan limits and onerous capital and testing requirements from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, designed to stop banks from wrecking themselves in America's periodic credit bubbles, Martin expects.  Farther off is Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac reform. "They shouldn't have to report to Congress," as some critics in both parties have urged, Martin argues. "It's hard enough to do home loans now," with lenders feeling obliged to require 20 percent down to meet investor guidelines, and fewer young families qualifying for loans. In fact, Trump's victory seems to have ended pressure in both parties for fundamental changes in home-loan finance. That makes it more likely Fannie and Freddie will come out from government control and resume their old status as private companies -- while also giving back billions of dollars in profits that Fannie-Freddie investors like hedge fund managers Gary Hindes of Delaware Bay Co., Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme Capital Management and Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management contend were wrongfully pocketed by the government, and should be returned by taxpayers to investors like them. J. Timothy Howard, a former Fannie Mae CFO who later advised Fannie shareholders including investor Berkowitz in an ongoing lawsuit against Treasury, posted a hopeful blueprint for non-reform titled Economics Trumping Politics on his Web page yesterday.  To many of us middle-American mortgage holders, Howard, as a former top officer of the largest of the private but government-backed mortgage-finance giants that make possible America's unique 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, might seem a consummate financial insider. But in his piece, Howard rails against what he calls the true "Financial Establishment—large banks and Wall Street firms, and their advocates and alumni at Treasury and elsewhere" -- who Howard says have long "been engaged in a well-designed, carefully scripted and highly orchestrated political campaign to convince Congress to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with a mechanism more financially beneficial to themselves."   Enter Trump: "Seemingly out of nowhere, five weeks ago Treasury Secretary-designate Steven Mnuchin announced his intention to 'get Fannie and Freddie out of government control reasonably fast'," Howard cheers.   "The odds immediately flipped to favor the prospect that the fates of Fannie and Freddie will be determined, not by a misinformation-based political process likely to benefit banks, but by a fact-based economic process likely to benefit borrowers." And investors, like Howard's lawsuit clients. Howard traces Fannie's and Freddie's problems to the 1990s, when units of General Electric Co., Wells Fargo & Co., PNC Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and the big mortgage insurers formed a lobby -- FM Watch -- to persuade Congress to restrict Fannie and Freddie from setting lending restrictions, guaranty fees and mortgage-bond yields. When Congress balked -- in Howard's telling -- the bankers got Treasury to seize Fannie and Freddie and blame it for the 2008 financial crisis.   Bankers used "fake facts" and "ignored the obvious evidence -- including the disastrous credit performance of loans financed with (banks' own private mortgage bonds) and the vastly lower delinquency numbers put out by (banks' rivals at) Fannie and Freddie." Instead they blamed the mortgage-finance twins and their supposed "flawed business model" for the banks' bad loans, Howard added.   "The Financial Establishment also had a proposed remedy: the companies must be 'wound down and replaced,'" advocates in both parties argued, with some new, more easily bank-controlled mortgage-finance mechanism that would "justify giving control over the availability, terms and pricing of $10 trillion in mortgages to the large banks and investment firms" -- in part by forcing the new mortgage-finance entity to hold more capital than they really need to safely make loans. Given the long and costly history of American financial institutions cheerfully blowing themselves and their shareholders and customers up through over-optimistic lending, can important lenders like Fannie and Freddie really have way too much capital? That's what Howard argues. High capital forces lenders to boost fees and "significantly overcharge" customers, he argues. "Borrowers would be badly hurt by those pricing distortions, while banks and Wall Street firms would profit from them."  If the "Financial Establishment" really has all that power, why did the Obama administration allow Fannie and Freddie to dangle on, under federal control, for eight years, instead of reforming them already?  Because the banks and loan insurers failed "to come up with a workable alternative to the two companies it so desperately wants to replace." Secretary Mnuchin, he adds, seems poised to kill the bankers' scheme by  returning Fannie and Freddie to full private control, removing "misinformed" Congress and putting "a small number of informed finance professionals with economic incentives to get it right" (presumably they aren't part of the "Financial Establishment") back in charge where they belong. Mnuchin will resolve Fannie and Freddie in court and administrative proceedings, "where the focus is on facts," he adds. Not in Congress, which is plagued by "deceptions, inventions and faleshoods."  "Far from rescuing Fannie and Freddie, Treasury planned and carried out their takeovers for ideological and policy reasons, then lied to both the public and the courts about what it had done and why," Howard writes, citing documents presented as part of the litigation against Treasury. “Mnuchin’s plan to “get [the companies] out of government control” requires settling the lawsuits. He figures Trump officials will quickly chose borrower and investor interests over bankers, and use their knowledge to settle "what the post-settlement secondary market system should look like, and how it should function." Which is a lot like the old system: "Fannie and Freddie were not the causes of the financial crisis... They didn’t need to be rescued by the government... Their secondary-market business model works better than any other... Recapitalizing Fannie and Freddie post-conservatorship is eminently achievable." Surely, he adds, Mnuchin will end up agreeing with investors like Berkowitz and Ackman. "The Trump administration will have at least two reasons to support them: "First, it will understand" from investors' lawsuits "that a secondary mortgage market built around Fannie and Freddie is far better for consumers and the economy than the bank-centric proposals supported by the Financial Establishment, and will know it will be held accountable for the negative consequences of choosing the latter. "Second, the Trump Treasury will inherit the warrants for 79.9 percent of Fannie and Freddie’s common shares created by the Bush Treasury, which will become worthless if the companies are wound down." That gives the new administration and the investors common cause against the bankers: "Trump Treasury will share the plaintiffs’ goal of setting Fannie and Freddie up to operate as cost-effectively and efficiently as possible, benefitting borrowers as well as shareholders. "It also will have strong incentives to alter the terms of the warrants—their strike price, percentage amount or both—and to manage the timing of conversions so as to maximize the value of all three categories of stock the companies will have as going concerns: existing shares, converted warrants, and the new issues of equity required for recapitalization." Everyone's happy! Except the old Financial Establishment -- those lenders, who make mortgages in the first place, and disliked Fannie and Freddie for cramping their lending style. But "they have no realistic legislative alternative to offer, and because Republicans in the executive branch will know the facts about Fannie, Freddie and the financial crisis from discovery in the court cases, Republicans in Congress will not be able to sustain their myths about them. "There never has been any economic case against reforming, releasing and recapitalizing the companies, and without the myths the political case falls apart. “It is by no means a certainty that the Trump administration will arrive at the right solution on mortgage reform. But because it has made the issue a 'top 10'  priority, and the path to a successful outcome is so obvious and wide open, for the first time in quite a while there is great cause for optimism.” More Coverage Hedge funds look to Trump for a Fannie-Freddie revival Jan 7 - 4:26 PM Published: January 5, 2017 — 4:19 PM EST | Updated: January 6, 2017 — 11:59 AM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

The stockbroker slashed its target price for the engineering giant from 890p to 730p and said it had concerns about the civil aerospace unit. JPM warned that earnings at the firm, which has issued five major profit warnings in recent years, could be ‘highly depressed’ over the next few years. Shares tumbled 4.2 per cent, or 28p, to 639.5p. It was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 for the day, but it didn’t stop the stock market setting a sixth consecutive closing high. The FTSE 100 climbed 0.1 per cent, or 5.57 points, to 7195.31. It is now the longest stretch of record closes since May 1997. Earlier in the day it had set a new record intra-day high of 7211.96. Shares plunge: JPMorgan slashed its target price for Rolls-Royce stock from 890p to 730p and said it had concerns about the civil aerospace unit Housebuilders were at the top of the table for a second day after Persimmon, which was up 7.2 per cent, or 130p, to 1940p, reported revenue for the year was up 8 per cent to £3.14billion.  Fastjet took off as it announced plans to raise £23.4million from investors. The airline business wants to use the cash to increase its working capital and improve cash flow. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Bosses of collapsed cruise firm All Leisure Group paid...

It will also have the right to nominate two directors to the firm’s board. Fastjet said the agreement would help grow the business in a flexible and cost-effective way. Shares flew up 9.8 per cent, or 1.62p, to 18.25p. STOCK WATCH - SCIENCE IN SPORT  Science in Sport soared as sales surged 30 per cent to £12.2million in 2016. The firm develops sports nutrition products, such as powders, gels and cereal bars.  The group said investment in its website and operations had seen direct sales double year-on-year. Growth in the US and Italy will be a particular focus for 2017 after Australia delivered ahead of target last year. While costs have increased, the firm said a more efficient product line meant margins were improving. Shares gained 7.7 per cent, or 5.5p, to 77p. Support services outfit Babcock has won a defence contract with the French Air Force. Babcock France will provide new training aircraft, simulators and training facilities in an 11-year deal worth more than £427million. Shares edged up 0.5 per cent, or 4.5p, to 955.5p. Cape climbed as it revealed full-year results are now likely to be materially ahead of expectations.  The industrial services provider said strong trading in the final two months of the year, particularly in Asia, meant results were now set to be better than expected. Cape has also won additional work at a natural gas project in Western Australia where it will provide painting, insulation, fire proofing and other services. Shares rocketed 17.4 per cent, or 26.5p, to 178.5p. PureCircle plunged as it revealed that sales had slipped after US Customs and Border Protection had detained a shipment earlier in the year of stevia – a type of natural sweetener.  It was detained in June amid allegations the shipment contained products produced using forced labour. PureCircle said the allegations were incorrect and it was committed to human rights and the proper and fair use of labour. The shipment was released after four weeks. But, with a third of the company’s sales coming from the US, the incident had a knock-on effect and PureCircle said gross margin, earnings and profit were likely to be lower. While growth had been strong in the six months to December 31 and demand for stevia-based products is increasing, sales were down 14 per cent to £38million.  The group is expecting a net loss of £1.6million, compared with a profit of £4million a year ago. However, PureCircle said increased awareness of obesity and implementation of sugar taxes by governments is driving demand for alternative sweeteners. Shares dropped 4.3 per cent, or 10.75p, to 240.25p. Software firm Intercede revealed it had received one of its largest ever orders. The deal with the US Government, worth around £2.4million, had been expected in the first half of the year but was delayed. The order is for software licenses and annual support and maintenance for its MyID identity and credential management software. Shares were flat at 57.5p.

The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies after U.S. inflation and unemployment data failed to reverse a downtrend that followed some of the biggest gains on record for China's yuan. U.S. Treasury debt yields slipped as investors grew risk-averse amid uncertainty about the incoming Trump administration. MSCI's world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, rose 0.55 percent for a third straight day of gains. The index has been riding a wave of upbeat factory and service sector surveys out of the United States, Europe and Asia this week. Growth in China's services sector accelerated to a 17-month high in December, a private sector survey showed. The index, however, got little support from Wall Street as the S&P 500 closed slightly lower, weighed by financial shares and as investors dumped traditional retailers Macy's and Kohl's on dismal holiday sales numbers. Amazon powered the Nasdaq Composite to a record closing high. The S&P 500 financial index fell 1.02 percent due to declines in JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. "Financials coming down probably had something to do with bond yields coming down. A lot of the post-election rally was predicated on yields moving higher," said Jimmy Chang, chief investment strategist at Rockefeller & Co. Adding to the downbeat sentiment was a report by a payrolls processor which showed that U.S. private employers added fewer jobs than expected in December even as the U.S. labor market remained solid. Thursday's ADP report precedes Friday's nonfarm payrolls data, which includes hiring in both private and public sectors. "Overall it looks like investors will be in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the Labor Department report tomorrow," said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.87 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 19,899.29, the S&P 500 lost 1.75 points, or 0.08 percent, to finish at 2,269 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.93 points, or 0.2 percent, to finish at 5,487.94. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.12 percent at 1,445.57. U.S. Treasury debt yields dropped broadly, falling for a third straight session. Yields should rise again despite weakness early in the year, although for the next few weeks they likely will be range-bound as investors wait to see results from the incoming Trump administration, said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. "There's a lot of uncertainty until the next administration takes place," Lederer said. "We'll be in ranges until we know more about the Trump presidency." Buying in Treasuries also accelerated after the disappointing private sector payrolls data. The U.S. 10-year note was up 29/32 in price to yield 2.348 percent, compared with 2.452 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar slipped to a three-week low against a basket of currencies. China stepped into both its onshore and offshore yuan markets to shore up the faltering yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 1.26 percent to 101.41. The dollar's retreat helped push gold to its highest in a month. Spot gold rose 1.43 percent to $1,180.01 an ounce. Oil prices rose in a choppy session, lifted by news that Saudi Arabia had cut production to meet OPEC's agreement to cut output. Prices had fallen earlier on data showing a surprisingly large increase in U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories. Brent crude settled up 43 cents, or 0.76 percent, at $56.89 a barrel, and U.S. crude settled up 50 cents, or 0.94 percent, at $53.76.

The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies after U.S. inflation and unemployment data failed to reverse a downtrend that followed some of the biggest gains on record for China's yuan. U.S. Treasury debt yields slipped as investors grew uncertain about the incoming Trump administration. MSCI (Frankfurt: 3HM.F - news) 's world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, was up 0.47 percent. The index has been riding a wave of upbeat factory and service sector surveys out of the United States, Europe and Asia this week. Growth in China's services sector accelerated to a 17-month high in December, a private sector survey showed. The index, however, got no boost from Wall Street as weakness in financials weighed. The S&P 500 financial index was down 1.3 percent - set for its worst day since late November - due to declines in JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news) , Wells Fargo (Swiss: WFC-USD.SW - news) and Bank of America (Swiss: BAC-USD.SW - news) . "Financials coming down probably had something to do with bond yields coming down. A lot of the post-election rally was predicated on yields moving higher," said Jimmy Chang, chief investment strategist at Rockefeller & Co. Department stores Macy's dropped 14 percent while Kohl's slumped 19 percent after the companies said their holiday sales fell more than expected. Adding to the downbeat sentiment was a report by a payrolls processor which showed that U.S. private employers added fewer-than-expected jobs in December even as the U.S. labor market remained solid. Thursday's ADP report precedes Friday's nonfarm payrolls data, which includes hiring in both private and public sectors. "Overall it looks like investors will be in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the Labor Department report tomorrow," said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 62.24 points, or 0.31 percent, to 19,879.92, the S&P 500 lost 4.22 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,266.53 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.70 points, or 0.12 percent, to 5,483.71. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.12 percent at 1,445.57. U.S. Treasury debt yields fell for a third straight session as investors grew uncertain about the incoming Trump administration and waited for more clarity about its policies before taking more positions. Buying in Treasuries also accelerated after the disappointing private sector payrolls data. The U.S. 10-year note was up 23/32 in price to yield 2.368 percent, compared with 2.452 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar slipped to a 3-week low against a basket of currencies. China stepped into both its onshore and offshore yuan markets to shore up the faltering yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/FilesMore By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity prices shrugged off weakness on Wall Street to cling to gains after hitting their highest level since mid-2015 on Thursday, bolstered by strong Chinese data that added to optimism about global growth and inflation. The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies after U.S. inflation and unemployment data failed to reverse a downtrend that followed some of the biggest gains on record for China's yuan. U.S. Treasury debt yields slipped as investors grew risk-averse amid uncertainty about the incoming Trump administration. MSCI's world index <.MIWD00000PUS>, which tracks shares in 46 countries, rose 0.55 percent for a third straight day of gains. The index has been riding a wave of upbeat factory and service sector surveys out of the United States, Europe and Asia this week. Growth in China's services sector accelerated to a 17-month high in December, a private sector survey showed. The index, however, got little support from Wall Street as the S&P 500 closed slightly lower, weighed by financial shares and as investors dumped traditional retailers Macy's and Kohl's on dismal holiday sales numbers. Amazon powered the Nasdaq Composite to a record closing high. The S&P 500 financial index <.SPSY> fell 1.02 percent due to declines in JPMorgan , Wells Fargo and Bank of America . "Financials coming down probably had something to do with bond yields coming down. A lot of the post-election rally was predicated on yields moving higher," said Jimmy Chang, chief investment strategist at Rockefeller & Co. Adding to the downbeat sentiment was a report by a payrolls processor which showed that U.S. private employers added fewer jobs than expected in December even as the U.S. labour market remained solid. Thursday's ADP report precedes Friday's nonfarm payrolls data, which includes hiring in both private and public sectors. "Overall it looks like investors will be in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the Labor Department report tomorrow," said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 42.87 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 19,899.29, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 1.75 points, or 0.08 percent, to finish at 2,269 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 10.93 points, or 0.2 percent, to finish at 5,487.94. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> closed up 0.12 percent at 1,445.57. U.S. Treasury debt yields dropped broadly, falling for a third straight session. Yields should rise again despite weakness early in the year, although for the next few weeks they likely will be range-bound as investors wait to see results from the incoming Trump administration, said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. "There's a lot of uncertainty until the next administration takes place," Lederer said. "We'll be in ranges until we know more about the Trump presidency." Buying in Treasuries also accelerated after the disappointing private sector payrolls data. The U.S. 10-year note was up 29/32 in price to yield 2.348 percent, compared with 2.452 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar slipped to a three-week low against a basket of currencies. China stepped into both its onshore and offshore yuan markets to shore up the faltering yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. The dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 1.26 percent to 101.41. The dollar's retreat helped push gold to its highest in a month. Spot gold rose 1.43 percent to $1,180.01 an ounce. Oil prices rose in a choppy session, lifted by news that Saudi Arabia had cut production to meet OPEC's agreement to cut output. Prices had fallen earlier on data showing a surprisingly large increase in U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories. Brent crude settled up 43 cents, or 0.76 percent, at $56.89 a barrel, and U.S. crude settled up 50 cents, or 0.94 percent, at $53.76.

In case of abuse, click here to report. Asian emerging equity market performance was mixed in 2016, as both core and frontier MSCI index components faded into end-year on combined internal growth and policy weaknesses, and external trade and geopolitical worries. In the main markets China “A” shares and India were down 10% and 3% percent respectively, and Malaysia and the Philippines each lost 7%. Thailand was the winner up 23%, followed by Indonesia and Taiwan rising 15 % and Korea 7%, as the overall regional gain was just half the MSCI’s benchmark 8%. In the frontier Pakistan, which will revert to the more advanced index in mid-2017, was the leading market generally with a 33% advance, and Bangladesh was also positive (+8%), while Sri Lanka and Vietnam declined 8%. JP Morgan’s EMBI bond gauge jumped 9.5% for the year, as Indonesia slightly outperformed (+11%), and the Philippines badly lagged (+3%). The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox Investors head into 2017 with this uneven record reflecting erosion of the region’s comparative “safe haven” reputation, which may be further tarnished if the new US administration carries through on commercial retaliation for alleged protectionism and currency manipulation. They still await decisive action on political, infrastructure, banking and private debt troubles, and favorites this year will be countries that finally treat them with a sense of urgency missing since the aftermath of financial crisis almost a decade ago. Chinese GDP growth has tracked the 6.5% target with the PMI manufacturing reading well above 50, but the Yuan slipped by the same amount against the dollar for the biggest annual drop in two decades. Regulators reopened the initial public offering pipeline with dozens of new approvals, but tightened individual cash transfer reporting rules for transactions over RMB 50,000, from the previous RMB 200,000, at the same time they warned against an outbound direct investment deals surge. According to government statistics, foreign ownership of local assets was RMB 3.3 trillion in the third quarter versus RMB 4.6 trillion at end-2015. Fund flow numbers compiled by the EPFR database continue to show heavy outflows from China as annual capital exit is estimate again in the $800 billion range, potentially pulling reserves below $3 trillion. Coming into 2017, Beijing relaxed the 49 percent financial sector overseas participation cap and doubled the units in its managed currency basket to reduce dollar weight, but also revealed that bond defaults quadrupled as record liquidity was injected into the banking system in December to tamp yield spikes. The central bank strengthened scrutiny of bank off-balance sheet exposure and also floated a possible real estate tax as Beijing mayor’s promised to “stamp out” price speculation. Outside these erratic indicators, China’s Communist leadership entered into a diplomatic spat with US President-elect Trump over Washington-Taiwan ties ahead of the upcoming party Congress, where President Xi may seek another term and groom next-generation successors. India sputtered the final months of 2016, as equity inflows fell to US$4 billion and US$6 billion in debt outflows were registered with the controversial seizure of high-denomination banknotes to isolate so-called black money.  The sudden move designed to defeat wealthy tax-dodgers descended into chaos which overwhelmed ATM networks and shuttered small shops, and also delayed the national unified tax timetable as states grappled with the revenue fallout. Prime Minister Modi’s team suggested that further anti-corruption and money-laundering measures were being planned that could also have immediate personal consumption and bank liquidity effects. The saga overwhelmed lower inflation results allowing a minimal benchmark rate cut, as growth estimates were rejiggered for further distance from the 7% goal. Indonesia was popular with a series of deregulation and infrastructure packages, but a hyped tax amnesty lagged projections to help send the fiscal deficit toward the 3% of GDP limit. Foreign investors, who hold one-third of domestic government debt, were further disturbed by official action against securities house JP Morgan, including its suspension as a primary dealer, after its research recommended trimming allocation. Thailand bounced off its 2015 bottom as a constitutional election return roadmap was approved under the ruling military, which also ushered in smooth royal succession after King Bhumipol’s death. The Philippines had the most extreme swings after President Duterte’s post-election rally gave way to concerns over unpredictable law and order and economic policies, resulting in the peso as the currency laggard and also a regional wake-up call to offer reasoned convincing solutions to festering poverty and security challenges alongside the lengthy productivity improvement, financial stability and structural reform agenda.

Department stores Macy's dropped 14 percent while Kohl's slumped 19 percent after the companies said their holiday sales fell more than expected. Adding to the downbeat sentiment was a report by a payrolls processor which showed that U.S. private employers added fewer-than-expected jobs in December even as the U.S. labor market remained solid.

Markets, it seems, expect him to make sweeping changes to policy, but there is considerable doubt whether the euphoria will last long.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Op-Ed: Wall street lawyer newest denizen of Trump's renewed swamp Listen | Print By Ken Hanly     Jan 5, 2017 in Politics Washington - Far from clearing the swamp in Washington as he promised, Trump is simply appointing new Wall Street creatures to replace Democrats. The latest appointment is elite Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton whose good works include defending big banks for their financial crisis crimes and advising Goldman Sachs on its government bailout. Trump claimed that Clayton would release the job-creating power of the U.S. economy while at the same time providing oversight. Trump hopes to make the oversight simpler and no doubt less than previously. Trump said: "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers. Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority." Clayton is a partner in the important law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell. He has advised on major deals such as the Alibaba IPO and the sale of the NBA, Atlanta Hawks. His bio at the firm show he was involved in helping work out mortage settlements between large financial institutions and the government. The institutions had issued or underwritten hundreds of toxic mortgage deals just prior to the economic meltdown. The firm helped JP Morgan reach a $13 billion deal with the Department of Justice in 2013. Clayton also had connections to Bear Stearns the investment bank that went under during the financial meltdown. He represented the company in its fire sale to JPMorgan. Also, Clayton helped out Goldman Sachs with its TARP bailout as well as a $5 billion investment from Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway during the crisis. Clayton has also worked for the SEC. Clayton says he wants to strike a balance between providing oversight and helping the economy. Given that regulations will be reduced and Clayton has strong ties to big financial institutions the balance will be weighted towards helping the financial institutions prosper. Rather than say this, he talks of helping the economy which is politically more palatable. Clayton said: "We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs." The appointment of Clayton is a clear message that Trump is intending to reduce regulations that corporations find irksome or reduce economic growth. Clayton has pledged to ensure that companies and investors have the confidence to invest in the United States. The present head of SEC, Mary Jo White is giving up the post on January 20 even though her term expires in June 2019. Senator Elizabeth Warren has criticized White as not preventing businesses from pouring cash into politics. It is not clear that Clayton will do any better and he will not be trying to implement Dodd-Frank reform rules as was White but trying to dismantle them. Clayton won the job over former federal prosecutor Debra Yang. While also a prominent corporate lawyer Yang was tough as a prosecutor and took on a violent drug gang as well as investigating financial fraud. Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, who is on the Senate Banking Committee said that Clayton was an "attorney who's spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap". Adam Green, of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, compared nominating Clayton as head of the SEC to allowing the fox to guard the henhouse on Wall Street. On the other end of the political spectrum, the Investment Adviser Association, which represents SEC-registered firms claimed Clayton was a "highly regarded, respected and accomplished lawyer" with a "deep understanding" or complex transactions and regulations. Jaret Seiber, an analyst at Cowen and Co. said the selection of Clayton was a conventional choice for a Republican president. Other creatures in the swamp will recognize Clayton as a welcome comrade. Clayton has pleaded for less onerous restrictions on foreign public companies in the U.S. and also participated in writing an article in 2011 that advocated less zealous enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Clayton's wife is employed by Goldman Sachs as a private wealth advisor. Senator Sherrod Brown said: "It's hard to see how an attorney who’s spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump's promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder.'" Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, who served as chief ethics lawyer under the George W. Bush administration said that Clayton's wife's employment at Goldman Sachs created a problem: "You cannot be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and have you or your spouse have any financial interest in Goldman Sachs." He said she would have to divest herself of any stock or options she holds and negotiate a flat salary. As the appended video points out, supporters of Trump should be digusted at his appointment of so many prominent Wall Street figures to his administration after claiming that Hillary Clinton was a puppet of Wall Street and that he was going to drain the Washington swamp.

Rizzi Published January 05 2017, 8:30am EST More in Law and regulation Dodd-Frank SIFIs Print Email Reprints Share Share on The new administration will undoubtedly address needed reform of the problematic Dodd-Frank Act this year. Especially pressing is Dodd-Frank's Title II, known as the Orderly Liquidation Authority. The OLA gives regulators the power to seize and liquidate failing "too big to fail" banks, attempting to eliminate taxpayer-funded bailouts while minimizing disruption of a collapse to the financial system. It adopts many of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's methods used for small bank receiverships. But critics have correctly noted that Title II has in fact institutionalized TBTF by creating formalized bailout procedures with dedicated taxpayer-supported funding. GOP lawmakers are now focused on the proposed Financial Choice Act, a contender to replace the DFA. It contains new provisions to prevent future taxpayer-funded bailouts. The provisions include, among other things, a repeal of the OLA procedure, a reform of the bankruptcy laws as an alternative for winding down failing giants, limits on Federal Reserve emergency lending power and repeal of the FDIC's authority to guarantee bank obligations. The problem with these provisions is they are the wrong solution to the right problem. Attempting to eliminate bailouts while TBTF banks exist is dangerously delusional. Despite DFA's capital and liquidity increase efforts, research shows investors perceive the big six banks — Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo — as no safer than they were before the crisis. Banks simply have insufficient capital to cover losses created by forced sales of assets at fire-sale prices during a crisis. Among the post-crisis reforms was the Fed's Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity rule, which requires firms to have enough capital and long-term debt to support a resolution. But the modest capital levels imposed by the rule are unlikely to cover losses in a failure. This leaves the question of what to do should one or more TBTF banks experience financial difficulty during the next crisis. Reform efforts relying on bankruptcy law, like the Choice Act, represent a questionable untested leap of faith with a huge downside should it fail to work. The problem is not with the bankruptcy code, but with trying to apply it to TBTF institutions during a crisis. Their very size would clog the system. For example, Lehman Brothers, a midsize investment bank that filed for bankruptcy in 2008, took years to resolve. Trying to resolve one, or more, much larger and more complex TBTF banks during a crisis without a bailout would be like trying to change a flat tire while the car is still moving. This is why "no more bailouts" laws lack market credibility. Investors recognize no government would or should allow a TBTF bank to fail during a crisis. Bailouts are merely the symptom of the boarder problem of having banks too big to resolve safely. Under the current set of choices, policymakers face a difficult balancing act trying to ensure the safety of the banking system while avoiding taxpayer-funded bank bailouts. It may only be possible to satisfy one of those interests at any one time. Yet there may be a more effective reform path in considering structural alternatives to the banking system: either reducing the size of TBTF banks so they can more safely fail, or regulate them as utilities to prevent their failure. There are no easy, quick fixes. If there were, they would have been tried already. Reform efforts must guard against creating a false sense of security leading potentially to disastrous governmental inaction during a crisis. The idea that orderly liquidation under Dodd-Frank, reforming the bankruptcy code or some other means will fix the TBTF problem is a myth. Whether you like bailouts is irrelevant to the TBTF issue. If these institutions exist, then bailouts are required. The only way to end bailouts is to eliminate TBTF-sized institutions. Address the problem, not the symptom, to avoid a cure worse than the disease. J.V. Rizzi is a banking industry consultant and investor. The views expressed are his own.

INNOVATE 5 Industries Ripe for Disruption in 2017 From live sports to real estate, it's been a long time coming for a lot of these spaces. By Kevin J. Ryan Kevin J. Ryan is a staff writer for Inc. He has written for ESPN The Magazine and the Long Island Press and contributed to Mental Floss. He lives in Queens, New York. @wheresKR Staff writer, Inc.@wheresKR 1 COMMENTS Members of the Chicago Cubs celebrate winning the 2016 World Series. In many cases, it's impossible to legally stream live sporting events, even if you're willing to pay. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The customer experience is uniformly bad. The business model hasn't changed in decades. The products overpromise and underdeliver. These are just some of the signs when a staid industry is in need of a serious shakeup. Expect to see several shakeups in 2017. Here are five industries we'll be watching. 1. Mobile banking Fees to use other banks' ATMs? Three days for transfers to clear? Sometimes it feels like you'd be better off keeping a wad of cash under your bed--at least your piggy bank won't charge you a monthly maintenance fee. Already, companies like Square and Stripe have moved customers toward cashless and cardless transactions; it's just a matter of time till those customers will want to become bankless, too. Mobile banking startups like GoBank, Moven, and Simple appeal to the "de-banked" customer. Zero, which launches in 2017, is looking to give customers a more convenient and rewarding banking option--think credit card perks but with a debit card. "I think we'll see more innovation in [mobile banking], and companies going deeper with their product offerings," says Matthew Wong, senior research analyst at CB Insights. Even big banks have taken notice, but are moving slowly to join the fast-paced, convenient, and customer-focused modern age. "Silicon Valley is coming," wrote JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in a letter to shareholders in 2015. "There are hundreds of startups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking." 2. Live sports Thanks to services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, viewers have already started cutting the cord. But there's one big factor that keeps many people tethered to their cable deals: live sports. In many cases, it's impossible to view a live sporting event online legally, even if you're willing to pay, mostly because of agreements between sports leagues and TV networks established long before live streaming. In November, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon had talked with several of the U.S.'s biggest sports leagues about acquiring the rights to stream games, calling live sports "the last bastion of traditional pay-television." A few weeks before that, popular Italian soccer club A.C. Milan signed a deal with Los Angeles-based sports streaming startup Sportle to broadcast exclusive live video--the first such deal between a major sports team and a third party. And in 2016, Twitter began live streaming Thursday Night Football games for its users. Cable and satellite companies won't like it, but leagues like the NFL, NBA, NHL, and Major League Baseball have a lot to gain by inking deals with streaming services and getting their products--behind-the-scenes events and eventually live games--in front of more eyeballs. 3. Real estate In the first half of 2016, investors poured $1.8 billion into real estate tech startups--an 85 percent increase from the previous year, according to CB Insights. These deals included everything from property management platforms, such as Homelink and Buildup, to online tools for lenders and brokers. But the bigger opportunity might be where the stakes are higher: the home buying and selling process. One startup, San Francisco-based Opendoor, uses location, size, and other variables to calculate a home's price, and then makes an offer. If the seller accepts, he or she gets paid immediately, the home is placed in escrow, and the company arranges an inspection before putting it back on the market for buyers. The company has had some success selling homes in the Phoenix area, where traditionally listed homes spend an average of more than 70 days on the market. Opendoor's process takes about 90 days on average, but the seller gets paid quickly. Says Wong: "That's definitely a theme we've seen lately: building algorithms and using machine learning to take something as complex as buying real estate and reduce the process to a much shorter time span." Don't be surprised to see competitors springing up soon. 4. Energy Despite some progress, 86 percent of America's energy supply still comes from coal, gas, or nuclear power plants. In 2017, that could start to change in a significant way. The price of solar installations has been cut in half in the U.S. since 2010, and, according to a new report from the World Economic Forum, wind and solar energy now cost less than fossil fuels in 30 countries, with two-thirds of the world's nations expected to reach that threshold within the next several years. That low, stable price point is a big reason why Google will offset 100 percent of its energy needs with renewable sources in 2017; Apple and Facebook are close to hitting that milestone as well. This year, Tesla's solar roofs will roll out, offering an alternative to the ugly panels that have adorned roofs since the '80s--perhaps the last consumer pain point preventing widespread adoption. Companies that can follow Tesla's lead in delivering solar through attractive or disguised means--like Solar Roadways, which is embedding solar panels in a rest stop's concrete parking lot--could help turn the energy industry upside down. "Renewable energy has reached a tipping point," Michael Drexler, head of infrastructure and development investing at the WEF, told Quartz in December. "It is not only a commercially viable option, but an outright compelling investment opportunity with long-term, stable, inflation-protected returns." 5. Athletic equipment The sports industry has internet-connected shirts, pants, and even socks. But what about equipment that reliably protects athletes' heads? With the revelations about the health risks of impact sports like football and lacrosse, there is a huge opportunity to nail down a desirable helmet design that can help reduce concussions and other head traumas. According to Bloomberg, Ridell and Schutt Sports own 90 percent of the $100 million to $150 million football helmet market--and the vast majority of available products look almost exactly the same as they did in the 1960s. Making the space difficult to tap into is the fact that lower levels of competition tend to follow the lead of the big leagues--and top athletes are notoriously particular about their equipment. Seattle-based Vicis has come close to cracking open the market: Several college programs adopted its "crumpling" helmets that bent upon impact during training camp, but they were eventually pulled when players complained about their fit. Some company will eventually design the helmet that NFL and college teams come to embrace, and when it does, the heads of those athletes, plus one million high school football players, are sure to provide lots of profits.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter RyanVlastelica Markets reporter The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at a record Thursday, as the broader stock market finished lower, dragged down by a steep slide in the financial sector and major retailers. Mixed data on jobs also raised concerns a day before the closely watched December employment report due Friday. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.48%  closed up 10.93 points, or 0.2%, at 5,487.94, following a day of slight gains and losses. Shares of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.43%  supported the index with a 3.1% gain. The last time the Nasdaq notched a record close was Dec. 27. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  fell 42.87 points, or 0.2%, to close at 19,899.29, paring losses after being down by as much as 131 points. Among the biggest decliners were Travelers Cos. TRV, +0.26% shedding 1.6%, and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.01% down 1.5%. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.53% finished down 0.9% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., GS, +0.19%  declined 0.7%, paring sharp losses from earlier in the session. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.18%  declined 1.75 points, or 0.1%, to finish at 2,269.00. The financial sector was the index’s biggest drag, falling 1%, while retailers, Kohl’s Corp. KSS, -1.26% and Macy’s Inc. M, -0.33% were taking it on the chin after disappointing holiday sales and announcing stores closures. Shares of Macy’s plummeted to close down 14% after the department-store chain late Wednesday announced plans to close 68 stores and lay off 10,000 employees in 2017. Fellow retailer Kohl’s, saw its worst trading day ever, finishing down 19%, after it cut its fiscal 2016 earnings outlook late Wednesday, following volatile holiday sales. Markets have enjoyed an upswing lately, with investors betting that President-elect Donald Trump will accelerate economic growth by emphasizing corporate tax cuts and deregulation. While most view the market’s uptrend as intact, the pace of the rally—which has taken major indexes to repeated records and pushed the Dow within striking distance of 20,000—has some concerned that equity valuations are getting ahead of fundamentals, notably earnings growth. But the uptrend that got the stock market to this point—a strong dollar trade, rallying financials, and a jump in bond yields—is showing signs of faltering, and that has many investors anticipating a downturn, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, in an interview. “What’s interesting is that yesterday we saw some shift in terms of higher-than-expected inflation out of the eurozone and that took starch out of the dollar’s rally,” Stone said. Read: Will surging Chinese yuan wreck the dollar rally? On Thursday, eurozone producer prices data showed a 0.1% rise for November, following Wednesday’s data showing that eurozone inflation jumped to 1.1% in December. Since the election, both the S&P 500 and the dollar both rallied in lockstep about 6% before hitting recent resistance. An uptick in inflation will make it more difficult for the European Central Bank to push for stimulus measures, which means the strong dollar trend could weaken, he said. Add to that the anticipation that stocks generally sell off during the first quarter following an election, and the worry that the Trump rally is heading for a reversal only grows, Stone said. See: ‘Trump rally’ could end when president-elect takes office: Morgan Stanley Others are worry that the postelection rally has simply overextended itself. “We must be careful with the strength in equity markets; the upside has been undoubtedly strong, and for me a little too strong,” said James Hughes, chief market analyst, at GKFX, in a note. Hughes also speculated that the speedy rise in stocks was encouraging investors to take some money off the table. “There is a big chance that the importance and focus of the 20,000 level could mean it is a key area of resistance on the upside, but also a key area for traders looking to exit long positions. A break could see a whole raft of profit-taking that could well be the catalyst for a medium-term correction in equity markets, a much-needed correction after two months of pure upside,” he added. Financials could be particularly vulnerable to profit-taking; the group has accounted for the bulk of the market’s postelection advance. Economic news: The market digested two reads on the labor market that pointed to mixed conditions. The private sector added 153,000 jobs in December, according to ADP, a rate that was below forecasts, while first-time jobless claims fell 28,000 in the latest week, dropping to a nearly 43-year low.

Four revenue-weighted Oppenheimer ETFs will be available to Schwab clients commission-free, including the b>Oppenheimer Ultra Dividend Revenue ETF (NYSE: RDIV) and the Oppenheimer Large Cap Revenue ETF (NYSE: RWL).

In The News Top U.S. intelligence officials are set to appear before Congress in the first public hearing about Russian interference in the 2016 election. The officials are expected to describe the Russian government’s role in directing a cyber campaign that divulged emails from the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and other political organizations, and set off an unprecedented postelection feud between President-elect Donald Trump and the intelligence community he is about to lead. The makers of precision-guided missiles and bombs are running to keep up with demand as the U.S. military bombards Islamic State from the air. Companies such as Boeing (NYSE: BA), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and BAE Systems —which make the precision-guidance kits that carry U.S. missiles and bombs to their targets—are benefiting from the U.S. military’s increased reliance on air power in the Middle East.

Photo: Mark Lennihan-Pool/Getty Images Two New Yorkers running for president (three if you count Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders)—what could be better? Well, just about anything, it turns. The ball dropped Sunday on an uncertain and despondent city, fearful for the future. Will our native-born billionaire president-elect follow through on vows to sap sanctuary cities like this one of federal funding? Will he set in motion a global trade war? Or, you know, an actual war? Will he at least get Congress to pick up the tab for the NYPD security around his family and properties? Last week, we gave a glimpse of those New Yorkers who entered 2017 more broken up than Mariah Carey. But what about those who got to pop their champagne bottles early? Read on. Mayor Bill de Blasio, left, with Police Commissioner James O’Neill after the Chelsea bombing. Spencer Platt/Getty Images 1. James O’Neill There’s an episode of The Simpsons where Homer tries to get himself out of an escalating series of crises by explaining “it’s my first day.” On James O’Neill’s first day as commissioner of the country’s largest police department, a bomb went off in Manhattan while the president of the United States was in town. The newly-minted top cop was not a nationally-known quasi-celebrity crime fighter or terrorism-crusher like his two immediate predecessors. He was a Flatbush, Brooklyn native who had spent more than three decades rising through the ranks first of the old Transit Police, then of the NYPD. It was in the former role that he forged a bond with Mr. Bratton during the 1980s. O’Neill’s ascent slowed during the 2000s, but Bratton promoted him to Chief of Patrol in June 2014—then Chief of Department just four months later, after the resignation of Phillip Banks. When Bratton revealed his plans to depart the department in August of this year, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced O’Neill would fill his role. Working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and New Jersey authorities, NYPD identified the bomber as Ahmad Khan Rahami. After a brief, desperate manhunt, Rahami was in custody, and calm restored to the city. If the administration’s grand plans prove successful, that may prove just a footnote in the ledger of O’Neill’s accomplishments. Even before reaching his current perch, O’Neill was charged with designing and implementing de Blasio’s “neighborhood policing” program, aimed at healing the rifts between the department and many nonwhite communities. Just a month after the Chelsea bombing, an NYPD sergeant fatally shot a mentally unstable baseball bat-wielding grandmother in the Bronx. The commissioner’s response was jarring in its candor. “What is clear in this once instance, we failed,” O’Neill said. “We do have policies and procedures for handling emotionally disturbed people and it looks like some of those procedures weren’t followed.” This comment predictably outraged the Sergeants Benevolent Association, but it’s unclear that anger permeated the rank and file that O’Neill came up from. Bratton was immensely popular among officers even during his boss’s darkest days. But his abrasive persona and tough reputation alienated reform-minded members of the City Council and the activist class. Many of those same people, including Brooklyn Councilman Jumaane Williams and Bronx Councilman Ritchie Torres, greeted O’Neill’s promotion optimistically, and praised his record of cooperation and diplomacy. If O’Neill can enact his agenda with success, and while appeasing cops and advocates alike —and while keeping crime rates down—he will have succeeded where his predecessors never could. The new commissioner has one other item on the agenda, and it’s a doozy: he’ll inevitably have to make a pilgrimage to D.C. to beg Congress to reimburse his department for its work shielding Donald Trump and his properties. But while plenty of Republicans revile New York City, respect for the NYPD is common to both sides of the aisle, and with a little Irish luck O’Neill will leverage that to his advantage. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. Spencer Platt/Getty Images 2. Preet Bharara None of the U.S. Attorney’s victims this year matched the scalps he collected in 2015: those of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos. But he took out Norman Seabrook, president of the powerful city correction officers’ union, a handful of top NYPD brass and a top de Blasio money man, and a raft of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s most important aides and campaign donors. On top of that, thanks to some finangling by his old boss Sen. Charles Schumer, Bharara will get to keep his post in the Trump administration—an almost unheard of triumph, since presidents usually like to have their personally picked prosecutors in the powerful Southern District Office. This will let the ambitious anti-corruption crusader to continue to target big game, with the mayor and his top political aides now in his sights. It’s unlikely he’s done taking shots at the governor, either. Bharara is clearly positioning himself for a higher post. Under the Obama administration, he was known to covet the office of U.S. Attorney General. That honor eluded him. With two well-cemented U.S. Senators in New York and a Republican regime in Washington, all that appears to remain for him is the top job in Albany—meaning he will have to evict its current occupant somehow. New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman Andrew Burton/Getty Images 3. Eric Schneiderman The state attorney general is the epitome of an activist prosecutor, and courts press attention at every opportunity. Some of his suits have failed, and his recent attempt to indict oil giant ExxonMobil for defrauding investors about the prospects of climate change appears to have run into a reef. But he has enjoyed tremendous success over the last several years wringing big banks for massive settlements over their role in the 2008 financial crisis, thanks in part to President Barack Obama, who appointed him chair of a national task force probing the mortgage industry. Yet Schneiderman has languished in relative obscurity compared to his predecessors, Eliot Spitzer and Cuomo, lacking both Spitzer’s steamroller persona and Cuomo’s bankable name. And Schneiderman clearly longs to follow them into the governor’s mansion. But Trump’s improbable ascent to the White House has offered Schneiderman a chance at some of the recognition he craves. He led a multi-state case against the dubious Trump University real estate seminar, and helped secure a $25 million settlement from the president-elect—$1 million of it going straight to the State of New York. His ongoing probe of the president-elect’s personal foundation, its unlicensed fundraising and its questionable expenditures, could reap even more headlines in the months to come. Already it appears the A.G. will try to block Trump from shutting down the sketchy charity, which could turn into a legal showdown with national repercussions. Schneiderman has also joined Bharara in indicting Alain Kaloyeros, the former State University of New York Polytechnic Institute president and point man for Cuomo’s flagship economic development programs. Kaloyeros stands accused of rigging multiple contracts so that only donors to Cuomo’s campaign could qualify. A successful conviction could open up a path to the governor’s office for an ambitious prosecutor—but there’s only room for one. Hungry as Schneiderman is, he’s shied away from going after Cuomo directly, even though the governor has repeatedly flouted and embarrassed him during their shared six years in statewide office (Cuomo also favored Schneiderman’s 2010 primary rival, then-Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice). Bharara, on the other hand, has shown he’s willing and eager to bite down hard, promising “gory detail” on the corruption at the heart of the governor’s signature initiatives. If the Silver and Skelos cases are any indication, the trials of Kaloyeros and indicted Cuomo confidante Joseph Percoco are bound to be ugly and humiliating affairs, deeply compromising to Cuomo. Schneiderman will have to develop a taste for the governor’s blood, or the U.S. Attorney alone will feast on the spoils. The Goldman Sachs booth at the New York Stock Exchange. Chris Hondros/Getty Images 4. Wall Street You know you’re a real winner when you bet on the wrong horse and still get to take the pot. The Masters of the Universe put their money—literally—on Hillary Clinton capturing the presidency, in one of their finest predictions since forecasting that the housing market would continue to expand indefinitely. Goldman Sachs forbade its employees from donating to Trump. Citi warned immediately ahead of the election that a devastating global economic crash would ensue should the Queens-born businessman triumph—though the company gave him only a one-in-three chance of winning. Both banks had hosted the former first lady for a few of her infamous speeches, as did JPMorgan Chase, and their money-handlers flooded her campaign coffers. This, of course, became fodder for both Sanders and Trump, who depicted her as a pawn of a vast financial conspiracy. The Republican nominee even included an image of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein in a late ad assailing the “global power structure.” Yet doomsday came and went without Citi’s predicted crash. Quite the opposite—the Dow is close to smashing through the 20,000 point barrier, riding a wave of trader euphoria over Trump’s imminent trashing of the post-crash Dodd-Frank regulations. Trump placed JPMorgan Chase CEO James Dimon (a longtime Clinton donor) on his “Strategic and Policy Forum,” and reportedly offered him the job of Secretary of the Treasury. Dimon turned him down, and that role instead went to Steven Mnuchin, a Goldman Sachs alum. The firm’s president, Gary Cohn, will be Trump’s chief economic advisor. Moral of the story: win or lose, these guys get paid. State Senator Jeffrey Klein. Ross Barkan/Observer 5. Jeffrey Klein Since 2012, the leader of the State Senate’s Independent Democratic Conference has enjoyed some kind of coalition agreement with the State Senate Republicans, granting him many of the perquisites of power his former colleagues in the mainline Democratic caucus once sought to deny him. Shortly after New Year’s Day, he revealed he would collaborate with them again. That decision was coming for weeks, even months. Klein peeled two seats away from the larger Democratic deputation—those of Brooklyn State Senator Jesse Hamilton and freshly elected Upper Manhattan State Senator Marisol Alcantara—ahead of Election Day, finally adding some members of color to the previously snow-white IDC and swelling their ranks to seven. Alcantara in particular is a valuable pick-up, given her ties to the Rev. Al Sharpton and new Congressman Adriano Espaillat. With a GOP majority so fragile a well-timed sneeze could blow it apart (another defecting Democrat, Brooklyn State Senator Simcha Felder, gives the Republicans just a one-seat advantage), the IDC can provide the votes necessary for a quorum if somebody falls ill, leaves the chamber or gets arrested. The splinter faction also has more money in its campaign fund than the other Democratic delegation, and Klein one of the few people left in Albany with an amicable relationship with the governor. But by absorbing Hamilton and Alcantara, Klein has taken something of a risk. The other IDC members hailed from districts with a decent Republican population, or at least some conservative inclinations, where relatively few would see propping up a GOP leadership structure as an outrage or apostasy. The two new members represent fiercely blue areas, where many might frown on empowering Republicans. And so Klein will have to extract some liberal concessions from the GOP on their behalf. Majority Leader John Flanagan is probably receptive to this, but his moderate Long Island delegation makes up a shrinking share of the Republican conference, relative to hard-right upstate members. Assemblyman Ronald Castorina, left, and Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, right. Will Bredderman/Observer 6. Staten Island Republicans Since the election there’s been a lot of jawing in Manhattan cable news studios about Trump’s surprising performance in once solid-blue counties of the old industrial Midwest, and plenty of fretting about how “coastal elites” have lost touch with the American core. But if any of these hand-wringing coastal elites bothered to take a short boat ride, they’d find themselves in a county with a five-to-three Democratic enrollment advantage that Trump won with nearly 60 percent of the vote. Staten Islanders broke for Obama in 2012 and Cuomo in 2014. But in 2016, they favored the candidate who shared their accent and worldview. Trump showed up at the local GOP’s Lincoln Day Brunch two days before the New York primary April, and subsequently carried Richmond County by his bigliest margin in the whole state. South Shore Councilman Joseph Borelli became one of the braggadocious developer’s earliest and most ardent supporters, and made multiple TV appearances as a surrogate. It was Staten Islanders who booed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz the loudest when he refused to endorse Trump in his speech at the GOP convention in July. But Borelli and party chairman John Antoniello weren’t the only Republicans who scored points last year. Congressman Daniel Donovan scarcely drew a challenge for what was once a hotly-contested seat, and appears to have ingratiated himself with the mayor and the rest of the city’s Democratic political class. Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis and Assemblyman Ronald Castorina, meanwhile, obtained an injunction in December blocking de Blasio from going through with plans to flush the records of his municipal identification program. Part of the idea behind IDNYC initiative was to provide a government-verified credential to people lacking other forms of paperwork, allowing them to do things like open a bank account. The city’s files are believed to contain the personal information of thousands upon thousands of undocumented immigrants. To prevent these logs from becoming a deportation database under a hostile administration, the City Council deliberately wrote a clause into the legislation that created the program enabling the administration to purge the files when the clock struck midnight on 2017. But Malliotakis and Castorina argued that wiping those records could compromise a future criminal investigation into a cardholder who used his IDNYC for illicit purposes—for instance, to open a bank account that financed terrorist activity. They triumphed in the preliminary round of legal proceedings, stopping de Blasio from dropping the records at year’s end, and prompting the mayor to announce the city would no longer retain any records relating to the municipal I.D. program at all. Politically speaking, this actually benefits all parties: Malliotakis and Castorina get to tell their voters they’re fighting de Blasio, de Blasio gets to tell his base he’s fighting Trump—everybody wins. Unless, of course, the Trump administration actually requisitions the records and uses them to start deporting people. Congressman Joseph Crowley delivers remarks on the second day of the Democratic National Convention. Alex Wong/Getty Images 7. Joseph Crowley The Queens congressman and county Democratic boss had an uneven batting average at home this year, but his stats on the road were great. He got an evening speaking slot at the party convention in Philadelphia, where he recalled how a firefighter cousin of his gave his life on 9/11—and how Trump, a fellow Queens native, “cashed in” on programs aimed at helping small businesses in the aftermath of the attack. His colleagues voted him up from vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus to chairman, making him the fourth-ranked Democrat in the House, bolstering his status as the top New York member—and potentially positioning him to one day replace Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Several of his colleagues reportedly even encouraged him to try to topple the San Francisco Democrat, and his pitch to his colleagues invoked his working-class roots, and sounded an awful lot like the argument Ohio Congressman Timothy Ryan gave in his bid to oust the incumbent leader. On top of all that, Congressman Steve Israel, a rival Democrat whose district covered parts of Nassau County and Queens, just retired. So far, though, Crowley has risen in stature without actually expanding his power. Democrats are still in the minority in the House. The Queens delegation wields little influence in the City Council. And Queens State Senator Michael Gianaris, a county loyalist who heads the Democratic State Senate Campaign Committee, failed to lead the party into political dominance in the upper chamber of the State Legislature. Crowley is in a position to help his party create a message that will allow it to capitalize on the anti-incumbent spirit of the midterms. He can also seek to reassert his influence at City Hall in the aftermath of local elections this fall, as the now-dominant Progressive Caucus appears poised to fracture. Finally, Crowley’s district stretches well into the Bronx, and he and State Senator Klein share both considerable turf and a close relationship with Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, the borough’s Democratic boss. The congressman unsuccessfully sought to boot Queens State Senator Tony Avella, a member of Klein’s caucus, from office in 2014. Still, few are better positioned than the Queens chairman to try to forge a coalition deal between Albany’s fractious Democratic factions following the next round of elections. The question is, does he have the juice to do it? Hillary Clinton confers with Congressman Hakeem Jeffries at Junior’s Restaurant in Brooklyn before the April Democratic primary. Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images 8. Hakeem Jeffries The Brooklyn congressman enjoyed a reputation as one of the city’s most promising political talents even before his election to the House in 2012. He’s used his seat as a pulpit to advocate for his signature issue of criminal justice reform, and occasionally as a platform for taking shots at de Blasio. But he was still a junior member of the Democratic minority, and seniority determined that if any benefits accrued to a representative from New York, they would go to Crowley. Rumors flew that he might challenge the mayor in next September’s primary, but it appeared a daunting prospect, given that they share a base in Central Brooklyn’s black community. The presidential race gave Jeffries a chance to burnish his star. He became an early supporter of Clinton’s candidacy, and an early basher of Sanders’. Throughout the campaign, he regularly unloaded on both the Vermont socialist and the billionaire GOP nominee, perhaps seeing a more prominent role for himself in an incoming Democratic administration. That didn’t happen. But when Minority Leader Pelosi faced a challenge for her perch in November, Jeffries publicly aligned with her, as she had indicated she was “open-minded” about letting newer members have a role in leadership. The congressman secured such a role for himself last month, becoming one of three members elected by his colleagues to lead the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee—which will craft the minority party’s platform. State GOP Chairman Edward Cox. Facebook 9. Edward Cox Rumor has it the state GOP chairman personally favored Ohio Gov. John Kasich for the nomination last year. He stayed neutral during the primary, even as many local Republican leaders flocked to the state’s native son. Apparently Trump hasn’t held it against him. Cox, who famously married Richard Nixon’s daughter, got front-row seats at the party convention and attention not usually given to a Republican leader from an overwhelmingly blue state. For once, it wasn’t such a lonely and thankless job. Cox’s apparatus raised cash for the Trump Victory Fund, and lent its precious tax-free postal indicia to mailings in swing states. The New York chairman is also tight with Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman and Trump’s chief of staff-to-be, and his son may soon receive an ambassadorship. On top of that, one of his chief rivals for the president-elect’s affections (and a general irritant), Buffalo developer Carl Paladino, has finally sunk so deep into his own vile racist juices that even Trump wants nothing to do with him. What clinched it was when the failed 2010 gubernatorial candidate, who co-chaired Trump’s New York campaign, told a local newspaper that his biggest hopes for 2017 were that Obama would die of a bovine ailment after having intercourse with a cow and that the first lady would take up residence with a gorilla in Zimbabwe. And yes, that’s actually what he said. Back on the topic of Cox, the New York Post has it that he snagged 200 D.C. hotel rooms for the inauguration on the cheap from Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Now all that’s left for the chairman to do is actually win a statewide election. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Alex Wong/Getty Images 10.

That's because credit card issuers have begun to respond to the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate hike last month by boosting rates on credit card offers. I began tracking variable rate offers in November on 14 cards from popular credit card issuers in anticipation of the rate increases. All of those cards now have higher rates -- both on the low and high end of the ranges you see when applying for a card. RATE SEARCH: Look now for a low-interest credit card offer. The issuer determines your interest rate within the range based on your creditworthiness at the time of application. Increased rates on both ends of the credit spectrum means excellent credit won't provide you an escape from higher APRs. Every issuer I surveyed that has increased annual percentage rates since the Fed meeting has done so by the same 0.25 percent the central bank increased its benchmark interest rate. Credit card interest rates on the rise Credit card APR range as of Nov. 28, 2016 APR range as of Jan. 3, 2017 American Express Blue Cash Everyday 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% BankAmericard Cash Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Capital One Venture Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Capital One Quicksilver Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Chase Freedom 14.24% to 23.24% 14.49% to 23.49% Chase Slate 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Chase Sapphire Reserve 16.24% to 23.24% 16.49% to 23.49% Citi Simplicity 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Double Cash 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Thank You Preferred 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Diamond Preferred 12.24% to 22.24% 12.49% to 22.49% Citi Prestige 15.49% 15.74% Discover it Card 11.24% to 23.24% 11.49% to 23.49% Wells Fargo Visa Signature 12.4% to 26.24% 12.65% to 26.49% Source: Issuer websites The only issuer among the ones I tracked not showing a rate change on its website: JPMorgan Chase. A spokeswoman for the bank's credit card division said its rates increased on Dec. 20, but had not yet been updated on marketing materials. Still, the impact of these rate increases across all cards hasn't yet been felt. Bankrate surveys 131 credit cards across 50 different issuers each week. As of the last week of 2016, the average variable interest rate was 16.27%, a slight increase over the previous week, although it's not even the high-water mark for the month. Impact on existing balances If you don't plan to apply for a new card in the new year, you're still not immune to a rate hike. While the Credit CARD Act of 2009 bans most retroactive rate increases, it does allow issuers to adjust APRs on variable rate cards tied to an index. Most cards are tied to the prime rate, which increases or decreases based on the Fed's own rate adjustments. CARD SEARCH: Delay your own personal interest rate hike by grabbing a good balance transfer card. Your credit card agreement will spell out how soon after the prime rate changes that you can expect a rate hike on your card. The most recent credit card agreements the issuers of the 14 credit cards I tracked filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau show generally you should feel the hike soon -- if you haven't already. The agreement for the Chase Freedom card, for example, says it will use the prime rate as published two business days before the end of each billing cycle. "If the U.S. Prime Rate changes, we’ll apply the new variable APR starting from the first day of the Billing Period when we take the U.S. Prime Rate from the (Wall Street Journal)," according to the agreement. My most recent American Express statement -- dated Dec. 22, little more than a week after the Fed increased rates -- already showed a change in my APR. The issuer bumped my interest rate from 17.49% APR to 17.74% APR. This isn't a big deal for me because I pay in full every month. But for others, this hike may pinch. Late payments could increase Prior to the rate hike, the credit bureau TransUnion calculated that a 0.25 percentage point rate hike would increase the average monthly payment on adjustable rate accounts by $6.45. Most consumers will be able to handle that additional cost, but 9.3 million Americans are expected to feel "payment shock" that could lead to late payments and defaults, TransUnion found.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Despite Strong Bullish Stock Action, Some Analysts Remain Bearish January 5, 2017 6:29am INDEXDJX:.DJI NYSE:DIA ShareTweet From Brad Hoppmann: The bull has been running wild on Wall Street since Election Day. The Dow is within about 50 points of the vaunted 20,000 mark. And the mood beyond the markets appears to be a good one. In fact, consumer confidence is as high as it’s been in some 15 years. Yet despite the positive backdrop, Wall Street isn’t buying in. That’s the conclusion of a recent article at CNBC.com. It shows that even after post-election animal spirits boosted the S&P 500 to a near-double-digit annual return in 2016, Wall Street’s biggest firms are the most-bearish they’ve been on equities for 2017 since 2005. So, it seems like the favorite animal spirit on Wall Street for 2017 is the bear. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the average S&P 500 forecast among 16 top investment firms calls for a 4.05% gain in 2017. That’s the smallest yearly increase predicted since the beginning of 2005. So, why the relatively negative outlook on stocks here, especially given the current buying mood on the Street? Source: CNBC.com / Bespoke Investment Group The CNBC piece cites comments by JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Dubravko Lakos-Bujas. He is about in the middle of the pack of analysts here, calling for the S&P 500 to finish 2017 at 2,400. Per the CNBC piece: “The prospects of pro-growth policy reforms under the Trump administration (i.e., deregulation, tax reform, fiscal spending) should continue to push the market higher. … However, rising yields and (the U.S. dollar) are the main risks to our positive equity outlook.” And there you have it — the push vs. pull of the potential for pro-growth policies from the Trump/Republican government vs. higher interest rates and a higher greenback. *** To that conflict, I would add the possibility of rising inflation. Especially if the aforementioned consumer confidence levels cause people to borrow and spend more money. Then we have the prospect of the Fed hiking rates at least a couple of times in 2017. And possibly more if the economy gets hot … and/or if there is a fiscal stimulus package that revs up GDP and inflation. On the flipside, we have the bullish outlook as articulated by RBC analyst Jonathan Golub. He is calling for a 10.1% move in the S&P 500 in 2017. Per the CNBC article: “Following two years of near-zero growth, we expect profits to re-accelerate … 2018 EPS growth (+9.4%) assumes a 2–3% impact from Trump policies. This placeholder for changes in taxes, regulation, and spending is quite modest, in our view, as an adjustment to corporate taxes alone could easily double this impact.” As you can see, there are a lot of “what ifs” wafting about as we settle into the first week of 2017, as well as a lot of conflicting opinions. Fortunately, I don’t think it will take too long to begin finding out how bullish (or how bearish) the smart money is going to view the Trump/Republican administration. With Inauguration Day a little more than two weeks away, I think we’ll start to see this market solidify a bit more by month’s end … so stay sharp, and stay tuned in!

Markus managed to build up his small pastry business through micro-credit loans. By BenPimentel This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. What is a microloan, and is one right for your small business? If you’re a small-business owner on a quest for capital, there are several smart reasons to turn to nonprofit microlenders. These lenders go beyond making small loans to entrepreneurs and provide some benefits that traditional lenders don’t: Profit is not their objective. Many microlenders are called mission-focused or mission-based lenders. They offer loans from government or nonprofit programs geared to helping disadvantaged communities, including areas that are struggling economically. Some microlenders also operate internationally, helping entrepreneurs in developing nations. Microlenders typically offer loans of $50,000 or less to startups and other small-scale operations. Some make bigger loans to more established businesses. Many microlenders and nonprofits provide pro bono consulting and training, including helping small businesses build credit. Good options for nonprofit financing Below, we list 13 sources for nonprofit financing. They include the top lenders based on information from two major small-business institutions, the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Aspen Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based policy and educational research nonprofit. When considering these lenders, keep in mind that microloans have limitations. Because many nonprofits rely on grants, donations or government guarantees or allocations, the number of loans they offer and the amount you can borrow are limited. Funding constraints can also mean strict borrower requirements. And many nonprofits operate only in specific states or regions. Nonprofit microlenders are also grappling with a major trend in small-business financing: the rapid rise of online lending. It offers quicker but usually more expensive access to cash, says Steven Cohen, president of Excelsior Growth Fund, a New York-based community development lender. “You see a lot of businesses trading off speed and efficiency for cost,” he says. “But you also see an incredibly crowded marketplace where there isn’t a whole lot of transparency. Nonprofits have the challenge of getting the word out there that, ‘We’re here.…We’re more affordable.’ ” Top U.S. microlenders The Aspen Institute’s FIELD program runs the U.S. Microenterprise Census, which collects data from microlenders across the country. Here are the top five microlenders by total loan amount disbursed, according to the program’s 2014 survey, the most recent data available. Grameen America Grameen America is affiliated with the Grameen Foundation, an international organization known for programs that help poor communities address their own needs. Grameen America has disbursed more than $490 million in loans to tens of thousands of women in the U.S. The organization has a nontraditional lending system: Borrowers must form a group with four other women they trust. That group then participates in a week of financial training, at the end of which each member opens a savings account and receives a $1,500 microloan to build a small business. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $100.7 million LiftFund San Antonio-based LiftFund offers microloans in the southern U.S., including Texas, Georgia and Florida. Borrowers typically use the financing to buy equipment and supplies. The microloans are also meant to help small-business owners improve their credit and more likely to qualify for a bank loan in the future, the lender says on its website. LiftFund got a boost in October 2016 when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced almost $5 million in funding for its new small-business loan program in New Orleans, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin, Texas. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $18.7 million Opportunity Fund California-based Opportunity Fund has been serving residents of the state since 1994, with more than $160 million in microloans. Its borrowers have a median household income of $31,000 a year. Around 90% are minority-owned businesses, and about 30% are women-owned businesses. Opportunity Fund also provides financial literacy education to business owners. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $17.7 million Accion New Mexico Accion New Mexico offers small-business loans from $1,000 to $1 million in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Texas. The nonprofit also provides business counseling and marketing support and sponsors educational events. It’s part of the Accion U.S. Network, which also has major chapters in New York, Chicago and San Diego. The international Accion nonprofit offers financing services and assistance, including microloans, in 32 countries. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $8.9 million Justine Petersen Justine Petersen, which is based in St. Louis, offers small-business loans, typically of less than $10,000. The nonprofit also finances businesses in rural areas through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Intermediary Relending Program and originates loans of up to $150,000 as part of the SBA’s Community Advantage Program. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $8.4 million Top SBA nonprofit lenders Aside from its signature 7(a) term loans, the SBA issues low-cost small-business financing through a network of nonprofits. The SBA Microloan Program offers loans of up to $50,000 administered through community-based nonprofit groups. The SBA Community Advantage Program offers loans of up to $250,000 in communities that historically have had limited access to capital. The federal agency guarantees up to 85% of Community Advantage financing. Here are the top five nonprofits in the SBA programs based on total loan amount disbursed to small businesses in 2015, the most recent data available: CDC Small Business Finance Corp. CDC Small Business Finance Corp. offers different types of financing for new and expanding businesses in California, Arizona and Nevada, including SBA Community Advantage loans of between $20,000 and $250,000. It also issues SBA commercial real-estate loans, known as the SBA 504 loans, for clients planning to buy an existing building or build a new facility. SBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $11.7 million Valley Economic Development Corp. Valley Economic Development Corp. specializes in small-business loans and microfinancing for entrepreneurs who don’t qualify for loans from traditional banks. It’s based in Los Angeles but also operates in other states, including Nevada, Illinois and New York. Aside from the SBA Community Advantage program, it participates in other small-business financing programs, including the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses, the National African-American Small-Business Loan Fund and the National Microfinance Network. SBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $9.7 million Empire State Certified Development Corp. Empire State Certified Development Corp. is part of the New York Business Development Corp., a major SBA lender. It was the top SBA Community Advantage lender in 2014. Empire State CDC also participates in the SBA commercial loan program. SBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $7.6 million Main Street Launch Main Street Launch, previously known as OBDC Small Business Finance, serves clients in the San Francisco Bay Area. It provides small-business loans of $10,000 to $250,000 that can be used for such expenses as equipment purchase, inventory or working capital. SBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $7.4 million LiftFund LiftFund, listed above among top U.S. microlenders, also offers SBA Community Advantage loans of $50,000 to $250,000 to businesses in low- to moderate-income communities in 13 states. Business owners can also qualify if more than 50% of their full-time workforce is low-income or if their employees live in areas designated as low- to moderate-income communities. SBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $6.6 million Other notable nonprofits Kiva U.S. Kiva U.S. is a part of Kiva, a nonprofit working in more than 80 countries. To receive an interest-free microloan through Kiva U.S., borrowers first must have friends and family members lend to the venture. This helps establish the borrower’s creditworthiness. Once that happens, Kiva opens the loan to its lenders for funding. Pacific Community Ventures Pacific Community Ventures is a San Francisco-based community development lender that offers loans of between $10,000 and $200,000 to small businesses in California. You need to have been in business at least a year and have at least two employees. However, if you have a solid business record and a firm grasp of your business finances, PCV may offer you a loan even if you fall short on some requirements. Excelsior Growth Fund Excelsior Growth Fund offers online loans of up to $100,000 for approved borrowers in less than five days and funding of up to $500,000 through its ImpactLoan program. The lender deals with borrowers who typically wouldn’t qualify for traditional financing because their company is a startup or has poor credit. Through affiliates, it also provides SBA 7(a) and Community Advantage loans. Business Center for New Americans Business Center for New Americans provides financing of between $500 and $50,000 to small businesses in New York City. Borrowers must be in the retail, light manufacturing, restaurant or service industry, and existing businesses must have at least three to six months of “verifiable revenue,” according to the organization. Brand-new companies must present a startup budget. For other small-business financing, compare options on NerdWallet’s small-business loans tool page.

He brokers the sale of private jets, and already he's seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5 percent more than anticipated. "My phone is ringing off the hook" from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation in the Washington suburb of Manassas, Va. "Just the business climate feels like it's getting better." The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. VIDEOS TOP JOBS But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business. Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who'll be an advocate for the industry but he also replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong an almost-decade-long sales slump. "You'll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet," said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business. Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12 percent since November 2015, the bank said. It's far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump's victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron gained 19 percent, General Dynamics rose 12 percent and Bombardier jumped 22 percent. Aircraft sales amount to about 30 percent of their revenue. "The Trump win looks positive for bizjet demand given the post-election stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama's anti-bizjet rhetoric," Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month. Alain Bellemare, chief executive of Canadian planemaker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees "somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates." "Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure — it's all good for our business," he said. "So I hear the tone now and I'm optimistic." Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump's theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron's Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kan. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Ga. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer SA manufactures planes in Melbourne, Fla. Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multi-city visits they otherwise couldn't with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane. That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup, which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation. » Next page...

"Towards the second half of this year, U.S. shale starts to kick in," said Scott Darling, the investment bank's Asia-Pacific oil and gas research head. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures were moving around $53 a barrel and Brent crude futures at around $56 a barrel on Thursday morning in Asia, up from sub-$50-a-barrel levels before the OPEC production cuts were announced. Late last year, OPEC and major non-OPEC countries announced join production cuts of around 1.8 million barrels a day starting this year. David McNew / Stringer | Getty Images News Pump jacks and wells on the Monterey Shale formation in California Darling said sustained crude prices of $50 a barrel in the second half of 2017 will aid U.S. shale growth of 200,000 barrels a day while the jump will be at 600,000 barrels a day if crude prices move up to $60 a barrel. Any further rise may even see shale production growth breaching 1 million barrels a day, he added. Rival Goldman Sachs noted Thursday U.S. shale activity has already picked up strongly, with the horizontal oil rig count at a 13-month high, and it expect U.S. shale producers to continue to ramp up activity at current price levels. JPMorgan's forecast for Brent crude averages $58 a barrel in 2017 with prices sliding to $55 in the fourth quarter as shale production starts to impact the market.

Other deals continue in the competitive card landscape. Chase had put an extraordinary incentive on a new credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve. (Photo: JPMorgan Chase) Ever imagine that anyone would rush out to sign up for a credit card with a $450 annual fee? Well, some big spenders could be writing that one on their to-do lists in the next week. Chase had put an extraordinary incentive on a new credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, which was rolled out in August. You get 100,000 in bonus rewards if you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account. Chase said the rewards would add up to as much as $1,500 toward travel when you redeem through Chase Ultimate Rewards. But Chase noted on its website Tuesday that the 100,000 bonus points will come to an end soon, falling to 50,000 points instead. Read more: DETROIT FREE PRESS The hottest new plastic is metal Did the Chase Sapphire Reserve stand out from a crowded card landscape? You betcha. The buzz was big and the card went viral before Chase did any other marketing. At one point, Chase ran out of the card’s metal stock and sent out temporary plastic cards until the handcrafted, embossed metal cards were available. In December, JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon told investors that the card has been doing great and now Chase would have to account for the cost. Dimon said then that the Sapphire Reserve card would reduce the bank’s profit by $200 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter. Is Chase reducing the bonus because it was too successful? Are we likely to see far smaller bonuses in the future? Not necessarily, according to some credit card experts. "The reduction in the Chase Sapphire Reserve introductory bonus was inevitable. The 100,000 point sign-up bonus was only a temporary offer," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. Chase said online that consumers need to apply by Jan. 11 online to get the 100,000 bonus.See www.chase.com/creditcards. After that, you can sign up at a bank branch to get the bonus through March 11. And after that, the offer will decrease to 50,000 bonus points, worth up to $750 for travel if you sign up through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal. The points do not expire as long as your account is open. If you're shopping for a credit card, always consider how you'd use the points, how much you typically spend and what kind of points you'd build over time. One resource: The Points Guy — at www.thepointsguy.com — lists some of the bonus rewards being offered, as well as tips on how best to use some travel-related cards. The Points Guy site is owned by Bankrate.com. Remember, if you don't pay the balance off each month, pay attention to the interest being charged on a credit card. The Chase Sapphire Reserve card states online that its rate will range from 16.24% to 23.24%, based on your credit worthiness. And remember, these rates would go up should the prime rate climb as expected. Are these Sapphire Reserve cards worthwhile?  Well, if you're trying to put a lid on spending right after the holidays, this card might be too great a temptation to spend even more early in 2017. And read the fine print. You would not earn that 100,000 in rewards points with a balance transfer or cash advance. And you'd pay another $75 a year in fees for each additional card for other users. Then again, this deal could work for some consumers who know for certain they'll spend $4,000 in the first three months. "The bonus more than outweighs the annual fee," said Bill Hardekopf, CEO of LowCards.com. "If you wanted to, you could then cancel the card before you are hit with the second year annual fee of $450." McBride noted that the card may still be worth keeping for many consumers. The $450 fee is partially offset by a $300 annual travel credit applied to your account for travel purchases on your card. The Chase Sapphire Reserve card pays three times the points on travel and dining purchases, compared with double the points on those categories on the Chase Sapphire Preferred, a card with a $95 annual fee. On other purchases, you'd earn one point per dollar on both Reserve and Preferred. Chase notes that travel is defined relatively broadly for the triple-points rewards, including using the credit card to pay for tolls and taxis. Hardekopf said consumers often like to use bonus points and rewards on airline tickets or hotel rooms. But sometimes consumers are disappointed by a limited number of rooms or flights available under some rewards programs. Or they're only able to use those rewards for a certain hotel or airline. "What happens if the hotel down the street has a much better rate when you want to take your trip? Your rewards are not very rewarding at that time," he said. For that reason, some consumers prefer cash-back programs. And there are plenty of those too. Hardekopf points to the Citi Double Cash card, which pays 1% when you make the transaction and 1% when you pay Citi for the purchase. These rewards apply for all purchases, so you don't have to keep track of any specific categories. Another popular card: The Capital One Quicksilver card gives 1.5% back on all transactions, plus consumers receive a $100 bonus when they spend at least $500 during the first three months of being a cardholder. It's likely to be another good year to shop for rewards cards — even after the end of the 100,000-point deal at Chase. "The rewards program arms race will continue in 2017, with new cards and stepped-up introductory offers appearing throughout the year just as we've seen the past few years," McBride said.

Trump announced his nomination of Jay Clayton, a partner in the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, as chairman of the independent agency that oversees Wall Street and the financial markets. If confirmed by the Senate, his responsibilities will include enforcing the scores of rules already written by the agency under the 2010 law that reshaped financial regulation after the 2008-09 crisis. The law, known as Dodd-Frank, has long been scorned by Republicans and is high on Trump’s target list. Clayton has worked on many of the securities deals that the SEC regulates and has represented Wall Street powerhouses including Goldman Sachs and Barclays. He is the latest Trump choice with Wall Street connections. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman executive. Trump also has tapped Gary Cohn, until recently Goldman’s president, to be his top economic adviser, and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department. Clayton would succeed Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor who also had worked as a corporate attorney before being named SEC chair by President Obama. Clayton played a legal role in a raft of major deals. Some of the biggest came in the panicky days of 2008: He represented Goldman in billionaire Warren Buffett’s $5 billion investment in the Wall Street bank, and the teetering Bear Stearns in its rescue sale to JPMorgan Chase. He worked on a multitude of deals bringing companies public, notably the 2014 U.S. stock market debut of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba — the biggest IPO ever. In announcing the appointment, Trump’s transition team said Clayton will encourage investment, “while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries.” “Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority,” the statement said. But some key Democrats were unimpressed with the choice of Clayton. “It’s hard to see how an attorney who’s spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder,’ ” said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. The committee, with a Republican majority, will conduct Clayton’s confirmation hearing. “I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from the financial institutions the SEC oversees, and work to prevent another financial crisis,” Brown said in a statement. Trump will be able to put an even broader stamp on the SEC. In addition to Clayton, he’ll have a chance to name two of the other four commissioners. The five-member body has been down two since December 2015. Two candidates nominated by Obama to fill vacancies, one Democrat and one Republican, have been stalled in Congress over whether they support requiring publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. Rather than offer quick remedies, the complex Dodd-Frank legislation laid down prescriptions for regulators to flesh out. The SEC was responsible for writing a large chunk of the nearly 400 required rules. Overall, federal regulators have completed about 70 percent of the rules more than six years after Dodd-Frank became law. With Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, a major overhaul of the law is expected, if not an outright dismantling. Republicans also have been pushing the SEC to ease the rules for smaller companies to raise capital in the markets — an area related to Clayton’s experience. “We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a statement.

That's because credit card issuers have begun to respond to the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate hike last month by boosting rates on credit card offers. I began tracking variable rate offers in November on 14 cards from popular credit card issuers in anticipation of the rate increases. All of those cards now have higher rates -- both on the low and high end of the ranges you see when applying for a card. RATE SEARCH: Look now for a low-interest credit card offer. The issuer determines your interest rate within the range based on your creditworthiness at the time of application. Increased rates on both ends of the credit spectrum means excellent credit won't provide you an escape from higher APRs. Every issuer I surveyed that has increased annual percentage rates since the Fed meeting has done so by the same 0.25 percent the central bank increased its benchmark interest rate. Credit card interest rates on the rise Credit card APR range as of Nov. 28, 2016 APR range as of Jan. 3, 2017 American Express Blue Cash Everyday 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% BankAmericard Cash Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Capital One Venture Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Capital One Quicksilver Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Chase Freedom 14.24% to 23.24% 14.49% to 23.49% Chase Slate 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Chase Sapphire Reserve 16.24% to 23.24% 16.49% to 23.49% Citi Simplicity 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Double Cash 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Thank You Preferred 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Diamond Preferred 12.24% to 22.24% 12.49% to 22.49% Citi Prestige 15.49% 15.74% Discover it Card 11.24% to 23.24% 11.49% to 23.49% Wells Fargo Visa Signature 12.4% to 26.24% 12.65% to 26.49% Source: Issuer websites The only issuer among the ones I tracked not showing a rate change on its website: JPMorgan Chase. A spokeswoman for the bank's credit card division said its rates increased on Dec. 20, but had not yet been updated on marketing materials. Still, the impact of these rate increases across all cards hasn't yet been felt. Bankrate surveys 131 credit cards across 50 different issuers each week. As of the last week of 2016, the average variable interest rate was 16.27%, a slight increase over the previous week, although it's not even the high-water mark for the month. Impact on existing balances If you don't plan to apply for a new card in the new year, you're still not immune to a rate hike. While the Credit CARD Act of 2009 bans most retroactive rate increases, it does allow issuers to adjust APRs on variable rate cards tied to an index. Most cards are tied to the prime rate, which increases or decreases based on the Fed's own rate adjustments. CARD SEARCH: Delay your own personal interest rate hike by grabbing a good balance transfer card. Your credit card agreement will spell out how soon after the prime rate changes that you can expect a rate hike on your card. The most recent credit card agreements the issuers of the 14 credit cards I tracked filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau show generally you should feel the hike soon -- if you haven't already. The agreement for the Chase Freedom card, for example, says it will use the prime rate as published two business days before the end of each billing cycle. "If the U.S. Prime Rate changes, we’ll apply the new variable APR starting from the first day of the Billing Period when we take the U.S. Prime Rate from the (Wall Street Journal)," according to the agreement. My most recent American Express statement -- dated Dec. 22, little more than a week after the Fed increased rates -- already showed a change in my APR. The issuer bumped my interest rate from 17.49% APR to 17.74% APR. This isn't a big deal for me because I pay in full every month. But for others, this hike may pinch. Late payments could increase Prior to the rate hike, the credit bureau TransUnion calculated that a 0.25 percentage point rate hike would increase the average monthly payment on adjustable rate accounts by $6.45. Most consumers will be able to handle that additional cost, but 9.3 million Americans are expected to feel "payment shock" that could lead to late payments and defaults, TransUnion found.
