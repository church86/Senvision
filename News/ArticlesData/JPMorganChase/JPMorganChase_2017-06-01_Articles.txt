First conducted by the Federal Reserve in 2009 to increase confidence in the system, bankers say the tests have morphed into a mysterious, laborious and time-consuming process from what was once a straightforward exam of financial strength. The outcome determines how much capital banks must hold, and how they can use what is left. But getting a passing grade can be tough. JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank, calls on hundreds of employees to work on stress test submissions each year. Morgan Stanley, the sixth largest, submits a file of over 25,000 pages. Reducing the tests’ complexity and frequency could not only save man-hours, but help the U.S. economy by stimulating more lending, bankers and lobbyists said in recent interviews. "While we believe that stress-testing is the best way to gauge capital adequacy, we also believe that a fresh look at how stress-testing is conducted could produce significant benefits for economic growth," said Greg Baer, president of industry trade group The Clearing House Association. Bankers have been making their case in meetings with legislators, in reports sent to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is stewarding the financial overhaul by the Republican administration, and in public comments to investors and securities analysts. Easing up on stress tests could significantly boost returns. For example, Nomura Instinet analyst Steven Chubak estimates JPMorgan could increase annual profits by about $2.5 billion, or 10 percent, under a more relaxed framework. There are more than a few skeptics pushing back on the industry's pleas. Hawkish regulators and former regulators oppose the idea of lightening stress tests too much. "As proposals for regulatory change swirl about, it is crucial that the strong capital regime be maintained, especially as it applies to the most systemically important banks,” former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, who led regulatory matters, said in April. “Neither regulators nor legislators should agree to changes that would effectively weaken that regime." Consumer advocates, anti-Wall Street groups and influential lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, have also fought any loosening of bank regulations, arguing the industry would embrace reckless practices again. While bond investors and ratings agencies are happy to see robust capital levels, stock investors are clamoring for banks to boost share buybacks and dividends. Wall Street analysts have been asking what banks would do with unleashed capital, and the picture is mixed. JPMorgan has said it would like to extend more credit to small businesses and home buyers if the government eases up on lending restrictions. Citigroup Inc, in contrast, has emphasized buying back stock because its shares are trading for less than the company is worth. The industry's stress-test offensive is happening as Washington re-examines financial reforms, in what will likely be a lengthy and heated debate. The Treasury Department is expected to release its first in a series of reports on overhauling regulations early next week, while House Republicans are scheduled to vote on their own financial regulatory reform bill. Despite assurances by Trump that rules will be rewritten, there appears to be insufficient support in Congress. At least eight Senate Democrats would be needed to pass any broad law rewrite, which is unlikely. However, the Fed has broad discretion to make changes to the stress tests. POOR EXECUTION When it comes to the stress tests, bankers argue that the goal is noble, but the execution is poor. For instance, the Fed scores loan portfolios for losses under hypothetical economic catastrophes but does not explain its methodology, which changes year-to-year. Even if banks pass numerically, they can fail for "qualitative" problems like risk management. And, in their own calculations, lenders cannot consider steps they would take to conserve capital, something bankers describe as irrational. "The world will end three times over, but you need to factor in the fact that you probably paid dividends in that time, and you wouldn't shrink your balance sheet, and you would continue to pursue mergers and acquisitions," one executive said. Bankers say they sweat through every year's process, worried they will miss unseen hurdles. The uncertainty causes them to lend less than they otherwise would, they argue. The Fed has resisted any wholesale reimagining of stress tests, and major revisions are unlikely until new Fed governors are confirmed. Three board seats including the supervisory post are open. But there are signs the Fed could become more accommodative. For instance, banks will receive "more guidance" on qualitative matters when stress test results are announced on June 22, Fed Governor Jerome Powell said on Thursday. Bankers are hoping bigger changes will happen before the Fed issues instructions for the 2018 stress tests early next year.

First conducted by the Federal Reserve in 2009 to increase confidence in the system, bankers say the tests have morphed into a mysterious, laborious and time-consuming process from what was once a straightforward exam of financial strength. The outcome determines how much capital banks must hold, and how they can use what is left. But getting a passing grade can be tough. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, the biggest U.S. bank, calls on hundreds of employees to work on stress test submissions each year. Morgan Stanley, the sixth largest, submits a file of over 25,000 pages. Reducing the tests´ complexity and frequency could not only save man-hours, but help the U.S. economy by stimulating more lending, bankers and lobbyists said in recent interviews. "While we believe that stress-testing is the best way to gauge capital adequacy, we also believe that a fresh look at how stress-testing is conducted could produce significant benefits for economic growth," said Greg Baer, president of industry trade group The Clearing House Association. Bankers have been making their case in meetings with legislators, in reports sent to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is stewarding the financial overhaul by the Republican administration, and in public comments to investors and securities analysts. Easing up on stress tests could significantly boost returns. For example, Nomura Instinet analyst Steven Chubak estimates JPMorgan could increase annual profits by about $2.5 billion, or 10 percent, under a more relaxed framework. There are more than a few skeptics pushing back on the industry's pleas. Hawkish regulators and former regulators oppose the idea of lightening stress tests too much. "As proposals for regulatory change swirl about, it is crucial that the strong capital regime be maintained, especially as it applies to the most systemically important banks," former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo, who led regulatory matters, said in April. "Neither regulators nor legislators should agree to changes that would effectively weaken that regime." Consumer advocates, anti-Wall Street groups and influential lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, have also fought any loosening of bank regulations, arguing the industry would embrace reckless practices again. While bond investors and ratings agencies are happy to see robust capital levels, stock investors are clamoring for banks to boost share buybacks and dividends. Wall Street analysts have been asking what banks would do with unleashed capital, and the picture is mixed. JPMorgan has said it would like to extend more credit to small businesses and home buyers if the government eases up on lending restrictions. Citigroup Inc, in contrast, has emphasized buying back stock because its shares are trading for less than the company is worth. The industry's stress-test offensive is happening as Washington re-examines financial reforms, in what will likely be a lengthy and heated debate. The Treasury Department is expected to release its first in a series of reports on overhauling regulations early next week, while House Republicans are scheduled to vote on their own financial regulatory reform bill. Despite assurances by Trump that rules will be rewritten, there appears to be insufficient support in Congress. At least eight Senate Democrats would be needed to pass any broad law rewrite, which is unlikely. However, the Fed has broad discretion to make changes to the stress tests. POOR EXECUTION When it comes to the stress tests, bankers argue that the goal is noble, but the execution is poor. For instance, the Fed scores loan portfolios for losses under hypothetical economic catastrophes but does not explain its methodology, which changes year-to-year. Even if banks pass numerically, they can fail for "qualitative" problems like risk management. And, in their own calculations, lenders cannot consider steps they would take to conserve capital, something bankers describe as irrational. "The world will end three times over, but you need to factor in the fact that you probably paid dividends in that time, and you wouldn't shrink your balance sheet, and you would continue to pursue mergers and acquisitions," one executive said. Bankers say they sweat through every year's process, worried they will miss unseen hurdles. The uncertainty causes them to lend less than they otherwise would, they argue. The Fed has resisted any wholesale reimagining of stress tests, and major revisions are unlikely until new Fed governors are confirmed. Three board seats including the supervisory post are open. But there are signs the Fed could become more accommodative. For instance, banks will receive "more guidance" on qualitative matters when stress test results are announced on June 22, Fed Governor Jerome Powell said on Thursday. Bankers are hoping bigger changes will happen before the Fed issues instructions for the 2018 stress tests early next year.

JPMorgan upgraded shares of Deere after the agricultural equipment manufacturer's announcement that it would buy Wirtgen Group. By Ben Levisohn June 2, 2017 12:54 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large In December, I recommended buying shares of Deere (DE) after the farm equipment manufacturer traded a new all-time high. It's hit another one today after JPMorgan upgraded it to Neutral from Underperform today. Illustration: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Deere's shares are up 24% since my call--50% during the past 12 months--so what are JPMorgan's Ann Duignan and Thomas Simonitsch seeing that made them upgrade it now? How about yesterday's announced acquisition of Wirtgen Group? They explain: Yesterday DE announced the planned acquisition of Wirtgen Group, the private, German-based road construction equipment company; the stock was up 1.8% vs. S&P 500 up 0.8%. Management has agreed to pay a total consideration of €4.6B (or ~$5.2B) in an all cash transaction, representing 9.5x EV/EBITDA on Wirtgen’s 2017 estimates or 7.9x EV/EBITDA including DE’s 2022 synergy assumptions. Overall, we appreciate the strategic fit of the acquisition to the extent that Wirtgen should improve the reach and breadth of DE’s C&F product offering, opening up new markets for growth; at the same time, the pro forma exposure reduces DE’s dependence on A&T, mitigating some of the key risks underlining our prior UW rating (our view on the next cycle in US agriculture especially). At first glance, synergies of €100MM by year five appear very conservative despite limited overlap between the businesses; we estimate savings in strategic sourcing alone may be worth €180MM. We like the strategic rationale behind the deal and Wirtgen appears to be a good company based on its product quality and reputation as well as the financial history available to us; whether it is a good investment for DE is harder to gauge at this point, though we would expect the market to view the deal favorably. As such, we can no longer justify an UW rating on DE, despite the continued risks to its core businesses; we are upgrading to Neutral and raising our Dec-17 price target to $122 (from $103) Shares of Deere have risen 0.6% to $125.47 at 12:51 p.m. today, while the Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI) has gained 0.9% to $68.52.

(Photo: Getty via iStock/Thinkstock) 600 CONNECTTWEET 11 LINKEDIN 139 COMMENTEMAILMORE After every major financial crisis over the past century, policymakers in the executive and legislative branches of the United States government have passed sweeping legislation to overhaul the way banks do business. The Panic of 1907 prompted the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which created our central bank. The Great Depression led to the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and prohibited the cohabitation of investment and commercial banks. And the litany of crises throughout the 1970s and 1980s convinced Congress to broadly deregulate the bank industry through a series of wide-ranging legislative acts. USA TODAY Trump to dismantle Dodd-Frank Wall Street rules through executive orders It's only through this lens of historical context that one can truly appreciate the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which came on the heels of the financial crisis that erupted two years earlier. Fighting the last war Generals are often accused of "fighting the last war," in that they set their strategies going forward based on their most recent combat experience. This can be a mistake, of course, because times change. Strategies evolve. Adversaries adjust. Weapons systems advance. The same can be said of the intent behind the Dodd-Frank Act, which was conceived with the best of intentions. Fissures in global financial markets were first exposed in August 2007 when a leading bank in Europe, France's BNP Paribas, stopped allowing investors to withdraw capital from two funds that held mortgage-backed securities. The situation escalated seven months later when Bear Stearns experienced a liquidity crisis. The investment bank's institutional clients stopped providing the funds the bank needed to stay afloat. Things got so dire that the federal government offered JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) a $30 billion loan to facilitate its acquisition and thus rescue. But it wasn't until September 2008 that the crisis climaxed with the failure of Lehman Brothers, the nation's fourth-biggest investment bank at the time. The stock market plummeted. Credit markets froze. And countless companies, both within the financial sector and outside of it, found themselves on the brink of failure. The fear pulsing through the credit markets was particularly alarming because it made it impossible for even the most creditworthy of companies such as General Electric to access the funds needed to cover its payroll and other ordinary operating costs. The government's initial response was swift. It arranged Bank of America's (NYSE: BAC) purchase of Merrill Lynch. It nationalized all but a small sliver of American International Group, the massive insurance company that had insured vast swaths of investment securities backed by subprime mortgages. And it injected tens of billions of dollars' worth of capital into the nation's leading banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup (NYSE: C), and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC). These were stopgap measures, however, more akin to CPR than to a long-term solution to cardiac problems. The latter came in the form of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed two years later in a heavily partisan vote spearheaded by Democrats and opposed by Republicans. "The White House will call this a victory," said then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "But as credit tightens, regulations multiply, and job creation slows even further as a result of this bill, they'll have a hard time convincing the American people that this is a victory for them." CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share President Donald Trump will sign an executive order that will rollback some of the financial sector regulations put in place following the global crisis in 2008. Newslook The too big to fail problem The Dodd-Frank Act was designed to ensure that a financial crisis like that in 2008 won't happen again. As such, it sought to attack the principal problem that policymakers believed had caused the crisis in the first place – the growth and proliferation of too-big-to-fail banks. The notion of banks being too big to fail has a rich history. Almost all of the greatest financial crises in American history were aggravated by the failure of large financial institutions, which further sapped confidence in the financial sector and, prior to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's founding, led to the destruction of countless peoples' liquid wealth. This is why the eponymous founder of JPMorgan Chase worked tirelessly during the Panic of 1907 to stop the bank runs occurring up and down Wall Street at the time. His actions were vindicated 25 years later when an otherwise ordinary recession transformed into the Great Depression due to a tsunami of bank failures. USA TODAY 5 signs you can trust your financial adviser But it wasn't until 1984 that the term "too big to fail" became part of our broader lexicon with the failure of Continental Illinois, one the country's largest banks at the time. In an almost identical series of events to the ones that brought down Bear Stearns more than 30 years later, Continental Illinois saw its funding sources evaporate after rumored problems at the bank led institutional investors to empty their accounts. Explaining the Dodd-Frank Act In an effort to prevent crises like these in the future, the policymakers behind the Dodd-Frank Act underwrote a series of critical reforms. The act increases the amount that capital banks must hold in reserve, giving the banks an added cushion to absorb loan losses in future downturns. It similarly requires banks to keep a larger portion of their assets invested in things that can be easily liquidated in the event of a bank run – namely, cash and government securities as opposed to term loans. The act also subjects the nation's biggest banks to a series of heightened regulatory requirements not faced by regional and community banks. Under Dodd-Frank, every bank with more than $50 billion worth of assets on its balance sheet must submit to annual stress tests administered by the Federal Reserve, which then determines if they would survive a hypothetically severe crisis akin to the one in 2008. As a part of the stress tests, these banks must also seek regulatory approval to increase their dividends or authorize new share repurchase programs. Even among the biggest banks, moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act makes distinctions. The biggest among them are classified as global systemically important banks, or G-SIBs, which must hold an additional tranche of capital, known as the G-SIB surcharge. This is particularly burdensome for JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup which have to keep as much as 3% their shareholders' equity laying fallow in cash or low-yielding but highly liquid securities. These banks must also submit resolution plans to regulators each year, detailing how they could be resolved without causing harm to the financial markets in the event they go bankrupt. The Dodd-Frank Act has reintroduced central tenets of the Glass-Steagall Act as well, which had been gradually eroded over the years after originally forbidding commercial banks from running trading operations. The iteration of the rule in Dodd-Frank, known as the Volcker Rule, outlaws proprietary trading at universal banks and thereby limits their trading operations to serving as market makers for institutional clients. And last but certainly not least among the major changes introduced by the Dodd-Frank Act was the founding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is vested with the authority to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive financial products and services. At the end of the day, in turn, while one can argue about the prescience and necessity of the Dodd-Frank Act, there's simply no doubt that it has fundamentally transformed the banking and financial services industry. The main question now is whether or not this transformation will be permanent, or, as has been promised by policymakers of late, just a temporary blip in the history of banking that could soon go away.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By Allison Arieff Detroit has a way with comebacks. In 1933, the city began emerging from the Great Depression with a little help from public-private-partnerships. Spurred by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the federal agency mandated with stabilizing U.S. banks, the National Bank of Detroit (NBD) was formed. On its opening day on March 24, 1933, customers swarmed the new NBD to open 562 accounts, bringing in bundles of currency and coins ranging from a few hundred dollars to hundreds of thousands. America’s “Motor City” was on the mend. JPMorgan Chase Detroit’s recovery demonstrates how targeted efforts fueled by data and collaboration can work to solve a city’s problems. Today, Detroit’s recent revitalization bears some resemblance to the past. Despite shifts in the city’s biggest industry, residents of the Motor City spend money with local businesses at a rate greater than other U.S. cities, powering the local economy. It’s clear that any solution to Detroit’s challenges has to start at the community level. This is also why public-private-partnerships continue to play a crucial role. In 2013, the Mayor’s office and a range of local groups including JPMorgan Chase – which has been in Detroit for more than 80 years and acquired the NBD during that time – helped fuel a recovery focused on stabilizing neighborhoods, re-training the workforce for today’s job market and bolstering local small businesses, all while attracting new investors. JPMorgan Chase was an early leader in this strategy, committing $100 million in 2014 with plans to expand that to $150 million by 2019. And the work underway in the city has helped JPMorgan Chase develop and refine its approach to creating economic opportunity – resulting in a model that can be applied elsewhere. For a city that was losing population just four years ago, the latest indicators are encouraging: Unemployment has nearly halved and 8,000 more Detroiters are working now than at this time last year. The downtown area, once blighted and abandoned, is flourishing with restaurants and businesses. Some 2,000 vacant homes are being rehabbed and reoccupied. But Detroit’s recovery is not just the feel-good story of America’s rustbelt – it’s a lesson in urban revival. The city’s revitalization is about more than access to capital. It’s about collaboration and public-private-partnership. A thriving city means thriving companies and an evolving, growing workforce that calls that place home. Data-Driven Workforce Development While governments, planners and economists have long sought to help cities grow smart, there are few precedents for managing the ones that have shrunk. This is partly because of the evolving demands of the labor market. Here, Detroit’s use of data is an example for other cities. Detroit partnered with the Corporation for Skilled Workforce and JPMorgan Chase to research employment barriers. Their research produced two reports in early 2016 evaluating the city’s untapped labor potential and solutions for increasing the employment rate. The data stemming from the reports helped inform a reconstituted Mayor’s Detroit Workforce Development Board, a team of workforce professionals in Detroit that pinpoint high demand industries so training programs can tailor their offerings to meet the market demands. The board’s efforts are also supported by the Workforce Intelligence Network in Detroit, which keeps track of open jobs by location and industry, to provide the city and trainers with actionable market data. To date, 15,000 Detroiters have received career and technical training. One example is The Greening of Detroit, a nonprofit devoted to restoring the city's tree infrastructure while providing training for skilled jobs in forestry, urban agriculture and landscaping. By aligning its programs with available jobs and workforce data, the organization boasts an 83 percent job placement rate. “We are helping to make these folks work-ready so they can get into the workforce and earn a decent living wage,” says Devon Buskin, workforce development director, the Greening of Detroit. Of course, a model for recovery not only addresses the workforce, it must be inclusive of the businesses that sustain it. Open For Business In Detroit, 43 percent of consumer purchases came from residents shopping in the same neighborhood where they live, according to 2016 research by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. Although this measure is higher than any other U.S. city, not all of Detroit’s small businesses were thriving. In 2014, when JPMorgan Chase made its initial $100 million investment in Detroit, they focused on growing incubators, such as TechTown and Eastern Market, to provide local ventures with the resources and skills training needed to succeed. The incubators spurred growth, but research soon showed that a portion of Detroit’s most important small businesses were being left behind. Many of the minority-owned small businesses weren’t expanding or even surviving because they couldn’t get access to funding. Minority-owned construction companies, for example, couldn’t bid on higher-end development projects because they didn’t have the funds to get more employees or equipment. This deeper understanding of the city’s needs led JPMorgan Chase to reposition its public-private partnerships with small businesses, a core part of their philosophy of testing and refining ideas over time. Out of these circumstances emerged the Entrepreneurs of Color (EOC) program, a fund designed expressly to help minority-owned small businesses. It has awarded over 40 small businesses with $3.3 million in critical capital since it began making loans just over a year ago. Today, Detroit’s minority-owned small businesses are expanding, not just surviving. Half of EOC loans have been to women minority-owned companies, like Marlene Brooks who was able to open a new hair salon, Dymond Designs, in downtown Detroit and Benkari, a plumbing company owned by the first African American female master plumber in Michigan. “There are a lot of factors at play in Detroit,” says Detroit Development Fund president Ray Watters, “A lot that needs to be helped. It’s not just the lending that we do. JPMorgan Chase has gotten involved in the mortgage program to help more residents own homes. They’ve moved into education to help with education of young residents. This broad approach has ripple effects.” Stabilizing Detroit’s Neighborhoods One sign of strong communities is population growth and neighborhood development. And while the populations of big cities like New York, London and San Francisco have been growing, Detroit’s was rapidly dwindling, due in part to failing neighborhood infrastructure. Like many cities, Detroit was overrun with unoccupied properties – approximately 91,000 vacant lots and 78,000 abandoned properties. That’s why JPMorgan Chase directed $50 million of its investment to building and supporting two new community development funds with Invest Detroit, a local community development organization, and Capital Impact Partners, a national organization focused on revitalizing neighborhoods. The funds finance community development projects in and adjacent to Detroit’s urban core with the goal of creating livable and workable spaces that attract and retain residents. These two development funds used the company’s initial investment to leverage $147 million in outside investment, supporting over $270 million worth of development projects completed or underway in Detroit. The investment in these two funds created or preserved 800 units of housing, 800 jobs, and over 175,000 square feet of commercial space. One such project included converting an abandoned midtown warehouse of the iconic Detroit motor company, Willys Overland, into new residential and retail space. The now thriving community development proudly display’s the original motor company’s logo and boasts modern residential lofts and storefronts for local small businesses like Shinola Detroit, the Jolly Pumpkin and RUNDetroit. JPMorgan Chase Detroit residents sit outside of Jolly Pumpkin, a local craft brewery, enjoying the spring weather and Jolly’s locally-renowned brews. The Jolly Pumpkin sits in the new Willys Overland development, which was previously an abandoned warehouse of an old Detroit motor company. It is now the site of modern residential lofts and small business storefronts. The downtown and Woodward Ave corridors are also seeing development with the rehabilitation of the 1212 Griswold building in Capital Park and the creation of The Shoppes at Woodward Park, which will become an epicenter of small business retail along the new Detroit light rail. To further stabilize Detroit’s neighborhoods, JPMorgan Chase invested $5 million toward a new $30 million Strategic Neighborhoods Fund that will dedicate critical resources towards commercial and residential real estate, jobs and community infrastructure in several Detroit neighborhoods over the next decade. The company also partnered with the Detroit Land Bank Authority to expand the program’s reach and help Detroit fight neighborhood blight. The Land Bank in turn partnered with a local Detroit entrepreneur, Jerry Paffendorf, and his start-up, Loveland Technologies. After 180 Detroiters took to the streets surveying over 376,000 parcels of land, the group launched the Motor City Mapping Project (MCM), an online map showing all of Detroit’s property information. The information has since helped the city and community groups devise plans to remove blighted properties and rehabilitate abandoned ones. The quality of life in Detroit’s communities improves with each such development. At this pace, Detroit’s population will continue to stabilize – and flourish. Connecting Detroit: The M-1 Rail Blighted neighborhoods were not Detroit’s only signature challenge. The city’s automobile legacy bears the consequence of a historically underfunded and under-prioritized public transportation system. Until recently. In 2014, JPMorgan Chase provided $1.5 million in direct funds and facilitated raising $13.5 million in New Markets Tax Credits to help the city finance its new light rail, a 3.3-mile project to connect Detroit’s downtown to the cultural district. The light rail is expected to serve 5,400 riders a day, according to Michigan’s Department of Transportation, and has brought in new investors to develop housing and commercial opportunities along the light rail’s path. In addition to partnering on public infrastructure, the company has sent over 100 employees to Detroit to advise on economic growth opportunities and help the city expand its global footprint through trade. The Detroit Service Corps, as it’s called, is a three-week program that matches employees from a variety of cities worldwide with local nonprofit projects. In addition to helping build capacity for nonprofits in Detroit, the program helps globalize lessons learned in different cities. JPMorgan Chase Detroit’s recovery demonstrates how targeted efforts fueled by data and collaboration can work to solve a city’s problems. Cities can’t have small businesses if they don’t have a workforce to support them. And a workforce can’t thrive without stable communities and the means to get to and from them. While every city is unique in its own way and requires tailored solutions, Detroit’s comeback is a model for other cities to follow.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe In recent years, the city of Detroit, Michigan has earned the nickname “America’s Comeback City”—and rightfully so. Detroit’s unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent in 2016, down from a high of 19 percent. The poverty rate is now 13.4 percent, a full point below the national average. This transformation is proving that America’s industry cities can move forward and thrive as the economy evolves. JPMorgan Chase In Detroit’s Midtown neighborhood, a wave of development is bringing new life to the community and spurring the city's rebirth. Through private sector investments, including an expected $150 million commitment from JPMorgan Chase by 2019, and collaboration with the public sector, the city is rebuilding from the ground up, and revitalization is coming faster than anyone could have imagined when the city filed for bankruptcy in 2013. The city is creating more reasons for locals to stay while also attracting new residents, a combination that is stabilizing and growing the local economy. The Midtown neighborhood has bounced back particularly quickly: adding nearly 150 new businesses and 1,500 new residents since 2013. More than 50,000 people now work in the area—and through new developments projects, many are starting to live there, too. As recently as 2014, 30 percent of Detroit’s residential buildings stood vacant or only partially occupied. A 1920s-era, 56-unit building on Alexandrine Street was one of them—about 40 percent occupied, partly by squatters who didn’t pay rent. The rest of the units were uninhabitable, with crumbling walls and long-outdated plumbing and wiring. “It was almost a detriment to the community,” says Jacob Horner, a vice president at PK Development, the firm that undertook the renovation. “The fourth floor had such extensive water damage, it was uninhabitable.” PK completed a gut renovation of Rainer Court in just 18 months, a pace made possible by a $6 million investment from JPMorgan Chase. Now, the 19th century masonry is once again an ode to the neighborhood’s storied past. A repaired skylight sends light streaming into the lobby, and its 36 new apartments feature much more than a fresh coat of paint. “They are blown away,” property manager La’Nore Rice says of her tenants, most of whom previously lived within a five-mile radius and yet had never seen a transformation like the one at Rainer Court. Just three months after reopening in September 2015, the building was already close to full occupancy. Now, the entire neighborhood is at 98-percent occupancy. It’s a welcome change from 2014, and Rice is looking forward to seeing what new growth Rainer Court’s renovation and other investments bring to her long-neglected block. “It’s getting better,” she says,“ and it’s going to continue to get better—but I’d like to see it stay that way.” When Norman Silk and Dale Morgan opened their flower shop Blossoms in the late 1970s along a stretch of Third Avenue not far from Rainer Court, the area was part of the red light district. Nonetheless, Blossoms built up a loyal following, from neighborhood regulars to the board and patrons of the nearby symphony hall. Over time, though, Midtown’s rising crime and the city’s economic distress made it hard to keep employees—and harder still to find willing new ones. “When they heard it was in Midtown, they’d say, ‘Oh no, I’m not working there,’” Norm recalls. Eventually Blossoms left Third Avenue for a suburb, a move many businesses were taking by the early 1990s. Norm kept close tabs on Detroit as the city’s revival took hold, and especially when the buzz started to focus on Midtown. “That’s when we started thinking about coming back,” he says. This year, he turned that thought into action. Blossoms reopened on Third Avenue in August 2016, shortly after the renovated Rainer Court started leasing new units and the neighborhood started drawing in new coffee shops, groceries, and retail stores—all within walking distance, in a neighborhood where walking wasn’t even safe just a few years before. The biggest change, though, is who comes through the door. Lots of Blossoms’ clientele are regulars and long-time Detroiters, some from local families spanning three generations, but new customers come in every day, recently including a few residents of Rainer Court who came in looking for wedding bouquets. Blossoms’ new-old neighborhood is a community now, he says, and he thinks that sense of home will anchor the neighborhood into the indefinite future. “You walk up and down this block, and these places are owned by real people,” he says. “This neighborhood is authentic, and it’s real.” Much like Rainer Court, the 19th-century Victorian building on the opposite corner of Third Avenue and Alexandrine was also unoccupied and showing its age by 2014. But with so many new businesses opening and development plans cropping up, neighborhood veteran Jason Peet saw an opportunity. All of these new residents would likely have family and friends coming to visit, and these new businesses would attract new customers. Surely, they’d need somewhere to stay—why not provide that right within the neighborhood? In 2016, after extensive renovation, the once-crumbling Victorian reopened as the El Moore. It serves now as half hotel, half residential apartments. In the morning, as hotel guests and residents share breakfast in the parlor, those conversations turn into recommendations—and sometimes even invitations to explore Detroit together. That’s exactly the effect Jason hoped the renovation would have. “It’s so important that each project not only take care of that building,” he says, “but also start to stitch communities back together.” Before Rainer Court and the El Moore were renovated, he recalls, “there was no one out on the street. Now people will pass each other, stop, have a conversation. Having those gatekeeper buildings makes that happen.” Mid-sentence, Jason had to excuse himself to answer his phone. The caller turned out to be a resident of Rainer Court, looking to book a hotel stay for her father, who would soon be visiting from Spain. “Those visitors will go home and talk to other people about their experience in Detroit,” he said later. “Being able to share that with people starts to break down a lot of barriers.” Changing the perception of Detroit starts here, on this block, he says, with the “passion and hope” he saw in the new neighborhood’s residents when he first arrived. “It’s always been here,” he says, “it’s just getting people comfortable enough to experience it.” Paula Guthat and her husband, Tim, moved Cinema Detroit from elsewhere in Midtown after noticing new blips of activity west of the Cass Corridor, including Rainer Court’s renovation. The theater is the only one in Midtown open seven days a week, and, not coincidentally, the Guthats chose a location just down the block from Rainer Court. “Just by virtue of more people living here, we have a greater customer base to draw from,” Paula explains, and as a new expression of community spirit, the theater inspires customer loyalty. Some regulars, including a couple at Rainer Court, stop in after work just to buy popcorn and chat. “Someone said to me, ‘I feel like you’re inviting us into your house,’” she recalls. "That’s why we’re here, for this neighborhood.” Building by building and block by block, Detroiters are “starting to see ourselves in a different, better way,” she says. “I think that’s the first step.” Having lived there for only a week, Rachel Darling is Rainer Court’s newest face, but she’s no stranger to Detroit. She’s been coming to the city for years, drawn by her love of techno music, Detroit’s latest musical specialty. She’s been attending the Movement music festival here since 2012, and each visit let her mark the city’s changes. “Restaurants started getting better, the hotels started to be built up,” she says, and she was drawn most of all by “how nice people are here.” Add the new M-1 train and a forthcoming bike share, and it’s easy to see why Rachel followed Detroit’s siren call all the way from Chicago. About a quarter of people who signed new leases in Midtown in 2016 were transplants from other cities, states, or countries, some of them seeking the new jobs in this flourishing neighborhood. Rachel landed a job as a tax advisor, a job that would have been exceedingly rare in this neighborhood before 2014. Rainer Court sold itself. She showed up without an appointment, fell in love, and signed for her unit on the spot. Her new job started five days later. After a week, she’s already figured out how to contribute to her new city, volunteering in the public schools and helping to bring techno, the passion that first brought her here, to the music venues of Midtown. “I’m itching to give back to the community,” she says, adding that the scope of projects happening across Detroit “makes you want to be immersed in the city that much more.” The Next Frontier Detroit’s boom doesn’t seem to be slowing anytime soon: In 2016 alone, the city opened 110 development sites in greater downtown. With each new development, says Paula, the excitement was coupled with a “tinge of worry” among regulars that they could soon be pushed out. Even Rachel couldn’t believe her luck with Rainer Court; she’s outpriced on most of Alexandrine Street. Property in Detroit now sells for 30 percent more than it did in the wake of the recession. Sue Mosey of Midtown Detroit Inc. helps manage the neighborhood’s balance of old and new residents through two initiatives: “Live Midtown” offers subsidies to employees of Midtown businesses who want to move to the area, and “Stay Midtown” does the same for residents who are spending a third of their income or more on housing. As of mid-April, Stay Midtown’s pilot program had raised enough money from institutions and non-profits to subsidize 50 households, half its ultimate goal. Extending and stabilizing new neighborhoods while sustaining community spirit is how projects such as Rainer Court have made a difference to Detroit’s overall rebound, says Jacob Horner of PK Development. With enough resources and commitment, developments throughout the neighborhood will keep raising the bar, making for a community with a sense of family and a city that feels like home. As part of an expected $150 million philanthropic investment in the city of Detroit by 2019, JPMorgan Chase supports Rainer Court and similar projects that contribute to the city’s revitalization. Emphasizing neighborhood stabilization as part of that recovery, the company’s targeted lending helps launch development and infrastructure projects, grow new and existing small businesses, and support community nonprofits and organizations. JPMorgan Chase’s continued commitment to Detroit has helped the company refine and reimagine its commitment to the city – leading to the creation of a new corporate responsibility model designed to create impact by focusing on some of the crucial drivers of inclusive growth: workforce training, small business development, financial health, and neighborhood revitalization.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe By JPMorgan Chase A car stops at an empty house on a Detroit street. Three passengers get out and approach the house, snapping pictures of different details that need renovation. They return to the car and then repeat the process at the next house. The passengers aren’t snooping neighbors. They’re Detroit residents who are knee deep in a data gathering initiative called The Motor City Mapping Project, led by Loveland Technologies. JPMorgan Chase Businesses across the country are recognizing data-driven initiatives as prime opportunities to contribute to effective, localized, and measurable change. Loveland Technologies is a software company solving urban development problems using interactive mapping and crowdsourcing. With these technologies Loveland is focusing on solving the issue of blight in a new way. “Applying a startup mentality to solving Detroit’s challenges means taking the best of the rapid-fire ‘innovate-test-iterate’ cycle and bridging it with a vision for creating long-term change,” says Jerry Paffendorf, the company’s CEO and co-founder. This vision would be difficult to execute, though, without support from a new kind of corporate philanthropy partnership. “JPMorgan Chase provides that kind of bridge: patient capital for innovative solutions to deep problems.” The concept of private companies donating data and analytical skills emerged on the global scene at the 2011 World Economic Forum in Davos, where attendees concluded that corporations with troves of data should know more about the benefits of sharing that data for public good. Since then, the United Nations Global Pulse initiative has promoted the model as a way to both spark innovation and address public interest issues across the globe. Insights from corporate-funded studies or the donation of proprietary data can be used to address challenges from disease outbreaks to economic stressors to fallout from natural disasters. The UN, for example, has accumulated data studies on macroeconomic issues in Cambodia, Ugandan community radio, and social attitudes toward biofuels. As evidenced by Motor City Mapping, data can make a profound difference at the hyper-local level too, particularly in finding solutions to issues like urban blight and unemployment. In Detroit, JPMorgan Chase donated data and analytics resources that are contributing to economic rebuilding efforts, closing the skills gap, and informing urban planning. It’s part of a broader effort by JPMorgan Chase to take a data-driven approach and use the firm’s talent and resources to make a lasting impact on the communities it works with. As a funder and partner to Motor City Mapping, JPMorgan Chase is helping ensure that the work of the photo-snapping volunteers—who have surveyed 380,000 parcels to date—has the maximum effect. The information has now been digitized, thanks to support from the company and Data Driven Detroit. The result is a fascinating interactive map of the city that shows the number of structures versus vacant lots, the condition of those structures (whether they’ve been affected by fire or illegal dumping), and their occupancy status. The map is visible on a house-by-house level—users can search an address and see a photo of what it looks like—and individual residents can contribute their own photos to keep the map updated. Data from the project provided the backbone for a report produced by the Detroit Blight Removal Task Force, an organization that has a goal of removing every blighted vacant structure in the city. As the world recognizes the full power of data, it’s emerged as a key aspect of a new corporate responsibility model that combines various capabilities to do the most good. Instead of handing over a check and calling it a day, corporate responsibility has evolved to be more strategic and multi-faceted in its approach. JPMorgan Chase is at the forefront of this new holistic approach, pioneering a model that offers a mix of money, employee expertise, and data with the belief that the same things that contribute to business success should also shape the way companies think about solving problems in civil society. A recent two-part report (pdf) published by the company in partnership with the Corporation for a Skilled Workforce presents data from the US Census and job postings to identify specific opportunities in Detroit’s job market. Part of what it revealed was that Detroit’s employment issue isn’t a lack of jobs; it’s that the skills of the unemployed don’t align with open positions. This skills gap is of particular concern for middle-skill jobs—or jobs that require a high school diploma and technical training. Among Detroit residents, 22% lack a high school diploma or GED. Whereas in the past a strategy for getting those diplomas in-hand might have been dictated by history or hunches, today’s data-based approach helps organizations optimize their resources and efforts. The aforementioned report has already informed several initiatives to address the skills gap in the city: its identification of the most desirable skills helped the mayor’s Detroit Workforce Development Board train more than 3,800 Detroit residents with in-demand skills and ultimately contributed to adding 8,000 more Detroiters to the workforce in 2016. It also prompted the creation of the Detroit Workforce System Leadership Academy, a year-long program that joins 22 of the city’s most prominent established businesspeople to solve universal employment issues. Mayor Mike Duggan praised the report as “giving us an invaluable tool in supporting our new Workforce Development Board as it tackles the challenges ahead.” And the value of the data provided by the Motor City Mappers has already proven persuasive enough to inspire spin-offs in Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus. The data-driven approach is spreading to the places that need it most, and, increasingly, businesses are recognizing that their philanthropic efforts can offer more than money alone. Businesses across the country are recognizing data-driven initiatives as prime opportunities to contribute to effective, localized, and measurable change. House by house, person by person, data can help transform a city.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Media & Advertising Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search AmEx to Issue Hilton Cards Alone -- WSJ ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More AmEx to Issue Hilton Cards Alone -- WSJ By AnnaMaria Andriotis Published June 02, 2017 Features Dow Jones Newswires Facebook Twitter Print Company will become the single issuer for the hotelier, muscling out Citigroup Continue Reading Below American Express Co. has won the rights to become the exclusive issuer of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. credit cards, according to executives from both companies, a much-needed victory for the card issuer. The deal ends a long-held arrangement in which AmEx and Citigroup Inc. had each issued the hotel's credit cards. Hilton more than a year ago had opened a bidding process for exclusive rights to its cards and decided to move to a single issuer. AmEx will become sole issuer of the Hilton Honors cards in the U.S. beginning in January 2018, according to both companies. This is a boost for AmEx, which has lost several card partnerships since 2015, including Costco Wholesale Corp., JetBlue Airways Corp., and Fidelity Investments. Costco and JetBlue accounted for 23% of AmEx's U.S. balances at the end of 2015. While Hilton is a loss for Citigroup, it was the issuer that wrested Costco away from AmEx, a far bigger arrangement. The loss of partnerships like Costco dented investor confidence in AmEx's ability to grow and pushed the issuer to increase lending to help boost revenues. The setbacks also occurred as AmEx has come under increasing pressure in the high-end rewards card space, notably from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and its Sapphire Reserve rewards card. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The last time AmEx won a new credit-card partnership in the U.S. was in 2015, when it announced an exclusive agreement with Charles Schwab Corp. Yet co-branded cards remain important for AmEx. Such cards accounted for 34% of the company's world-wide loan balances and 15% of its billings during the last half of last year. Its largest co-brand portfolios are with Delta, which accounts for 20% of world-wide loan balances, and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., which accounts for 5% of balances, according to AmEx data. All of its other co-brands comprise 9% of balances. "Co-brands are very important for AmEx...and this particular arrangement is meaningful for us," said Denise Pickett, president of U.S. consumer services at AmEx. Meanwhile, Jud Linville, chief executive at Citi Cards, played down the loss, saying in a statement that "during negotiations, it became clear that terms of exclusivity given the relatively small size of the portfolio were not economically viable." While Hilton is now in AmEx's win column, investors are also awaiting news about the fate of its Starwood relationship. Marriott International Inc. completed its acquisition of Starwood last year and the hotel is reviewing several scenarios, including whether to merge the Marriott and Starwood credit-card programs, or to leave them separate. Marriott's credit cards are issued by J.P. Morgan Chase. A decision will likely be made about the Marriott and Starwood cards by the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the matter. In terms of the Hilton deal, it isn't immediately clear for AmEx investors how much of a financial boost the victory will bring. It wasn't known how much AmEx paid for the deal. Nor has the future of Citi's Hilton card balances been decided, said Mark Weinstein, global head of customer engagement, loyalty and partnerships at Hilton. Also unknown is whether Citi Hilton card users will be able to continue using the cards after 2017. Those discussions are still under way, said Mr. Weinstein, adding that card users' relationship with Hilton Honors will continue. "This is a preview of what's coming in 2018," he said. Competition for travel credit-card partnerships has intensified in recent years. Banks want airfare and hotel cards because most consumers who sign up for them have high credit scores and are high spenders. For some issuers, this is also an opportunity to sell other services to affluent consumers. "The competition...is at the highest pitch I've ever seen it," said Michael Abbott, digital lead at Accenture Financial Services. "It's a war for distribution for the issuers." And card issuers often have to give up a lot to get a deal. Hotels in recent years, for example, have been demanding that issuers pay them a higher amount for each point that consumers rack up on their cards. And the prices for these arrangements have been rising since the recession, Mr. Abbott said. Another potential downside: Hotels typically want assurances from issuers that they will commit to getting more consumers to sign up for the cards and to use them a lot. That can lead to increased marketing spending at issuers, which has been an issue for AmEx in recent quarters. Ms. Pickett of AmEx declined to talk about marketing expenses associated with this deal and said the company "already had a marketing partnership with Hilton and this is obviously continuing at a different level." Such costs could become even more of an issue as banks and others have ramped up the rewards offerings on their high-end general purpose credit cards. That potentially diminished the allure of using, say, a hotel-specific card. "Airline and hotel co-brands are a snoozefest...[they] are under pressure," said Brian Kelly, founder and chief executive of ThePointsGuy.com, which tracks rewards-card programs. But there are pluses. Clinching a deal like this on an exclusive basis gives AmEx exposure to a large number of desirable consumers. Hilton's loyalty program has approximately 63 million members, according to the hotel. That includes a mix of consumers who have Hilton co-branded cards and those who earn hotel perks without the credit card. "The deals are wins even if the positive impact isn't to the same degree it might have been about 10 years ago," said Craig Maurer, an analyst who covers AmEx at Autonomous Research Corrections & Amplifications Hilton's full company name is Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

But Dimon doesn’t plan to follow Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney boss Bob Iger by stepping down from President Trump’s business advisory council. “We have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment,” Dimon said. A JPMorgan spokeswoman confirmed that Dimon does not plan to leave the the council, which is called the Strategic and Policy Forum. By contrast, Musk followed through on his threat to quit that forum as well as the president’s manufacturing jobs initiative. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said on Twitter shortly after Trump’s White House announcement on leaving the climate deal. Dimon did express disappointment with Trump, echoing concerns raised by fellow Wall Street bigwig Lloyd Blankfein. The Goldman Sachs CEO sent his first-ever tweet on Thursday to call Trump’s Paris move a “setback for the environment and for the U.S.’s leadership position in the world.” Blankfein is not a member of Trump’s advisory council. Dimon’s statement suggests he wants to continue to have a voice in Trump’s agenda, which includes plans to rip up rules governing Wall Street. The stocks of JPMorgan and other banks spiked after the election, in part because of Trump’s pledge to “do a big number” on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Bank stocks have given back some of their post-election gains amid disappointment with slow progress on tax reform and deregulation. JPMorgan stock is up 19% since Trump’s victory.

The IPO would be the first by a U.S. e-commerce company in two years, as stock market investors have been wary of betting on companies in the sector that, unlike Stitch Fix, are not already profitable. San Francisco-based Stitch Fix has hired investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to lead the IPO, four people said this week, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Stitch Fix, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment. Founded in 2011 by Harvard Business School graduate Katrina Lake, Stitch Fix has over 5,700 employees. It had $730 million in sales in its fiscal year for 2016, its third year of profitability. Stitch Fix sends its customers five personalized apparel and accessories items based on size, budget and style. Customers fill out a survey of their preferences, which the company then uses to select items for them with the aid of a personal stylist. Customers can return what they do not like in the company’s prepaid packaging. Stitch Fix works with more than 250 women’s fashion brands, including Joie and Citizens for Humanity, and more than 30 men’s brands including Scotch & Soda. Stitch Fix is a variant on the popular e-commerce “subscription box” model, in which customers pay to have regular – often monthly – shipments of goods. Stitch Fix offers subscriptions, but does not require customers to subscribe to use their service. Subscription businesses such as cosmetics supplier Birchbox and athleisure brand Fabletics have proliferated in recent years, offering retailers more predictable revenue streams, albeit at the expense of putting off some customers who do not like the commitment of a subscription. The reach of subscription businesses has attracted corporate acquirers in recent years. Subscription shave business Dollar Shave Club, for example, agreed last year to be sold to consumer goods company Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) for $1 billion. Take your pick!

"Following" : "Follow"}} June 01, 2017 11:57am   Comments Share: Related FN 20 Biggest Mid-Day Gainers For Tuesday 25 Stocks Moving In Tuesday's Pre-Market Session The valuation of Fabrinet (NYSE: FN) led JPMorgan to add the tech manufacturer to the firm's focus list Thursday. JPMorgan has an Overweight on Fabrinet and raised their price target on the stock from $55 to $57. “We believe the recent sell-off (down 28 percent since Feb. 21 peak/S&P up 2 percent) presents an attractive GARP entry point. We are buyers here," analyst Paul Costersaid in a note. Why A Top Pick? 100G deployments in North America have been driving growth for optical components, and Chinese demand is set to pick up soon, Coster said. Fabrinet is likely to benefit from this upgrade cycle, the analyst said. Fabrinet's operating leverage should increase “as opex grows slower than revenues with management indicating capacity for improvement driven by scale and as new facilities begin to ramp," according to the JPMorgan note. Fabrinet has developed a larger footprint with their campus in Santa Clara and with Exception EMS in the UK. These locations provide “turnkey solutions and prototypes getting in early during the design cycle," Coster said. Fabrinet Chief Financial Officer Toh-Seng Ng had a positive tone at JPMorgan’s TMT conference, according to the firm's note. Fabrinet was trading up 4.6 percent late Thursday morning.

Photos Videos Topics Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Business News GLOBAL MARKETS-Italy leads Europe shares up after data highlights recovery Shares0 Thu, 1 Jun 2017-07:11pm , Reuters Bank shares lagged slightly after two major U. S. lenders, JPMorgan and Bank of America, warned on Wednesday that low market volatility would crimp trading revenue. European stocks rose on Thursday with Italy setting the pace after a big upward revision in first-quarter economic growth, while the dollar rose after forecast-beating U.S. private sector jobs data. Wall Street was expected to open higher, according to index futures , after the jobs numbers which are likely to feed into the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later this month. The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged up 0.3 percent, led higher by industrials and consumer staples companies. Bank shares lagged slightly after two major U.S. lenders, JPMorgan and Bank of America, warned on Wednesday that low market volatility would crimp trading revenue. Italy's FTSE MIB index was the top gaining national market, up 0.6 percent and fractionally outperforming France's CAC 40. Italy's national statistics bureau said strong domestic demand helped the economy grow 0.4 percent in the first quarter, twice as much as indicated by preliminary data issued last month. The euro zone economy as a whole grew 0.5 percent in the period and, in a further sign of recovery, data on Thursday showed manufacturing grew in May at its fastest rate in six years. Stronger euro zone data has helped push the euro higher against the dollar of late, contributing to the U.S. currency's worst fortnight since March 2016. However, the greenback rose 0.4 percent on Thursday, hitting session highs after data showed the private sector added 253,000 jobs in May, above economists' forecasts. The ADP data comes a day before the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report and a fortnight before the Fed is expected to raise interest rates. Asian shares, as measured by MSCI's main index of Asia-Pacific shares, excluding Japan rose 0.1 percent, though gains were limited by data showing Chinese factory activity contracted in May for the first time in 11 months. Chinese Shanghai Composite share index fell 0.5 percent after a private survey of the manufacturing sector. The findings contrasted with official data on Wednesday that suggested growth remained steady. China's yuan, however, strengthened beyond 6.8 per dollar for the first time since Nov. 11 after the central bank pushed its reference rate, around which the spot rate can fluctuate, 0.8 percent higher in the second-largest single-day appreciation of the currency since it was de-pegged from the dollar in 2005. Traders said major state-owned banks were selling dollars. "The PBOC has let the yuan bulls loose in the China shop," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA in Australia, referring to the People's Bank of China. Spot yuan last stood at 6.8066 per dollar, having strengthened as far as 6.7878 earlier. As recently as May 24, it traded at 6.8949 per dollar. Britain's pound, on a rollercoaster ride this week as polls have sent conflicting signals about the outcome of next week's election, fell 0.2 percent to $1.2866 after another poll showed the Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives just 3 percentage points ahead of the Labour opposition. There was little reaction to Britain's manufacturing PMI beating forecasts. "This data point is clearly a positive for the UK economy however GBP traders are putting macro releases on the back burner at present, with the twists and turns in the race for upcoming election having a greater impact on the market of late," David Cheetham, markets analyst at broker XTB, said. The euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.1209, having fallen as low as $1.1201 after the ADP data. The Japanese yen was down 0.5 percent to 111.32 per dollar. Oil prices initially rose, lifting off Wednesday's three-week lows, after data showing a big drop in U.S. crude stocks last week, but pared gains as some participants doubted output cuts by OPEC would be enough to rebalance an oversupplied market. Brent crude, the international benchmark for the oil market, was down 13 cents at $50.63 a barrel at 1243 GMT. President Donald Trump is expected to announce later on Thursday whether he will withdraw the United States from the Paris accord on measures to fight climate change. Phillip Futures' investment analyst Jonathan Chanes said a U.S. withdrawal would signal Trump's intention to further roll back emission regulations. "That would favour the use and demand of fossil fuels," Chanes said.

By MARLEY JAYAAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — U.S. stock indexes edged lower for the second day in a row Wednesday as a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for technology companies canceled out gains for drugmakers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The New York Stock Exchange was evenly split between gainers and losers. “The stock market has been strong and all the while bond yields have dropped during the year,” signaling caution about the economy, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Management. “In the next couple of months we’re going to solve which is right: the bond market or the stock market.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 4.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,198.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,370.21. Banks had skidded a day earlier as bond yields dropped, which hurts banks by forcing interest rates on loans lower. Yields were little changed Wednesday, but financial firms fell again as investors worried that banks’ revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. At a financial industry conference in New York, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said JPMorgan’s trading revenue is down about 15 percent this quarter because of a drop in fixed-income trading. She said that was because of low interest rates and remarkably low market volatility. “There is not a lot to trade around,” she said. “People have cash but no conviction.” At a different industry event Wednesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said second-quarter trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared with a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason. On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase fell $1.75, or 2.1 percent, to $82.15 and Bank of America lost 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $22.41. Capital One slumped $1.36, or 1.7 percent, to $76.92 and Goldman Sachs, which saw its vaunted trading business hit a speed bump in the first quarter, gave up $7.16, or 3.3 percent, to $211.26. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.21 percent. Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom, and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 25 percent. All three slid Wednesday. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.65 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $4.93, or 7.3 percent, to $72.85 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.14 to $128.25. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. Solar power companies sank as investors wondered if President Trump will seek to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate change accords. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 99 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.51. SunPower fell 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $7.87 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $9.70 to $1,265.40 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $17.41 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.58 a pound. European stocks gave up an early gain. The DAX in Germany remained up 0.1 percent, but France’s CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index dipped 0.1 percent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Wall Street little changed as financials drop, defensive stocks gain Reuters comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet June 1, 2017:   US stocks were little changed on Wednesday as financials dropped after JPMorgan and Bank of America warned of revenue weakness, offsetting gains in defensive plays. JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 per cent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 per cent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 per cent in the wake of the US presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump, but they have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.3 per cent on the year. “All the things that Trump told us were going to happen, which was infrastructure spend, deregulation, tax reform, people dont believe any of those will happen, certainly the magnitude and with the speed the market had originally priced in,” said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. “That is why youve seen a lot of the move back, specifically banks.” Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom, hitting trading desks at big banks. The US stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8 and has not topped its long-term average of 20 since November. It did, however, hit a seven-day high of 11.30 on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares lost 2.1 per cent, while Bank of America was down 1.9 per cent as the two biggest weights on the S&P 500. Goldman Sachs fell 3.3 per cent, the biggest drag on the Dow. Defensive plays such as utilities, up 0.46 per cent and telecoms, up 0.35 per cent, were the bright spots as enthusiasm fades for sectors that would benefit from Trump policies. Energy stocks, down 0.4 per cent, also lost ground. Oil prices touched a three-week low as rising output from Nigeria and Libya fuelled concerns that OPEC-led output cuts are being undermined. US crude settled down 2.7 per cent at $48.32 a barrel and Brent settled 3 per cent lower at $50.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 6,198.52. Shares of Michael Kors plunged 8.5 per cent to $33.18. The luxury fashion retailer gave a bleak full-year forecast and said it would shut more than 100 full-price retail stores in the next two years. Mallinckrodt closed down 1.2 per cent at $43.13 after sources said the drugmaker is exploring a sale of its generic drug unit for as much as $2 billion. Analog Devices rose 1.1 per cent to $85.76 after the chipmaker's quarterly results came in above expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. About 7.85 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, above the 6.72 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

This Alice-in-Wonderland world of sub-zero interest rates – bonds which, if held to maturity, result in a loss for investors as bondholders effectively pay governments for the privilege of lending them money – appeared to be slowly returning to normal towards the end of last year. Yet in its latest negative yield index monitor, published last month, which tracks and analyses the international stock of sovereign bonds offering yields below zero per cent, JPMorgan notes that the share of negative-yielding debt in its benchmark index for government bonds in developed markets has been rising again over the past few months. The increase, moreover, is attributable to the renewed decline in bond yields in Europe, a region that has been enjoying surprisingly robust economic growth this year and which, under the normal circumstances, ought to be experiencing a rise in yields as economic conditions improve. However, according to JPMorgan, while the stock of negative-yielding bonds in the index for government bonds in developed markets has fallen significantly from a peak of nearly US$13 trillion in July 2016, it started rising again in March, increasing from just over US$8 trillion in February to nearly US$10 trillion by mid-April before retreating to US$9.2 trillion in early May. The main reason for the renewed increase is a reduction in perceived political risk in the euro zone following the victory of pro-European centrist Emmanuel Macron in France’s presidential election last month. Since the first round of the election in late April, when it became clear that Macron was a virtual shoo-in for the presidency, the stock of negative-yielding debt in France shot up by US$60 billion, according to JPMorgan, helping drag down yields elsewhere in the euro zone, especially in Italy which, given the country’s political and banking-sector woes, would have suffered the most from a victory for the far-right in France’s election. France’s 10-year yield, which was above 1 per cent in mid-March, has sunk to 0.7 per cent (pretty much where it stood at the beginning of this year) while its two-year equivalent is once again falling deeper into negative territory, dropping to minus 0.5 per cent. What is more disturbing, however, is that even short-term borrowing costs in Italy – the next focal point of investor concern in Europe following the favourable outcome of France’s election – are back in negative territory after being positive for most of this year. It borders on the absurd that as much as US$3 trillion of the bloc’s government debt is still trading with a negative yield in a region whose economy is enjoying its fastest growth in six years According to JPMorgan, as much as US$450 billion of Italian government debt is now trading with a negative yield, accounting for nearly one-sixth of the 35 per cent or so of bonds in JPMorgan’s benchmark euro-zone government bond index currently in negative territory. That even in the euro zone – whose economy grew by a faster-than-expected 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year (outpacing the US) and which is expected to expand by an even brisker 0.7 per cent in the second quarter – more than a third of government debt still trades in negative territory shows just how distorted global asset prices have become. Much, if not all, of the blame lies with central banks, especially the European Central Bank and its Japanese counterpart, whose aggressive quantitative easing programmes are keeping bond yields anchored at historically low levels despite a pick-up in growth and inflation in both regions, most noticeably in the euro zone. In last month’s global fund manager survey produced by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a record number of respondents claimed that global monetary policy had become too loose. While the ECB’s caution over withdrawing stimulus is justified, given the persistently subdued level of core inflation (which excludes volatile energy and food prices) in the euro zone, it borders on the absurd that as much as US$3 trillion of the bloc’s government debt is still trading with a negative yield in a region whose economy is enjoying its fastest growth in six years. Quite aside from the damaging effects of negative yields on the performance of long-term institutional investors, particularly pension funds and insurers, sub-zero-yielding debt has allowed market sentiment to become dangerously detached from countries’ underlying fundamentals. France may have averted a full-blown crisis by electing Macron as president, but Italy may not be as fortunate when it holds a crucial parliamentary election, possibly as early as this autumn. In the coming months, negative-yielding Italian bonds may emerge as the most conspicuous case of mispricing in global markets.

US stocks were little changed on Wednesday as financials dropped after JPMorgan and Bank of America warned of revenue weakness, offsetting gains in defensive plays. JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 percent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 percent in the wake of the US presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump, but they have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.3 percent on the year. "All the things that Trump told us were going to happen, which was infrastructure spend, deregulation, tax reform, people don‘t believe any of those will happen, certainly the magnitude and with the speed the market had originally priced in," said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. "That is why you have seen a lot of the move back, specifically banks." Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom, hitting trading desks at big banks. The U.S. stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8 and has not topped its long-term average of 20 since November. It did, however, hit a seven-day high of 11.30 on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares lost 2.1 percent while Bank of America was down 1.9 percent as the two biggest weights on the S&P 500. Goldman Sachs fell 3.3 percent, the biggest drag on the Dow. Defensive plays such as utilities , up 0.46 percent and telecoms , up 0.35 percent, were the bright spots as enthusiasm fades for sectors that would benefit from Trump policies. Energy stocks , down 0.4 percent, also lost ground. Oil prices touched a three-week low as rising output from Nigeria and Libya fuelled concerns that OPEC-led output cuts are being undermined. U.S. crude settled down 2.7 percent at $48.32 a barrel and Brent settled 3 percent lower at $50.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,198.52. Shares of Michael Kors plunged 8.5 percent to $33.18. The luxury fashion retailer gave a bleak full-year forecast and said it would shut more than 100 full-price retail stores in the next two years. Mallinckrodt closed down 1.2 percent at $43.13 after sources said the drugmaker is exploring a sale of its generic drug unit for as much as $2 billion. Analog Devices rose 1.1 percent to $85.76 after the chipmaker's quarterly results came in above expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.About 7.85 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.72 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. tags #Business #markets #Wall Street Related news Business Smooth implementation of GST will grow industry: Britannia Ind Jun 05, 2017 09:35 AM Business Single GST rate would have been disastrous; bank, investment revival the ‘bull's eye’ now: FM Jun 05, 2017 09:34 AM Business Salman Khan to launch electric bicycles under Being Human Jun 05, 2017 09:26 AM Business This day, that year: World's first 'practical' PC goes on sale Jun 05, 2017 08:20 AM Business Centre exploring ways to make Air India profitable: Jayant Sinha Jun 05, 2017 07:45 AM Business There is 'political confusion' in Tamil Nadu: Rahul Gandhi Jun 04, 2017 08:58 PM Politics Mine auction row: Punjab CM rules out any arbitrary action Jun 04, 2017 08:45 PM Business Trade Setup for Monday: Top 10 things you should know before Opening Bell Jun 04, 2017 08:05 PM Business World Bank report says demonetisation will provide long-term benefits Jun 04, 2017 07:22 PM News Most Popular Top News How Ravi Narain built the NSE, and then lost his grip Book profits @ 9700 on Nifty; 5 stocks which can return up to 14% in short term Wipro chief Azim Premji took home 63% less salary, zero commission in FY17 What green initiatives are banks taking towards climate change?

By MARLEY JAYAAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — U.S. stock indexes edged lower for the second day in a row Wednesday as a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for technology companies canceled out gains for drugmakers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The New York Stock Exchange was evenly split between gainers and losers. “The stock market has been strong and all the while bond yields have dropped during the year,” signaling caution about the economy, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Management. “In the next couple of months we’re going to solve which is right: the bond market or the stock market.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 4.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,198.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,370.21. Banks had skidded a day earlier as bond yields dropped, which hurts banks by forcing interest rates on loans lower. Yields were little changed Wednesday, but financial firms fell again as investors worried that banks’ revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. At a financial industry conference in New York, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said JPMorgan’s trading revenue is down about 15 percent this quarter because of a drop in fixed-income trading. She said that was because of low interest rates and remarkably low market volatility. “There is not a lot to trade around,” she said. “People have cash but no conviction.” At a different industry event Wednesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said second-quarter trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared with a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason. On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase fell $1.75, or 2.1 percent, to $82.15 and Bank of America lost 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $22.41. Capital One slumped $1.36, or 1.7 percent, to $76.92 and Goldman Sachs, which saw its vaunted trading business hit a speed bump in the first quarter, gave up $7.16, or 3.3 percent, to $211.26. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.21 percent. Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom, and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 25 percent. All three slid Wednesday. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.65 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $4.93, or 7.3 percent, to $72.85 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.14 to $128.25. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. Solar power companies sank as investors wondered if President Trump will seek to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate change accords. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 99 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.51. SunPower fell 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $7.87 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $9.70 to $1,265.40 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $17.41 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.58 a pound. European stocks gave up an early gain. The DAX in Germany remained up 0.1 percent, but France’s CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index dipped 0.1 percent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent.

Executives of the two biggest US banks said second-quarter trading revenue was set to drop at least 10 percent, according to media reports. In 2.45pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.15 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.3 percent. In 2.30pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced shed 0.21 percent. The Dow weakened as slides in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JPMorgan Chase, down 3.4 percent and 2.4 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Pfizer and those of Johnson & Johnson, recently up 1.7 percent and 1 percent respectively. Shares of Bank of America dropped 2.9 percent as of 2.58pm in New York. In other earnings disappointments, shares of Michael Kors sank, down 9 percent as of 3.07pm, after the luxury fashion retailer offered a full-year earnings outlook that fell short of expectations. It also announced plans to close between as many as 125 of its full-price retail stores over the next two years. Also sliding was the price of oil amid fresh concern about the global glut. “There doesn’t seem to be an end to supply out there,” Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, told Bloomberg. “And demand is not exactly rip-roaring." Meanwhile, a National Association of Realtors report showed its pending home sales index fell 1.3 percent to 109.8 in April, from a downwardly revised 111.3 in March. Significantly weak supply levels are spurring deteriorating affordability conditions, Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said in the report. “Much of the country for the second straight month saw a pullback in pending sales as the rate of new listings continues to lag the quicker pace of homes coming off the market," according to Yun. “Realtors are indicating that foot traffic is higher than a year ago, but it's obviously not translating to more sales." “Prospective buyers are feeling the double whammy this spring of inventory that's down 9 percent from a year ago and price appreciation that's much faster than any rise they've likely seen in their income,” Yun noted. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.21 percent decline from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.1 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index dropped 0.4 percent. Germany’s DAX Index rose 0.1 percent. A YouGov poll showed that UK Prime Minister Theresa May could lose control of parliament in in next month’s election. When asked by a reporter if she would resign if she lost seats, May dodged the question, saying that the only poll that mattered was the election on June 8, Reuters reported.

"I absolutely disagree with the Administration" on its choice to pull out of the landmark accord on climate change, Dimon said in a statement Friday, "but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment." Dimon is one of many CEOs to serve as a member of the White House's Strategic and Policy Forum, and unlike SpaceX and Tesla entrepreneur Elon Musk and Disney head Bob Iger, he doesn't intend to leave that table, a spokesperson for JPMorgan confirmed with CNN Money. This isn't the first dust-up Dimon has endured as a member of the White House's business council. Facing critiques for his participation, he told shareholders at JPMorgan's annual meeting: "I’d try to help any President of the U.S. because I’m a patriot."

The lease is for 15 years, the Wall Street Journal reported. JPMorgan already has space there, but is expanding for FinTech, its financial technology arm, according to an earlier report from Bloomberg. The lease means the bank is expanding office space for its digital teams from 125,000 square feet to 428,000 square feet. Between 2,000 and 2,500 JPMorgan employees will eventually work at 5 Manhattan West, the bank said. The company has one floor, and will take three more in the new lease deal.

In return, companies must commit to bringing low- and mid-skill jobs to workers in challenged neighborhoods. “Access to capital is crucial for businesses in communities like Rochester and conventional small business loans can often times be hardest to get. This is especially true for many low-wealth entrepreneurs who wind up struggling and sometimes failing as a result of the lacking financial support,” said Matthew Tipple, market executive-middle market commercial banking at JPMorgan Chase. “We also know that small businesses are the primary drivers of job growth, contributing about two-thirds of all new jobs in the private sector. That’s why we support nonprofit organizations such as the Venture Jobs Foundation and programs such as the VJF Jobs Kitchen.” The program was announced at VJF’s annual Rochester Prosperity Conference. To learn more about the organization and its programs, visit www.venturejobs.org. “Broader access to professional resources and funding is critical to driving more inclusive economic growth in Rochester,” said Dennis DeLeo, VJF president and founder.  “We’re grateful to JP Morgan Chase for its support of the Jobs Kitchen program. This is a great next step toward getting local entrepreneurs started on the right foot to achieve the ultimate goal of job growth and prosperity in our community.” VJF makes impact investments in support of its charitable purpose, funding small businesses that will its capital to create jobs in higher poverty neighborhoods.

Bank stocks slid Wednesday after Bank of America and JPMorgan executives announced lower second-quarter trading revenues compared to last year. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman is now saying the same for his firm. “We all have similar clients, if not the same clients,” Gorman told Bloomberg in a video interview.  Trading revenue is expected to drop at least 10% in the second quarter at Morgan Stanley, Gorman said. This mirrors a 15% drop in trading revenue at JPMorgan which CFO Marianne Lake announced Wednesday at an investor conference. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan also said trading revenues would be lower. Those executives all point to lower volatility as a key factor for the lower revenues. Brexit and the surprise rise election of Donald Trump contributed to higher uncertainty and volatility in the markets in the summer of 2016, according to Gorman. “There is enormous uncertainty which typically would breed tremendous volatility and it’s not,” Gorman said. Economic growth at large is relatively strong, but business-friendly moves promised by Trump, like tax and healthcare reform, have not been implemented as quickly as Trump would have hoped. Normally, this type of political uncertainty would breed higher volatility but that hasn't happened yet, according to Gorman. "Right now, people are trying to unravel the conundrum where globally, the economic picture looks relatively robust," Gorman said. "[But] globally, the geopolitical picture looks relatively unstable. How does one trade in that environment?" Morgan Stanley shares have not moved much this year, and are trading 0.5% higher than the start of 2017. Shares closed Wednesday at $41.74.

Still, Dimon signalled he won’t follow Tesla Inc’s chief executive Elon Musk and Walt Disney’s CEO Bob Iger in quitting the council, which provides the president with advice on everything from tax reforms to employment and business policies. “I absolutely disagree with the Administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment,” Dimon said in an emailed statement. Trump said overnight he would withdraw the US from the global climate accord, saying it favours countries like China and India at the expense of American workers. He had campaigned on a pledge to exit the landmark accord that was one of the signature achievements of his predecessor Barack Obama, calling the agreement a “hoax.” “We are getting out, but we will start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal, and if we can, that’s great,” Trump said in televised remarks on Thursday. “And if we can’t, that’s fine.” While the withdrawal process will take years to unfold -- the earliest the US can extricate itself is in November 2020 -- Trump’s plan immediately drew condemnation from European allies and the captains of American industry. Lloyd Blankfein, chairman of Dimon’s competitor bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said on Tweeter that Trump’s decision was a “setback for the environment and for the US’s leadership position in the world.” General Electric’s CEO Jeff Immelt tweeted his disappointment with the decision. “Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government,” he tweeted. Tesla’s Musk said withdrawal from the accord was “not good for America or the world,” and announced he’s quitting Trump’s council, as did Disney’s Iger. That makes three members who have withdrawn from the task of providing advice to Trump. In February, Uber Technologies Inc’s CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick withdrew from the council, responding to the blowback from drivers and Uber riders who criticised Trump’s executive order on immigration. Besides Dimon, the other members who remain on Trump’s business advisory council include Blackstone Group LP’s CEO Stephen Schwarzman, PepsiCo’s CEO Indra Nooyi and General Motors Corp’s CEO Mary Barra.

In an emailed statement to CNBC, Dimon said, "I absolutely disagree with the Administration on this issue." He added, "But we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment." Win McNamee | Getty Images Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, speaks at the Economic Club of Washington September 12, 2016 in Washington, DC. Dimon is one of the CEOs to participate in White House councils and in his statement he did not indicate if he would remain in that post. On Thursday, Disney CEO Robert Iger said he quit the business advisory council over the decision, while Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also said he'll leave his positions on presidential councils. The president said he would start talks to re-enter the agreement, but with terms that he called a more "fair" deal to his country. His comment was rebuked by several European governments. Many business leaders in the U.S. said they were disappointed by, or disagreed with, the decision, including Apple chief Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. Last month, at JPMorgan's annual shareholder meeting, Dimon had urged the business community and the administration to work together to find meaningful solutions to critical issues confronting the U.S. In response to a question on Trump's tighter immigration policy, Dimon had said, "He is the president of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our plane. I would try to help any president of the United States because I am a patriot." — CNBC's Dawn Giel contributed to this report.

CNBC Here's how much we've spent in Apple's App Store Apple today revealed how much developers have earned through the App Store, and from this figure we can glean just how much users have spent on apps over the years. Apple announced developers have earned over $70 billion since the App Store went live in 2008. Taking the tech giant's 70/30 revenue split into account, that means customers have spent over $100 billion in App Store purchases. Apple didn't stop with an earnings number boast as it also revealed App Store downloads grew by over 70% in the past 12 months, and active paid subscriptions are up 58% since the same time last year.

The Nasdaq gained 0.78 percent, also posting a record high. The S&P 500 rose 0.76 percent to an all-time high, with materials and health care leading advancers. The health care sector reached its first 52-week high since March 15. Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy to have added 185,000 jobs last month. But David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said expectations may have increased in the market after a strong report from ADP and Moody's Analytics. The Thursday report said private payrolls surged by 253,000 in May, easily topping a consensus estimate of 185,000. "It was a very good, positive surprise. We've had a few negative surprises, so this is definitely against the current," said JPMorgan Funds' Kelly. "Overall, it says the economy is still moving along nicely." The report from ADP and Moody's is often seen as a preview to the U.S. government's nonfarm payrolls report, which is set for release Friday at 8:30 a.m.  Wall Street had a slew of data to digest Thursday, including weekly jobless claims, which came in at 248,000, above a forecast of 239,000. The ISM manufacturing index for May came in at 54.9, just below an estimate of 55.0. April construction spending fell 1.4 percent with economists forecasting a gain of 0.5 percent. Auto companies, meanwhile, released monthly vehicle sales throughout the day. Load Error The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq are coming off solid monthly performances in May. S&P and Nasdaq posted monthly gains of 1.16 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, while the Dow rose about a third of a percent on the back of a subdued volatility environment. The CBOE Volatility Index broke below 10 six times last month, hitting levels not seen in more than 20 years. "Investors worry that the relationship between decreasing volatility and increased purchases could morph from a virtuous cycle to self-fulfilling feedback frenzy, leading to a vicious, volatility induced selloff," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. "The extent of a potential downdraft depends on how large the risk-parity investment community is. It's widely believed that the mass of money managed under a risk-parity mandate remains small, although it's a trend worth watching," Ablin said in a note. Tech stocks were among the best performers as the sector continued to build on its stellar year-to-date gains. Tech has gained nearly 20 percent in 2017. By comparison, consumer discretionary, the second-best-performing sector, is up 12 percent. "Most of the growth has come from large-cap growth stocks," said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt. "It's still a momentum-driven market that's skeptical about cyclical land." In corporate news, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise slipped more than 5 percent after the firm reported a significant decline in quarterly sales. Marathon Petroleum approved an additional $3 billion to its shares repurchase program. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

April and May didn’t deliver Hugh Son, Laura J. Keller and Dakin Campbell, Bloomberg, Bloomberg News | June 1, 2017 | Last Updated: Jun 1 11:31 AM ET More from Bloomberg News Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo? More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Many crises could’ve erupted in the world during the second quarter, and then didn’t. That’s not necessarily good for Wall Street banks. Top executives at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are lamenting that there’s too little happening in the world to spur investors to buy and sell. Yet at the same time, there’s just enough uncertainty over geopolitics and U.S. tax reform to restrain corporate mergers and acquisitions. Remarks from those three banks’ leaders signal that almost a year of geopolitical turmoil that began with the U.K.’s surprise vote to exit the European Union, and then escalated with Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election, may be cooling. Wall Street had gorged as customers adjusted to every shock. Now it seems many are inured: Trump’s early morning tweets aren’t enough to keep trading desks buzzing. “Volatility hasn’t been that great actually — it’s made for a very tough slog,” Eric Wasserstrom, a banking analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. Still, “I don’t know if we really want to be rooting for political dislocation as something that really helps the investment banking community.” At JPMorgan, markets revenue tumbled about 15 percent in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a fixed-income slump, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told investors in New York on Wednesday morning. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10 percent to 12 percent lower, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said at another event that day. At Goldman, clients’ trading remains “subdued,” co-President David Solomon said. “There haven’t been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them,” Lake said. “As a sweeping generalization, low rates, a more cautious outlook on rates, and low volatility have led to low client flows and a generally quiet, subdued and challenging trading environment.” Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman indicated his firm is seeing similar trading declines. The estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different,” Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Beijing on Thursday. A lot hasn’t happened this quarter. Centrist Emmanuel Macron prevailed in France’s presidential election last month, heading off euro-skeptic Marine Le Pen and taking pressure off the currency bloc. Trump struggled to score major legislative victories. And while tensions escalated between the U.S. and North Korea, they didn’t veer into open warfare. Still, the trading doldrums described by bank executives on Wednesday caught their shareholders off guard. Goldman Sachs’s stock fell hardest, dropping 3.3 percent to the lowest since November, leading a decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Bank of America and JPMorgan both slid more than 2 percent. Investors were aware that volatility was muted but were expecting trading revenues to fall only about 5 percent from the year-earlier period, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a phone interview. “There’s just been no event this quarter” comparable with last year’s, such as Brexit, he said. The Federal Reserve’s meeting in June could provide fodder for bank clients, Cassidy said. Traders are expecting the Fed to outline how and when it plans to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. And futures prices indicate an 88 percent chance the Fed is poised to raise rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If either of those don’t go according to expectations, banks could jump on the opportunity to trade. In the first quarter, profits at several of the biggest U.S. banks trounced estimates, fueled by revenue from fixed-income sales and trading. Altogether, the five biggest U.S. banks took in 51 percent more from debt underwriting than a year earlier, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Fresh debts typically help spur trading in the secondary market. This quarter, new debt issuance has waned or stagnated in almost every major market. U.S. investment-grade bond underwriting declined 6.7 percent, European deals dropped 18 percent, and emerging-market bonds were flat through May 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even new loans — typically more desirable for investors when rates are rising because the interest they charge can adjust — declined globally by 28 percent, the data show. Equities trading — a business that’s been transforming into a lower-fee, largely electronic market — may hold up for banks this quarter even after the CBOE Volatility Index for the S&P 500 neared a record low in May. In Europe, revenue from cash equities is on pace to rise 18 percent from the first quarter, while dropping “slightly” in the U.S., JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients May 23. Still, revenue from stock derivatives will decline across regions, he said. JPMorgan’s Lake listed equities, especially corporate derivatives and prime brokerage, as an source of strength for the period. When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, uncertainties over European elections and U.S. tax reform have led companies to exercise caution, Solomon said. That’s despite steady growth and a competitive environment that encourages CEOs to act. As a result, Solomon said he expects a “reasonable pace” for deals. Gorman called the confluence of economic growth and political turmoil a “conundrum” for markets. “There is enormous uncertainty, which typically would breed tremendous volatility, and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have, and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” Even if turmoil — and thus trading — revives, the reward for many employees may be limited. Executives said they’re trying hard to keep a lid on costs. Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez put it like this alongside Solomon: “As revenue growth occurs, you should expect comp growth to lag.” Bloomberg’s Jenny Surane contributed.

The arrangement takes effect Jan. 1, Hilton said Thursday in a statement that didn’t disclose terms. AmEx shares had struggled after the company lost out to Citigroup in a bidding war for Costco Wholesale Corp.’s card portfolio and failed to renew its partnership with JetBlue Airways Corp. in 2015. The lender also has been buffeted by intensifying competition for its wealthy clients, prompting Chief Executive Officer Ken Chenault to shuffle top managers, boost spending on marketing and sweeten rewards to keep customers. Read more: Buffett says AmEx is up to the challenge from JPMorgan “This announcement is clearly positive for American Express as this breaks a string of defections,” Sanjay Sakhrani, a KBW analyst, said in a note to clients. “It also potentially signals a peak in the competitive intensity of these deals.” American Express climbed 0.7 percent to $77.46 at 11:29 a.m. in New York. The shares have gained 4.5 percent this year, compared with the 0.3 percent decline of the 65-company S&P 500 Financials Index. AmEx’s Starwood Preferred Guest card, which accounts for about 4 percent of the company’s loans and 2 percent of total spending, is at risk after Marriott International Inc.’s takeover of rival Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. Marriott has a co-brand deal with JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. credit-card lender, and Visa Inc., the world’s biggest payments network. Co-Brand Pressure The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up AmEx winning the Hilton portfolio takes some of the sting out of losing its agreement with Costco, a much bigger partnership that accounted for 20 percent of worldwide loans and 8 percent of card spending. The largest U.S. warehouse chain decided in 2015 to end its 16-year relationship with AmEx after the firms couldn’t agree on card fees. Last year, Citigroup became the exclusive credit-card issuer for the retailer. Citigroup said the terms of the Hilton deal didn’t make economic sense for a relatively small portfolio. Hilton represents about 1 percent of the bank’s $126.4 billion U.S. credit-card loans. “For over 15 years, Citi and Hilton enjoyed a terrific co-brand credit card partnership, however during negotiations it became clear that terms of exclusivity, given the relatively small size of the portfolio, were not economically viable,” Jud Linville, CEO of Citigroup’s global cards business, said in a phone interview. Citigroup intends to focus on "core" co-brand partners including Costco, American Airlines Group Inc. and AT&T Inc., he said. AmEx, Hilton Chenault said at an investor conference Thursday that the Hilton deal won’t have a material effect on earnings and probably won’t have any bearing on its chances of keeping the Starwood partnership. When Hilton opened the bidding for its co-brand portfolio a year and a half ago, it received “tremendous response” from issuers, said Mark Weinstein, global head of customer engagement, loyalty and partnerships at the hotel chain. Ultimately, it was AmEx’s focus on innovation that sold Hilton, he said, adding the hotelier has 63 million members in its Hilton Honors program. “We’re not announcing any new benefits at this time, but I think Hilton Honors members can look forward to new cardmember benefits,” said Denise Pickett, president of U.S. consumer services at American Express.

But it is not often that the seller is the central bank of a brutal, cash-strapped regime faced with protests; the buyer, a bulge-bracket American investment bank; and the size of the deal in the billions of dollars. A report in the Wall Street Journal on May 28th that Goldman Sachs had bought bonds with a face value of $2.8bn issued by Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, for 31 cents on the dollar (ie, for $865m) caused a stink. Julio Borges, an opposition politician and president of the National Assembly, lambasted Goldman on May 29th in an open letter to its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, for its decision to “aid and abet Venezuela’s dictatorial regime”. For all its sins, that regime has met its obligations to bondholders. Mr Borges vowed to advise future Venezuelan governments not to repay the bonds in question. Protesters gathered outside Goldman’s headquarters in New York. The bank acknowledged buying the bonds but said it had done so from a broker, not directly from the government, and invested because it believed that life in Venezuela would get better.

Nor is Venezuela the first dictatorship to give priority to debt service over providing necessities to its people. But one factor that has changed is the role of indices in directing investment. Just days before this transaction came to light, Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan minister now at Harvard, had argued that JPMorgan Chase should exclude Venezuelan-government bonds from the emerging-market bond indices it compiles. Investors, he alleged, were profiting from the suffering of Venezuelans by buying what he called “hunger bonds”. In some indices, such as JPMorgan’s EMBI+ or Morningstar’s “emerging-markets high-yield bond” one, Venezuelan-government and PDVSA bonds represent only a small slice of the portfolio (around 5%), but are so cheap they contribute nearly a fifth of yield. Bloomberg also includes Venezuelan bonds in its indices. But JPMorgan’s is the most widely quoted, and drew Mr Hausmann’s ire. Such indices serve both as a benchmark for active managers (ie, those that seek to beat an index for their investors) and to determine the allocation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) run by such firms as BlackRock or Vanguard. America’s largest ETF for emerging-market bonds is a BlackRock one with $11.6bn under management. It tracks a different JPMorgan index but holds nearly $275m-worth of Venezuelan bonds at current market prices, and derives over 10% of its total yield from them. Goldman’s big bet has drawn a lot of attention. But indexmakers, ETF providers, asset managers and, of course, their investors have all been happy to make money out of Venezuela’s unsavoury debt.

President Donald J. Trump is the 45th President of the United States. President Donald J. Trump being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on January 20th, 2017. President Trump addressed a joint session of Congress for the first time on February 28th, 2017. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump at The White House. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Bank stocks surged after Donald Trump was elected on the hopes that he would scale back some of President Obama's Wall Street reforms and boost the economy with a massive stimulus package. And even though Trump bashed Wall Street (and his opponent Hillary Clinton's ties to big banks) repeatedly during the campaign, Trump tapped several former Goldman Sachs employees for key posts in the White House. The two most notable were Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, who even stepped down as Goldman COO to take the job. So it seemed that it was nothing but blue skies ahead for financial stocks. It hasn't turned out that way. Goldman Sachs has fallen 11% so far in 2017. JPMorgan Chase has dropped 5%. Morgan Stanley's stock is down slightly too. Citigroup's stock is actually in the black, but it's only up 2% -- less than the broader market. What gives? Ironically enough, the stock market is currently in the midst of an unusually quiet stretch -- despite the fact that the environment in Washington is anything but calm and serene. The VIX, a measure of volatility often referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge is back to levels where it was trading at just before the market's brief freakout last month, when the Dow fell nearly 373 points following the Comey-Trump-Flynn allegations. And CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index, which includes the VIX and six other indicators of market sentiment, is currently stuck in Neutral territory. That's yet another sign of the typical Wall Street blahs during the start of the summer. To be sure, this is great news for most investors. Earnings in the first quarter were strong, thanks largely to solid results from big tech companies, many of whom disagree with Trump's stances on immigration and climate change. (So much for Trump being bad for Silicon Valley and good for Wall Street.) But volatility is often the best friend for big Wall Street firms. The lack of is posing to be a problem. JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Marianne Lake said at a Deutsche Bank investment conference Wednesday that trading volumes were down 15% from a year ago so far in the second quarter, mostly in its fixed income division. She referred to current conditions as a "quite subdued and challenging trading environment." Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, speaking at a Sanford C. Bernstein conference on Wednesday, said trading volumes are down 10% to 12% in second quarter. And Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told Bloomberg in an interview from Beijing that his firm was seeing similar trends in its trading division. Gorman said in the interview that the comments from Lake and Moynihan "are reflecting reality and I don't think we're very different." He added that "we all have similar clients, if not the same clients." Another issue for the big banks? Interest rates remain relatively low. More specifically, the difference between long-term and short-term bond rates is relatively narrow. That's known as a flat yield curve on Wall Street. And it's also not great news for banks. It makes their lending businesses less profitable. Both Lake and Moynihan acknowledged the flattening yield curve as another factor that is hurting their earnings. And the banks may not get much help from Trump in that department either -- or the Federal Reserve for that matter. Some thought that Trump's stimulus plan, which was expected to be funded partly through more government debt, would lift longer-term bond yields. But it's now unclear what Trump and Congress will be able to accomplish this year. Meanwhile. the Fed is likely to keep raising rates, but at a slow and gradual pace. All of this is, once again, could be great news for consumers and most investors. But it's not going to help Trump's friends on Wall Street.

The Nasdaq gained 0.78 percent, also posting a record high. The S&P 500 rose 0.76 percent to an all-time high, with materials and health care leading advancers. The health care sector reached its first 52-week high since March 15. Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy to have added 185,000 jobs last month. But David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said expectations may have increased in the market after a strong report from ADP and Moody's Analytics. The Thursday report said private payrolls surged by 253,000 in May, easily topping a consensus estimate of 185,000. "It was a very good, positive surprise. We've had a few negative surprises, so this is definitely against the current," said JPMorgan Funds' Kelly. "Overall, it says the economy is still moving along nicely." The report from ADP and Moody's is often seen as a preview to the U.S. government's nonfarm payrolls report, which is set for release Friday at 8:30 a.m.  Wall Street had a slew of data to digest Thursday, including weekly jobless claims, which came in at 248,000, above a forecast of 239,000. The ISM manufacturing index for May came in at 54.9, just below an estimate of 55.0. April construction spending fell 1.4 percent with economists forecasting a gain of 0.5 percent. Auto companies, meanwhile, released monthly vehicle sales throughout the day. Load Error The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq are coming off solid monthly performances in May. S&P and Nasdaq posted monthly gains of 1.16 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, while the Dow rose about a third of a percent on the back of a subdued volatility environment. The CBOE Volatility Index broke below 10 six times last month, hitting levels not seen in more than 20 years. "Investors worry that the relationship between decreasing volatility and increased purchases could morph from a virtuous cycle to self-fulfilling feedback frenzy, leading to a vicious, volatility induced selloff," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. "The extent of a potential downdraft depends on how large the risk-parity investment community is. It's widely believed that the mass of money managed under a risk-parity mandate remains small, although it's a trend worth watching," Ablin said in a note. Tech stocks were among the best performers as the sector continued to build on its stellar year-to-date gains. Tech has gained nearly 20 percent in 2017. By comparison, consumer discretionary, the second-best-performing sector, is up 12 percent. "Most of the growth has come from large-cap growth stocks," said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt. "It's still a momentum-driven market that's skeptical about cyclical land." In corporate news, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise slipped more than 5 percent after the firm reported a significant decline in quarterly sales.

And even though Trump bashed Wall Street (and his opponent Hillary Clinton’s ties to big banks) repeatedly during the campaign, Trump tapped several former Goldman Sachs employees for key posts in the White House. The two most notable were Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, who even stepped down as Goldman COO to take the job. So it seemed that it was nothing but blue skies ahead for financial stocks. It hasn’t turned out that way. Goldman Sachs has fallen 11% so far in 2017. JPMorgan Chase has dropped 5%. Morgan Stanley’s stock is down slightly too. Citigroup’s stock is actually in the black, but it’s only up 2% — less than the broader market. What gives? Ironically enough, the stock market is currently in the midst of an unusually quiet stretch — despite the fact that the environment in Washington is anything but calm and serene. The VIX, a measure of volatility often referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge is back to levels where it was trading at just before the market’s brief freakout last month, when the Dow fell nearly 373 points following the Comey-Trump-Flynn allegations. And CNNMoney’s Fear & Greed Index, which includes the VIX and six other indicators of market sentiment, is currently stuck in Neutral territory. That’s yet another sign of the typical Wall Street blahs during the start of the summer. To be sure, this is great news for most investors. Earnings in the first quarter were strong, thanks largely to solid results from big tech companies, many of whom disagree with Trump’s stances on immigration and climate change. (So much for Trump being bad for Silicon Valley and good for Wall Street.) But volatility is often the best friend for big Wall Street firms. The lack of is posing to be a problem. JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Marianne Lake said at a Deutsche Bank investment conference Wednesday that trading volumes were down 15% from a year ago so far in the second quarter, mostly in its fixed income division. She referred to current conditions as a “quite subdued and challenging trading environment.” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, speaking at a Sanford C. Bernstein conference on Wednesday, said trading volumes are down 10% to 12% in second quarter. And Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told Bloomberg in an interview from Beijing that his firm was seeing similar trends in its trading division. Gorman said in the interview that the comments from Lake and Moynihan “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different.” He added that “we all have similar clients, if not the same clients.” Another issue for the big banks? Interest rates remain relatively low. More specifically, the difference between long-term and short-term bond rates is relatively narrow. That’s known as a flat yield curve on Wall Street. And it’s also not great news for banks. It makes their lending businesses less profitable. Both Lake and Moynihan acknowledged the flattening yield curve as another factor that is hurting their earnings. And the banks may not get much help from Trump in that department either — or the Federal Reserve for that matter. Some thought that Trump’s stimulus plan, which was expected to be funded partly through more government debt, would lift longer-term bond yields. But it’s now unclear what Trump and Congress will be able to accomplish this year. Meanwhile. the Fed is likely to keep raising rates, but at a slow and gradual pace. All of this is, once again, could be great news for consumers and most investors. But it’s not going to help Trump’s friends on Wall Street.

Barclays Plc reached a long-term target for shrinking its stake in its African unit earlier than expected as the bank boosted the size of a share sale by more than 50%. The London-based lender is selling 285.7 million shares of Barclays Africa Group, equal to a 33.7% stake, at R132 each, it said in a statement on Thursday. The bank previously planned to sell a 22% stake and said it boosted the size of the offering “due to strong investor demand.” The sale will raise about R37.7 billion ($2.9 billion) and is part of plans by chief executive officer Jes Staley, 60, to reduce the lender’s presence on the continent in favor of supporting a trimmed-down investment bank focused on London and New York. The British bank, which has had a presence on the continent for more than 100 years, first bought a controlling stake in the Johannesburg-based lender in 2005 when it was still called Absa Group. The placement accelerates Barclays’s plan to gradually sell down its stake and deconsolidate the unit from its accounts, releasing capital that can be invested elsewhere in the business. Barclays had initially paid $5.4 billion for a 60% holding. That stake increased to more than 62% in 2013 as part of a reshuffle that saw Absa take over Barclays’s operations in eight African countries. JPMorgan upgrade The Public Investment Corporation, South Africa’s largest money manager, will buy a 7% stake in Barclays Africa as part of the sale once it has obtained regulatory approvals, the Johannesburg-based lender said in an emailed statement. That will help cut the stake held by Barclays, which currently owns 50.1%, to 16.4%. The British lender’s stake will drop to 15% — reaching its target level and allowing the bank to deconsolidate the unit from its capital calculations — after the completion of a transaction aimed at boosting the participation of black investors in Barclays Africa, it said. Barclays shares jumped 2% to 214.1 pence at 8:16am in London. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Raul Sinha upgraded their rating on Barclays shares to overweight following the larger sale, saying it narrowed the firm’s gap to peers on capital ratios and could provide the ability to boost dividends. The securities are being sold at an almost 10% discount to Barclays Africa’s closing price on Tuesday. Barclays Africa rose 2.4% to R142.32 in Johannesburg after tumbling 4.8% on Wednesday. Second sale The second sale follows the disposal of a 12.2% stake to fund managers in South Africa and abroad in May 2016. The latest phase was said to have been delayed after South African President Jacob Zuma fired Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan at the end of March, replacing him with Malusi Gigaba. Gordhan had given provisional approval to a separation agreement that involves the UK lender paying its subsidiary 765 million pounds ($987 million). Deconsolidating Barclays Africa and including the proceeds from the sale will boost Barclays’s common equity Tier 1 ratio, the key measure of capital strength, by at least 0.73 percentage point, the lender said. The share placement is being coordinated by Barclays itself, aided by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS Group, according to the statement. Barclays can’t sell any more Barclays Africa stock for 90 days after the latest placement is settled, a provision known as a lock-up restriction.

Darren Boey Morgan Stanley reported $1.71 billion in first-quarter revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities. Photo: Bloomberg Hong Kong: Morgan Stanley chief executive officer James Gorman indicated his firm is seeing similar trading declines as competitors JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., which said second-quarter trading revenue is on pace to drop at least 10%. The estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different,” Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Tom Mackenzie in Beijing. “We all have similar clients, if not the same clients.” Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15% in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income, chief financial officer Marianne Lake said on Wednesday at an investor conference in New York. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10% to 12% lower, though first-half results should be stronger, chief executive officer Brian Moynihan said at a separate event. Analysts at JPMorgan warned this month that revenue at the world’s biggest investment banks is likely to drop in the second quarter because of the decline in fixed income. The UK’s exit from the European Union and US President Donald Trump’s surprise election win had been fuelling wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading results. Those types of stimulants have been more scarce in recent months. Passive investors Gorman said markets are facing a “conundrum,” with economic growth generally strong but the world facing an uncertain political environment. Trump’s administration has faced resistance in pushing an ambitious agenda of tax overhaul and repealing Obamacare, he said. “There is enormous uncertainty which typically would breed tremendous volatility and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” In April, Morgan Stanley reported $1.71 billion in first-quarter revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities, allowing it to beat bigger rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for the first time since 2011. After concluding that new rules had permanently impaired the outlook for fixed-income markets, Morgan Stanley moved last year to slash a quarter of its sales and trading staff and sold large chunks of its commodities business. The results marked the fourth straight quarter Morgan Stanley posted bond-trading revenue exceeding $1 billion after Gorman said the business could produce at least $4 billion annually. The fixed-income division—crucial to the CEO’s plan to improve company-wide returns—was overhauled after revenue plunged to $550 million in the final quarter of 2015. Trading chief Ted Pick cut about 25% of the division’s staff and assigned equities executive Sam Kellie-Smith to turn around the business. Asked if he saw further scope for headcount reduction at the bank, Gorman said: “I don’t think so.” “The basic reshaping of the firm that has taken place over five to eight years is essentially done and we feel good about it,” he said.

That’s not necessarily good for Wall Street banks. Top executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are lamenting that there’s too little happening in the world to spur investors to buy and sell. Yet at the same time, there’s just enough uncertainty over geopolitics and U.S. tax reform to restrain corporate mergers and acquisitions. Remarks from those three banks’ leaders signal that almost a year of geopolitical turmoil that began with the U.K.’s surprise vote to exit the European Union, and then escalated with Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election, may be cooling. Wall Street had gorged as customers adjusted to every shock. Now it seems many are inured: Trump’s early morning tweets aren’t enough to keep trading desks buzzing. “Volatility hasn’t been that great actually -- it’s made for a very tough slog,” Eric Wasserstrom, a banking analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. Still, “I don’t know if we really want to be rooting for political dislocation as something that really helps the investment banking community.” ‘Idiosyncratic Events’ At JPMorgan, markets revenue tumbled about 15 percent in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a fixed-income slump, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told investors in New York on Wednesday morning. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10 percent to 12 percent lower, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said at another event that day. At Goldman, clients’ trading remains “subdued,” co-President David Solomon said. “There haven’t been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them,” Lake said. “As a sweeping generalization, low rates, a more cautious outlook on rates, and low volatility have led to low client flows and a generally quiet, subdued and challenging trading environment.” Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman indicated his firm is seeing similar trading declines. The estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different,” Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Beijing on Thursday. A lot hasn’t happened this quarter. Centrist Emmanuel Macron prevailed in France’s presidential election last month, heading off euro-skeptic Marine Le Pen and taking pressure off the currency bloc. Trump struggled to score major legislative victories. And while tensions escalated between the U.S. and North Korea, they didn’t veer into open warfare. Read more: Stress-free markets in calmest run since 2014 Still, the trading doldrums described by bank executives on Wednesday caught their shareholders off guard. Goldman Sachs’s stock fell hardest, dropping 3.3 percent to the lowest since November, leading a decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Bank of America and JPMorgan both slid more than 2 percent. Investors were aware that volatility was muted but were expecting trading revenues to fall only about 5 percent from the year-earlier period, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a phone interview.  “There’s just been no event this quarter” comparable with last year’s, such as Brexit, he said. The Federal Reserve’s meeting in June could provide fodder for bank clients, Cassidy said. Traders are expecting the Fed to outline how and when it plans to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. And futures prices indicate an 88 percent chance the Fed is poised to raise rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If either of those don’t go according to expectations, banks could jump on the opportunity to trade. Underwriting Down In the first quarter, profits at several of the biggest U.S. banks trounced estimates, fueled by revenue from fixed-income sales and trading. Altogether, the five biggest U.S. banks took in 51 percent more from debt underwriting than a year earlier, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Fresh debts typically help spur trading in the secondary market. This quarter, new debt issuance has waned or stagnated in almost every major market. U.S. investment-grade bond underwriting declined 6.7 percent, European deals dropped 18 percent, and emerging-market bonds were flat through May 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even new loans -- typically more desirable for investors when rates are rising because the interest they charge can adjust -- declined globally by 28 percent, the data show.

Sign Up Equities trading -- a business that’s been transforming into a lower-fee, largely electronic market -- may hold up for banks this quarter even after the CBOE Volatility Index for the S&P 500 neared a record low in May. In Europe, revenue from cash equities is on pace to rise 18 percent from the first quarter, while dropping “slightly” in the U.S., JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients May 23. Still, revenue from stock derivatives will decline across regions, he said. Read more: Banks’ bond-trading boom to end, JPMorgan says JPMorgan’s Lake listed equities, especially corporate derivatives and prime brokerage, as an source of strength for the period. When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, uncertainties over European elections and U.S. tax reform have led companies to exercise caution, Solomon said. That’s despite steady growth and a competitive environment that encourages CEOs to act. As a result, Solomon said he expects a “reasonable pace” for deals. Gorman called the confluence of economic growth and political turmoil a “conundrum” for markets. “There is enormous uncertainty, which typically would breed tremendous volatility, and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have, and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” Even if turmoil -- and thus trading -- revives, the reward for many employees may be limited. Executives said they’re trying hard to keep a lid on costs. Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez put it like this alongside Solomon: “As revenue growth occurs, you should expect comp growth to lag.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Even the names of nearby boat basins were reminders of Britain’s lost empire and postwar decline: the West and East India docks. George Iacobescu arrived in 1988, sent to oversee what at the time seemed like a bold, verging-on-insane idea: the creation of a financial district that would supplant the winding lanes and low-slung stone of the City, London’s traditional banking hub. Maintaining the City’s historical character and its views of St. Paul’s Cathedral made building skyscrapers there all but impossible then. Canary Wharf, as the development would be called, would offer bright, modern office towers and cutting-edge telecommunications, allowing London to compete with New York as a center of global finance. For the first few years, Canary Wharf looked like a colossal failure. Then, in the late 1990s, it began taking off, slowly at first and soon with dizzying speed—transformed, like London as a whole, by the power of international finance. On the 30th floor of its tallest skyscraper, Romanian-born Iacobescu, now the chief executive officer of Canary Wharf Group Plc, beams with pride as he surveys his domain, where 100,000 workers arrive every weekday at Chevron, HSBC, Intel, and JPMorgan Chase, among others. In an adjacent room, a forest of architectural models the size of small children shows its 16 million square feet of towers, malls, and underground rail links. Iacobescu gravitates to one in particular, illustrating the plans for a new district under construction east of the original site. Canary Wharf has changed so much that now people want to live there, and its tallest building will be residential. “The Chinese look at Canary Wharf and they say, ‘This is how cities should work,’ ” Iacobescu boasts. “The world wants to come here.” Perhaps, though, not as much as it did a little more than a year ago. The city that breathed life into Canary Wharf faces a fight for its future. Last June pollsters and investors confidently ruled out the possibility that British voters would decide to leave the European Union. The morning after 52 percent of them rebuked everything Canary Wharf stands for by voting to leave, the pound plunged to its lowest level in 30 years. By 9 a.m., Prime Minister David Cameron had announced his resignation. Within weeks, banks such as Goldman Sachs Group and JPMorgan were weighing how many staff they would have to relocate to Frankfurt or Dublin, threatening the engine of London’s $490 billion economy. Airlines slashed flights, universities reported plunging European applications, and—truly shocking—house prices slid. Its economic foundations under assault, the idea that London could ever, as then-Mayor Boris Johnson suggested in 2012, be the “capital of the world” sounded suddenly like a bad joke. At the rate things were going, the city would be lucky to even stay the capital of the United Kingdom if the Scots made good on renewed threats to secede. And that was before a pair of recent terror attacks—a March vehicle assault on Westminster Bridge and a suicide bomb on May 22 at Manchester Arena, which killed 22 people—gave London another reason to be on edge. “The Chinese look at Canary Wharf and they say, ‘This is how cities should work’ ” But while the ubiquity of the “Keep Calm and Carry On” mantra may have diluted the brand a little, that’s exactly what London is doing. A loose grouping of London business and political leaders has coalesced to make the case that with the right mix of policies, the city’s economy can thrive despite Brexit. Earlier this year, TheCityUK, the main lobbying group for the all-important financial industry, called leaving the EU “a once-in-a-generation opportunity” to reorient trade and investment links to new markets. Mayor Sadiq Khan is using the tumult to try to wrest more autonomy over transport, infrastructure, and perhaps even immigration. And the booming tech sector is pushing to turn the crisis into an opportunity to overhaul regulations to make the U.K. the preferred jurisdiction for testing uncharted inventions. Those plans are taking shape in an environment of continued political turbulence. Cameron’s Conservative Party successor, Theresa May, is fighting an unexpectedly fierce battle in the June 8 general election against Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. After a series of missteps by May and her advisers—including a perceived U-turn on a key plank of her party’s manifesto on social care—her once seemingly unassailable lead is under threat as voters fret about her ability to deliver a “strong and stable” Britain. M by Montcalm, a hotel near the Silicon Roundabout. Photographer: Barry Lewis/In Pictures/Getty Images May is still expected to win a majority of seats, and whatever the U.K.’s immediate political future, economic apocalypse is nowhere in sight. More skyscrapers are under construction than ever, and residential asking prices have hit a record. Amazon.com, Facebook, and Google have announced major expansions of their London footprints since last summer, the latter becoming a principal tenant in a massive redevelopment of the once slightly seedy King’s Cross neighborhood. Next year the ribbon will be cut on the Elizabeth Line, or Crossrail, a 13-mile, ultrahigh-capacity express subway linking Heathrow to the heart of the city and beyond. The airport itself is midway through an ambitious expansion, with shiny new terminals largely complete and a long-contested third runway finally moving forward. Indeed, what some supporters of the “Remain” camp warned of seems to be coming to pass: The places likeliest to suffer badly from Brexit are the U.K.’s troubled industrial heartlands, regions that overwhelmingly supported leaving but have far less ability to adapt to its effects than the dynamic capital. London “has a global and particularly European competitive advantage that has been built over decades,” says John McFarlane, the chairman of banking group Barclays Plc. “It cannot be replicated easily in other centers.” It’s impossible to overstate the intensity of the U.K.’s ties with the rest of Europe, and those pulling for London still have deep concerns about what’s to come. Nonetheless, as Iacobescu’s experience at Canary Wharf shows, the global metropolis that’s contemporary London didn’t just spring fully formed from the damp Thames clay. It had to be made, by people, capital, and policies. That means it can be remade, too. By the turn of the 21st century, London was the economic center of Europe. Ambitious Scandinavian bankers, German architects, and Italian lawyers arrived in droves, able to move to the U.K. without so much as filling out a form, thanks to the EU’s free-movement rules. At one point, Mayor Johnson claimed there were a quarter-million French citizens in the capital, more than in the city of Bordeaux. It’s not exactly verifiable, but the fact that many Europeans accepted it as received wisdom served as further evidence of London’s dominance. At the same time, the city prospered from the expansion of emerging markets. It was where the multiplying elites from Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and elsewhere came to spend their money, educate their children, start fashion lines, and occasionally race their custom Lamborghinis through the streets of Knightsbridge. As its internationalization intensified, the city came increasingly unmoored from the country as a whole, as if it had achieved escape velocity from the very idea of national borders. Many businesspeople use the U.K. “as a place to do business from, not necessarily to do business in,” says John Browne, former CEO of BP Plc, who now leads a Russian-backed global investment fund from offices in—where else?—London. The city’s success had many ingredients. The English language helped, as did a legal system of impartial courts and enforceable contracts, elite universities, and a tolerant attitude toward foreigners that dates back centuries. (It was London that gave Karl Marx a place from which to unpack capitalism’s evils after Germany, Belgium, and France expelled him.) Less talked about, but essential, is a degree of semi-deliberate government indifference to the precise sources of money flowing in from Moscow, the Middle East, and elsewhere—a stance unimaginable in the more prosecutorial U.S. That’s made investing in London far more attractive to emerging-country oligarchs eager to avoid taking chances with the IRS and U.S. Department of Justice. Despite London’s global appeal, the U.K.’s European status also has offered huge advantages. The EU is the destination for almost half of U.K. exports and the source of the same proportion of foreign direct investment. EU law allows a bank established in any member state to operate freely in any of the others, an advantage that U.S. and Asian lenders used to locate their European headquarters overwhelmingly in the U.K. Despite being outside the euro zone, the City came to dominate the market for euro-denominated derivatives, worth hundreds of billions of dollars daily, and to rival New York as the heart of investment banking and trading of all kinds. Just a mile up the road, a tech sector clustered around the ugly junction half-jokingly called Silicon Roundabout thrived as well, sustained by City investment and workers from throughout Europe and beyond. The victory of the nationalist Brexit campaign seemed to put all this at risk. How great a risk is hard to say. Some financial jobs will almost certainly have to relocate to meet EU regulatory requirements, depending on the shape of a final settlement with Brussels, and banks are making contingency plans. Estimates range from as few as 4,000 or so, according to management consultant Oliver Wyman, to a worst-case scenario of 232,000 detailed by Xavier Rolet, CEO of the London Stock Exchange Group, in January to a parliamentary committee. In other words, no one has a clue. “A place to do business from, not necessarily to do business in” How can London be saved from the worst predictions? As it happens, in addition to the Little England fantasies of cream teas and village cricket with which the “Leave” vote was often associated, there was always a liberal vision for Brexit, espoused by Johnson and others. The plan was a form of doubling down. Broadly, it entailed making the post-EU U.K. a sort of giant, cold Singapore—rabidly pro-capital, lightly taxed, and hospitable to innovation. The Brexit twist: a focus on connecting tightly to emerging markets. Within the EU, the U.K. benefited from the bloc’s network of trade agreements but was prohibited from negotiating any on its own. Now, the slightly wishful theory goes, it can do so with enthusiasm and speed—while winning a post-Brexit deal that preserves access to the EU’s huge economy. May began earlier this year to at least pay lip service to this notion of “Global Britain” and got away with it, despite the apparent desire of half the country’s citizens for exactly the opposite, in part by stoking a bit of indirect nostalgia for the bygone age of empire. Speaking in January to top-tier investors and CEOs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, she pledged to make the U.K. “the strongest and most forceful advocate for business, free markets, and free trade anywhere in the world.” If May follows through, implementing that vision shouldn’t, theoretically, be too difficult. The U.K. has a highly centralized system of government in which American-style gridlock is a virtual impossibility. Within reason, what the prime minister wants, she gets. Her government has already hinted that if it receives an unfavorable deal in negotiations with Brussels, it could retaliate by slashing its corporate tax rate—which at 19 percent is already far lower than those of the U.S., France, and Germany—to poach companies from neighboring countries. The U.K. has a track record of this sort of thing. Fiat Chrysler, Liberty Global, Aon, and other businesses, attracted by low taxes, have relocated operations to London in recent years. City Hall, the “glass gonad.” Photographer: Dinendra Haria/REX/Shutterstock One of the architects of London’s emergence as a financial capital is among those urging May to make some version of Global Britain a reality. Lord Nigel Lawson of Blaby, now 85 and ensconced in the oak-paneled sanctum of the House of Lords, oversaw the “Big Bang”—the U.K.’s sudden move to deregulate financial services—as chancellor of the Exchequer under Margaret Thatcher. He figured that a gradual removal of rules that benefited incumbents would foment too much opposition, so the decision was made to implement the changes on a single day in October 1986. It opened up the London Stock Exchange, previously run something like a not-very-lively gentlemen’s club, to a rush of overseas capital and brainpower. Sitting in an overstuffed red leather chair in one of the Palace of Westminster’s ubiquitous private bars, morning sun streaming in from the Thames through tall, neo-Gothic windows, Lawson advocates a similarly aggressive approach for prospering from Brexit. He rejects the charge that he’s anti-European; after all, he says, he lives most of the time at his country estate in southwest France, flying in to Heathrow for Lords debates. “London’s success owes nothing whatever to being in the European Union,” Lawson says, as if it should be obvious, but rather to “this huge collection of expertise” in finance and related industries that he argues will never pick up and go. The picture he paints of post-Brexit Britain is of a nation shorn of unhelpful multilateral entanglements, with “complete autonomy over our tax system,” which “should be, en principe, a low-tax system.” He speaks optimistically of restructuring immigration to remove the current distinction whereby bricklayers from Slovenia face no visa restrictions, yet American Ph.D.s must fill out miles of forms and cross their fingers—treating “citizens from anywhere in the world on an equal basis.” And proving the notion that to scratch a Brexiteer is to quickly uncover fond memories of the last time there was such a thing as Global Britain, Lawson says that as Europe’s economy stagnates, “it’s the emerging world which is really going places. And a large part of the emerging world is the former empire”—India, Nigeria, Malaysia, and so on, with which Britain still enjoys close cultural and political ties. Indeed, there’s an argument to be made that the emerging economies need London as a stable venue for making deals and protecting assets. For its part, TheCityUK has suggested reimagining trade deals to focus on the sale of services, which the U.K. exports in spades, rather than just goods, which are less important to its economy. Another possibility being floated in the City: scrapping or loosening the EU-imposed cap on bonuses for bankers. Limiting windfalls to twice a person’s fixed pay, the gap is understandably unpopular there. The tech industry has also been active. In December a collection of local players, including Skype co-founder Niklas Zennstrom and Sonali De Rycker of venture capital company Accel, wrote an open letter to May calling on her to preserve maximum access to the EU’s “single market” and to provide automatic visas for tech graduates as part of a post-Brexit immigration strategy. The group had other, more unusual suggestions. The most eye-catching was that the U.K. should engage in “regulatory arbitrage” for technologies such as drones and blockchain. In the words of Mattias Ljungman of venture firm Atomico, which he co-founded with Zennstrom, the country could use its nimble system of government to become a “neutral zone” for testing ideas that other places restrict. There are some indications this is already happening. The U.K.’s main financial watchdog has created a “regulatory sandbox” that allows fintech firms to do real-world tests of products that normal rules might not allow. And Amazon is conducting trials of its delivery-by-drone program near Cambridge after complaining the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration wasn’t moving fast enough to change American flight rules. The task of marshaling these forces has fallen to Mayor Khan. The 46-year-old’s biography couldn’t be further from the usual Eton-and-Oxbridge CV of British politics. His parents were immigrants from Pakistan who raised Khan and his seven siblings in public housing. After university he became a lawyer, working on racial discrimination and police brutality cases, before entering Parliament in 2005. Last year he became the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital. Khan is often discussed as a future prime minister, and his political standing is in direct contrast to his physical presence. He’s quite short, and the navy blue suits he wears—always without a tie—as an unvarying uniform can look at least half a size too big. At one recent event, a photo op with high school students who towered over him, Khan’s dark-brown leather belt was cinched to the sixth notch. The mayor’s first year at City Hall, a riverside orb that Johnson dubbed “the glass gonad,” has been consumed by the fallout of the referendum. Like a lawyer making arguments before an all-powerful judge, he’s relentlessly made the case to business leaders not to give up on London and sought to counter the Britain-first message of Brexit with a nonstop calendar of speeches, international trade missions, and slickly produced ads showing off the city’s diversity. There’s substance behind the marketing blitz. To protect London’s appeal, Khan is pursuing even more heavy-duty infrastructure, including Crossrail 2, another massive rail line through the heart of the city. He’s also suggested the creation of a “London visa,” whereby a foreigner with a job offer from a local company could be given permission to live and work in the capital and not elsewhere. That’s not as crazy as it sounds. Canada and Australia have regional visa policies for some migrants. And it’s hard to argue with the idea’s inherent logic. Unlike much of the rest of the country, diverse London has no problem with newcomers. What these prescriptions for a vibrant metropolis all share is a focus on talent, a conviction that London can’t hope to succeed without brainy immigrants. Politically, that happens to be the most difficult item on the wish list to deliver. The Brexit vote was widely interpreted by politicians as a backlash against immigration, and May has said repeatedly that gaining control of the borders—i.e., ending freedom of movement for European citizens—is a nonnegotiable red line for her government in talks with its European counterparts. What will replace the open-door policy is anyone’s guess. So, too, is the evolution of the current, less permissive system for non-EU workers. While May in January said that “openness to international talent must remain one of this country’s most distinctive assets,” she’s not a likely candidate to champion a relaxed approach. In her previous role as home secretary, she was the public face of a pledge, never fulfilled but recently reiterated as Conservative policy, to reduce annual inflows to the “tens of thousands.” Despite pleas from business groups and members of her own party, she’s also refused to formally guarantee that EU citizens already in the U.K., who number in the millions, will be able to stay—even though no one realistically expects any other outcome. “If you really want to understand what’s behind the success of London, it’s that the city is a powerful magnet for international talent. It’s all based on people,” says Gregor Irwin, the chief economist at political consultant Global Counsel. Politicians who want to preserve that will have to contend, he says, “with a prime minister who’s still hellbent on bringing down the overall numbers.” Free trade and a permissive attitude to technological disruption weren’t what, say, underemployed pipe fitters in Stoke-on-Trent had in mind when they voted for Brexit. Telling them the country must continue to prioritize the interests of footloose international capital to prosper is a lot to ask of May, who leans more populist than many Conservatives. Perhaps more daunting, a swashbuckling, neo-Elizabethan vision of a Britain dedicated to conquering new markets ignores that U.K. companies have prioritized the giant bloc on their doorstep for decades. As an alternative, reorienting the economy toward emerging markets would mean “a quantum shift in terms of our trade strategy,” says Martin Sorrell, CEO of London-based advertising giant WPP Plc. If the U.K. loses its links to the EU and fails to develop ones with other regions, the risk is that “we become an isolated island instead of a connected one,” he says. As London’s business elites weigh how to sell politicians on their vision, what they view as sensible economic policy can feel hard to reconcile with the demands of an angry populace. On a chilly early March evening, a crowd of bankers, corporate executives, and diplomats filed past a military string ensemble in formal red uniforms as a crier in an elaborate sash shouted entering guests’ names. The occasion was the annual Business and Investment Dinner at Mansion House, the City’s ceremonial heart—a Palladian pile that since the 1700s has been where deals are struck, successes are celebrated, and postprandial port is passed to the diner on one’s left. “The pound is down,” began the grace as guests sat down to smoked-and-peppered mackerel terrine. But “stocks are up, so let us be thankful as we sup.” As dinner moved on past the roast rib-eye served with mushroom panna cotta and a full-bodied 2001 Pessac-Léognan, Lord Mayor Andrew Parmley, the City’s official leader, rose to address the subject on everyone’s mind. Next to him was Business Secretary Greg Clark, a member of May’s cabinet responsible for economic policy, representing the national government. “Free trade, ambition, openness to new ideas, techniques, and talent,” Parmley recited, glancing occasionally at his neighbor. “They can power the future success of what is, what has always been, and indeed in my opinion always will be, the world’s greatest city.” It was meant as a confident affirmation of the obvious. Instead, it sounded a little like a plea. Canary Wharf. Photographer: Incamerastock/Alamy Stock Photo At Canary Wharf, Iacobescu talks up London’s advantages with the zeal of a convert, which he is—before he arrived, he lived in Toronto and then New York, helping build the World Financial Center. “Why are all the institutions here?” he asks. “Because of the language, because of the regulatory regime, because of the time zone, because of the infrastructure, because of the know-how. All these things haven’t disappeared.” Banks and companies that depend on them, he says, have no intention of abandoning a city that helped make them rich. Yet even the optimism of a man whose job it is to sell London to the world has its limits. As Iacobescu circumnavigates his largest architectural model of the district, reciting from memory the addresses of companies such as Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and American Express, one tower makes him wince slightly: the European Medicines Agency, the EU equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a major Canary Wharf tenant. Like every other EU institution with a U.K. presence, it will almost surely soon depart, perhaps for Milan, perhaps Copenhagen. It’s a small example of an important reality: If London is no longer the “gateway to Europe,” he says, losing growth to Frankfurt, Paris, or New York is inevitable. While Iacobescu believes in London as much as anyone, he concedes that without enlightened leadership, its strengths may not be enough to overcome harsh political reality. “London is a great city,” he says. “But the effort should be to keep it the capital of the world.” —With Stephen Morris   Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Hugh SonDakin Campbell Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15% in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income. Photo: Bloomberg New York: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America, the two biggest US banks, said June-quarter trading revenue is on pace to drop at least 10% because tranquil markets are curbing demand. Bank shares slid after the revenue updates and led the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower. Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15% in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income, chief financial officer Marianne Lake said Wednesday at an investor conference in New York. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10% to 12% lower, though first-half results should be stronger, chief executive officer Brian Moynihan said at a separate event. A top Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive agreed that clients’ trading remains “subdued,” while, on Thursday in Beijing, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman indicated his firm is seeing a similar trend. Analysts at JPMorgan warned this month that revenue at the world’s biggest investment banks is likely to drop in the second quarter because of the decline in fixed income. The UK’s exit from the European Union and Donald Trump’s surprise election win had been fuelling wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading results. Those types of stimulants have been more scarce in recent months. “There haven’t been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them,” Lake said. “As a sweeping generalization, low rates, a more cautious outlook on rates, and low volatility have led to low client flows and a generally quiet, subdued and challenging trading environment.” In rates trading, clients are cautious because of conflicting signs from unemployment and inflation data, Lake said. In corporate bonds, “people have cash but no conviction” as spreads are tight, she said. Equities, corporate derivatives and the prime brokerage were sources of strength in the quarter, she said. “Client activities, which were more subdued in the first (March) quarter, have in these first two months, continued in a comparable fashion in the second (June) quarter,” David Solomon, Goldman Sachs’s co-president, said at the same conference, declining to project the impact on the firm’s revenue. Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 3.3% to a six-month low of $211.26 in New York on Wednesday, while JPMorgan slid 2.1% to $82.15. The pair were the day’s worst performers in the Dow. Bank of America, which isn’t in the index, dropped 2.2% to $22.41. At JPMorgan, the last three quarters of 2016 generated record trading revenue, so the comparisons this year are harder for traders to live up to, Lake said. “If I look to June, I don’t see any particular reason for that to change,” Lake said. “But anything can happen in a month.” Speaking to Bloomberg Television in Beijing on Thursday, Morgan Stanley’s Gorman said the estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America reflect the reality in the present trading environment. “I don’t think we’re very different,” he said. “We all have similar clients, if not the same clients.” “There is enormous uncertainty which typically would breed tremendous volatility and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, uncertainties over European elections and US tax reform have led corporate executives to be cautious, Solomon said. That’s despite steady growth and a competitive environment that encourages CEOs to act. As a result, he expects a “reasonable pace” for deals, and said the environment has felt a little better in the past month or two than it did earlier in the year. Separately, analysts also asked about expense discipline. Goldman Sachs chief financial officer Marty Chavez, speaking at the same event as Solomon, told investors that when the firm’s revenue does climb, compensation will rise at a slower rate. Bank of America will take a charge of about $300 million to speed up data-center consolidation, and will report $125 million in severance, about double what’s typical, Moynihan said. The expenses are part of the firm’s goal of cutting total annual costs to $53 billion by the end of 2018. “We’re trying to accelerate opportunities, and so this quarter we’ll do a couple things to push some stuff through and really position us to make that $53 billion without a problem,” he said.

Kshitij Anand Moneycontrol News The Nifty is likely to open flat on Thursday, tracking muted handover from Wall Street. The index closed flat, but with a negative bias at 9,621 on Wednesday. But during the session, it hit a fresh record high of 9,649.60. The index failed to sustain at a higher level and pared most of its intraday gains to close in negative which made a small bearish candle on the daily candlestick charts, after rallying for four straight sessions. If the index manages to defend 9,600 this week, bullish momentum remains intact, but a close below this level could fuel further profit booking decline. Traders are advised to lighten up long positions if Nifty slips below 9,580-9,600, suggest experts. Stay tuned with Moneycontrol to find out what happens in currency and equity markets today. We have collated a list of important headlines from across news agencies. GDP expands at 7.1% in FY17 The Indian economy grew at 7.1 percent in 2016-17, the government said in new estimates on Wednesday, identical to the expansion projected in February, but slower than the previous year’s 8 percent growth. A 6.1 percent growth in January-March quarter, however, indicated that the economy is still smarting under the demonetisation shock that the sudden flush out of high-value notes and restricted cash access had caused on household spending and corporate investment. SGX Nifty The Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 8 points lower at 9,629 indicating a flat opening for the domestic market. Wall Street ends flat US stocks closed flat as financials dropped after JPMorgan and Bank of America warned of revenue weakness. JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 percent lower than last year, said a Reuters report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,198.52. Petrol price hiked by Rs 1.23/litre, diesel by 89 paise Petrol price was today hiked by Rs 1.23 per litre and diesel by 89 paise a litre in sync with rising international fuel rates. Petrol price in Delhi will cost Rs 66.91 per litre as against Rs 65.32 a litre. Similarly, a litre of diesel will be priced at Rs 5.94, as compared to Rs 54.90 at present. Delhi Assembly passes state GST bill The Delhi Assembly today passed the state Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill even as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal pitched for capping the tax rate at a maximum of 10 percent, said a report. A special session of the Assembly, which saw clashes between a few AAP MLAs and sacked minister Kapil Mishra, cleared the bill following an extensive discussion while also adopting a resolution on lowering tax slabs. Government meets 3.5% fiscal deficit target in 2016-17 The government on Wednesday said it has achieved the fiscal deficit target of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2016-17. For 2017-18, the government aims to further bring down the fiscal deficit gap between expenditure and revenue up to 3.2 percent, said a report. "Fiscal deficit is 3.51 percent of GDP or Rs 5.35 lakh crore in 2016-17," the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) said while releasing the provisional accounts for the last financial year. Dollar wobbles on U.S. political tension The dollar slid to two-week lows against the yen and a more than one-week trough versus the euro amid growing political tension in Washington said a report. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar ended the month with its largest monthly percentage loss since January. The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 110.67 yen after earlier falling to two-week lows. The euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.1236, while the dollar index fell 0.3 percent to 96.99. India, Spain sign 7 agreements India and Spain on Wednesday decided to widen defence partnership, conclude a civil nuclear deal and share best practices to jointly fight terror, said a report. PM Modi and his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy held talks to strengthen strategic partnership amid signing of seven agreements, including on cyber security and transfer of sentenced persons. Rupee logs 1st gain in 3 days The rupee endured a sharp reversal in fortunes against a resurgent US dollar after a two-day fall and recovered by 15 paise to end at 64.51 on fresh selling of the American currency by banks and exporters. 3 stocks under ban period on NSE Security in ban period for the next trade date under the F&O segment include companies in which the security has crossed 95% of the market-wide position limit.Securities which are banned for trading today include names like JP Associates, Reliance Communications, and Reliance Capital. tags #Market Cues #Nifty #Sensex Related news Business See Nifty open on positive note: Maximus Securities Jun 05, 2017 09:12 AM Business GST Impact: Jewellery stocks surge 6-10% as govt sets 3% rate on gold Jun 05, 2017 09:03 AM Business Sensex mantra: Top 5 golden rules to remember when market trades in ‘Boom’ cycle Jun 05, 2017 08:56 AM Business GST Impact: Jockey manufacturer Page Industries gains post Credit Suisse upgrade to Neutral Jun 05, 2017 08:33 AM Business F&amp;O cues: Nifty 9600 Put adds 9.6 lakh shares in Open Interest Jun 05, 2017 08:11 AM Business Nifty gave positive returns in 6 out of last 10 years in June; on track to hit Mount 10K Jun 05, 2017 08:02 AM Business What changed for the market while you were sleeping? 12 things to know Jun 05, 2017 07:52 AM Business Resistance for Nifty at 9713; Bajaj Finserv, IRB Infra bullish plays: Prakash Gaba Jun 05, 2017 07:45 AM Business Trade Setup for Monday: Top 10 things you should know before Opening Bell Jun 04, 2017 08:05 PM News Most Popular Top News How Ravi Narain built the NSE, and then lost his grip Book profits @ 9700 on Nifty; 5 stocks which can return up to 14% in short term Wipro chief Azim Premji took home 63% less salary, zero commission in FY17 What green initiatives are banks taking towards climate change?

At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10 percent to 12 percent lower, though first-half results should be stronger, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said at a separate event. Read more about Lake and Moynihan’s comments. Analysts at JPMorgan warned this month that revenue at the world’s biggest investment banks is likely to drop in the second quarter because of the decline in fixed income. The U.K.’s exit from the European Union and U.S. President Donald Trump’s surprise election win had been fueling wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading results. Those types of stimulants have been more scarce in recent months. Morgan Stanley's Gorman Says Growth in India Is Exciting Passive Investors Gorman said markets are facing a “conundrum,” with economic growth generally strong but the world facing an uncertain political environment. Trump’s administration has faced resistance in pushing an ambitious agenda of tax overhaul and repealing Obamacare, he said. “There is enormous uncertainty which typically would breed tremendous volatility and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up In April, Morgan Stanley reported $1.71 billion in first-quarter revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities, allowing it to beat bigger rival  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for the first time since 2011. After concluding that new rules had permanently impaired the outlook for fixed-income markets, Morgan Stanley moved last year to slash a quarter of its sales and trading staff and sold large chunks of its commodities business.

The fixed-income division -- crucial to the CEO’s plan to improve companywide returns -- was overhauled after revenue plunged to $550 million in the final quarter of 2015. Trading chief Ted Pick cut about 25 percent of the division’s staff and assigned equities executive Sam Kellie-Smith to turn around the business. Asked if he saw further scope for headcount reduction at the bank, Gorman said: “I don’t think so.” “The basic reshaping of the firm that has taken place over five to eight years is essentially done and we feel good about it,” he said.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dow Jones Industrial Average Falls Amid Financial Sector Sell-Off Shutterstock photo The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)  once again traded lower, as weakness in bank stocks and oil prices weighed for a second straight day. Most notably, Dow components JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs experienced sharp losses, with both stocks posting their lowest closes of 2017. As for the energy sector , oil prices extended their recent slide, hitting three-week lows, with traders digesting a notable rise in production out of Libya. Meanwhile, the Fed’s Beige Book likely strengthened the case for a June rate hike, though some traders are questioning whether a September hike is in the cards. Still, the Dow closed lower for a third straight session, though the blue-chip index — as well as the  S&P 500 Index ( SPX )  and  Nasdaq Composite (COMP)  — finished the month in positive territory.  Continue reading for more on today’s market, including: The rare  Nasdaq signal that rang in 2009 just sounded again.  2 underloved electronics stocks with room to run.  While Michael Kors stock sank after earnings, this sector peer had its best day since its IPO .    Plus, the Amazon story going unnoticed; how options traders are playing Lululemon earnings; and a medical technology stock with room to run.

The  Nasdaq Composite (COMP – 6,198.52) touched a record high of 6,221.99 in intraday trading, but still closed down 4.7 points, or 0.1%. The SPX added 1.1% for the month, and the Nasdaq picked up 2.5% — a seventh straight monthly win.  The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX – 10.41)  closed up 0.03 point, or 0.3%, but lost 3.8% for the month.  5 Items on Our Radar Today: Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, threatened to leave the White House advisory council should President Trump withdraw from the Paris Climate accords .

Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, high-dividend utilities, and household goods companies.

The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,370.21. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.65 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $4,93, or 7.3 percent, to $72.85 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.14 to $128.25. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188.

But even a reliable paycheck no longer delivers a reliable income. Like Casares, who works at a Victoria’s Secret store in Ocala, Fla., more and more employees across a growing range of industries find the number of hours they work is swinging giddily from week to week — bringing chaos not only to family scheduling, but also to household finances. And a new wave of research shows that the main culprit is not the gig economy, but shifting pay within the same job. This volatility helps unravel a persistent puzzle: why a below-average jobless rate — 4.4 percent in April — is still producing an above-average level of economic anxiety. Turbulence has replaced the traditional American narrative of steady financial progress over a lifetime. “Since the 1970s, steady work that pays a predictable and living wage has become increasingly difficult to find,” said Jonathan Morduch, a director of the U.S. Financial Diaries project, an in-depth study of 235 low- and moderate-income households. “This shift has left many more families vulnerable to income volatility.” Latest business videos Ever-changing schedules at Victoria’s Secret, for example, make it difficult for Casares, 27, to find care for her 2-year-old and 6-year-old, and to cover the bills. “The lowest hours I’ve gotten is 15 and the highest I’ve gotten is 39,” said Casares, who started in October, earning $10 an hour. The schedule is usually posted a month in advance, she said, but there are frequently last-minute changes. Stability is worth a lot to workers. On average, employees are willing to give up a fifth of their weekly wage to avoid a schedule set by an employer on a week’s notice, according to a field experiment where workers were offered a range of alternative hours at different pay levels. “That is totally the story,” said Morduch, who watched household incomes in his study rise and fall. “And that instability and insecurity are increasingly a part of middle-class life, too.” In the course of a year, for example, the monthly income of a California family with one child that Morduch’s team tracked jumped to $5,279 from as low as $1,175. The husband supplemented his steady $400-a-week salaried construction job with extra remodeling work that could add from $323 to $1,588 a month to his total. His wife brought in up to $1,824 a month from babysitting and from selling jewelry, clothing and flowers. Monthly expenses can pendulum as much as income, but the two do not necessarily move in tandem. An analysis of 250,000 bank accounts by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, a nonprofit research arm of the bank, found that roughly 80 percent of households had an insufficient cash buffer to manage the mismatch between income and expenses in a given month. Few people can comfortably ride out the inevitable financial bronco ride. “Only households that earn $105,000 or more a year are secure against the volatility they are exposed to,” said Diana Farrell, the institute’s president and CEO. “It’s not just about the unemployed or the poor.” Middle-income households, for example, saw their monthly expenses deviate by nearly $1,300, the equivalent of a month’s rent or mortgage payment. And one uh-oh expense — usually in the form of a medical, tax or car repair bill — can wreck a family’s balance sheet for a year or more. Even a single month’s volatility can have a cascading effect. One month, a family copes by using the money earmarked for, say, the utility bill to cover the cost of replacing a busted water heater. The next month, it is the telephone company that goes unpaid as the family struggles to make up the missed utility bill plus late fees and interest — and so on. Emergencies are not the only source of expense spikes. So are bridal showers, Christmas gifts and outgrown winter coats. May turned out to be an expensive month for Tomika Waggoner, 44, a nursing home aide in Newport, Ky. Her daughter was graduating from high school, and she needed a few hundred dollars to pay for her cap and gown, commencement fees, a prom ticket and a dress. Waggoner’s work schedule depends on her ability to find care for her 15-year-old son, who has epilepsy. So sometimes she works a weekend at $17 an hour and sometimes three $15-an-hour weekdays. For the Waggoner family, and many others with low and moderate incomes, a tax refund offered a once-a-year lifeline. That $700 check and a contribution from her mother covered most of the graduation costs and helped pay off the debt on some furniture. (Doctor’s visits and medical payments are frequently scheduled to coincide with tax refunds, according to the JPMorgan Chase Institute.) “I also went to a couple of food pantries,” Waggoner added. “We ate a lot of bologna.” Rather than causing jolts in income, the gig economy is, for many people, what smooths them out. Only about 0.5 percent of the labor force is working in the gig economy. And while bonuses, extra commissions and overtime bump up a worker’s average income, unwelcome reductions in hours, particularly at the lower end of the income ladder, more often shrink an expected paycheck. “Stable, predictable work schedules are essential to economic security,” said Susan Lambert, a professor at the University of Chicago who is studying new data supplied by the General Social Survey, a respected national survey that began asking in-depth questions about work schedules only last year. The latest data shows that 41 percent of all hourly workers say they are not given more than a week’s notice of their schedule; nearly half have little or no say on their work hours. “It’s not just service, or female-dominated jobs, but some of the most challenging schedules are production and construction jobs,” Lambert said. The ubiquity of the phenomenon has frequently been masked by annual measures of income and spending or one-time snapshots of savings and debt that fail to capture fluctuations week to week or month to month. Casares said that when she had to turn down an inconvenient shift at Victoria’s Secret, like staying until midnight to close, her schedule the following week would suffer. “I would be facing fewer hours,” she said. To supplement the light weeks, Casares started picking up a shift as a part-time server at Olive Garden ($5.39 an hour plus tips). The number of Americans living comfortably or doing all right financially has grown since the recession. Still, the new Fed report found that 30 percent — roughly 73 million adults — say they are finding it difficult to get by financially, or are just getting by. To Morduch and his co-author, Rachel Schneider, the rise in income volatility is an indication of how businesses in an era of advancing technology and global competition have shifted risk onto employees. Consider the cost of saving for retirement and medical care. When health insurance premiums for employers soared between 2003 and 2013 (before the Affordable Care Act went into effect), workers picked up 93 percent of the extra cost. Asked whether her job at Victoria’s Secret provided benefits, Casares said it did: “We’re given three bras and a bottle of Bombshell, their No. 1 selling perfume.” Health or retirement contributions are not part of the package.

ALLISON MCNEELY TORONTO — Bloomberg News Published Friday, Jun. 02, 2017 6:02PM EDT Last updated Friday, Jun. 02, 2017 6:02PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print In a world where corporate bonds look expensive and it’s tough to find yield, one firm has been digging around in an overlooked corner of the bank-bond market. Phil Mesman and his colleagues at Picton Mahoney Asset Management have been scooping up subordinated debt issued by the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays PLC and Crédit Agricole SA in the 1980s and 90s that is trading at a discount to face value. The goal is to get repaid early at a premium to the current price. This strategy, which began almost two years ago with a spreadsheet plotting the rather tiny universe of the asset class, has handed the firm’s funds returns of more than 20 per cent, Mr. Mesman said. These legacy hybrid capital notes were originally issued to convert to equity in the event of a bank failure. They trade at a discount primarily because of the low coupon, which is based on a spread over the London interbank offered rate, and uncertainty around whether they will be repaid early, Mr. Mesman said. The bonds, which also have a liquidity discount, have a maturity of 25 years or longer in most cases and some are perpetual bonds, he said. The bond covenants and structures are good for investors, because they make it difficult for a bank to convert the bonds to equity in the event it needs to shore up capital levels. Regulators have said that banks need to take out the bonds before Jan. 1, 2022, Mr. Mesman said, putting a deadline on opportunities in the trade. “It’s an incredible risk-reward,” Mr. Mesman, senior partner and portfolio manager, said by phone from Toronto. He manages more than $700-million in fixed income of Picton’s $6.8-billion of assets. “Typically they would be rated BB or higher-quality high-yield instruments, but the bank issuers are all investment grade.” Stamp collecting Mr. Mesman estimates that his firm is one of only a few players in the $5-billion (U.S.) to $7-billion market, with most of the investors and dealers concentrated in Europe. The bonds represent about 30 per cent of both Picton Mahoney’s main fund, the Fortified Income Fund and the Income Opportunities Fund, as well as about 50 per cent of the firm’s special-situations fund, he said. It’s a strategy that can only be pursued by knowledgeable investors who have flexibility with their investment horizon and don’t have to follow an index, Roger Francis, a credit analyst at Mizuho International PLC in London, said by phone. He said he’s heard the strategy compared to stamp collecting. The main risks with these old bank bonds is liquidity – they’re difficult to trade in tough market conditions – and that a bank will opt not to call or tender for them early, Mr. Francis said. The strategy hinges on correctly identifying which bonds are candidates to be repaid early, or which banks might be willing to negotiate, Mr. Mesman said. Direct approach “If we find a bond where perhaps 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the issue has already been tendered over the years, then we’ll approach them directly and offer them our bonds at a certain price,” he said. Crédit Agricole recently tendered for €371.2-million of a perpetual bond at 78 euro cents on the euro, but investors only took them up on part of the offer, suggesting that they’re waiting for a higher payout, Mr. Mesman said. His firm sold 25 per cent of their €25-million position in the bond and are waiting for a higher price for the rest, he said. To be sure, there has been some headline uncertainty with some banks in Europe, Mr. Mesman said. Deutsche Bank AG, UniCredit SpA and other European banks have in the past been at risk of not paying the coupons on their bonds. While failure to pay interest would be tantamount to default for most debt securities, coupon payments on newer contingent convertible bonds, known as CoCos, are discretionary. Once missed, though, they are gone forever.

(New York Times) By News Editorial Board Published Fri, Jun 2, 2017 SHARE TWEET EMAIL With an ill-considered stroke of the pen, President Trump has turned the country’s back on its own people, its business leaders, its scientists and most of the rest of the world. His rejection of the Paris climate accord also carries the real risk of allowing China to supplant the United States in world leadership. His decision could defeat the world’s best hope of preventing catastrophic climate change or at least buying time so that coastal areas, including New York City, have an opportunity to adapt. That’s bad for America and it’s bad for Buffalo, home to what will be the hemisphere’s largest solar panel manufacturing plant. There may be opportunities to mitigate the damage Trump is inviting, but the risks are undeniably higher today than they were on Wednesday. Few doubt at this point that the climate is warming; the argument is over the causes, and whether the warming can be stemmed. But, in the worst case, what is the downside to better gas mileage, cleaner air and a chance to avoid the calamities that could await? After all, there really is a fast-growing crack in the Antarctic ice shelf. Something really is happening to the planet that deserves the attention of the world, including the United States. Consider the breadth of American interests that favored remaining in the pact. Start with Trump’s own secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who, as chief executive officer of Exxon, supported the Paris agreement. So does his successor, Darren Woods. So does Elon Musk, whose company owns SolarCity, which will produce solar panels in Buffalo. So do the leaders of ConocoPhillips and British Petroleum. So do General Electric, Dow Chemical, 3M, Disney, Coca-Cola, JPMorgan Chase and many other influential businesses whose leaders understand that America’s interests lie in an interconnected world in which science is not kicked to the curb as a political inconvenience. In a Rose Garden speech replete with misstatements, Trump stiff-armed American interests and joined Syria and Nicaragua, the only two countries that didn’t sign the accord – and Nicaragua only because it didn’t go far enough. The decision also puts the United States at odds with the other 194 nations that signed the agreement, including our closest allies. With that, Trump is tilting those countries away from the United States and eroding our influence in the world. The void is liable to benefit China, which is eager to expand its influence. Fortunately for Americans, this matter is not solely up to Trump or even Congress. The governors of New York, California and Washington state have formed the U.S. Climate Alliance and announced that their large and influential states will continue to abide by the agreement. Other governors are also expressing interest. New York and California, alone, comprise nearly 20 percent of the country’s population. This alliance means research and investment in clean energy will continue to exert a useful influence on commerce and the environment. Voters may also have a chance to weigh in. The process of backing out of the agreement could take as much as four years, making Trump’s decision an issue in the 2020 presidential election, and perhaps a key one. It’s hard to escape the sense that Trump’s decision was based in some significant part on his thirst to project the image of the “winner” that he promised during last year’s campaign. He has been largely stymied on anything requiring legislation – repealing the Affordable Care Act, enacting tax reform – and even thwarted thus far on his executive effort to ban Muslims from traveling here. Trump has left the door open a crack, saying he will try to negotiate “a deal that’s fair.” It’s a puzzling comment, since the existing agreement is voluntary and already allows each country to set its own commitments. Still, Americans, 70 percent of whom supported staying in the agreement, should let the president, governors and their legislative representatives know that they are interested in the condition of the country and the planet they leave to their children and grandchildren.

Nonfarm payrolls increased 138,000 last month as the manufacturing, government and retail sectors lost jobs, the Labor Department said on Friday. The economy created 66,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April. Last month's job gains could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. "While the message was a little muddied today, the evidence generally suggests the labor market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. "We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month. Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes." Details of the employment report were weak. Though the unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to its lowest level since May 2001, that was because 429,000 people dropped out of the labor force. The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a drop in employment. The jobless rate has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year. Average hourly earnings rose four cents or 0.2 percent in May after a similar gain in April, leaving the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Job growth has decelerated from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labor market nears full employment. There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. Economists also believe that companies might be holding off hiring amid worries political scandals engulfing President Donald Trump could imperil his economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. "Political uncertainty in Washington is another factor holding back the job market," said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo. "The probability that any of the Trump stimulus would become reality has decreased significantly in recent weeks." Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 185,000 last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4 percent. The Fed raised interest rates in March. A Reuters survey of banks that do business directly with the Fed, conducted after the employment report, showed all 18 primary dealers polled expected the U.S. central bank to raise rates this month. Ten forecast further monetary policy tightening in September and only six saw a rate hike in December. The dollar hit a seven-month low against a basket of currencies on the diminishing rate hike prospects in the second half of the year. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell to nearly seven-month lows, and short-dated yields touched their lowest in more than two weeks. U.S. stocks closed at new highs. The modest payrolls gain could temper expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year. While consumer spending picked up in April, a second report on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 5.2 percent to $47.6 billion. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter. There was some good news in the employment report. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4 percent, the lowest since November 2007. As a result, the spread between the jobless rate and this broad unemployment gauge, considered a better measure of labor market slack, was the smallest since early 2008. But the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. The volatile 16-24 age group accounted for much of the drop in the participation rate last month, suggesting a rebound is likely. Manufacturing employment fell by 1,000 jobs last month as payrolls in the automobile sector dropped 1,500 amid declining sales. Ford Motor Co said last month it planned to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives. Construction payrolls rose 11,000 last month after decreasing by 1,000 jobs in April. Retail employment fell 6,100, declining for a fourth straight month, with department stores shedding 3,700 jobs. Department store chains like J.C. Penney Co Inc, Macy's Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch are struggling against stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon. Nonstore retailers, including online merchants, hired 2,900 workers last month. Government employment decreased 9,000 last month, with state and local governments accounting for all the decrease. © (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017. Earn an American degree in Japan.

Lu Wang — Bloomberg News Published Friday, Jun. 02, 2017 5:32PM EDT Last updated Friday, Jun. 02, 2017 7:06PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print The bulls are back in charge after a second weekly advance pushed the S&P 500 Index to a fresh record. But look a little more closely and the signs of unease in the stock market are hard to ignore. It’s visible in fund flows, where investors are rotating from U.S. stocks to the rest of the world at the fastest pace in two years. And short sellers are getting aggressive, raising bearish bets in three of the past four months. U.S. stocks climbed this week, led by by phone companies and materials producers. The S&P 500 increased 1 per cent to 2,438.91 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent to 21,204.58. While the gains built on the previous week’s breakout, neither index is more than 2 per cent above the all-time highs reached on March 1. In other words, benchmark indexes are at records, but they also haven’t advanced much since March, one of the longer periods of stasis since Donald Trump’s election. For all their resilience, equity investors remain anxious about an economy that has recently given uneven evidence of its vigour just as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise interest rates. After Friday’s employment report, three-month U.S. jobs growth is now the lowest since 2012. Housing demand weakened more than expected in April, and while manufacturing gauges remain firm, a series of reports on inflation continue to show corporate pricing power is muted. “It is a warning that, as with asset prices, the key question is not the level you are at, but the prospects for growth from here,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York. “Investors should consider whether overseas economies with greater growth potential may provide better equity market returns.” Meanwhile, investors in exchange-traded funds turned net sellers of U.S. stocks in May for the first time in a year, with withdrawals approaching $2-billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They added $22-billion to equity funds that invest in markets from Europe to Asia. The divergence in flows, the widest since April 2015, marked a turnaround from last year, when almost $10 went for American equities for every one that went elsewhere. Even as stocks vaulted to new highs, bears aren’t deterred. Short interest as a proportion of total shares outstanding has expanded since January, rising by 0.3 percentage point to 3.9 per cent. Never before has an equity advance as big as this year’s occurred simultaneously with more short sales, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg that goes back to 2008. Spotty demand for American stocks coincided with hiccups in economic data. Rather than picking up pace as expected by many at the start of the year, Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index for the U.S., which measures the difference between actual releases and economist expectations, peaked in March and has since fallen to the lowest level since February 2016. By contrast, similar gauges for the rest of the world have fared better as Brazil and Russia emerged from recessions while the populist political tide receded in Europe. Since the global financial crisis, the U.S. had dominated equity gains worldwide, with rallies underpinned by easier monetary policy and a steady recovery. Now that growth is poised to accelerate from Europe to Japan, American assets are losing some of their appeal. In Bank of America Corp.’s latest survey of money managers, 82 per cent called the U.S. the most expensive market. While the S&P 500 is up 8.9 per cent this year, it’s poised to trail the MSCI World ex-U.S. Index for the first time since 2009. The dollar is heading for the worst annual decline in a decade after losing about 6 per cent of its value against a basket of currencies. Even within the U.S. market itself, the preference for overseas exposure is evident. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket tracking shares with the highest leverage to international growth has risen 17 per cent this year, compared with 6 per cent for a similar gauge for domestic-focused companies. “The dollar weakness and non-U.S. economic strength is being replayed all over the world,” said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust in New York. “Rarely have times been better for U.S. firms with global exposure. The auspicious omens are plain to see.” Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail Gen Y Money: What you need to know about owning and buying a condo (The Globe and Mail)   SPXS&P 500 INDEX Latest Price2,439.07 +9.01 (+0.37%) Updated June 2 4:44 PM EDT. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

A scientist's perspective 15th-century Chinese sailors have a lesson for Trump about climate policy Will the Paris Agreement still be able to deliver after the US withdrawal? Trump's move to withdraw from Paris accord cedes global leadership to China Time for China and Europe to lead, as Trump dumps the Paris climate deal Several major US companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, JP Morgan Chase & Co and IBM Corp, on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President's Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration - as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co, criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Inc Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Goldman Sachs. General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption." The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment." "If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP. Blackrock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

MarketWatch recently spoke with Lee Kranefuss, one of the founders of industry giant iShares, about the state of the industry and where it may go from here. Read the first part of MarketWatch’s interview with Lee Kranefuss MarketWatch: ETFs have been around for more than 20 years. What do you see when you look out to the next 20? Lee Kranefuss: Well 20 years is a long time. I think one thing you might see is that fund launches will slow over time. More people will realize they can’t write a hit song. The flip side of that is that a lot of money managers and institutions who missed out of the wave will come out with their own products. We’re starting to see that with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.51%  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -0.79% which have recently launched their own ETFs. MarketWatch: Has the space gotten over-proliferated? Kranefuss: There are too many funds. Advisers come to us saying, “I don’t know about these, I don’t understand them, there are just too many.” The over-proliferation is supply driven, not demand driven, but I’m not inclined to say that there should be artificial constraints of some sort; I just wish people would be more rational about it. MarketWatch: Is it possible we’ll see fewer funds as we look out into the future? Kranefuss: I think we will. What determines whether a fund provider will be able to keep operating, or whether its funds will become zombie ETFs, is the diversity and breadth of the family it offers. If a smaller provider doesn’t have a healthy family of funds, you’ll see them close up or get absorbed into bigger names. MarketWatch: Given the growth in the industry, has your answer to whether ETFs are putting the nail in the coffin of mutual funds changed? Kranefuss: I think that active management, by which I mean security selection, is a dying business. It won’t ever completely die, because there’s some value to it, but I don’t think that traditional mutual funds are a growth field. It’s just too hard to pull real returns out of security selection, and the performance numbers are very damning. Related: How unloved is active management? Even outperformance is being snubbed MarketWatch: Is it possible that ETFs will become the venue for indexing while active stays in mutual funds, and that’s the primary different between the two? Kranefuss: Certainly you’ll never see a big firm come out with index mutual funds ever again—that doesn’t make sense. They’ll go straight to ETFs, where there are advantages of scale and of being the first mover. Active management will stay in mutual funds. There will be a middle ground in retirement assets, some of which is being done in the form of life-cycle funds. See also: Retirement accounts a ‘Holy Grail’ that remain out of reach for ETFs MarketWatch: What do you make of the smart-beta category, where the components are selected by rules designed to deliver specific strategies? “We don’t need the hot new thing; we don’t need smaller players chasing hot spots of the market.” Lee Kranefuss, iShares pioneer Kranefuss:There are some interesting ideas in the category, but only a handful of documented factors—momentum, low-volatility, and so forth. You can easily implement those at the portfolio level. Value, for example, is largely a matter of sector orientation. There’s no need to spend more on a value fund. Most of these funds seem developed to stand out in marketing. There are always times when you can say something outperforms when back tested over a specific period. MarketWatch: What are your concerns for the industry going forward? Kranefuss: One issue that comes up is how there are both too many funds and too few. There’s a lot of concentration in the industry, but we’re missing some building blocks. We don’t need the hot new thing; we don’t need smaller players chasing hot spots of the market. One example I give is with emerging markets. A lot of major EM companies have a high correlation to developed markets because they’re international. So why would you pay high fees to get exposure to a part of the market that has a high correlation to something you can get cheaply here? I can imagine a way of investing in emerging markets where you get the correlated part of the market through cheap domestic proxies, and then the rest is unbundled and purchased separately. That seems like a useful thing to have.

Heads of delegations at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. (Wikimedia Photo / Presidencia de la República Mexicana). Dozens of the country’s biggest corporations are mounting a last-ditch attempt to dissuade President Donald Trump from abandoning the Paris Agreement, a pledge to reduce carbon emissions and stem the tide of global warming. In full-page ads running in today’s New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and New York Post, 25 companies have signed an open letter detailing the economic benefits of adhering to the agreement. Those companies include Microsoft, Apple, Google, Adobe, Facebook, Intel, and Salesforce. In a related TV ad, “America’s biggest CEOs,” including the leaders of JPMorgan Chase, GE,  Johnson & Johnson, and Disney, make a similar case. Both ads claim the Paris Agreement will lead to job creation and will boost the U.S. economy. Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk is one of the CEOs named in the TV ad. An outspoken supporter of the Paris Agreement, Musk has pledged to abandon his post as an advisor to Trump if the president pulls out of the climate deal. Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017 Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. committed to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025. If Trump exits the Paris Agreement, the U.S. will join Syria and Nicaragua as the only non-participants. The entreaties from the business community appeal to Trump’s sense of nationalism, stressing the economic and financial benefits of remaining in the agreement while underplaying the environmental factors. “By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth,” the newspaper ad says. “U.S. companies are well-positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures.” Two of the world’s biggest oil producers, Exxon Mobile and ConocoPhillips, also oppose pulling out of the agreement, arguing it’s better to have a seat at the table to influence global climate policy, according to Bloomberg News. The Guardian reports EPA chief Scott Pruitt and Trump advisor Steve Bannon support an exit. Most reports say Trump is leaning toward leaving the Paris Agreement. He is expected to deliver his decision this afternoon.

(AAPL) Stock Recent Posts: 3 Reasons Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Could Catch Fire 3 Ways Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Can Go Off the Rails 3 Reasons Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Is Dangerous to Your Portfolio’s Health View All Posts Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is proof that in the markets, a lot can happen in just a few short months. Between early October and late February, BAC stock logged an impressive 60% gain — this after about three years of essentially running in place. Source: Shutterstock Since then, however, BofA dropped by double digits, and has been stuck in neutral ever since. Bank of America isn’t suffering in a bubble, of course. The rest of the banking sector — including Big Four rivals Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) — have been cooling off, too. That caused a lot of alarm, but it’s not often that mega-banks act like fast-growing dot-coms. And besides, it was for good reason. Much of the enthusiasm over President Donald Trump’s promised financial deregulation waned as his other policies began to lag, leaving many to wonder when exactly a freer, easier environment for banks would open up. Still, that leaves investors wondering: What can we expect out of BAC stock now? Is the giant bank still a value, or is the recent flatlining a sign that investors should still be cautious. I don’t think the bull run is over, and I have three reasons why. Reason #1: Bank of America Is on Solid Footing If it wasn’t for the help of the federal government, BofA might not be around today. The company had deep exposure to toxic mortgages, thanks in large part to the disastrous Countrywide Financial acquisition. Yet Bank of America has made tremendous strides in restructuring the overall business, including deep cuts in headcount and its retail footprint. BAC also has implemented more rigorous systems to better manage risk. BofA is very different than it was 10 years ago, but don’t get the impression that it lost all of its tremendous scale. Consider that Bank of America still boasts … 47 million consumer and small business relationships About $2.6 trillion in assets Roughly 1 million high net worth clients Bank of America also has made important investments in new technologies, amounting to about $3 billion per year. The results are there, too, as the bank boasts 22.2 million mobile customers and 34.5 million active digital users. These consumers have been drawn in by innovations such as P2P payments (via the Zelle app), its artificial intelligence unit (Erica) and cardless-enabled ATMs. Reason #2: Net Interest Income Net interest income is at the heart of Bank of America’s performance. NII is calculated as the difference between the revenues of core banking services — such as providing loans — and the costs of paying interest on deposits. Historically low interest rates after the financial crisis have been a major drag on the performance of BAC stock. But the Federal Reserve has been changing its policies, engaging in more tightening. It’s difficult to predict interest rates, but some important factors should keep them on the rise. Unemployment — though it decelerated in May — is still at all-time low levels, and the Fed also wants to lessen its balance sheet. The interesting thing about the net interest income is that the fees on deposits tend to remain depressed whereas loan rates have much larger increases. The result is a nice expansion in margins.

Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council.Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets.Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, said he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council.A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council.McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said.Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said.Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), criticized Trump's decision, but suggested in a statement on Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said.PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc (FB.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N). GE's CEO, Jeff Immelt, is on Trump's manufacturing council.AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people."Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption."The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment.""If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP (BX.N). Blackrock Inc (BLK.N) Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co (GM.N) said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's (F.N) new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo By David Shepardson and Susan Heavey | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON Several major U.S. companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, JP Morgan Chase & Co and IBM Corp, on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co, criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Inc Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Goldman Sachs. General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption." The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment." "If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP. Blackrock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

Nonfarm payrolls increased 138,000 last month as the manufacturing, government and retail sectors lost jobs, the Labor Department said on Friday. The economy created 66,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April. Last month's job gains could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. "While the message was a little muddied today, the evidence generally suggests the labor market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. "We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month. Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes." Details of the employment report were weak. Though the unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to its lowest level since May 2001, that was because 429,000 people dropped out of the labor force. The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a drop in employment. The jobless rate has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year. Average hourly earnings rose 4 cents or 0.2 percent in May after a similar gain in April, leaving the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Job growth has decelerated from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labor market nears full employment. There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. Economists also believe that companies might be holding off hiring amid worries political scandals engulfing President Donald Trump could imperil his economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. "Political uncertainty in Washington is another factor holding back the job market," said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo. "The probability that any of the Trump stimulus would become reality has decreased significantly in recent weeks." Economists had forecast payrolls increasing 185,000 last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4 percent. The Fed raised interest rates in March. A Reuters survey of banks that do business directly with the Fed, conducted after the employment report, showed all 18 primary dealers polled expected the U.S. central bank to raise rates this month. Ten forecast further monetary policy tightening in September and only six saw a rate hike in December. The dollar hit a seven-month low against a basket of currencies on the diminishing rate hike prospects in the second half of the year. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell to nearly seven-month lows, and short-dated yields touched their lowest in more than two weeks. U.S. stocks closed at new highs.[MKTS/GLOB] SHRINKING LABOR MARKET SLACK The modest payrolls gain could temper expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year. While consumer spending picked up in April, a second report on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 5.2 percent to $47.6 billion. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter. There was some good news in the employment report. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4 percent, the lowest since November 2007. As a result, the spread between the jobless rate and this broad unemployment gauge, considered a better measure of labor market slack, was the smallest since early 2008. But the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. The volatile 16-24 age group accounted for much of the drop in the participation rate last month, suggesting a rebound is likely. Manufacturing employment fell by 1,000 jobs last month as payrolls in the automobile sector dropped 1,500 amid declining sales. Ford Motor Co said last month it planned to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives. Construction payrolls rose 11,000 last month after decreasing by 1,000 jobs in April. Retail employment fell 6,100, declining for a fourth straight month, with department stores shedding 3,700 jobs. Department store chains like J.C. Penney Co Inc , Macy's Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch are struggling against stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon . Nonstore retailers, including online merchants, hired 2,900 workers last month. Government employment decreased 9,000 last month, with state and local governments accounting for all the decrease.

The best credit card rewards and bonuses David Slotnick, Insider Picks Jun. 2, 2017, 2:15 PM 32,436 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. Chase/Business Insider The Insider Pick: Credit cards with good rewards programs and great sign-up bonuses make it easier than ever to rack up a lot of points and use them to travel in style. These are the best credit card rewards programs and sign-up bonuses that are available now. Last summer’s launch of the Sapphire Reserve credit card by J.P. Morgan Chase stirred up a frenzy usually reserved for the newest iPhone. Millennials and Gen X-ers jumped into the once-obscure world of credit card rewards and bonuses, drawn by Chase’s introductory offer of 100,000 bonus points if you spent $4,000 in your first three months of card membership. Now that the big bonus is gone and many of the points likely spent, what’s the next move for someone seeking to boost their stock of credit card points and frequent flyer miles? Here are some of the top credit card sign-up bonuses still available. But first, a word of warning: Credit cards play a big role in maintaining a healthy credit profile and score. Make sure you’re aware of the impact that opening a new card can have, especially if you’re planning to apply for a mortgage or finance a major purchase anytime soon. It’s also important to practice financial discipline when targeting credit card rewards — paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay is the best course of action. After all, interest and late charges can cancel out the value you get from your rewards. The Chase Sapphire Reserve card, the Chase Sapphire Preferred card, the Chase Unlimited Freedom card, the American Express Platinum card, the American Express Preferred Rewards Gold card, the Capital One Venture Rewards card, and various airline rewards credit cards offer the best rewards.  View As: One Page Slides Chase Sapphire Reserve Spencer Platt/Getty Images Why you'll love it: The Chase Sapphire Reserve Credit Card makes it easy to earn rewards for travel and more with a great sign-up bonus. Sign-up Bonus: 50,000 points (after spending $4,000 in the first three months) The huge introductory bonus might have made way for a smaller incentive, but the Chase Sapphire Reserve is still a great card to keep in your wallet. Earning three times Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on dining and any travel, and one point per dollar on everything else, the Sapphire Reserve earns points quickly through your everyday spending, and it comes with a slew of perks.  Points are worth 1.5¢ each towards travel booked through Chase, but can also be transferred to a number of frequent flyer and hotel loyalty programs. Benefits include access to airport lounges through the Priority Pass network, trip delay coverage, purchase protection, a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit, and car rental primary coverage. However, while the airport lounge access can be great, most Priority Pass lounges are in international terminals, which isn't helpful when you're flying domestically. The annual fee is a hefty $450, but that’s offset by a $300 travel credit each year, good for things like taxis, subway fare, parking, tolls, and flights. There aren’t many downsides to this card. Chase has invested heavily in making the Ultimate Rewards program competitive. Booking flights by transferring points to frequent flyer partners is generally more lucrative — that’s usually how people use points to fly in first and business class — but it can be complicated because you have to decipher award charts, find availability, and work around complicated airline rules.  However, because the Sapphire Reserve allows you to get 1.5¢ for each point, if you use them to book travel through Chase’s online or phone travel agent, there’s a simpler and still-valuable option.  Pros: Solid sign-up bonus, easy to earn points, points work with frequent flier and hotel loyalty programs, good airport benefits Cons: High annual fee, Priority Pass lounges are typically in international terminals  Sign up for a Chase Sapphire Reserve Credit Card now Chase Sapphire Preferred Spencer Platt/Getty Images Why you'll love it: The Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card has a lower annual fee than the Reserve card and it's easy to rack up points. Sign-up Bonus: 50,000 points (after spending $4,000 in the first three months) The Reserve’s older sibling, the Sapphire Preferred offers a number of similar features and an identical sign-up bonus for a lower annual fee. The card earns 2 times the Ultimate Rewards points instead of the Reserve’s 3 times the points on dining and travel, and one times the points on everything else. Points are worth a lower 1.25¢ on travel booked through Chase, but can still be transferred to frequent flyer and hotel loyalty programs. There’s no annual travel credit, but there’s still car rental primary coverage, as well as slightly less-generous trip delay coverage and purchase protection. The annual fee is a more manageable $95, which is waived the first year. The Sapphire Preferred was the all-around best card for a long time, but the Reserve has changed the landscape. The Preferred earns fewer points on bonus spending categories than the Reserve, and the value of the points on travel booked through Chase is less. The no-hassle travel credit on the Reserve makes the annual fee on that card effectively $150 (accounting for the $300 you get back through the credit), so — depending on your spending habits — it can be worth paying more up front for the Reserve. Pros: Good sign-up bonus, transferable points, travel perks, lower annual fee than Sapphire Reserve card Cons: Lower point value, no annual travel credit, no as good as Sapphire Reserve Sign up for a Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card now  Chase Freedom Unlimited John Gress/Reuters Why you'll love it: The Chase Unlimited Freedom Credit Card helps you earn points for normal purchases and get cash back with no annual fee. Sign-up Bonus: 15,000 points/$150 (after spending $500 in the first three months) If you already have the Sapphire Reserve and are saving your points for something, the Freedom Unlimited can give your balance a nice boost. While Chase markets the card as “cash back,” it actually earns Ultimate Rewards points that you can redeem for cash (1 point = 1¢).  If you have a premium card like the Sapphire Reserve, you can pool your points from the two cards. The Freedom Unlimited earns 1.5 points per dollar spent, so paired with a Sapphire Reserve, it’s a great card to use for purchases that aren’t made on travel expenses or dining.  Best of all, the card has no annual fee and often has zero percent APR for the first 15 months on purchases and balance transfers. The Chase Freedom Unlimited is a fantastic all-around card. However, to get the most value when it’s time to spend your points, you need the Sapphire Reserve or Preferred card, too, so you can pool your points. Otherwise, points are only worth 1¢ each no matter how you use them and they can’t be transferred to airline or hotel partners. Pros: Decent sign-up bonus, earn points on regular purchases, no annual fee, zero percent APR for first 15 months Cons: One point only equals one cent for cash back Sign up for a Chase Unlimited Freedom Credit Card now American Express Platinum Mario Tama/Getty Images Why you'll love it: The American Express Platinum Rewards Credit Card offers a big sign-up bonus and lots of perks for travelers. Sign-up Bonus: 60,000 points (after spending $5,000 in the first three months) American Express has made some big moves recently in the credit cards rewards war. The company fired shots at Chase by upping its standard sign-up bonus offer. Previously, it was only 40,000 points, and now it's 60,000. AmEx is also offering 5 times the Membership Rewards points per dollar spent on airfare directly with airlines and a monthly $15 credit on Uber, which was boosted to $35 in December. Like Chase Ultimate Rewards points, American Express Membership Rewards points can be used to purchase travel, gift cards, or products directly through from the issuer, or they can be transferred to certain airline and hotel loyalty programs. The card includes access to the same lounges as the Sapphire Reserve, plus Delta SkyClubs and the proprietary American Express Centurion Lounges. It carries a number of perks similar to its rival from Chase, including purchase protections and a $200 annual credit on incidental airline fees — think checked bags, drinks, and upgrades. Cardholders also qualify for elite status with Hilton and Starwood hotels. That can help you stomach the $550 annual fee. However, $550 is a lot to pay out each year. The $200 airline fee credit and $200 Uber credit certainly help, but the airline credit can be difficult to use if you aren’t checking bags or buying drinks on flights. Some people have found that buying gift cards from the airline of your choice counts as a qualifying purchase. The bonus spending categories on this card are less generous than on the Sapphire Reserve, meaning it can take longer to earn points unless you book a lot of flights. The spending requirement in the first three months is higher than most other cards, and Membership Reward points are worth less than Chase’s Ultimate Rewards points when used to book travel through the card issuer — only 1¢ per point. Pros: High sign-up points bonus, perks at airlines, points can go toward purchases, points are transferable to airline and hotel rewards programs Cons: High $550 annual fee, only 1¢ per point, high spending requirement, less generous than Chase Sapphire Reserve Sign up for an American Express Platinum Rewards Credit Card now American Express Preferred Rewards Gold Glassdoor Why you'll love it: The American Express Preferred Rewards Gold Credit Card has a lower annual fee and you can easily earn points on travel and other purchases. Sign-up Bonus: 25,000 points (after spending $2,000 in the first three months) If the high annual fee turns you away from the Platinum card, you may want to consider the Preferred Rewards Gold card instead. While it comes with fewer perks, it still offers a $100 annual credit on incidental airline fees, and earns three times points on airfare, two times points on groceries, restaurants and gas stations, and one times the points on everything else. There are a few other benefits as well, including purchase protection and baggage insurance. While the card carries a $195 annual fee, it’s waived for your first year. Note that it’s often possible to find a higher sign-up bonus offer simply by visiting the American Express website. However, it's worth noting that for a card with a $195 annual fee, you would expect a higher standard sign-up bonus like the ones Chase offers. The bonus spending categories overlap heavily with the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Reserve cards, but with a higher annual fee. If you can maximize the airline credit, the fee is effectively the same as the Sapphire Preferred, but points are only worth 1¢ each on travel booked through American Express, while the Preferred card’s Ultimate Rewards points are worth more on travel booked through Chase. Pros: Easy to earn points, good for travelers, airline perks Cons: $195 annual fee, smaller sign-up bonus, only 1¢ per point Sign up for an American Express Preferred Rewards Gold Credit Card now Capital One Venture Rewards REUTERS/ Brendan McDermid Why you'll love it: The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card has a low annual fee and makes it easy to earn points for travel. Sign-up Bonus: 40,000 miles (after spending $3,000 in the first three months) Capital One’s travel rewards program isn’t necessarily as lucrative as what other banks offer. The points can’t be transferred to hotel or airline partners, and they’re worth a fixed value of 1¢ each. The flip side, though, is that they’re easy to earn and easy to use. The Venture Rewards card earns two times the miles per dollar on all purchases. The points can be redeemed as a statement credit to “erase” travel purchases. For example, if you buy a $400 plane ticket, you can apply 40,000 points to cancel out that charge. The annual fee of $59 is waived the first year. However, you won’t find outsized value with Capital One’s travel rewards, since you don’t even get the option to transfer miles to a hotel or frequent flyer program. Each mile is worth 1¢, and that’s that. On the other hand, that means there’s no ambiguity or confusion when it’s time to spend your miles. Pros: Low annual fee, easy to earn points, decent sign-up bonus Cons: Points are non-transferable, only 1¢ per point Sign up for a Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card now Airline Rewards Programs United Why you'll love it: Airlines often have decent rewards programs through major credit card providers that will help you travel more. Sign-up Bonus: Varies If you often travel with the same airline or live in a major hub city, you might want to consider signing up for a co-branded airline credit card. American Express issues Delta’s credit cards, Citibank offers American’s, and Chase partners with United. Sign-up bonuses often vary through the year, but they generally fall between 30,000 and 60,000 miles after spending $3,000 in the first three months. Perks vary by card and are often valuable even if you only fly a few times a year, generally including a form of early boarding, free checked bags, and extra miles earned on purchases from that airline. While each airline offers a few cards, the most popular ones tend to come with annual fees of $95, which are waived the first year. However, with these cards, there’s no option to redeem your miles for cash or book travel hassle-free. Nor is there an option to choose which frequent flyer program offers the most value and flexibility for the trip you’re planning. Instead, you’re stuck booking travel with one airline and dealing with whatever restrictions it might impose. If the airline chooses to devalue their frequent flyer program or raise costs for a particular type of award flight, you’re stuck. The upside comes mainly with the perks like the free checked bag, and the fact that with a little bit of work, it can be possible to get an incredible value for your miles by booking an unforgettable trip in first or business class.

Pros: Airlines offer good deals, travel perks, low annual fees Cons: There's still an annual fee, you're stuck with that airline and have less flexibility If you want to see more from Insider Picks, we're collecting emails for an upcoming newsletter.

By David Shepardson and Susan Heavey WASHINGTON — Reuters Published Friday, Jun. 02, 2017 1:59PM EDT Last updated Friday, Jun. 02, 2017 6:48PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Several major U.S. companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>, JP Morgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> and IBM Corp <IBM.N>, on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies. Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. Tesla Inc <TSLA.O> Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co <DIS.N> CEO Robert Iger reacted by leaving White House advisory councils after Trump's move. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council. Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets. Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>, the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council. McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said. Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group. "I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement. PepsiCo Inc <PEP.N> Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table." 'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL' Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc <FB.O>, Alphabet Inc <GOOGL.O> and Goldman Sachs <GS.N>. General Electric Co <GE.N> CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government." Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co <BA.N> Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said. Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers. In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure. "If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption." The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders. Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment." "If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP <BX.N>. Blackrock Inc <BLK.N> Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors. General Motors Co <GM.N> said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's <F.N> new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group. In February, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies.

Google, GE, Apple, Dozens Of Other Companies Denounce Withdrawal From Paris Climate Accord Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google, GE, Apple, Dozens Of Other Companies Denounce Withdrawal From Paris Climate Accord Image courtesy of James LeVeque June 2, 2017 2:01 pm EDT By Kate Cox@kcoxdc money is green climate change capitalism sustainability The biggest news of the week, so far, has been President Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the landmark Paris Agreement. And while politicians’ support or condemnation of the withdrawal is predictably split along party lines, one surprising consensus has emerged: The business world, including the corporations that run basically everything, really wish we would stay in. The decision, which Trump announced in a Rose Garden speech yesterday, starts the several-year process for taking the U.S. out of the international agreement, also called the Paris Climate Accord. The agreement was finalized in Paris (hence the name) in 2015. 195 nations — basically, the entire world save two — have signed on to the non-binding accord, agreeing to take voluntary steps to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change. NPR has a full, easy-to-read explainer of the terms the nations all agreed to. Basically, it’s a voluntary pledge to do something by 2020, and then work toward a global goal of zero greenhouse gas emissions by some vague “mid-century” date. However, the President decided the U.S. should not remain in the planet-wide agreement. “As of today,” he said in his speech yesterday, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.” The D.C. rumor mill had signaled for a while that this withdrawal was probably coming, and so businesses began to stake out their positions ahead of the formal speech. Earlier in May, the CEOs for 30 major corporations signed an open letter all but begging the administration to leave well enough alone. Why? Not out of any deep moral sentiment; business is business. Instead, staying in the agreement, they argue, is what’s best for capitalism. “Based on our vast experience doing business all over the world,” the CEOs write, “we believe there is strong potential for negative trade implications if the United States exits from the Paris Agreement.” “Our business interests are best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced response to reducing global GHG emissions. The Paris Agreement gives us that flexible framework to manage climate change while providing a smooth transition for business.” The letter wasn’t signed by a bunch of startups and newbies, but rather by the biggest names in banking, manufacturing, media, and agriculture including: 3M, Dow Chemical, Bank of America, Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Johnson & Johnson, Tesla, Coca-Cola, JP Morgan Chase, Unilever, Morgan Stanley, and Disney, among others. After the announcement was made, several CEOs voiced their disappointment and vowed that their businesses would continue to act believing that climate change is a real threat. Several took to Twitter to voice their displeasure. General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt Tweeted, “Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.” Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government. — Jeff Immelt (@JeffImmelt) June 1, 2017 He was joined by Tesla’s Elon Musk, who Tweeted that the withdrawal was enough to make him resign from Presidential advisory councils he sits on. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 “Climate change is real,” Musk said. “Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.” Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein made his first-ever Tweet yesterday, and used it to voice disappointment with the administration’s choice: “Today’s decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.’s leadership position in the world,” he Tweeted. Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement — Lloyd Blankfein (@lloydblankfein) June 1, 2017 The major players in the tech world also nearly universally condemned the choice. Google CEO Sundar Pichai, like many others, took to Twitter to make a statement, saying, “Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all.” Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all. — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 1, 2017 Microsoft’s Brad Smith said nearly the same, also on Twitter, saying, “We’re disappointed with the decision to exit the Paris Agreement. Microsoft remains committed to doing our part to achieve its goals.” We’re disappointed with the decision to exit the Paris Agreement. Microsoft remains committed to doing our part to achieve its goals. — Brad Smith (@BradSmi) June 1, 2017 Amazon joined the fray in a four-part Tweetstorm from the company’s official news account saying, “Amazon continues to support the Paris climate agreement and action on climate change. We believe that robust clean energy and climate policies can support American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth.” Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, of course, posted his statement on Facebook, for obvious reasons. “Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children’s future at risk,” Zuck posted. “Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it’s too late.” Apple CEO Tim Cook was even more blunt in a company-wide email to employees. “I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement,” Cook wrote. After outlining steps Apple is currently taking toward sustainability, Cook concluded, “Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. … Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us.” And lest you think it’s just the new, modern vanguard of tech businesses objecting, those CEOs were joined by stalwarts Dow Chemical, Shell Oil, and Exxon Mobil — none of which exactly enjoy public reputations for environmental friendliness. But for public-facing condemnation, the most visible has been The Weather Channel. Although the cable network itself is still owned by a consortium of NBCUniversal and investment groups, since 2016 its website, Weather.com, has been owned by IBM. And that website has been basically as scathing as it is possible for website layout to be. While the formal announcement was taking place yesterday, this was how it looked: And it hasn’t eased up today.

Apple announced developers have earned over $70 billion since the App Store went live in 2008. Taking the tech giant's 70/30 revenue split into account, that means customers have spent over $100 billion in App Store purchases. Apple didn't stop with an earnings number boast as it also revealed App Store downloads grew by over 70% in the past 12 months, and active paid subscriptions are up 58% since the same time last year.

The Wall Street Journal.3:51 UP NEXT As oil prices sag despite OPEC’s renewed efforts to shore up world crude markets, Wall Street banks have more bad news for the producer group: the outlook for next year isn’t great either. Quotes in the article Morgan Stanley MS ▼ 42.52 -0.09 -0.21% Goldman Sachs Group Inc GSPRA ▲ 23.72 +0.20 +0.85% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 82.64 -0.42 -0.51% Citigroup Inc C ▲ 61.11 +0.03 +0.05% AdChoices Oil futures have lost 8 percent since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed on May 25 to keep output constrained through the first quarter of 2018 in a bid to clear a global glut. While Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects their strategy to ultimately succeed, they warn the surplus may re-appear once the curbs end. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. say the group will have little choice but to stick with the cuts even longer. Resurgent supplies from U.S. shale drillers and fading growth in fuel demand mean that world oil markets could face another overhang next year, the banks predict. That means Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two biggest producers in the 24-nation coalition, may need to deliver on their promise to do “whatever it takes” to restore equilibrium. “If OPEC wants to keep the market balanced next year, they will probably need to extend the production cut to all of 2018,” Martijn Rats, managing director at Morgan Stanley in London, said by email. “Demand growth has slowed somewhat recently, and with U.S. production growing strongly, there doesn’t seem to be much room for OPEC production to grow in 2018.” Slow Recovery Production cuts are taking longer than expected to eliminate the surplus as U.S. shale drillers boost production with surprising speed. American oil explorers, having learned to operate more efficiently during a two-year market slump, have restored almost all the output lost during the downturn. As a result, the market may be unable to absorb the return of production halted by OPEC and its partners when their pact ends in April.© Bloomberg/Bloomberg OPEC Has a 2018 Problem “The market isn’t able to see how OPEC exits production cuts without creating huge surpluses in 2018,” said Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in New York. “We see risks for a renewed surplus later next year if OPEC and Russia’s production rises to their expanded capacity and shale grows at an unbridled rate.” Still, even if a surplus re-emerges in 2018, OPEC’s current efforts to deplete stockpiles will make their task of managing it easier, according to Citigroup Inc. While shale’s recovery means next year’s supply situation “looks weighty,” OPEC’s output cuts now mean that if inventories accumulate again, it would be from a lower level, said Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. Those increases in inventories may nonetheless prove substantial enough to prevent prices gaining, said David Martin, an analyst at JPMorgan, who slashed his 2018 forecast for Brent crude by $10 a barrel to $45 on May 25. Brent traded near $49 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London on Friday. Even if OPEC extends their output accord for all of next year, it may only succeed in stopping further stockpile increases, he said. “OPEC may be shackled to its deal for a long time,” said Martin.

That’s what First Federal Lakewood, a $1.7 billion-asset mutual in Ohio, is doing. Recently, First Federal was one of the founders of an Ohio-based fintech accelerator. It’s also invested in Numerated Growth Technologies — a commercial lending technology that lets banks make lending decisions in as little as five minutes. It was created by Eastern Labs, the innovation unit of the Boston mutual Eastern Bank, and spun out recently. While each project has its specific draw, they both speak to a common motivation: the opportunity for First Federal to punch above its weight by collaborating on technology. “We have to be open-minded" about pursuing technology "so we can make sure we can continue to deliver a great experience our customers,” said Thomas Fraser, First Federal's president and CEO. “Why can’t a group of 10 community banks figure out how to make investments in an innovative platform down the road?” he said. “Or a group of banks being part of a development fund to steer a variety of tech initiatives?” Prime spot "Having a seat at the table and access to fintech solutions is certainly a benefit to us," says Thomas Fraser, president and CEO of First Federal Lakewood, about its decision to team up with larger banks on a startup accelerator. Indeed, increased collaboration among community banks is a “logical next step” in the advancement of technology in the industry, said Christine Barry, senior analyst with Aite Group. “You see this more commonly in the credit union industry, with things like a shared branch network and shared technology,” she said. “It makes perfect sense for community banks, and I’m surprised they haven’t been doing it sooner.” Barry expects to see more cooperation between community banks as a strategy to compete against larger banks. “It’s kind of an us-against-them mentality,” she said. With the accelerator, First Federal is teaming up with larger banks. Its partners in the accelerator include Fifth Third Bancorp, Huntington Bancshares, KeyCorp and the insurer Progressive. JPMorgan Chase and Silicon Valley Bank are also part of the initiative. Fraser said the bank’s participation in the fintech accelerator is in part to help spur economic growth in the state and is “part of our role as a bank in fostering local communities economically.” Still, it is a prime chance to give fintechs a place to test their technology with an eye toward bringing it formally into the bank. “Having a seat at the table and access to fintech solutions is certainly a benefit to us,” Fraser said. “For ideas that fit into our business model, we can be in a position to deploy those solutions rapidly.” Fraser says regulators are becoming more open to collaboration between banks and “looking at how we can use existing rules to help banks work together.” Community banks should be at the forefront, Fraser said. “Look at what some of the larger banks are doing with Zelle,” he said. “There’s no reason why smaller banks can’t band together. Forty years ago, the payments system was built by banks in regional areas on a small scale, and then connected by nodes over time. The lesson from the past is banks can work together on innovation.” The investment in Numerated was another chance for First Federal to improve its offerings. “We saw great value in the technology, how they were using the data to deliver credit decisions,” Fraser said. “And we liked that they also had mutual-bank roots.” Fraser said First Federal was familiar with Eastern Bank, as executives from the two institutions would see each other "at various industry events. We had a good networking relationship.” After realizing how well the Numerated technology was working at Eastern, First Federal decided to become an investor when Eastern spun it out and licensed the technology for its own use. Fraser said the technology will help the bank compete against the customer experience offered by “the high-priced, nonbank solutions.” While First Federal’s moves will certainly give it a front row to some shiny new innovations, Fraser said the bank will stay focused on products that stand to benefit its core services. “Small-business lending is a big area for us, and we want those customers to have a great experience,” he said. “We look for what is a good cultural fit.” Areas the bank is considering for tech investment and partnership in the future include payments and mortgage lending, Fraser said. Expect other community bankers to go down the tech path together, says Frank Sorrentino, CEO of ConnectOne Bank in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., another tech-savvy community bank. (Sorrentino, however, declined to say what collaborations ConnectOne has in the works.) “You’re going to continue to see a pooling of resources" as community banks share the cost of technology, he said. “Or you’ll see a series of community banks come together with a technology partner to solve a particular issue.” Article The mortgage search goes digital Search habits and online lenders are forcing loan officers to step up their digital game to compete.

Oil futures have lost 8 per cent since the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed on May 25 to keep output constrained through the first quarter of 2018 in a bid to clear a global glut. While Goldman Sachs Group Inc expects their strategy to ultimately succeed, they warn the surplus may re-appear once the curbs end. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. say the group will have little choice but to stick with the cuts even longer. Resurgent supplies from US shale drillers and fading growth in fuel demand mean that world oil markets could face another overhang next year, the banks predict. That means Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two biggest producers in the 24-nation coalition, may need to deliver on their promise to do “whatever it takes” to restore equilibrium. “If Opec wants to keep the market balanced next year, they will probably need to extend the production cut to all of 2018,” Martijn Rats, managing director at Morgan Stanley in London, said by email. “Demand growth has slowed somewhat recently, and with US production growing strongly, there doesn’t seem to be much room for Opec production to grow in 2018.” Slow Recovery Production cuts are taking longer than expected to eliminate the surplus as US shale drillers boost production with surprising speed. American oil explorers, having learnt to operate more efficiently during a two-year market slump, have restored almost all the output lost during the downturn. As a result, the market may be unable to absorb the return of production halted by Opec and its partners when their pact ends in April. “The market isn’t able to see how Opec exits production cuts without creating huge surpluses in 2018,” said Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in New York. “We see risks for a renewed surplus later next year if Opec and Russia’s production rises to their expanded capacity and shale grows at an unbridled rate.” Still, even if a surplus re-emerges in 2018, Opec’s current efforts to deplete stockpiles will make their task of managing it easier, according to Citigroup Inc. While shale’s recovery means next year’s supply situation “looks weighty,” Opec’s output cuts now mean that if inventories accumulate again, it would be from a lower level, said Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. Those increases in inventories may nonetheless prove substantial enough to prevent prices gaining, said David Martin, an analyst at JPMorgan, who slashed his 2018 forecast for Brent crude by $10 a barrel to $45 on May 25. Brent traded near $49 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London on Friday. Even if Opec extends their output accord for all of next year, it may only succeed in stopping further stockpile increases, he said. “Opec may be shackled to its deal for a long time,” said Martin.

The ribbon cutting at the project's centerpiece urban village is a milestone for one of North Texas' most ambitious real estate endeavors. "This project took an army to develop," said Legacy West's Fehmi Karahan. "A project like this one has consumed me - night and day, seven days a week for about three years." Developed by Karahan, KDC and Columbus Realty Partners, Legacy West is located on the Dallas North Tollway and State Highway 121. Dallas' Sam Moon family switches orbits, from handbags to a Legacy West hotel in Plano The project was built on 250 acres of surplus land surrounding retailer J.C. Penney's headquarters. This weekend's celebration is to debut the Legacy West Urban Village, which has more than 300,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, about 300,000 square feet of office space, more than 1,000 apartments and a high-rise hotel. The retail and restaurant center and most of the office space is already rented.

(Ryan Michalesko/The Dallas Morning News) (Ryan Michalesko/Staff Photographer) Restaurants in Legacy West include Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House, Fogo de Chao, Mesero, Shake Shack, Taverna, True Food Kitchen and Toulouse. Legacy West's retailers include Bonobos, Coach, Fabletics, Filson, Johnny Was, Peter Millar, Pockets Menswear, Suitsupply, Tesla, Tommy Bahama, TUMI, and West Elm. "You can make great projects, but if you don't lease it doesn't work," Karahan said. "On the office leasing, we've been attracting some of the best names in the country." Aerospace giant Boeing recently announced plans to locate a new division headquarters in the Legacy West Urban Village. And Toyota has just started moving the first of thousands of workers into its new North American headquarters located just up the street. Liberty Mutual Insurance and JPMorgan Chase will start moving thousands more employees into Legacy West late this year. Plano's Legacy West adds Madewell, J. Crew, M.A.C and Levi's to store lineup More than 20,000 people will soon work in the development. "Welcome to the center of the universe," said Plano's mayor Harry LaRosiliere. "What makes this special is the sense of place created. "Anybody can build strip shopping centers," LaRosiliere said. "Only Fehmi Karahan can building Legacy West." Karahan developed Legacy West after having great success with the Shops at Legacy retail center he built on the east side of the tollway at Legacy Drive. "I had this dream to someday build something across the street," Karahan said. After petitioning Penney for years to develop its vacant land, the team of Karahan Cos., KDC and Columbus Realty were picked from a field of competing developers in early 2014. Just three months later in April of 2014 Toyota stunned the market when it announced it would build its new headquarters in Legacy West - joining FedEx Office as the first major companies in the mixed-use project. After Toyota's announcement, Legacy West took off. What was supposed to be a 10-year project is almost out of land and is recognized as one of the most successful such projects in the country. Plano's Legacy West celebrates grand opening with free bites and more delights "I'm proud to be involved in the partnership building this project," said Roger Staubach, the former Dallas Cowboys' star quarterback and a partner in Legacy West's apartments. "Legacy West is going to be outstanding. "People who live in the apartments are going to be able to walk to the finest retail experience in the Dallas area." Designed by architect Gensler, the $400 million Legacy West Urban Village was financed by JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Invesco Real Estate is a financial partner in the development. This weekend's grand opening events for the Legacy West Urban Village include live entertainment and drink tastings. Some of the retailers will be offering store discounts. Legacy West Urban Village includes more than 300,000 square feet of shops and restaurants and hundreds of new apartments.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad British shares near records on week before general election By Reuters Published: 12:59 EDT, 2 June 2017 | Updated: 12:59 EDT, 2 June 2017 e-mail By Helen Reid and Danilo Masoni LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - British shares climbed to fresh all-time peaks on Friday but pared most of their gains following disappointing jobs growth data in the U.S. that weighed on global equities. The FTSE 100 index of top UK blue chips rose 0.05 percent, off a peak of 7,598.99 points hit earlier in the day, while the domestically focused mid cap FTSE 250 index inched down 0.04 percent, reversing earlier gains. Britain holds a general election next Thursday that is likely to have an impact on how the country tackles talks on its exit from the European Union. "Clearly the upcoming election is a short term focus for the market, but the UK market is very international in its make-up ... and therefore insulated from domestic politics," said JPMorgan portfolio manager James Illsley. "As we have seen through the referendum last year, sterling will act as a natural shock absorber for the market - if the domestic outlook weakens or the political landscape becomes more challenged, sterling weakens thereby boosting the sterling value of those overseas earnings to domestic investors," he added. Some opinion polls point to a tighter-than-expected race, with the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Theresa May seeing its lead over the opposition Labour party dwindling. Consumer staples were the biggest boost to the FTSE, adding 10 points to the index with British American Tobacco and Unilever both up more than 1 percent. While the broader market was weighed down by the lackluster U.S. jobs data, gold prices rose near a six-week peak as the figures lowered expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year. That in turn boosted shares in precious metal miners Randgold and Fresnillo to the top of the FTSE with gains of 4 and 3.8 percent respectively. Energy stocks, however, weighed with oil major BP down 1.5 percent as Brent crude tumbled on worries that U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to abandon a climate pact could spark more crude drilling, worsening a global glut. Acacia Mining was a top mid-cap gainer, up 2.1 percent, after it maintained its full-year production guidance. The stock has lost a third of its value after a Tanzanian government investigation report found last month that the miner had under-declared precious metals in its exports. An upgrade to 'outperform' from Credit Suisse boosted Kaz Minerals by 1.3 percent. "Debt levels are high but, given the strong operational performance, new debt facilities raised, reduced project capex and the around $1.1 billion cash buffer, we see limited risk of a funding gap," said analysts at the Swiss bank. But B&amp;M European Value Retail fell 2.5 percent after major shareholders SSA Investments and CD&amp;R sold a combined 12.5 percent of the company.

Phil Mesman and his colleagues at Picton Mahoney Asset Management have been scooping up subordinated debt issued by the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc, and Credit Agricole SA in the 1980s and 1990s that is trading at a discount to face value. The goal is to get repaid early at a premium to the current price. This strategy, which began almost two years ago with a spreadsheet plotting the rather tiny universe of the asset class, has handed the firm’s funds returns of more than 20 percent, Mesman said. These legacy hybrid capital notes were originally issued to convert to equity in the event of a bank failure. They trade at a discount primarily because of the low coupon, which is based on a spread over the London interbank offered rate, and uncertainty around whether or not they will be repaid early, Mesman said. The bonds, which also have a liquidity discount, have a maturity of 25 years or longer in most cases, and some are perpetual bonds, he said. The bond covenants and structures are good for investors, because they make it difficult for a bank to convert the bonds to equity in the event it needs to shore up capital levels. Regulators have said that banks need to take out the bonds before Jan. 1, 2022, Mesman said, putting a deadline on opportunities in the trade. “It’s an incredible risk-reward,” Mesman, senior partner and portfolio manager, said by phone from Toronto. He manages more than C$700 million ($518 million) in fixed income of Picton’s C$6.8 billion of assets. “Typically they would be rated BB or higher-quality high-yield instruments, but the bank issuers are all investment grade.” Stamp Collecting Mesman estimates that his firm is one of only a few players in the $5 billion to $7 billion market, with most of the investors and dealers concentrated in Europe. The bonds represent about 30 percent of both Picton Mahoney’s main fund, the Fortified Income Fund, and the Income Opportunities Fund, as well as about 50 percent of the firm’s special-situations fund, he said. It’s a strategy that can only be pursued by knowledgeable investors who have flexibility with their investment horizon and don’t have to follow an index, Roger Francis, a credit analyst at Mizuho International Plc in London, said by phone. He said he’s heard the strategy compared to stamp collecting. “They’re rare and you find them in the back of drawers,” he said. “It’s a relatively small asset class.” The main risks with these old bank bonds is liquidity -- they’re difficult to trade in tough market conditions -- and that a bank will opt not to call or tender for them early, Francis said. The strategy hinges on correctly identifying which bonds are candidates to be repaid early, or which banks might be willing to negotiate, Mesman said. Direct Approach “If we find a bond where perhaps 50 percent to 60 percent of the issue has already been tendered over the years, then we’ll approach them directly and offer them our bonds at a certain price,” he said. Credit Agricole recently tendered for 371.23 million euros of a perpetual bond at 78 cents on the euro, but investors only took them up on part of the offer, suggesting that they’re waiting for a higher payout, Mesman said. His firm sold 25 percent of their 25 million euro position in the bond and are waiting for a higher price for the rest, he said. To be sure, there has been some headline uncertainty with some banks in Europe, Mesman said. Deutsche Bank AG, UniCredit SpA, and other European banks have in the past been at risk of not paying the coupons on their bonds. While failure to pay interest would be tantamount to default for most debt securities, coupon payments on newer contingent convertible bonds, known as CoCos, are discretionary. Once missed, though, they are gone forever. With their strategy, Mesman and colleagues focus on buying older notes generally from U.K. and U.S. banks. They also hedge using tools including bank stock and currencies, he said. The bonds generally pay in U.S. dollars. “We’re looking for situations where they’re taking them out sooner, ideally within the next 12 months,” he said. This article was provided by Bloomberg News.

Photos Videos Topics Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Business News WRAPUP 4-U.S. job growth slows; unemployment rate drops to 4.3 percent Shares0 Fri, 2 Jun 2017-10:09pm , Reuters U.S. job growth slowed in May and employment gains in the prior two months were not as strong as previously reported, suggesting the labor market was losing momentum despite the unemployment rate falling to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent. Nonfarm payrolls increased 138,000 last month as the manufacturing, government and retail sectors lost jobs, the Labor Department said on Friday. The economy created 66,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in March and April. Last month's job gains could still be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its June 13-14 policy meeting. The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. "While the message was a little muddied today, the evidence generally suggests the labor market is cyclically tightening, and the Fed will need to continue to lean against that," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. "We still believe it is very likely that the Fed will hike later this month. Perhaps more in question is the signal coming out of that meeting regarding subsequent hikes." Details of the employment report were weak. Though the unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to its lowest level since May 2001, that was because 429,000 people dropped out of the labor force. The survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived also showed a drop in employment. The jobless rate has declined five-tenths of a percentage point this year. Average hourly earnings rose four cents or 0.2 percent in May after a similar gain in April, leaving the year-on-year increase in wages at 2.5 percent. Job growth has decelerated from the 181,000 monthly average over the past 12 months as the labor market nears full employment. There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find qualified workers. Economists also believe that companies might be holding off hiring amid worries political scandals engulfing President Donald Trump could imperil his economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. "Political uncertainty in Washington is another factor holding back the job market," said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo. "The probability that any of the Trump stimulus would become reality has decreased significantly in recent weeks." Economists had forecast payrolls increasing by 185,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4 percent. U.S. financial markets are almost pricing in a 25 basis point increase in the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate this month, according to CME FedWatch. The dollar fell to seven-month lows on views the jobs data could portend diminished chances for a Fed rate hike in the second half of the year. Long-dated U.S. Treasury yields fell to nearly seven-month lows, and short-dated yields touched their lowest in more than two weeks, but U.S. stocks edged up to new highs.. SHRINKING LABOR MARKET SLACK The modest payrolls gain could temper expectations of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter after gross domestic product increased at a tepid 1.2 percent annualized rate at the start of the year. While consumer spending picked up in April, a second report on Friday showed the trade deficit widening 5.2 percent to $47.6 billion. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter. There was some good news in the employment report. A broad measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4 percent, the lowest since November 2007. As a result, the spread between the jobless rate and this broad unemployment gauge, considered a better measure of labor market slack, was the smallest since early 2008. But the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. The volatile 16-24 age group accounted for much of the drop in the participation rate last month, suggesting a rebound is likely. Manufacturing employment fell by 1,000 jobs last month as payrolls in the automobile sector dropped 1,500 amid declining sales. Ford Motor Co said last month it planned to cut 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia through voluntary early retirement and other financial incentives. Construction payrolls rose 11,000 last month after decreasing by 1,000 jobs in April. Retail employment fell 6,100, declining for a fourth straight month, with department stores shedding 3,700 jobs. Department store chains like J.C. Penney Co Inc, Macy's Inc and Abercrombie & Fitch are struggling against stiff competition from online retailers led by Amazon . Nonstore retailers, including online merchants, hired 2,900 workers last month. Government employment decreased 9,000 last month, with state and local governments accounting for all the decrease.

No pricing details were given in the filing, but the offering is valued up to $75 million. The company intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol MRSN. The underwriters for the offering are JPMorgan, Cowen, Leerink Partners and Wedbush PacGrow. This clinical stage biopharmaceutical company is focused on developing antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) that offer a clinically meaningful benefit for cancer patients with significant unmet need. Mersana has leveraged 20 years of industry learning in the ADC field to develop proprietary technologies that enable it to design ADCs to have improved efficacy, safety and tolerability relative to existing ADC therapies. Its most advanced platform, Dolaflexin, has been used to generate a pipeline of proprietary ADC product candidates to address patient populations that are not currently amenable to treatment with traditional ADC-based therapies. The lead product candidate, XMT-1522, is a HER2-targeted ADC currently in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in primarily breast cancer patients, with interim safety results expected by the end of 2017. Upon the completion of dose escalation, Mersana plans to expand clinical development of XMT-1522 into additional breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and gastric cancer patient populations, all of which are not addressed by existing HER2 therapies. The second product candidate, XMT-1536, is an ADC targeting NaPi2b, an antigen broadly expressed in ovarian cancer and NSCLC. The firm expects XMT-1536 to enter clinical development in early 2018. Its current product candidates, all based on the Dolaflexin platform. Mersana intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for: Phase 1 clinical trial of XMT-1522 Preclinical activities and Phase 1 clinical trial of XMT-1536 New and ongoing research activities The remainder of the net proceeds will be put toward working capital and other general corporate purposes.

Climate pact pull-out suggests ‘America Alone’ 2 Jun 2017 Companies JPMorgan’s Dimon says he disagrees on Paris accord exit 2 Jun 2017 US President Donald Trump insisted withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs – but plenty of American companies seemed to disagree. Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip firms while the response from fossil fuel groups was muted. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils. “Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk wrote on Twitter. Trump pulls US out of climate pact: is China set to lead? Iger followed suit, saying he was resigning from the panels “as a matter of principle.” Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, also disagreed with Trump’s decision. “I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment,” Dimon said in a statement. Other business leaders were even more emphatic in their criticism of the decision. “Today’s decision is a setback for the environment and for the US’s leadership position in the world,” said Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein. General Electric’s Jeff Immelt tweeted: “Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead.” Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote: “Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet” and “Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver”. Catastrophic climate change is more likely, Donald Trump has just made sure of that There is a pathway here where the rest of America in reaction to, really, what is an insane decision by President Trump, takes the kind of steps needed California Governor Jerry Brown Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted: “Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children’s future at risk.” Meanwhile, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, offered an opaque response. “What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognise the role of all sources of energy, including coal,” Sporton said, adding his group had outlined to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement. Within hours of Trump announcing his decision, a coalition emerged of state governors and city mayors who declared they would adhere to the Paris agreement, even if the White House would not. “There is a pathway here where the rest of America in reaction to, really, what is an insane decision by President Trump, takes the kind of steps needed,” said California Governor Jerry Brown, who was joined by the governors of Washington and New York, who also called for a “climate alliance”. Brown was on his way to China overnight, and planned to lead a conference of states and other “sub-national” actors making voluntary commitments to cut greenhouse grasses. Brown said he would also explore the possibility of integrating California and Chinese provincial carbon trading systems. That would be a “heavy lift” Brown said, but “I am going to discuss that with the highest officials in China this week”.

Bosses from the likes of American banking giants Citigroup and JP Morgan - along with Russia's VTB and France's Societe Generale - bemoaned the effects of Brexit, which they said will continue to plague the UK long after its official departure from the EU in 2019. Speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in Russia, Daniel Pinto, the chief executive of JP Morgan's corporate and investment bank, said: "I think going forward you will be in a scenario where the Europeans want to have a substantial financial services industry in their territory. "So it's likely that the migration will continue in the years to come, probably it will take five to 10 years and you will see the full effect of the decision that the UK is taking today." His comments came after Mrs May claimed that it "would not be sensible" to see a diminished City. "I think they (EU countries) all benefit from the expertise, the skills, the size and the capability of the City and anything that diminished that would not be sensible for them," she said. The Prime Minister also said she would work with the Square Mile to get a good deal for the financial services industry, if she manages to convince the electorate to vote her back into power next week. However, Mr Pinto confirmed that JP Morgan is preparing for a scenario where there is "no deal" with the EU, where passporting rights for financial services are scrapped. "That scenario assumes that there is no change in regulation at all, and I think that over time we will see the real effect," Mr Pinto said. He added: "I think that at the beginning there is an interest on both sides that whatever everyone does in every sector creates the minimum amount of disruption." James Cowles, Citigroup's chief executive for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), said he agreed that the City's fortunes might not be fully revealed for another five to 10 years and said the bank was similarly planning for the "worst case" scenario from Brexit negotiations. He said: "From a financial industries perspective, financial markets, it's unfortunate. "We had a system that worked. I think passporting worked and I think as we move forward we're going to spend the next two years, spending a lot of time and resources trying to get to a position that's not as favourable as we have today." Societe Generale chief executive Frederic Oudea added that Brexit could present an "extraordinary window of opportunity" for the EU. "I think we have an extraordinary window of opportunity to think strategically to think about the financial services in the Eurozone, and which is needed not just for the financial services (industry) or for banks, but for growth." 2 June 2017 3:45PM View comments Most Commented Carlisle couple subjected to online abuse over daughter's temporary tattoo 8 Carlisle school head urges parents to donate paper, pencils and crayons 6 Anti-Tory election campaign launches in Carlisle 3 Carlisle businessman calls for post-Brexit vaping reforms 2 Wembley cup win for Carlisle school youngsters 2 Most Read Carlisle cyclist seriously hurt in crash Cumbrian couple not heard from since they missed flight home Fire "destroys" kitchen of north Cumbrian pub Boy, 11, fell 30ft through roof of Carlisle furniture store Police make arrest after robbery at corner shop More news   Police in Southwark Bridge Road near the scene of Saturday's terrorist incidents London terror attack: Police search two more homes Harry House, pictured, died after Joseph Eke punched or kicked him after losing his temper Man faces sentence for 'losing temper' and murdering two-year-old Harry Amber Rudd won a High Court order last November preventing the disclosure of ''sensitive material'' at the inquest Russian whistleblower's inquest due to start amid poison soup allegations Lotan Carter is one of the Big Brother housemates Big Brother goes head to head with Love Island Ariana Grande, left, and Miley Cyrus performing during the One Love Manchester benefit concert for the victims of the Manchester Arena terror attack Tears as Ariana Grande leads 'night of love' at Manchester benefit concert Quick searches Carlisle Airport Carlisle United Court cases Cumberland Infirmary Sellafield West Cumberland Hospital Featured articles   Olly Murs on the main stage at BBC Radio One's Big Weekend at Carlisle in May 2011 Olly Murs promises madness and craziness at Carlisle gig The Cumberland Show Cumberland Show: All you need to know about this year's event STUART WALKER David Beesley ‘It’s a cruel thing, my dad lasted two years’ Jo Reid and daughter Hannah Reid enjoy a dance together Lost in music.

By Grant Smith As oil prices sag despite OPEC’s renewed efforts to shore up world crude markets, Wall Street banks have more bad news for the producer group: the outlook for next year isn’t great either. Oil futures have lost 8 per cent since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed on May 25 to keep output constrained through the first quarter of 2018 in a bid to clear a global glut. While Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects their strategy to ultimately succeed, they warn the surplus may re-appear once the curbs end. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. say the group will have little choice but to stick with the cuts even longer. Resurgent supplies from US shale drillers and fading growth in fuel demand mean that world oil markets could face another overhang next year, the banks predict. That means Saudi Arabia and Russia, the two biggest producers in the 24-nation coalition, may need to deliver on their promise to do “whatever it takes” to restore equilibrium. “If Opec wants to keep the market balanced next year, they will probably need to extend the production cut to all of 2018,” Martijn Rats, managing director at Morgan Stanley in London, said by email. “Demand growth has slowed somewhat recently, and with US production growing strongly, there doesn’t seem to be much room for Opec production to grow in 2018.” Slow Recovery Production cuts are taking longer than expected to eliminate the surplus as US shale drillers boost production with surprising speed. American oil explorers, having learned to operate more efficiently during a two-year market slump, have restored almost all the output lost during the downturn. As a result, the market may be unable to absorb the return of production halted by Opec and its partners when their pact ends in April. “The market isn’t able to see how Opec exits production cuts without creating huge surpluses in 2018,” said Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs in New York. “We see risks for a renewed surplus later next year if Opec and Russia’s production rises to their expanded capacity and shale grows at an unbridled rate.” Still, even if a surplus re-emerges in 2018, OPEC’s current efforts to deplete stockpiles will make their task of managing it easier, according to Citigroup Inc. While shale’s recovery means next year’s supply situation “looks weighty,” OPEC’s output cuts now mean that if inventories accumulate again, it would be from a lower level, said Ed Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. Those increases in inventories may nonetheless prove substantial enough to prevent prices gaining, said David Martin, an analyst at JPMorgan, who slashed his 2018 forecast for Brent crude by $10 a barrel to $45 on May 25. Brent traded near $49 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London on Friday. Even if Opec extends their output accord for all of next year, it may only succeed in stopping further stockpile increases, he said. “OPEC may be shackled to its deal for a long time,” said Martin.

By Matt Egan NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Jamie Dimon isn't quitting Team Trump, despite opposing the decision to yank the United States from the Paris climate accord. "I absolutely disagree with the Administration on this issue," the JPMorgan Chase CEO said in a statement on Friday. But Dimon doesn't plan to follow Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney boss Bob Iger by stepping down from President Trump's business advisory council. "We have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said. A JPMorgan spokeswoman confirmed that Dimon does not plan to leave the the council, which is called the Strategic and Policy Forum. By contrast, Musk followed through on his threat to quit that forum as well as the president's manufacturing jobs initiative. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said on Twitter shortly after Trump's White House announcement on leaving the climate deal. Dimon did express disappointment with Trump, echoing concerns raised by fellow Wall Street bigwig Lloyd Blankfein. The Goldman Sachs CEO sent his first-ever tweet on Thursday to call Trump's Paris move a "setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world." Blankfein is not a member of Trump's advisory council. Dimon's statement suggests he wants to continue to have a voice in Trump's agenda, which includes plans to rip up rules governing Wall Street. The stocks of JPMorgan and other banks spiked after the election, in part because of Trump's pledge to "do a big number" on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Bank stocks have given back some of their post-election gains amid disappointment with slow progress on tax reform and deregulation. JPMorgan stock is up 19% since Trump's victory.

MSFT, +2.37%  Earlier, the average touched a record intraday high of 21,225.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.94%  climbed 58.97 points, or 0.9%, to close at a record 6,305.80, after touching an intraday high of 6,308.76. Along with all three main indexes closing at records, the Dow industrials finished the week up 0.6%, the S&P 500 advanced 1%, and the Nasdaq gained 1.5%. The May nonfarm payrolls data showed the economy added 138,000 jobs last month, coming in below Wall Street economists’ forecasts. The details of the jobs report were also weaker than expected. The number of job gains for April and March were revised lower. The unemployment rate slipped to 4.3% but the decline was largely due to shrinking labor force. Average wages rose 0.2% to $26.22 an hour, in line with expectations. “This is undoubtedly a weak jobs report, especially with downward revisions. But it’s just one data point that will not change the Fed’s course, which is to raise rates at its June meeting,” said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird & Co. “Nonfarm payrolls month-to-month is a very jumpy number and a one-off weakness should not be seen as a beginning of a trend. For example, we’ve had a very poor print in May 2016, with 43,000 jobs. Since then, the S&P 500 is up about 400 points,” Antonelli said. Read: The S&P 500 has never had a down year after a start like 2017 Despite the unexpectedly low print on the jobs report, expectations for a rate increase in June didn’t fall. Fed fund futures are pricing in a 91% probability of a rate increase this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. While a June hike is widely expected, the weak jobs number and tepid wage growth may give the Fed pause when it comes to other rate increases this year, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management, in an interview. “Wage growth is not fabulous, and maybe that gives the Fed room to sit on rates,” Nolte said. “Markets love a near-zero rate.” Should inflation trends and weakness persist then it’s entirely possible that a rate increase in June could be the last one of 2017, and with Treasury yields at unexpected lows, equities become one of the few games in town for a return, said Nolte. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.44%  fell nearly 6 basis points to 2.154%, declining below its 200-day moving average for the first time since October. Meanwhile, the dollar weakened against other major currencies, with the ICE U.S. Dollar index DXY, +0.04%  last down less than 0.1% at 96.68. Other markets: Oil prices CLN7, +1.24%  fell 1.5% to settle at $47.66 a barrel for a three-week low on Friday, partly driven by concerns that President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord will lead to an increase in U.S. oil output. The Nikkei 225 index NIK, +0.04%  closed above the key 20,000 level, adding 1.6% as the Japanese yen eased against the dollar USDJPY, +0.16% European stocks SXXP, +0.23%  finished higher, and the FTSE 100 UKX, +0.05% pared back from an intraday high to close up less than 0.1%. Gold prices GCQ7, +0.25%  rose 0.8% to settle at $1,280.20 an ounce. Individual stocks: Shares of Broadcom Limited AVGO, +8.50%  finished up 8.5% after reporting earnings. Shares of Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, +11.55%  shot up nearly 12% after the apparel-maker posted first-quarter results that beat expectations and announced a shake-up of its Ivivva brand, late Thursday. Leading the slump in energy were shares of Devon Energy Corp. DVN, -3.33% Newfield Exploration Co. NFX, -5.02% Range Resources Corp. RRC, -3.89% all of which finished down 3% or more, while Transocean Ltd. RIG, -2.17%  shares declined 2.2%. Shares of Cooper Cos. COO, +8.43%  rallied 8.4% after Raymond James raised its price target of medical device company’s stock. Shares of Delta Air Lines DAL, +2.69%  advanced 2.7% after the company reported its monthly operating performance. Shares of RH Inc.

(Reuters) President Donald Trump’s decision to abandon the Paris climate accord touched off a furious and immediate backlash, igniting condemnation from C-suites and capitals around the world. But one man was left a clear winner. China’s President Xi Jinping now has another opportunity to burnish his country’s image as a clean-energy innovator and global champion in fighting climate change. Not a bad spot for the world’s No. 1 polluter. Xi has been deliberate in moving into the spaces Trump abandons. He runs a command economy but told the global elite at Davos this year that China is now a bastion of free trade. His Belt and Road Forum last month was meant to prove China — not the U.S. — is now in the vanguard of globalization. China’s also getting friendlier with Germany’s Angela Merkel, who can barely hide her growing distaste for Trump. Watch video here: Trump now is alone and isolated. His rhetoric explaining the decision may play well in some working-class precincts in Pittsburgh but in Paris, Emmanuel Macron is all but mocking him: “Make our planet great again,” he tweeted. Now China may be only too happy to grab that slogan for itself. Global Headlines CEO outrage | Normally, global executives applaud attempts to roll back regulation. And Trump’s announcement was hardly a shock. But the reaction from most CEOs was striking in its outrage. Goldman Sachs’s Lloyd Blankfein took to Twitter for the first time to slam it, while Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan said he will continue to press for emissions controls. Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, meanwhile, said the decision made him want to cry. What does it mean for investors? | The biggest winners from Trump’s decision are oil, coal and natural gas producers. And even they aren’t popping Champagne corks. As Joe Ryan and Naureen Malik write today, that’s because individual government policies around the world, changing economics and cheaper solar power are already spurring a shift toward cleaner energy. So while Trump quitting Paris may be a boon for fossil fuels, it’s not necessarily moving markets. Trump asks Supreme Court to revive travel ban | The administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to immediately reinstate its stalled travel ban, aiming to reverse a string of courtroom losses and setting up the biggest legal showdown of the young presidency. The case – Trump’s first initiative to go before the high court – brings the nine justices into a dispute over claims that the president is targeting Muslims. May goes easy on Trump | While Germany, France and Italy protested in unison at Trump’s climate decision, Britain’s Theresa May waited more than three hours to respond and when she did, she merely expressed her “disappointment.” Her reticence was another sign of the distance opening up between the U.K. and Europe ahead of the Brexit talks and showed how careful she’s trying to be with Trump as she eyes an eventual free-trade deal. Is Putin trolling America? | The Russian president yesterday gave his strongest hint yet that Russian hackers could have been involved in interfering with foreign elections. While repeating past denials that he had anything to do with the cyber attacks on Hillary Clinton, Putin told reporters that he couldn’t rule out involvement by free-spirited and patriotic “artists” who want to strike back against foreign criticism of their country. Manila casino horror | At least 36 people died at a casino and hotel in the Philippine capital after a gunman opened fire and torched the complex. The dead appeared to have suffocated in thick smoke, police said, after the assailant killed himself. The incident sparked a security lock down amid fears that Islamist militants from the country’s south were responsible, but authorities have now ruled out terrorism and say the perpetrator may have been mentally disturbed. Mexico’s populists are on the move | The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party has dominated the country’s political landscape for nearly nine decades, and in that time has never lost control of Mexico State. But as Nacha Cattan writes, surging crime, stagnant wages, corruption and Trump mean the governorship is now up for grabs. Should arch-populist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador emerge victorious from Sunday’s vote, it could set him up to win next year’s presidential election. Lewandowski and Kushner hug it out | Ousted Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski’s relationship with Trump’s son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, seems to be on the mend. The pair’s Rose Garden stroll this week ended in a hug, a sign that Kushner may no longer be a barrier to Lewandowski, now a private consultant, working more closely with the White House. And finally… At an economic summit in Russia, newly minted NBC host Megyn Kelly bantered with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as she prepared to host a panel with the two leaders later today. “Are you on Twitter?” she asked Modi in St Petersburg. “Yes!” he boomed. India’s leader actually has has more than 30 million Twitter followers. (For anyone keeping score, Kelly has 2.3 million.) Here’s how some of the world’s most-followed leaders rank. No Comments.
