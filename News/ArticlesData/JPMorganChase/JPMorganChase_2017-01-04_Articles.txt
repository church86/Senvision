Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 January 20175 January 2017 by Final Results LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE ANNOUNCEMENT   JPMORGAN ASIAN INVESTMENT TRUST PLC   FINAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30TH SEPTEMBER 2016 The Directors of JPMorgan Asian Investment Trust plc announce the Company’s results for the year ended 30th September 2016.   CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT   Performance I am very pleased to report that in the year to 30th September 2016 the Company’s return on net assets was +41.3%. The return to shareholders was +38.7%, reflecting a disappointing widening of the Company’s discount from 11.7% to 13.4%. These results marked a continuation of the positive turnaround in the Company’s performance, with the return on net assets representing an outperformance against its benchmark, the MSCI Asia ex Japan Index, of 5.1 percentage points, building on the 3.4 percentage points outperformance in 2015. It is also a point of pride to note that our recent investment returns have been accomplished with the lowest total charges ratio of all our peers in the Asia ex-Japan sector. Continuing Appointment of the Manager Earlier in the year JPMorgan Funds Limited (‘JPMF’) informed the Board that one of the Company’s investment managers, Sonia Yu, had left JPMorgan Asset Management (‘JPMAM’) to pursue other interests. The Board subsequently approved the appointment of Ayaz Ebrahim, a managing director and portfolio manager at JPMAM, as her replacement. Mr Ebrahim, who is based in Hong Kong, chairs JPMAM’s Asia Pacific Asset Allocation Committee within the Emerging Markets and Asia Pacific (‘EMAP’) equities team. Although he has only been in the role for a short period, Mr Ebrahim has already proved to be a valuable addition to the investment team managing the assets of your Company. Richard Titherington, the Chief Investment Officer of EMAP, continues to manage the Company’s portfolio alongside Mr Ebrahim. The Company’s Manager, JPMF, has now delivered two consecutive years of strong relative investment performance. The Board is confident in its continuing ability to deliver satisfactory results and has therefore resolved that JPMF remain as the Company’s Manager. Continuation Vote Pursuant to the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board is required to put a triennial continuation vote to shareholders. Since the last time this requirement was enacted by the Company was in 2014, a continuation vote will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 2nd February 2017. Given the performance returns highlighted above, your Board has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that they vote in favour of the Company continuing as an investment trust for a further three year period. Revenue and Final Dividend Revenue per share for the year amounted to 3.48p and the Board is recommending a final dividend of 3.0p which, if approved by shareholders, will be payable on 6th February 2017 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 13th January 2017. Proposed Change in Discount Management and Dividend Policy Subject to the relevant shareholder approvals at the Annual General Meeting in 2017, the Board has approved the implementation of changes aimed at narrowing the Company’s discount. It has been the Board’s stated objective for a number of years to stabilise the discount at a level no wider than between 8 and 10 per cent. under normal market conditions. The Board has been disappointed and concerned by the widening of the Company’s discount over the year, particularly against the background of strong investment performance. Widening of discounts has been a feature not only of Asian regional funds this year but also across the investment trust industry generally for many non-income focused funds. The Company’s discount was consistently higher than 10 per cent. over the financial year and we have therefore, for some time, been actively considering our current discount control policy. We believe that, over the longer term, an effective discount control policy must address the concerns of current investors and make the Company more attractive to new investors at the same time. The two major mechanisms we have deployed over the past few years to try to reduce the discount have been periodic, semi-annual tender offers and more regular share buybacks. On the subject of tenders, our experience has been that, whilst offering liquidity to those shareholders electing to participate, tenders per se at tight discounts were not having a measurable effect in reducing the discount, were mainly subscribed by larger institutional holders and not favoured by most shareholders, were delivering nugatory NAV uplift to remaining shareholders and at the same time were shrinking the size and consequently the market attractiveness of the Company. Our issued share capital has contracted significantly over recent years, mainly as a result of tender offers, and we believe that this contraction has been detrimental to the attractiveness of the Company in the market. Turning to buybacks, the Board and its advisers concluded, over the course of the past year, that market conditions were such that there was no certainty that conducting share buybacks on a standalone basis would have a lasting, or even temporary, impact in reducing the Company’s discount.  Accordingly, no share buybacks were enacted by the Company in this financial year.  The Directors nonetheless continue to see the merits of buybacks as a means of addressing imbalances in supply and demand and of reducing the discount and will again propose a resolution at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to authorise the Company to repurchase its Ordinary shares. The overall objective will remain, namely stabilising the discount at a level no wider than between 8 to 10 per cent. in normal market conditions.   As the Board remains dissatisfied with the Company’s current discount level, it has been actively considering other approaches for reducing the discount on a sustainable basis and has been considering the views of our shareholders as provided to our advisers. One point that became clear was that the bulk of new demand for investment trust shares now comes from retail investors. Against the background of the low yields now available from many asset classes, these new investors are particularly interested in shares that offer an attractive, predictable and regular dividend. With this in mind, and as previously announced to shareholders on 21st December 2016, the Board is proposing a new dividend policy under which it aims to pay, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, a regular quarterly dividend equivalent to 1% of the Company’s NAV on the last business day of each financial quarter, being the end of December, March, June and September. This dividend will be paid from a combination of the revenue and capital reserves. The Board will propose a resolution at the Annual General Meeting to amend the Company’s Articles of Association to allow the Company to distribute capital as dividends, to allow for the long-term implementation of the new dividend policy. The proposed changes to the Company’s Articles of Association are explained in the Director’s Report on page 26.  This proposed change in dividend policy will not be accompanied by a change in the investment policy of the Company. The Board takes the view that any demand placed on the investment managers to seek a higher income yield from the portfolio may be at the expense of the total returns available to shareholders.  By dissociating the dividend policy of the Company from the split of capital and revenue returns generated from its current investment policy, the Board expects to attract new buyers for the Company’s shares, whilst maintaining the portfolio’s ability to generate attractive total returns with a low level of attrition to the capital base of the Company.    As part of its deliberations, the Board asked its advisers to secure feedback from shareholders (on a no names basis) as to their views on increasing the dividend yield by paying dividends out of capital. Whilst there was a broad spectrum of opinion, we believe that our shareholders are generally supportive of a move designed to stimulate new buying interest in the Company and hence lead to a reduction in the discount. The Board expects this change of policy to be permanent. However, it will keep the policy (and its expected positive impact on discount level) under constant review and may amend it in the light of potential changes in the expected total returns to be earned from the portfolio or changes in the nature of returns desired by shareholders. Should the Resolution to permit the necessary changes to the Company’s Articles of Association be approved, the new distribution policy will be effective for the year that commenced on 1st October 2016 and the first dividend payable on the new basis will be calculated by reference to the Company’s net assets on 31st December 2016. This first quarterly dividend will be payable on 6th February 2017, at the same time as the 2016 final dividend, to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 13th January 2017. As the Company’s cum income NAV on 31st December 2016 was 309.90 pence per share, this first new quarterly dividend will amount to 3.1 pence per share, resulting in a total distribution of 6.1 pence per share on 6th February 2017. The Board expects that a combination of this new distribution policy, alongside the more traditional and consistent use of share buybacks, will be effective in tightening the discount at which your Company trades at a level no wider than between 8 to 10 per cent. The Board therefore recommends these proposals to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting. Gearing The Company’s £25 million three year multicurrency loan facility with Scotiabank expired in December 2016. The facility was renewed with Scotiabank at the level of £40 million, with the option of further increasing the facility to £60 million. In agreement with the Board, the investment managers increased gearing during the year and it stood at 5% at the year end. Gearing remains one of the key benefits of the closed end structure of investment trusts and, if implemented well, can enhance returns to shareholders. The investment management team has developed a model to assist with gearing decisions and the signals from the model are discussed with Directors at each Board meeting. Board of Directors As previously reported, I will retire at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. I have had the privilege of serving on the Board of JPMorgan Asian Investment Trust since 1997 and although the Company has faced some challenging periods during my tenure, I am pleased to be leaving the Board with a strong investment team in charge, much improved performance and a dedicated Board of Directors to take the Company forward. I would like to thank shareholders, my fellow Directors and the team at JPMorgan for their many years of support. I am delighted that Bronwyn Curtis, a Director since 2013, will be appointed Chairman upon my retirement, subject to her reappointment by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Having served as a Director since 2009, James Strachan has decided also to retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. I thank James for his strong contribution to the deliberations of the Board during his tenure and wish him well for the future. The implementation of the Company’s succession plan to refresh the Board has continued with the appointment of Peter Moon as a Director from 3rd August 2016. Peter has a strong background in investment management, notably as the former chief investment officer of the Universities Superannuation Scheme. He will stand for reappointment at the Annual General Meeting and I look forward to introducing him to shareholders at this event. There is a formal process each year for evaluating the performance of the Board, its Committees, individual Directors and myself as Chairman. The performance reviews this year having been completed. Mrs Curtis and Messrs. Buckley, Gould and Moon will stand for reappointment at the Annual General Meeting and I warmly endorse and recommend them. Annual General Meeting This year’s Meeting will be held at 60 Victoria Embankment, London EC4Y 0JP on Thursday, 2nd February 2017 at 12.00 noon. In addition to the formal proceedings, shareholders will have the opportunity to meet Richard Titherington, who will be presenting and will be available to respond to questions on the Company’s portfolio, the investment team’s strategy and the outlook for Asian markets. Following the Meeting there will be an opportunity for shareholders to meet the Board, investment management personnel and other Company advisers informally and I look forward to seeing as many of you as possible. Conclusion It is customary in Japan, upon news of the demise of the Emperor, for stock markets to dip slightly out of respect. Since I announced my intention to retire from the Company, by contrast, our share price has raced to all-time highs. I like to think that this is on the back of our recent excellent absolute and relative returns, but I can also happily live with the notion that the market believes that the Company is now set fair to accomplish even better things under my successor’s leadership. The one aspect that gives more than a tinge of lingering disappointment to my term, however, is the seemingly remorseless rise of the discount over recent years. In rough terms, the Company is valued by the market at some £50 million less than its break-up value: that is c.£50 million we have constantly to try to recoup, if for no other reason than that it is a loss of value for shareholders that dwarfs our average annual total return. I have seen such impressive and positive changes in the processes and people at our investment manager in recent years and am so pleased that these are now being translated into solid delivery of outperformance. And yet, the discount stubbornly remains wide. As that can, ultimately, only be because there are more sellers than buyers, I commend the new dividend policy to shareholders, for outperformance alone cannot be relied upon to generate buying interest in an acceptable time frame: we have to attract new retail buyers. I hope and expect that the increased dividend yield, coupled with the more consistent use of share buybacks will be effective, in that regard for the benefit of all shareholders. I am delighted that Bronwyn Curtis is taking over from me as Chairman and, although I sometimes like to think that the Company is now simply going to move smoothly upwards, with turbulence and underperformance a thing of the past, I know that Asia will continue to be an exciting investment ride for her and the Board and I will continue to watch the market swings, from elation to despair, with keen interest going forward. I leave the Company in very good hands, in very good shape and with my very best wishes.   James M Long Chairman                                                                                                                                              5 January 2017   INVESTMENT MANAGERS’ REPORT Summary During the year under review, the Company’s return on net assets was +41.3%, outperforming Asian stock markets, as measured by the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan Index, which delivered a +36.2% return in sterling terms. In this report, we discuss the market backdrop, examine the drivers of the Company’s performance and then consider the outlook for Asian stock markets in 2017. Market Review Asian equities rose over the 12 months to 30th September 2016, however, the period was characterised by high levels of volatility with a strong rally from October 2015 followed by a sharp sell-off at the beginning of 2016 from which the market rose steadily. Key catalysts for this volatility include the ever-changing outlook for US interest rates and the resulting direction of the US dollar, commodity prices including oil, iron ore and coal, the UK leaving the European Union, and importantly, the trajectory of economic growth and policy changes in China. The calendar year 2016 began with a sharp drop in the oil price with Brent Crude Oil falling to 34 US dollars per barrel and resulting deflationary worries weighed on emerging market and Asian economies. As markets and commodity prices corrected, expectations of rate hikes in the US were reduced and by February markets priced the probability of less than one additional hike in 2016 which, ultimately contributed to a correction in the US dollar, a favourable development for many markets in Asia. Importantly, this coincided with policy stimulus in China and a stabilisation of the Renminbi following a period of depreciation in the summer of 2016 which market participants interpreted as a reactive move to slowing growth. Explicit commitments to reinforce stronger fixings in the exchange rate were taken positively. Despite the challenging conditions for the Chinese economy overall, the shift from central bank rate cuts to more explicit fiscal stimulus and policy measures led to a strong recovery in areas such as auto sales. With 10 year government bond rates stabilising at 3% and a slowing of non-performing loans, bank shares outperformed the market. The ‘new economy’ also continued to perform well with some of China’s leading internet companies posting strong revenue and earnings growth. Overall, the Chinese government is trying to adjust to a slower rate of economic growth and they have found it challenging to design policies to address excessive capacity in manufacturing industries without leading to even slower economic growth. Reform across the region was a major theme and positive change that also contributed to a re-rating of equity markets. In India the passing of the goods and services tax bill (GST) was an important step for the Narendra Modi-led government and removes a big road block in implementing what is possibly the biggest structural reform in India since 1992. Although economic growth in India has taken longer to recover than the market has expected, sentiment was also boosted by the appointment of Dr. Urjit Patel as the new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor. This appointment helped reassure investors that the RBI would continue with its macro stability policy focus and inflation targeting. In Indonesia, the passing of the tax amnesty bill was a major achievement for the Joko Widodo led government. With a low and falling tax take in the Indonesian economy, the bill is key to helping reduce the budget deficit and ultimately leading to the government’s ability to fund more infrastructure projects, of which the country is badly in need. In addition, the reappointment of Ms. Sri Mulyani Indrawati as Minister of Finance, who previously held the role from 2005 to 2010, was seen as further evidence that the Joko Widodo government is seriously addressing reform issues. Minister Indrawati has a distinguished record, having also worked as a Chief Operating Officer at the World Bank. Asian markets continued to rally towards the end of the reporting year. The Chinese Insurance Regulatory Commission approved mainland insurance companies to invest directly in Hong Kong shares via the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect. Furthermore it was confirmed that the connect programme would be extended to the Shenzhen exchange. Such developments were positive and important in China’s long but challenging journey of structural reform. The strong rebound in commodity prices helped alleviate deflationary concerns and also contributed to a broad reversal of company profit expectations. Performance For the Company’s financial year ended September 2016, the portfolio outperformed its benchmark index. Positive relative performance was driven by both country allocation and stock selection, with positions in Taiwan, India and China being the stand out contributors. PERFORMANCE ATTRIBUTION FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30TH SEPTEMBER 2016 % % Contributions to total returns Benchmark return +36.2   Stock selection +4.6   Currency effect +0.8   Gearing/(net cash) +0.7 Investment Manager contribution +6.1   Dividends/residual -0.2 Portfolio return +42.1   Management fee/other expenses -0.8 Return on net assets +41.3 Effect of movement in discount over the year -2.6 Return to shareholders +38.7   In Taiwan, overweight positions in leading technology companies were the primary contributors to good stock selection. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), Silicon Motion and Largan Precision all benefited from strong trends in the mobile handset and memory segments of the technology sector. Although the outlook for growth in the global handset market is slowing, speciality firms are taking a higher share of content per client device because of technology upgrades, including more advanced cameras and faster processing speeds. In addition, the shift from hard disk drives to solid-state memory and NAND memory drove earnings growth at firms including Silicon Motion, Samsung and SK Hynix. In China, our holdings in the property sector, utilities and health care performed well over the period under review. China Vanke was the top performing stock within the broader financial sector due to accelerating property prices in major cities. Elsewhere, our positions in the technology sector, including Tencent and AAC Technology, continued to deliver positive returns with strong top line growth throughout the year. We continue to believe that there are growth opportunities in consumption in China. In India, the main contributor to performance came from the holdings in Maruti Suzuki, Ambuja Cement and HDFC Bank. The outlook for certain cyclical sectors has gradually improved, including the auto and cement markets. In Maruti Suzuki’s case, the company has also taken market share in new segments including cross-over vehicles, where investors were sceptical that consumers would trade up within the Maruti Suzuki brand. The company’s market share at the end of September was nearly 50%. HDFC Bank, the largest overweight position in India, again delivered upbeat earnings with strong loan and fee income growth. The secular growth story in quality Indian private banks remains intact and we continue to prefer them over government owned banks. The holding in the JP Morgan Vietnam Opportunities fund was also an important contributor to performance. Sentiment in Vietnam has gradually improved on the back of important reform measures. However, stock selection was poor in Hong Kong, with our position in CK Hutchinson underperforming for a variety of reasons, including the negative impact from the weaker sterling exchange rate and the European Commission’s decision to prohibit the proposed 3UK/O2 merger. Other areas of weakness in the portfolio included Chinese life insurers and Korean retailers. The underweight in Alibaba also negatively contributed to performance over the period under review. Outlook Looking ahead, we expect the outlook for Asian markets to be characterised by numerous opportunities for growth against a backdrop of periodic volatility driven by events inside and outside the region. In China, policy makers are confronted by overall slower growth with oversupply in many manufacturing and commodity sectors, but at the same time an overheating property sector where prices in major cities have rapidly increased over the last year and they are responding with measures to cool this sector. How successful policy makers will be in terms of balancing the economy without unintended consequences remains to be seen but it is clear that the divergence between ‘new’ industries like the internet and ‘old’ industries should widen over time. The longer term outlook in India remains broadly positive, driven by our belief that economic growth and earnings are set for a strong cyclical recovery, with falling interest rates a key catalyst. Reform continues to be in focus and, importantly, events such as the passing of the GST are the first in an upcoming series of legislative reforms which required constitutional amendment as opposed to simply procedural reform, which had previously been the prior driver. In addition to the positive reform developments in India and Indonesia, the removal of foreign ownership caps in Vietnam’s largest listed company, Vietnam Dairy Products, marks an important turning point for the opening of the country’s stock market to further foreign investment. Our investment philosophy is to own high quality growth companies in undervalued countries. Against that backdrop, our three key positions in the portfolio include overweight allocations to the information technology sector, the insurance sector, particularly in China, and selected private sector banks in India.   Richard Titherington Ayaz Ebrahim Investment Managers                                                                                                                           5th January 2017   PRINCIPAL RISKS The Directors confirm that they have carried out a thorough assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. Three key risks have been identified and the ways in which they are managed or mitigated are summarised as follows: •   Investment and Strategy: An inappropriate investment decision, in areas such as asset allocation or the level of gearing, may lead to underperformance against the Company’s benchmark index and peer companies, and may result in the Company’s shares trading on a wider discount. The Board seeks to mitigate these risks by diversification of investments through its investment restrictions and guidelines which are monitored and reported on by the Manager. The Manager provides the Directors with timely and accurate management information, including performance data and attribution analysis, revenue estimates and shareholder analysis. The Board monitors the implementation and results of the investment process with the investment managers, who attend all Board meetings, and reviews data which show statistical measures of the Company’s risk profile. The Manager employs the Company’s gearing tactically, within a strategic range set by the Board. The Board holds a separate meeting devoted to strategy each year. •   Political and Economic: Changes in financial or tax legislation, may adversely affect the Company. The Manager makes recommendations to the Board on accounting, dividend and tax policies and the Board seeks external advice where appropriate. In addition, the Company is subject to political risks, such as the imposition of restrictions on the free movement of capital. •   Operational Risk and Cybercrime: Disruption to, or failure of, the Manager’s accounting, dealing or payments systems or the custodian’s records could prevent accurate reporting and monitoring of the Company’s financial position. Details of how the Board monitors the services provided by the Manager and its associates and the key elements designed to provide effective internal control are included with the Internal Control section of the Corporate Governance report on pages 29 and 30 of the 2016 Annual Report. The threat of cyber attack, in all its guises, is regarded as at least as important as more traditional physical threats to business continuity and security. The Company benefits directly or indirectly from all elements of JPMorgan’s Cyber Security programme. The information technology controls around the physical security of JPMorgan’s data centres, security of its networks and security of its trading applications are tested by Deloitte and reported every six months against the AAF Standard. The following risks, although not viewed as critical, have also been identified as important in our risk matrix: •   Change of Corporate Control of the Manager: The Board holds regular meetings with senior representatives of JPMF and JPMAM in order to obtain assurance that the Manager continues to demonstrate a high degree of commitment to its investment trusts business through the provision of significant resources. •   Market: Market risk arises from uncertainty about the future prices of the Company’s investments. It represents the potential loss that the Company might suffer through holding investments in the face of negative market movements. The Board considers asset allocation, stock selection and levels of gearing on a regular basis and has set investment restrictions and guidelines, which are monitored and reported on by the Manager. The Board monitors the implementation and results of the investment process with the Manager. •   Loss of Investment Team: A sudden departure of several members of the investment management team could result in a deterioration in investment performance. The Manager takes steps to reduce the likelihood of such an event by ensuring appropriate succession planning and the adoption of a team-based approach. •   Financial: The financial risks faced by the Company include market risk (comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk), liquidity risk, credit risk and the failure of any counterparty. Further details are disclosed in note 22 on pages 55 to 61 of the 2016 Annual Report.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During the financial year, no transactions with related parties have taken place which have materially affected the financial position or the performance of the Company during the year.   STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and accounts in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

"Biotech has historically outperformed the broader market during The J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference," biotech analysts at the firm wrote in a note to clients ahead of the event, which will take place Jan. 9-12 in San Francisco. In the past 16 years, the NYSE Arca Biotechnology index (BTK), which measures the performance of 30 biotechnology firms, has outperformed the S&P 500 index by nearly 3 percent during JPMorgan's conference, research by the firm shows. "We observed that the BTK has outperformed the S&P 500 during JPM week ~81 percent of the time (all but three years)," the report said.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) President-elect Donald Trump's choice to be the next top cop of Wall Street is Jay Clayton, an elite lawyer who has defended big banks for their financial crisis-era misbehavior. Clayton has extensive ties to Wall Street. He advised Goldman Sachs on its government bailout and his wife Gretchen currently works at the bank as a private wealth advisor. Trump announced his SEC pick on Wednesday and explained that Clayton's background as a Wall Street lawyer will help unleash the "job-creating power" of the economy while still providing strong oversight. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers," Trump said in a statement. The appointment rankled some Democrats, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren. She told CNNMoney in a statement that Trump's selection of Clayton is another sign that "his administration will put Wall Street first and working families last." "Mr. Clayton's selection is great news if you happen to run a big bank or manage a hedge fund," Warren said, "but you're out of luck if you want to see tough rules on Wall Street and bankers held accountable when they break the law." The SEC is responsible for rooting out financial crime such as fraud as well as ensuring capital markets are fair for all investors. "Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority," the Trump statement said. Clayton is currently a partner at the powerful law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and has advised on a slew of major deals, including the record-breaking Alibaba IPO and the sale of the NBA's Atlanta Hawks. His law firm bio also notes that Clayton helped secure mortgage settlements on behalf of large financial institutions with the government. It's not clear which specific banks Clayton defended. However, Sullivan & Cromwell's website said the firm represented Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and other banks against allegations that they fraudulently issued or underwrote hundreds of toxic mortgage deals prior to the subprime collapse. Sullivan & Cromwell similarly helped JPMorgan reach its $13 billion toxic mortgage settlement with the Department of Justice in 2013. Clayton also has ties to Bear Stearns, the investment bank that collapsed during the financial crisis as its toxic loan portfolio spiraled out of control. He represented Bear in its fire sale to JPMorgan. Additionally, Goldman Sachs hired Clayton to advise on the Wall Street firm's TARP bailout as well as the crucial $5 billion investment it received from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway during the crisis. Clayton already has experience working with the SEC, albeit on the other side. In 2010, Clayton helped secure a $365 million bribery settlement with the SEC on behalf of Italian oil giant Eni. If confirmed, Clayton said he wants the SEC to strike a balance between providing oversight and helping the economy. "We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs," Clayton said. Clayton would replace Mary Jo White, who is stepping down on January 20 even though her term doesn't expire until June 2019. Some liberal critics, led by Senator Warren, have claimed White didn't do enough to prevent business from pouring cash into politics. While White spent her tenure trying to implement a wave of rules coming from Dodd-Frank, Clayton could be charged with helping Trump carry out his pledge to "dismantle" the reform law. Clayton beat out former federal prosecutor Debra Wong Yang for the SEC job. While Yang is a star corporate lawyer like Clayton, she earned a reputation for toughness as a prosecutor by taking down a violent drug-dealing gang and investigating financial fraud. Democrats strongly criticized Trump's selection of Clayton. Senator Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, knocked Clayton as an "attorney who's spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap." Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, compared Clayton's nomination to allowing the "fox guard the henhouse on Wall Street." On the other hand, the Investment Adviser Association, which represents SEC-registered firms, praised Clayton as a "highly regarded, respected and accomplished" lawyer who has a "deep understanding" of complex transactions and regulations. Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen & Co., called Trump's selection of Clayton a "conventional choice" for a Republican president given his background at a high-profile law firm. "He almost is from central casting," Seiberg wrote in a note. --CNNMoney's Cristina Alesci contributed to this report. Copyright 2017 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

 JPMorgan Chase is about to slash the 100,000-point sign-up bonus for the most ballyhooed credit card of 2016 Tanza Loudenback Jan. 4, 2017, 12:19 PM 48,377 facebook linkedin twitter email print Time is running out on the Chase Sapphire Reserve's enormous sign-up bonus. JPMorgan Chase Last summer, JPMorgan Chase revealed its newest rewards card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve. It came complete with a $450 annual fee and a bevy of benefits, including an unheard-of 100,000-point sign-up bonus worth about $1,500 in travel credit. That sign-up bonus will be slashed in half for online applicants after January 11, according to The Points Guy. The Reserve's debut made waves among consumers. A spokeswoman for Chase previously told The New York Times that the card was an unexpected hit, especially among millennials, even before the bank spent a dime on advertising. But the card's generous benefits were perhaps too big of a hit. By December, JPMorgan Chase said it expected an earnings dip in the fourth quarter to the tune of $200 million to $300 million as a result of the card's popularity, according to CEO Jamie Dimon. The Reserve's sign-up bonus will soon match that of the Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card: If you spend $4,000 in the first three months, you'll receive 50,000 bonus points worth about $625, which is still a lucrative offer. The card will also maintain its steep annual fee, though cardholders receive a $300 travel credit reimbursement awarded each calendar year, effectively reducing the card's annual fee to $150. And the card's extensive benefits will still include: 1 point earned for every $1 spent 2 additional points earned for every $1 spent on travel (includes airfare, hotels, Airbnbs, taxis, Ubers, etc.) 2 additional points earned for every $1 spent on dining (includes Seamless, bars, cafés, restaurants, etc.) Beyond the points, the Reserve offers some perks that are truly unparalleled, including a suite of "elite travel benefits": $100 application-fee credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck Transfer points 1:1 to frequent flyer and hotel loyalty partners Access to over 900 VIP airport lounges worldwide No foreign transaction fees Special benefits during a stay at Chase's Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection (including room upgrades, free breakfast, and early or late check-in/check-out) If you miss the January 11 cutoff but still want to cash in on one of the most eye-popping credit card offers in recent memory, you can still get the original 100,000 sign-up bonus points until March 12 by applying at a physical JPMorgan Chase bank branch, according to The Times.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 January 20175 January 2017 by JPMorgan Chase Institute’s Local Consumer Commerce Index Shows a 1.5 Percent Decrease in Consumer Spending Growth in September 2016 WASHINGTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Today, the JPMorgan Chase Institute released its Local Consumer Commerce Index (LCCI) for September 2016, which showed that only one-third of the 15 major U.S. cities studied experienced positive growth in year-over-year spending. Overall, year-over-year consumer spending growth declined by 1.5 percent in September – the third largest decline in year-over-year growth since October 2013. Like in August 2016, Denver experienced the fastest growth of all cities studied, this time at 6.9 percent year-over-year. Although restaurant spending across the 15 cities added 0.6 percentage points in September, it was the only product type to see an increase in year-over-year spending growth. This report provides a timely view of how the following cities and surrounding metro areas are faring economically both individually and in aggregate: Atlanta, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, Portland (OR), San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle. By looking at actual anonymized financial transactions, LCCI offers an ongoing, dynamic view of the health and vibrancy of the U.S. consumer and the places where businesses operate. “While we see continued declines in spending growth, there are a few bright spots in year-over-year local consumer commerce for September 2016,” said Diana Farrell, President and CEO of the JPMorgan Chase Institute. “For example, spending at neighborhood small businesses can have a multiplier effect on nearby businesses and the community overall – it’s an important contributor to the vibrancy of local commerce.” The key highlights from the latest Index include: All five of the largest cities in our sample – New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas and Houston – experienced reductions in spending. Spending at small businesses grew notably, adding 2.5 percentage points to year-over-year growth. However, these gains were more than offset by declines in spending growth at mid-sized and large businesses. Fuel spending recovered significantly in September 2016, subtracting only 0.2 percentage points from growth. This level of growth departs strongly from a downward trend that began at the beginning of 2016. Year-over-year spending growth on nondurables declined in September, in contrast to virtually flat growth in August. Spending contractions for these goods have been relatively rare events; September marks the third instance in our series. Spending by customers that live in the same neighborhood as the merchant has experienced a downward trend throughout much of 2016. The LCCI offers unique advantages over existing measures of consumer spending. The LCCI captures actual transactions, instead of self-reported measures of how consumers think they spend. The LCCI provides timely data on spending in 15 major metropolitan areas; such geographic granularity is unavailable in most other spending measures. These 15 cities mirror the geographic and economic diversity of larger metropolitan areas in the United States and account for 32 percent of retail sales nationwide. The index also presents a more granular view of local consumer commerce through five important lenses: consumer age, consumer income, business size, product type, and consumer residence relative to the location of the business. For each lens, we show how different segments contributed to year-over-year spending growth. The LCCI captures economic activity in sectors that previously have not been well understood by other data sources. These include sectors such as food trucks, new merchants, and personal services. Each release of the LCCI will describe the economic picture of local communities and provide a powerful tool for city development officials, businesses, investors, and statistical agencies to better understand the everyday economic health of consumers, businesses, and the places they care about. About the JPMorgan Chase Institute The JPMorgan Chase Institute is a global think tank dedicated to delivering data-rich analyses and expert insights for the public good. Its aim is to help decision makers – policymakers, businesses, and nonprofit leaders – appreciate the scale, granularity, diversity, and interconnectedness of the global economic system and use better facts, timely data, and thoughtful analysis to make smarter decisions to advance global prosperity.

 JPMorgan Chase reduces Sapphire Reserve rewards BI Intelligence Jan. 5, 2017, 10:41 AM 3,599 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY EXPLAINED: The Trends Creating New Winners And Losers In The Card-Processing Ecosystem Credit cards are going the way of fax machines THE MOBILE PAYMENTS REPORT: Market forecasts, consumer trends, and the barriers and benefits that will influence adoption This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. JPMorgan Chase will be cutting back some of the lucrative rewards associated with its Sapphire Reserve card, which took the credit card rewards market by storm last summer, according to The New York Times. The card originally offered users who spent $4,000 in the first three months the points equivalent of roughly $1,500 in travel credits. Now, it will offer just half that to consumers who apply online after January 11. Although this cutback may hurt the card's extreme popularity with consumers, the benefits to JPMorgan will likely outweigh any negative sentiment. Consumers are likely to continue to find the card appealing even if it sees a small decline in popularity. The lucrative offers associated with the Sapphire Reserve card are in part responsible for the 35% increase in new Chase card accounts in Q3 2016. But though the cutback could decrease popularity, the card's other offerings will likely still draw in the 60% of consumers that rank rewards as a major reason for credit card adoption.  The cutback will also help the issuer to save millions on costs. Offering lucrative rewards on credit cards can have a dramatic impact on costs — the firm's Sapphire Reserve credit card could end up reducing the bank’s profit by $200 million to $300 million in Q4 2016, according to Bloomberg. By reducing how much the Sapphire Reserve card will cost the firm, it will be able to regain millions in profits.  This cutback could be the beginning of a major slow down in credit card reward offerings by card issuers. In the last year, there has been an aggressive increase in credit card reward offerings, which has been fueled in part by the release of the Sapphire Reserve card. This aggressive push in offerings has led to a steady increase in costs for many major issuers. However, with this recent cutback, card issuers could begin to follow JPMorgan's lead by pushing similar cutbacks because they no longer have to match the firm's impressive offer. In the US, when customers make payments via banks, they’re completed in two ways: via wire transfer, or through the Automated Clearing House (ACH). ACH transactions, which are less expensive for customers and which accounted for 18% of total noncash US payments volume in 2012, can take up to five days to settle because of the way that they are processed. That’s problematic, because it interferes with consumer demand for convenience and could slow the supply chain or make it more challenging for banks and businesses to get paid in the way they need to conduct operations. As a result, the US Fed looked into the ACH system in 2013, and found that there was no “ubiquitous, convenient, and cost-effective way for US consumers and businesses to make fast payments between banks.  In response, the Fed, NACHA, and private institutions have begun to find ways, together and separately, to modernize the US payments system in order to increase convenience and catch up to many of the country’s trade partners. The Fed has formed a task force, which will resolve potential solutions, while NACHA and private institutions are pushing banks to hit a set of three same-day settlement deadlines through late 2016 and into 2017. Such a system will particularly benefit high-growth spaces in the electronic payments ecosystem, like P2P and B2B payments, which could magnify its impact over time. Though it’s likely the system could grow ACH volume by making it a more appealing option in these high-growth areas, it could become a hindrance to banks. That’s because the implementation is costly and time-consuming — the Fed find that the business impact is net-neutral to negative for these firms. Instead, the parties that reap these benefits are providers of services in these high growth areas, like mobile bill pay firms or P2P vendors, which means that banks are actually aiding their competitors. That means that Faster Payments could ultimately enhance the impact of digital disruption in the payments ecosystem, rather than mitigate it. Jaime Toplin, research associate for BI Intelligence, Business Insider’s premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on faster payments that looks at why the US needs a Faster Payments system, explains how the country plans to implement it, evaluates the different areas that are most likely to be impacted by Faster Payments, and determines which parties benefit from such a system and which are hindered by it. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Sluggish settlement of payments in the US is pushing NACHA, the national electronic payments trade group, and the Federal Reserve to reform the system. US payments made via ACH can take three to five days to settle.The Fed's Faster Payments Task Force and NACHA are looking to implement a same-day settlement program in the US by 2017 in order to increase consumer convenience.  The number of transactions affected by faster payments will increase over time.Four key areas — P2P, B2B, C2B, and B2C payments — will gain the most from such a system. And these areas, which comprised 12% of US payments volume in 2014, will grow rapidly over time, therefore magnifying the impact of such a system. Faster payments implementation will be a mixed bag for banks, because of additional costs associated with the burden of implementation. And the platform is likely to actually boost third-party providers, like P2P app vendors or mobile bill pay firms, by giving them an easy way to increase efficiency, engagement, and volume, without a substantial rise in transaction costs.

Katz appeared in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, where he admitted to participating in a conspiracy with other bankers to manipulate emerging-market currency trades while working at three different financial institutions from 2007 to 2013. Katz’s conviction comes one day before five banks are scheduled to be sentenced in connection with the Justice Department’s three-year investigation. The banks - Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Company, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland Group - pleaded guilty in May 2015 to charges that their traders conspired to manipulate trading in U.S. dollars and euros. UBS Group also pleaded guilty to a related charge. Bloomberg previously reported that the currency-rigging investigation had expanded to additional chatrooms involving trading in emerging market currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble and the South African rand. Trading history Katz spent a year as director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading at Barclays beginning in 2010, according to regulatory filings and his LinkedIn profile. He joined BNP Paribas in September 2011 as its director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading, before leaving for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group two years later, the documents show. Before joining Barclays, Katz spent more than nine years at Standard Bank, where he was head of foreign exchange, according to his LinkedIn profile. Prosecutors say Katz was a dealer of central and eastern European, Middle Eastern and African currencies and conspired to manipulate prices through "non-bona fide trades," coordinating the placement of bids and offers, and agreeing on currency prices they would quote specific customers. Katz has agreed to cooperate with the government’s investigation. The conspiracy charge Katz admitted to has a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine, which may be increased based on the proceeds gained or the loss to investors.

It isn’t clear whether Katz had any interaction with Ashton or other members of The Cartel.

Barclays, JPMorgan and Citigroup provided evidence of a potential new antitrust conspiracy in the currency spot market that prosecutors say involves different currencies than the ones at the centre of their 2015 guilty pleas.

(BAC), Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) Options activity provides a look at expectations on BAC, TSLA and DAL By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 5, 2017, 9:14 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Monday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and AT&T Inc. (T) 2 Trades for the General Electric Company (GE) Stock Comeback Under Armour Inc (UA) Stock Is Headed to $30 Recent Posts: 2 Trades for the General Electric Company (GE) Stock Comeback Friday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU) 2 Trades to Play the Exxon Mobil (XOM) Stock Breakout (or Breakdown) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are retreating this morning, as Wall Street takes a breather ahead of a wealth of economic data, including key employment reports. Specifically, the ADP private-sector payrolls report and weekly jobless claims are due out today, followed by December’s non-farm payrolls report tomorrow. Meanwhile, the December purchasing manager’s index is also due to hit the Street later this morning. Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have retreated 0.08%, S&P 500 futures have fallen 0.14% and Nasdaq-100 futures have dropped 0.18%. On the options front, volume remained strong on Wednesday, with about 15.1 million calls and 12.1 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio extended its recent decline to rest at 0.64, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.67. Turning to Wednesday’s volume leaders, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) options traders are gearing up for next Friday’s fourth-quarter earnings report. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) came up short in full-year deliveries but was initiated at “buy” at Guggenheim, and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) lifted its fourth-quarter passenger unit revenue. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) Ahead of the open next Friday, Bank of America will slip into the earnings confessional. Analysts are expecting a profit of 38 cents per share on revenue of $20.99 billion — up 40% and 7.3% year-over-year, respectively. Expectations appear to be a bit higher, however, as EarningsWhispers.com reports a whisper number of 39 cents per share for BofA earnings. 5 Stocks to Buy for a Big January Options traders are also quite bullish on BAC stock. During Wednesday’s trading, speculative traders pushed more than 673,000 contracts across the tape on BAC, with calls gobbling up 73% of the day’s take. Among yesterday’s most interesting trades, however, was what appeared to be a short-strangle at the January 2017 20 series $22.50 and $23 strikes. According to Trade-Alert.com, 10,000 contracts traded at each of the January $22.50 put and $23 call for the bid prices of 49 cents and 46 cents, respectively. Taking the trade at face value, the trader received a credit of 95 cents, or $95 per pair of contracts, which he will only keep if BAC stock closes between $22.50 and $23 when January options expire.

(iStock) Related Articles Barclays awarded in Middle East Barclays severs ties with 7 000 clients to boost returns Barclays sells off French retail division Barclays to save millions with office sublet to govt Barclays posts 35% jump in profit Barclays channels 'new deal' lesson in shaky commodities world   Manhattan - Jason Katz, a former Barclays currency trader, admitted conspiring to fix prices in the foreign-exchange market, the third individual to be charged and the first to plead guilty in a long-running US criminal investigation into the rigging of currency rates. Katz appeared in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, where he admitted to participating in a conspiracy with other bankers to manipulate emerging-market currency trades while working at three different financial institutions from 2007 to 2013. Separately, the Federal Reserve Board said it banned Katz from the banking industry. Katz’s conviction comes one day before five banks are scheduled to be sentenced in connection with the Justice Department’s three-year investigation. The banks - Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Company, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland Group - pleaded guilty in May 2015 to charges that their traders conspired to manipulate trading in US dollars and euros. UBS Group also pleaded guilty to a related charge. Bloomberg previously reported that the currency-rigging investigation had expanded to additional chat rooms involving trading in emerging market currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Russian rouble and the South African rand. Katz was released on a $150 000 bond to be secured by property in New York’s Delaware County. His travel is limited to New York, Connecticut and London until April 1 when he is to turn over his passport and remain in the US. Trading history Katz spent a year as director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading at Barclays beginning in 2010, according to regulatory filings and his LinkedIn profile. He joined BNP Paribas in September 2011 as its director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading, before leaving for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group two years later, the documents show. Before joining Barclays, Katz spent more than nine years at Standard Bank, where he was head of foreign exchange, according to his LinkedIn profile. Prosecutors say Katz was a dealer of central and eastern European, Middle Eastern and African currencies and conspired to manipulate prices through "non-bona fide trades," coordinating the placement of bids and offers, and agreeing on currency prices quoted to specific customers. Katz has agreed to cooperate with the government’s investigation. The conspiracy charge Katz admitted to a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1m fine, which may be increased based on the proceeds gained or the loss to investors. "These conspirators engaged in blatant collusion and succeeded in manipulating exchange rates for multiple currencies to their advantage," said Brent Snyder, a deputy assistant attorney general with the department’s antitrust division. "Conspiracies such as this undermine the integrity of our financial markets, and the Antitrust Division is committed to ensuring that they are pursued and punished.' Currency chats Katz’s time at Barclays coincides with that of Chris Ashton, the former global head of spot trading at the London-based bank. Prosecutors have been investigating allegations that Ashton and a group of other traders participated in an electronic chatroom called The Cartel where they conspired to rig currency prices. Ashton was permanently banned from US banking by the US Federal Reserve in August. It isn’t clear whether Katz had any interaction with Ashton or other members of The Cartel. Those chatroom discussions formed the basis of guilty pleas by four of the banks, which are scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday in Connecticut. Barclays, JPMorgan and Citigroup provided evidence of a potential new antitrust conspiracy in the currency spot market that prosecutors say involves different currencies than the ones at the centre of their 2015 guilty pleas. The case is US v. Katz, 17-cr-00003, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Follow Fin24 on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

Predictably, there will be tears, upset, relief and joy (for some). As a general rule, the longer a bonus advisory meeting takes, the more likely that the bonus itself is not quite up to scratch. Bonus advisory meetings become protracted usually for two reasons only - a subordinate is pushing back in a futile attempt to increase his / her award, or an embarrassed line manager is trying his best to justify the unjustifiable. But in all honesty, there should be relatively few surprises this bonus season (unless an employee is completely deluded, of course, or been living on the moon). We all know that 2016 was a tough for the industry - revenues were under pressure, job losses continued, etc. Against this background, year-end bonuses for most individuals will be flat to down (although there will always be some 'hot spots' that will see big payouts and hit the headlines). There will be some, however, who will be shocked about the paucity of their awards (and tears will flow), thinking that the relatively small bonus they have been allocated for 2016 means that they are being given a subtle message by their employer - it's time for you to move on. You can rest assure, however, that this is not the case - banks don't send subtle messages any more; they don't have the luxury. If your face doesn't fit, or you're no longer delivering the goods, then you'll simply be fired - you won't have even made it to bonus advisory day. A word of caution, though: you'll need to survive another 12 months to bag another bonus, and 12 months is now a very long time in the industry. image: © Aiden And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

Monday, January 16, 2017 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Indonesia penalises JPMorgan for ‘underweight’ call January 5, 2017, Thursday JAKARTA: Indonesia will drop JPMorgan Chase & Co from providing some services to the government after the bank’s research arm said investors should reduce their exposure to the country, senior finance ministry officials said. “After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan’s services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank,” Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry’s fiscal policy office, told Reuters. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan was already in effect. In an equities research note dated Nov 13, JPMorgan downgraded its investment recommendation on Indonesia to ‘underweight’ from ‘overweight’, citing higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. “Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit,” the bank wrote, adding that the “spike in volatility” may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a ‘tactical’ response to Trump’s victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. “The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” she said by email. The finance ministry’s Nazara said the bank’s analysis “did not make sense” because it recommended a ‘neutral’ position for Brazil, which is better than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. “We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They’ve explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It’s not that we think we’re so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries’ economies,” Nazara said. “Our mindset is, if you’re doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don’t create unnecessary volatility to create business,” he added. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia’s director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan’s research should not have a major impact on Indonesia’s future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place “until we say otherwise”. Primary dealers of Indonesian government bonds as of Nov. 25 included Citibank, Deutsche Bank AG, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited and local lender PT Bank Central Asia Tbk, according to the finance ministry’s website. Indonesia’s 10-year credit default swap, a contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield on its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the US election, though they have since dipped. Trump signalled more protective US trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said Indonesia’s economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia’s lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. Indonesia’s central bank said shortly after the Federal Reserve raised US interest rates in December that it was on guard against ‘reversals’ of capital flows into the country. — Reuters What do you think of this story?

Clayton has extensive ties to Wall Street. He advised Goldman Sachs on its government bailout and his wife Gretchen currently works at the bank as a private wealth advisor. Trump announced his SEC pick on Wednesday and explained that Clayton's background as a Wall Street lawyer will help unleash the "job-creating power" of the economy while still providing strong oversight. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers," Trump said in a statement. The appointment rankled some Democrats, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren. She told CNNMoney in a statement that Trump's selection of Clayton is another sign that "his administration will put Wall Street first and working families last." "Mr. Clayton's selection is great news if you happen to run a big bank or manage a hedge fund," Warren said, "but you're out of luck if you want to see tough rules on Wall Street and bankers held accountable when they break the law." The SEC is responsible for rooting out financial crime such as fraud as well as ensuring capital markets are fair for all investors. "Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority," the Trump statement said. Clayton is currently a partner at the powerful law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and has advised on a slew of major deals, including the record-breaking Alibaba IPO and the sale of the NBA's Atlanta Hawks. His law firm bio also notes that Clayton helped secure mortgage settlements on behalf of large financial institutions with the government. It's not clear which specific banks Clayton defended. However, Sullivan & Cromwell's website said the firm represented Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and other banks against allegations that they fraudulently issued or underwrote hundreds of toxic mortgage deals prior to the subprime collapse. Sullivan & Cromwell similarly helped JPMorgan reach its $13 billion toxic mortgage settlement with the Department of Justice in 2013. Clayton also has ties to Bear Stearns, the investment bank that collapsed during the financial crisis as its toxic loan portfolio spiraled out of control. He represented Bear in its fire sale to JPMorgan. Additionally, Goldman Sachs hired Clayton to advise on the Wall Street firm's TARP bailout as well as the crucial $5 billion investment it received from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway during the crisis. Clayton already has experience working with the SEC, albeit on the other side. In 2010, Clayton helped secure a $365 million bribery settlement with the SEC on behalf of Italian oil giant Eni. If confirmed, Clayton said he wants the SEC to strike a balance between providing oversight and helping the economy. "We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs," Clayton said. Clayton would replace Mary Jo White, who is stepping down on January 20 even though her term doesn't expire until June 2019. Some liberal critics, led by Senator Warren, have claimed White didn't do enough to prevent business from pouring cash into politics. While White spent her tenure trying to implement a wave of rules coming from Dodd-Frank, Clayton could be charged with helping Trump carry out his pledge to "dismantle" the reform law. Clayton beat out former federal prosecutor Debra Wong Yang for the SEC job. While Yang is a star corporate lawyer like Clayton, she earned a reputation for toughness as a prosecutor by taking down a violent drug-dealing gang and investigating financial fraud. Democrats strongly criticized Trump's selection of Clayton. Senator Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, knocked Clayton as an "attorney who's spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap." Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, compared Clayton's nomination to allowing the "fox guard the henhouse on Wall Street." On the other hand, the Investment Adviser Association, which represents SEC-registered firms, praised Clayton as a "highly regarded, respected and accomplished" lawyer who has a "deep understanding" of complex transactions and regulations. Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen & Co., called Trump's selection of Clayton a "conventional choice" for a Republican president given his background at a high-profile law firm. "He almost is from central casting," Seiberg wrote in a note. --CNNMoney's Cristina Alesci contributed to this report. Copyright 2017 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

Trump announced his SEC pick on Wednesday and explained that Clayton's background as a Wall Street lawyer will help unleash the "job-creating power" of the economy while still providing strong oversight. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers," Trump said in a statement. The appointment rankled some Democrats, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren. She told CNNMoney in a statement that Trump's selection of Clayton is another sign that "his administration will put Wall Street first and working families last." "Mr. Clayton's selection is great news if you happen to run a big bank or manage a hedge fund," Warren said, "but you're out of luck if you want to see tough rules on Wall Street and bankers held accountable when they break the law." The SEC is responsible for rooting out financial crime such as fraud as well as ensuring capital markets are fair for all investors. "Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority," the Trump statement said. Clayton is currently a partner at the powerful law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and has advised on a slew of major deals, including the record-breaking Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) IPO and the sale of the NBA's Atlanta Hawks. His law firm bio also notes that Clayton helped secure mortgage settlements on behalf of large financial institutions with the government. Related: Elizabeth Warren watchdog under siege It's not clear which specific banks Clayton defended. However, Sullivan & Cromwell's website said the firm represented Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays (BCS) and other banks against allegations that they fraudulently issued or underwrote hundreds of toxic mortgage deals prior to the subprime collapse. Sullivan & Cromwell similarly helped JPMorgan reach its $13 billion toxic mortgage settlement with the Department of Justice in 2013. Clayton also has ties to Bear Stearns, the investment bank that collapsed during the financial crisis as its toxic loan portfolio spiraled out of control. He represented Bear in its fire sale to JPMorgan (JPM). Additionally, Goldman Sachs (GS) hired Clayton to advise on the Wall Street firm's TARP bailout as well as the crucial $5 billion investment it received from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) during the crisis. Clayton already has experience working with the SEC, albeit on the other side. In 2010, Clayton helped secure a $365 million bribery settlement with the SEC on behalf of Italian oil giant Eni (E). If confirmed, Clayton said he wants the SEC to strike a balance between providing oversight and helping the economy. "We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs," Clayton said. Related: Scandal-ridden Wells Fargo wants less regulation Clayton would replace Mary Jo White, who is stepping down on January 20 even though her term doesn't expire until June 2019. Some liberal critics, led by Senator Warren, have claimed White didn't do enough to prevent business from pouring cash into politics. While White spent her tenure trying to implement a wave of rules coming from Dodd-Frank, Clayton could be charged with helping Trump carry out his pledge to "dismantle" the reform law. Clayton beat out former federal prosecutor Debra Wong Yang for the SEC job. While Yang is a star corporate lawyer like Clayton, she earned a reputation for toughness as a prosecutor by taking down a violent drug-dealing gang and investigating financial fraud. Democrats strongly criticized Trump's selection of Clayton. Senator Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, knocked Clayton as an "attorney who's spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap." Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, compared Clayton's nomination to allowing the "fox guard the henhouse on Wall Street." On the other hand, the Investment Adviser Association, which represents SEC-registered firms, praised Clayton as a "highly regarded, respected and accomplished" lawyer who has a "deep understanding" of complex transactions and regulations. Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen & Co., called Trump's selection of Clayton a "conventional choice" for a Republican president given his background at a high-profile law firm. "He almost is from central casting," Seiberg wrote in a note. --CNNMoney's Cristina Alesci contributed to this report.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Business News | Wed Jan 4, 2017 | 6:27am EST Indonesia tries to assure banks they won't be penalized if research is 'credible' A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files By Hidayat Setiaji and Eveline Danubrata | JAKARTA JAKARTA Indonesia's finance ministry sought on Wednesday to assure banks and research firms that they will not be sanctioned for their assessment of the country as long as it is "credible". Indonesia cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) because its research was "not credible and not objective", Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told reporters. Some analysts have said that the decision has raised concern about whether the government would penalize other research providers for reports that are deemed to be negative. Nazara dismissed such worries. "There is no need to be afraid as long as it's credible," he said. "The point is, don't worry, go ahead with an analysis of Indonesia's economy that is as credible as possible, by using the available data and facts." In a note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan analysts downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight", citing higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Indonesia has dropped JPMorgan's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global markets, Nazara said. The U.S. bank is also no longer what Indonesia terms a perception bank. The government said in a 2006 decree that perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. JPMorgan is allowed to continue its business in the private sector, Nazara said. The government assurances are unlikely to dispel the worries. "This has made us more cautious although we'll still try our best to safeguard our research independence," said a Jakarta-based analyst at a foreign bank, who declined to be identified.

The ministry suspended JPMorgan as a primary dealer and underwriter of Indonesia’s bonds from Jan. 1 after the bank downgraded the country’s equities by two notches to underweight in November following Donald Trump’s election win. JPMorgan continues to operate as normal in Indonesia and is working with the finance ministry to resolve the matter, the New York-based bank said in e-mailed statement Tuesday. The biggest U.S. bank was part of a underwriting syndicate when Indonesia sold 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) of bonds in June. The lender wasn’t listed as a member of syndicates for two more recent offerings denominated in yen and U.S. dollars, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   The government will find a replacement for JPMorgan as a primary dealer and bond underwriter if needed, Nazara said. “The message to all finance companies is be objective and credible,” he said. “The bigger the institution and reputation, the bigger the responsibility.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Yet it is no exaggeration to say that central banks’ exit from the ultra-loose monetary policies they have been pursuing for the last several years represents one of the most significant, and perilous, moments in the history of financial markets. This is, quite simply, the mother of all inflection points. To be sure, the exit has only just begun and is being mitigated by what are still extremely accommodative financial conditions, underpinned by the quantitative easing (QE) programmes of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) which are helping suppress bond yields. According to a report from JPMorgan published on December 1, the stock of negative-yielding government bonds still amounts to some $9 trillion. The share of sub-zero-yielding sovereign debt in JPMorgan’s benchmark developed market government bond index (GBI-DM) stands at 20 per cent. Yet this is already down from a peak of 32 per cent in July. Make no mistake, the “lower for longer” period of global interest rates has finally come to an end. The only question is how painful and disorderly the monetary policy normalisation process is likely to be. The last two months of 2016 provided a glimpse of what the post-QE era could look like. The Fed’s decision on December 14 to announce a faster-than-anticipated pace of monetary tightening next year, partly as a pre-emptive move in anticipation of the reflationary economic policies of president-elect Donald Trump, has fuelled a sell-off in the bond market. The US Federal Reserve is at the forefront of a much-discussed shift from monetary easing to fiscal expansion as the main source of stimulus for the global economy. The Fed’s decision on December 14 to announce a faster-than-anticipated pace of monetary tightening next year, partly as a pre-emptive move in anticipation of the reflationary economic policies of president-elect Donald Trump, has fuelled a sell-off in the bond market. The yield on benchmark US 10-year Treasury bonds has shot up 65 basis points since Trump’s victory to 2.5 per cent, its highest level since September 2014. Its 2-year equivalent, meanwhile, has surged 40 basis points to 1.2 per cent, its highest level since the end of 2009. While the rise in European and Japanese bond yields has been much less pronounced, even the BoJ and the ECB have moved away from unlimited asset purchases and are now focusing on managing the yield curve for short and long-term borrowing costs and improving the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The return on bonds in the last quarter of 2016 was the worst since the first quarter of 1994 when speculation, excessive leverage, and [Fed] rate hikes combined to create one of the worst years for bonds in modern history Wells Fargo Asset Management Although there is a significant divergence of views among investment strategists about where yields are heading, a regime change in financial markets is in the air – so much so that many market commentators have suddenly stopped using the 2008 global financial crisis as the starting point for assessing the performance of asset prices, and are instead looking at price action since Trump’s victory in the US election. The “Trumpflation” trade – a repositioning of investors’ portfolios favouring equities over bonds - is the prologue of the post-QE policy regime. International investors must now prepare themselves for the first chapter. From a market sentiment standpoint, the stakes could not be higher. Central banks’ ultra-accommodative monetary policies have distorted asset prices and desensitised investors to risks and vulnerabilities in the global economy. Markets have become used to central banks being, in the words of Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz, “the only game in town”. The exit from seven years of QE, which has only just begun, is bound to be a tumultuous one, particularly if Trump’s reflationary policies – now perceived by investors as the substitute for further monetary stimulus – are not as aggressive and effective as is currently being priced in. Even if Trump, who takes office on January 20, is able to get a hefty fiscal stimulus package approved by Congress, global equity markets – which have rallied spectacularly since the US election in anticipation of stronger growth – could start to wobble because of concerns about an even more hawkish Fed. Emerging markets (EM) will be particularly vulnerable as the post-QE era unfolds. The sharp deterioration in sentiment towards developing economies in the last two months of 2016 – EM equity and bond funds experienced six consecutive weeks of outflows following Trump’s victory – shows the extent to which the asset class suffers when central bank-driven volatility picks up. The world’s leading central banks used to have a stabilising effect on markets. In the coming years, they will be a source of intense volatility.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Capital Market NAHCO, Guinness, Dangote Flour lead N98bn market loss January 6, 2017January 5, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Stanley Opara The Nigerian Aviation Handling Company Plc, Guinness Nigeria Plc and Dangote Flour Plc emerged as the top three losers at the close of trading on the floor of the Nigerian stock Exchange on Thursday as the market capitalisation slid by N98bn. A total of 137.694 million shares valued at N898.708m exchanged hands in 2,488 deals. The NSE market capitalisation dropped to N9.018tn from N9.116tn, while the All-Share Index closed at 26,212.09 basis points from 26,495.04 basis points. NAHCO shares dropped by N0.30 (9.49 per cent) to close at N2.86 from N3.16, while the share price of Guinness depreciated to N78.90 from N83.05, losing N4.15 (five per cent). Similarly, Dangote Flour share price closed at N4.04 from N4.25, losing N0.21 (4.94 per cent). The NSE continued to seek its first positive close of the year as sizeable declines in select market heavyweights pulled the NSE ASI down by 1.07 per cent. On the global scene, major bourses across Europe traded mixed amid the release of impressive full year earnings from the United Kingdom’s house building sector and JP Morgan’s decision to revise lower its valuation on a few European insurers. Also, the United States opened mixed as investors assessed a series of economic data and the Federal Reserve’s thoughts on President-elect Donald Trump’s policies. At the NSE, the industrial goods sector came as the biggest loser in Thursday’s session largely on the back of a 4.01 per cent decline in Dangote Cement Plc. The consumer goods and the oil/gas sectors also closed lower amid losses in blue-chip Guinness and Forte Oil Plc by five per cent and 3.41 per cent, respectively. The financial services sector, however, recorded its first green close of the year, buoyed by advances across a number of tier-1 banks  such as Access bank Plc, FBN Holdings Plc, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, United Bank for Africa Plc and Ecobank Transnational Incorporated Plc by 4.96 per cent, 3.30 per cent, 2.49 per cent, 2.22 per cent and 1.99 per cent, respectively.  Market breadth turned positive with 17 advances and 16 declines. “We highlight that today’s market closing position was largely distorted by the loss in market heavyweight – Danote Cement. Excluding the loss in the stock, the ASI would have closed in the green. Consequently, considering the improved market sentiment (as indicated by the positive market breadth), we foresee a positive close in Friday’s trading session,” analysts at Vetiva Capital Management Limited said in a draft. Meanwhile, there was an oversubscription of Treasury bills instruments sold as the naira depreciated at the parallel market. The results of the Primary Market Auction, which was held on Wednesday, showed oversubscription across all instruments. Treasury bills worth N172.85bn were sold in 91-day (N35bn), 182-day (N22bn) and 364-day (N115.85bn), with respective bid-to-cover ratios of 1.02, 1.05 and 1.17 and stop rates of 14 per cent, 17.5 per cent and 18.68 per cent, accordingly. Money market rates (open-buy-back and overnight rates) increased marginally by 0.50 per cent and one per cent to close at 8.50 per cent and 9.42 per cent, respectively. As a result, the average money market rate advanced by 0.75 per cent to close at 8.96 per cent at the end of the trading day . Mixed reaction, according to Meristem Securities Limited was witnessed in the Treasury bond space. However, significant demand was observed at the shorter end of the curve. The April 2017, July 2017, August 2017 and May 2018 instruments all recorded declines of 0.52 per cent, 0.03 per cent, 0.10 per cent and 0.19 per cent, respectively. Consequently, the average bond yield advanced by 0.02 per cent, closing at 16.69 per cent at the end of Thursday’s trades. Copyright PUNCH.                All rights reserved.

Jan 11 Fed chief advises youth to follow the Ben Franklin model Jan 13 Card deals: Amazon wants buyers to borrow Jan 13 More from Joseph N. DiStefano Arrow icon Bank stocks are up since Trump's election, and bankers and bank investors are streaming to Washington to urge laws they think will profit them. "Right now Congress will focus on tax reform," says Chris Martin, CEO of not-quite-$10 billion-asset, New Jersey-based Provident Bank, which has been making more business loans in the Philadelphia area and seeks to open an office in the city as it adds customers. A little later, with friendly Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) running the Senate Banking Committee, "there'll be conversations" about lifting the loan limits and onerous capital and testing requirements from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, designed to stop banks from wrecking themselves in America's periodic credit bubbles, Martin expects.  Farther off is Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac reform. "They shouldn't have to report to Congress," as some critics in both parties have urged, Martin argues. "It's hard enough to do home loans now," with lenders feeling obliged to require 20 percent down to meet investor guidelines, and fewer young families qualifying for loans. In fact, Trump's victory seems to have ended pressure in both parties for fundamental changes in home-loan finance. That makes it more likely Fannie and Freddie will come out from government control and resume their old status as private companies -- while also giving back billions of dollars in profits that Fannie-Freddie investors like hedge fund managers Gary Hindes of Delaware Bay Co., Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme Capital Management and Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management contend were wrongfully pocketed by the government, and should be returned by taxpayers to investors like them. J. Timothy Howard, a former Fannie Mae CFO who later advised Fannie shareholders including investor Berkowitz in an ongoing lawsuit against Treasury, posted a hopeful blueprint for non-reform titled Economics Trumping Politics on his Web page yesterday.  To many of us middle-American mortgage holders, Howard, as a former top officer of the largest of the private but government-backed mortgage-finance giants that make possible America's unique 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, might seem a consummate financial insider. But in his piece, Howard rails against what he calls the true "Financial Establishment—large banks and Wall Street firms, and their advocates and alumni at Treasury and elsewhere" -- who Howard says have long "been engaged in a well-designed, carefully scripted and highly orchestrated political campaign to convince Congress to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with a mechanism more financially beneficial to themselves."   Enter Trump: "Seemingly out of nowhere, five weeks ago Treasury Secretary-designate Steven Mnuchin announced his intention to 'get Fannie and Freddie out of government control reasonably fast'," Howard cheers.   "The odds immediately flipped to favor the prospect that the fates of Fannie and Freddie will be determined, not by a misinformation-based political process likely to benefit banks, but by a fact-based economic process likely to benefit borrowers." And investors, like Howard's lawsuit clients. Howard traces Fannie's and Freddie's problems to the 1990s, when units of General Electric Co., Wells Fargo & Co., PNC Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and the big mortgage insurers formed a lobby -- FM Watch -- to persuade Congress to restrict Fannie and Freddie from setting lending restrictions, guaranty fees and mortgage-bond yields. When Congress balked -- in Howard's telling -- the bankers got Treasury to seize Fannie and Freddie and blame it for the 2008 financial crisis.   Bankers used "fake facts" and "ignored the obvious evidence -- including the disastrous credit performance of loans financed with (banks' own private mortgage bonds) and the vastly lower delinquency numbers put out by (banks' rivals at) Fannie and Freddie." Instead they blamed the mortgage-finance twins and their supposed "flawed business model" for the banks' bad loans, Howard added.   "The Financial Establishment also had a proposed remedy: the companies must be 'wound down and replaced,'" advocates in both parties argued, with some new, more easily bank-controlled mortgage-finance mechanism that would "justify giving control over the availability, terms and pricing of $10 trillion in mortgages to the large banks and investment firms" -- in part by forcing the new mortgage-finance entity to hold more capital than they really need to safely make loans. Given the long and costly history of American financial institutions cheerfully blowing themselves and their shareholders and customers up through over-optimistic lending, can important lenders like Fannie and Freddie really have way too much capital? That's what Howard argues. High capital forces lenders to boost fees and "significantly overcharge" customers, he argues. "Borrowers would be badly hurt by those pricing distortions, while banks and Wall Street firms would profit from them."  If the "Financial Establishment" really has all that power, why did the Obama administration allow Fannie and Freddie to dangle on, under federal control, for eight years, instead of reforming them already?  Because the banks and loan insurers failed "to come up with a workable alternative to the two companies it so desperately wants to replace." Secretary Mnuchin, he adds, seems poised to kill the bankers' scheme by  returning Fannie and Freddie to full private control, removing "misinformed" Congress and putting "a small number of informed finance professionals with economic incentives to get it right" (presumably they aren't part of the "Financial Establishment") back in charge where they belong. Mnuchin will resolve Fannie and Freddie in court and administrative proceedings, "where the focus is on facts," he adds. Not in Congress, which is plagued by "deceptions, inventions and faleshoods."  "Far from rescuing Fannie and Freddie, Treasury planned and carried out their takeovers for ideological and policy reasons, then lied to both the public and the courts about what it had done and why," Howard writes, citing documents presented as part of the litigation against Treasury. “Mnuchin’s plan to “get [the companies] out of government control” requires settling the lawsuits. He figures Trump officials will quickly chose borrower and investor interests over bankers, and use their knowledge to settle "what the post-settlement secondary market system should look like, and how it should function." Which is a lot like the old system: "Fannie and Freddie were not the causes of the financial crisis... They didn’t need to be rescued by the government... Their secondary-market business model works better than any other... Recapitalizing Fannie and Freddie post-conservatorship is eminently achievable." Surely, he adds, Mnuchin will end up agreeing with investors like Berkowitz and Ackman. "The Trump administration will have at least two reasons to support them: "First, it will understand" from investors' lawsuits "that a secondary mortgage market built around Fannie and Freddie is far better for consumers and the economy than the bank-centric proposals supported by the Financial Establishment, and will know it will be held accountable for the negative consequences of choosing the latter. "Second, the Trump Treasury will inherit the warrants for 79.9 percent of Fannie and Freddie’s common shares created by the Bush Treasury, which will become worthless if the companies are wound down." That gives the new administration and the investors common cause against the bankers: "Trump Treasury will share the plaintiffs’ goal of setting Fannie and Freddie up to operate as cost-effectively and efficiently as possible, benefitting borrowers as well as shareholders. "It also will have strong incentives to alter the terms of the warrants—their strike price, percentage amount or both—and to manage the timing of conversions so as to maximize the value of all three categories of stock the companies will have as going concerns: existing shares, converted warrants, and the new issues of equity required for recapitalization." Everyone's happy! Except the old Financial Establishment -- those lenders, who make mortgages in the first place, and disliked Fannie and Freddie for cramping their lending style. But "they have no realistic legislative alternative to offer, and because Republicans in the executive branch will know the facts about Fannie, Freddie and the financial crisis from discovery in the court cases, Republicans in Congress will not be able to sustain their myths about them. "There never has been any economic case against reforming, releasing and recapitalizing the companies, and without the myths the political case falls apart. “It is by no means a certainty that the Trump administration will arrive at the right solution on mortgage reform. But because it has made the issue a 'top 10'  priority, and the path to a successful outcome is so obvious and wide open, for the first time in quite a while there is great cause for optimism.” More Coverage Hedge funds look to Trump for a Fannie-Freddie revival Jan 7 - 4:26 PM Published: January 5, 2017 — 4:19 PM EST | Updated: January 6, 2017 — 11:59 AM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

The stockbroker slashed its target price for the engineering giant from 890p to 730p and said it had concerns about the civil aerospace unit. JPM warned that earnings at the firm, which has issued five major profit warnings in recent years, could be ‘highly depressed’ over the next few years. Shares tumbled 4.2 per cent, or 28p, to 639.5p. It was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 for the day, but it didn’t stop the stock market setting a sixth consecutive closing high. The FTSE 100 climbed 0.1 per cent, or 5.57 points, to 7195.31. It is now the longest stretch of record closes since May 1997. Earlier in the day it had set a new record intra-day high of 7211.96. Shares plunge: JPMorgan slashed its target price for Rolls-Royce stock from 890p to 730p and said it had concerns about the civil aerospace unit Housebuilders were at the top of the table for a second day after Persimmon, which was up 7.2 per cent, or 130p, to 1940p, reported revenue for the year was up 8 per cent to £3.14billion.  Fastjet took off as it announced plans to raise £23.4million from investors. The airline business wants to use the cash to increase its working capital and improve cash flow. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Bosses of collapsed cruise firm All Leisure Group paid...

It will also have the right to nominate two directors to the firm’s board. Fastjet said the agreement would help grow the business in a flexible and cost-effective way. Shares flew up 9.8 per cent, or 1.62p, to 18.25p. STOCK WATCH - SCIENCE IN SPORT  Science in Sport soared as sales surged 30 per cent to £12.2million in 2016. The firm develops sports nutrition products, such as powders, gels and cereal bars.  The group said investment in its website and operations had seen direct sales double year-on-year. Growth in the US and Italy will be a particular focus for 2017 after Australia delivered ahead of target last year. While costs have increased, the firm said a more efficient product line meant margins were improving. Shares gained 7.7 per cent, or 5.5p, to 77p. Support services outfit Babcock has won a defence contract with the French Air Force. Babcock France will provide new training aircraft, simulators and training facilities in an 11-year deal worth more than £427million. Shares edged up 0.5 per cent, or 4.5p, to 955.5p. Cape climbed as it revealed full-year results are now likely to be materially ahead of expectations.  The industrial services provider said strong trading in the final two months of the year, particularly in Asia, meant results were now set to be better than expected. Cape has also won additional work at a natural gas project in Western Australia where it will provide painting, insulation, fire proofing and other services. Shares rocketed 17.4 per cent, or 26.5p, to 178.5p. PureCircle plunged as it revealed that sales had slipped after US Customs and Border Protection had detained a shipment earlier in the year of stevia – a type of natural sweetener.  It was detained in June amid allegations the shipment contained products produced using forced labour. PureCircle said the allegations were incorrect and it was committed to human rights and the proper and fair use of labour. The shipment was released after four weeks. But, with a third of the company’s sales coming from the US, the incident had a knock-on effect and PureCircle said gross margin, earnings and profit were likely to be lower. While growth had been strong in the six months to December 31 and demand for stevia-based products is increasing, sales were down 14 per cent to £38million.  The group is expecting a net loss of £1.6million, compared with a profit of £4million a year ago. However, PureCircle said increased awareness of obesity and implementation of sugar taxes by governments is driving demand for alternative sweeteners. Shares dropped 4.3 per cent, or 10.75p, to 240.25p. Software firm Intercede revealed it had received one of its largest ever orders. The deal with the US Government, worth around £2.4million, had been expected in the first half of the year but was delayed. The order is for software licenses and annual support and maintenance for its MyID identity and credential management software. Shares were flat at 57.5p.

The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies after U.S. inflation and unemployment data failed to reverse a downtrend that followed some of the biggest gains on record for China's yuan. U.S. Treasury debt yields slipped as investors grew risk-averse amid uncertainty about the incoming Trump administration. MSCI's world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, rose 0.55 percent for a third straight day of gains. The index has been riding a wave of upbeat factory and service sector surveys out of the United States, Europe and Asia this week. Growth in China's services sector accelerated to a 17-month high in December, a private sector survey showed. The index, however, got little support from Wall Street as the S&P 500 closed slightly lower, weighed by financial shares and as investors dumped traditional retailers Macy's and Kohl's on dismal holiday sales numbers. Amazon powered the Nasdaq Composite to a record closing high. The S&P 500 financial index fell 1.02 percent due to declines in JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. "Financials coming down probably had something to do with bond yields coming down. A lot of the post-election rally was predicated on yields moving higher," said Jimmy Chang, chief investment strategist at Rockefeller & Co. Adding to the downbeat sentiment was a report by a payrolls processor which showed that U.S. private employers added fewer jobs than expected in December even as the U.S. labor market remained solid. Thursday's ADP report precedes Friday's nonfarm payrolls data, which includes hiring in both private and public sectors. "Overall it looks like investors will be in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the Labor Department report tomorrow," said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.87 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 19,899.29, the S&P 500 lost 1.75 points, or 0.08 percent, to finish at 2,269 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.93 points, or 0.2 percent, to finish at 5,487.94. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.12 percent at 1,445.57. U.S. Treasury debt yields dropped broadly, falling for a third straight session. Yields should rise again despite weakness early in the year, although for the next few weeks they likely will be range-bound as investors wait to see results from the incoming Trump administration, said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. "There's a lot of uncertainty until the next administration takes place," Lederer said. "We'll be in ranges until we know more about the Trump presidency." Buying in Treasuries also accelerated after the disappointing private sector payrolls data. The U.S. 10-year note was up 29/32 in price to yield 2.348 percent, compared with 2.452 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar slipped to a three-week low against a basket of currencies. China stepped into both its onshore and offshore yuan markets to shore up the faltering yuan, sparking speculation that it wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 1.26 percent to 101.41. The dollar's retreat helped push gold to its highest in a month. Spot gold rose 1.43 percent to $1,180.01 an ounce. Oil prices rose in a choppy session, lifted by news that Saudi Arabia had cut production to meet OPEC's agreement to cut output. Prices had fallen earlier on data showing a surprisingly large increase in U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories. Brent crude settled up 43 cents, or 0.76 percent, at $56.89 a barrel, and U.S. crude settled up 50 cents, or 0.94 percent, at $53.76.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/FilesMore By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity prices shrugged off weakness on Wall Street to cling to gains after hitting their highest level since mid-2015 on Thursday, bolstered by strong Chinese data that added to optimism about global growth and inflation. The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies after U.S. inflation and unemployment data failed to reverse a downtrend that followed some of the biggest gains on record for China's yuan. U.S. Treasury debt yields slipped as investors grew risk-averse amid uncertainty about the incoming Trump administration. MSCI's world index <.MIWD00000PUS>, which tracks shares in 46 countries, rose 0.55 percent for a third straight day of gains. The index has been riding a wave of upbeat factory and service sector surveys out of the United States, Europe and Asia this week. Growth in China's services sector accelerated to a 17-month high in December, a private sector survey showed. The index, however, got little support from Wall Street as the S&P 500 closed slightly lower, weighed by financial shares and as investors dumped traditional retailers Macy's and Kohl's on dismal holiday sales numbers. Amazon powered the Nasdaq Composite to a record closing high. The S&P 500 financial index <.SPSY> fell 1.02 percent due to declines in JPMorgan , Wells Fargo and Bank of America . "Financials coming down probably had something to do with bond yields coming down.

Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> closed up 0.12 percent at 1,445.57. U.S. Treasury debt yields dropped broadly, falling for a third straight session. Yields should rise again despite weakness early in the year, although for the next few weeks they likely will be range-bound as investors wait to see results from the incoming Trump administration, said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. "There's a lot of uncertainty until the next administration takes place," Lederer said. "We'll be in ranges until we know more about the Trump presidency." Buying in Treasuries also accelerated after the disappointing private sector payrolls data. The U.S. 10-year note was up 29/32 in price to yield 2.348 percent, compared with 2.452 percent late on Wednesday. The dollar slipped to a three-week low against a basket of currencies.

In case of abuse, click here to report. Asian emerging equity market performance was mixed in 2016, as both core and frontier MSCI index components faded into end-year on combined internal growth and policy weaknesses, and external trade and geopolitical worries. In the main markets China “A” shares and India were down 10% and 3% percent respectively, and Malaysia and the Philippines each lost 7%. Thailand was the winner up 23%, followed by Indonesia and Taiwan rising 15 % and Korea 7%, as the overall regional gain was just half the MSCI’s benchmark 8%. In the frontier Pakistan, which will revert to the more advanced index in mid-2017, was the leading market generally with a 33% advance, and Bangladesh was also positive (+8%), while Sri Lanka and Vietnam declined 8%. JP Morgan’s EMBI bond gauge jumped 9.5% for the year, as Indonesia slightly outperformed (+11%), and the Philippines badly lagged (+3%). The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox Investors head into 2017 with this uneven record reflecting erosion of the region’s comparative “safe haven” reputation, which may be further tarnished if the new US administration carries through on commercial retaliation for alleged protectionism and currency manipulation. They still await decisive action on political, infrastructure, banking and private debt troubles, and favorites this year will be countries that finally treat them with a sense of urgency missing since the aftermath of financial crisis almost a decade ago. Chinese GDP growth has tracked the 6.5% target with the PMI manufacturing reading well above 50, but the Yuan slipped by the same amount against the dollar for the biggest annual drop in two decades. Regulators reopened the initial public offering pipeline with dozens of new approvals, but tightened individual cash transfer reporting rules for transactions over RMB 50,000, from the previous RMB 200,000, at the same time they warned against an outbound direct investment deals surge. According to government statistics, foreign ownership of local assets was RMB 3.3 trillion in the third quarter versus RMB 4.6 trillion at end-2015. Fund flow numbers compiled by the EPFR database continue to show heavy outflows from China as annual capital exit is estimate again in the $800 billion range, potentially pulling reserves below $3 trillion. Coming into 2017, Beijing relaxed the 49 percent financial sector overseas participation cap and doubled the units in its managed currency basket to reduce dollar weight, but also revealed that bond defaults quadrupled as record liquidity was injected into the banking system in December to tamp yield spikes. The central bank strengthened scrutiny of bank off-balance sheet exposure and also floated a possible real estate tax as Beijing mayor’s promised to “stamp out” price speculation. Outside these erratic indicators, China’s Communist leadership entered into a diplomatic spat with US President-elect Trump over Washington-Taiwan ties ahead of the upcoming party Congress, where President Xi may seek another term and groom next-generation successors. India sputtered the final months of 2016, as equity inflows fell to US$4 billion and US$6 billion in debt outflows were registered with the controversial seizure of high-denomination banknotes to isolate so-called black money.  The sudden move designed to defeat wealthy tax-dodgers descended into chaos which overwhelmed ATM networks and shuttered small shops, and also delayed the national unified tax timetable as states grappled with the revenue fallout. Prime Minister Modi’s team suggested that further anti-corruption and money-laundering measures were being planned that could also have immediate personal consumption and bank liquidity effects. The saga overwhelmed lower inflation results allowing a minimal benchmark rate cut, as growth estimates were rejiggered for further distance from the 7% goal. Indonesia was popular with a series of deregulation and infrastructure packages, but a hyped tax amnesty lagged projections to help send the fiscal deficit toward the 3% of GDP limit. Foreign investors, who hold one-third of domestic government debt, were further disturbed by official action against securities house JP Morgan, including its suspension as a primary dealer, after its research recommended trimming allocation. Thailand bounced off its 2015 bottom as a constitutional election return roadmap was approved under the ruling military, which also ushered in smooth royal succession after King Bhumipol’s death. The Philippines had the most extreme swings after President Duterte’s post-election rally gave way to concerns over unpredictable law and order and economic policies, resulting in the peso as the currency laggard and also a regional wake-up call to offer reasoned convincing solutions to festering poverty and security challenges alongside the lengthy productivity improvement, financial stability and structural reform agenda.

JPMorgan's complete guide to everything happening in the markets Prashanth Perumal Jan. 5, 2017, 2:49 PM 102,640 facebook linkedin twitter email print JP Morgan Asset Management 2017 promises to be an exciting year for markets, with Donald Trump set to move into the White House in a couple of weeks. Markets, it seems, expect him to make sweeping changes to policy, but there is considerable doubt whether the euphoria will last long. A bunch of risks from 2016 carry over into 2017, though, including currency and debt worries in China and lackluster growth in the US and Europe. JPMorgan provides a guide to make sense of all these and more as we travel through the first quarter of 2017.

The latest appointment is elite Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton whose good works include defending big banks for their financial crisis crimes and advising Goldman Sachs on its government bailout. Trump claimed that Clayton would release the job-creating power of the U.S. economy while at the same time providing oversight. Trump hopes to make the oversight simpler and no doubt less than previously. Trump said: "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers. Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority." Clayton is a partner in the important law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell. He has advised on major deals such as the Alibaba IPO and the sale of the NBA, Atlanta Hawks. His bio at the firm show he was involved in helping work out mortage settlements between large financial institutions and the government. The institutions had issued or underwritten hundreds of toxic mortgage deals just prior to the economic meltdown. The firm helped JP Morgan reach a $13 billion deal with the Department of Justice in 2013. Clayton also had connections to Bear Stearns the investment bank that went under during the financial meltdown. He represented the company in its fire sale to JPMorgan. Also, Clayton helped out Goldman Sachs with its TARP bailout as well as a $5 billion investment from Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway during the crisis. Clayton has also worked for the SEC. Clayton says he wants to strike a balance between providing oversight and helping the economy. Given that regulations will be reduced and Clayton has strong ties to big financial institutions the balance will be weighted towards helping the financial institutions prosper. Rather than say this, he talks of helping the economy which is politically more palatable. Clayton said: "We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs." The appointment of Clayton is a clear message that Trump is intending to reduce regulations that corporations find irksome or reduce economic growth. Clayton has pledged to ensure that companies and investors have the confidence to invest in the United States. The present head of SEC, Mary Jo White is giving up the post on January 20 even though her term expires in June 2019. Senator Elizabeth Warren has criticized White as not preventing businesses from pouring cash into politics. It is not clear that Clayton will do any better and he will not be trying to implement Dodd-Frank reform rules as was White but trying to dismantle them. Clayton won the job over former federal prosecutor Debra Yang. While also a prominent corporate lawyer Yang was tough as a prosecutor and took on a violent drug gang as well as investigating financial fraud. Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, who is on the Senate Banking Committee said that Clayton was an "attorney who's spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap". Adam Green, of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, compared nominating Clayton as head of the SEC to allowing the fox to guard the henhouse on Wall Street. On the other end of the political spectrum, the Investment Adviser Association, which represents SEC-registered firms claimed Clayton was a "highly regarded, respected and accomplished lawyer" with a "deep understanding" or complex transactions and regulations. Jaret Seiber, an analyst at Cowen and Co. said the selection of Clayton was a conventional choice for a Republican president. Other creatures in the swamp will recognize Clayton as a welcome comrade. Clayton has pleaded for less onerous restrictions on foreign public companies in the U.S. and also participated in writing an article in 2011 that advocated less zealous enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Clayton's wife is employed by Goldman Sachs as a private wealth advisor. Senator Sherrod Brown said: "It's hard to see how an attorney who’s spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump's promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder.'" Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, who served as chief ethics lawyer under the George W. Bush administration said that Clayton's wife's employment at Goldman Sachs created a problem: "You cannot be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and have you or your spouse have any financial interest in Goldman Sachs." He said she would have to divest herself of any stock or options she holds and negotiate a flat salary. As the appended video points out, supporters of Trump should be digusted at his appointment of so many prominent Wall Street figures to his administration after claiming that Hillary Clinton was a puppet of Wall Street and that he was going to drain the Washington swamp.

Rizzi Published January 05 2017, 8:30am EST More in Law and regulation Dodd-Frank SIFIs Print Email Reprints Share Share on The new administration will undoubtedly address needed reform of the problematic Dodd-Frank Act this year. Especially pressing is Dodd-Frank's Title II, known as the Orderly Liquidation Authority. The OLA gives regulators the power to seize and liquidate failing "too big to fail" banks, attempting to eliminate taxpayer-funded bailouts while minimizing disruption of a collapse to the financial system. It adopts many of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's methods used for small bank receiverships. But critics have correctly noted that Title II has in fact institutionalized TBTF by creating formalized bailout procedures with dedicated taxpayer-supported funding. GOP lawmakers are now focused on the proposed Financial Choice Act, a contender to replace the DFA. It contains new provisions to prevent future taxpayer-funded bailouts. The provisions include, among other things, a repeal of the OLA procedure, a reform of the bankruptcy laws as an alternative for winding down failing giants, limits on Federal Reserve emergency lending power and repeal of the FDIC's authority to guarantee bank obligations. The problem with these provisions is they are the wrong solution to the right problem. Attempting to eliminate bailouts while TBTF banks exist is dangerously delusional. Despite DFA's capital and liquidity increase efforts, research shows investors perceive the big six banks — Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo — as no safer than they were before the crisis. Banks simply have insufficient capital to cover losses created by forced sales of assets at fire-sale prices during a crisis. Among the post-crisis reforms was the Fed's Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity rule, which requires firms to have enough capital and long-term debt to support a resolution. But the modest capital levels imposed by the rule are unlikely to cover losses in a failure. This leaves the question of what to do should one or more TBTF banks experience financial difficulty during the next crisis. Reform efforts relying on bankruptcy law, like the Choice Act, represent a questionable untested leap of faith with a huge downside should it fail to work. The problem is not with the bankruptcy code, but with trying to apply it to TBTF institutions during a crisis. Their very size would clog the system. For example, Lehman Brothers, a midsize investment bank that filed for bankruptcy in 2008, took years to resolve. Trying to resolve one, or more, much larger and more complex TBTF banks during a crisis without a bailout would be like trying to change a flat tire while the car is still moving. This is why "no more bailouts" laws lack market credibility. Investors recognize no government would or should allow a TBTF bank to fail during a crisis. Bailouts are merely the symptom of the boarder problem of having banks too big to resolve safely. Under the current set of choices, policymakers face a difficult balancing act trying to ensure the safety of the banking system while avoiding taxpayer-funded bank bailouts. It may only be possible to satisfy one of those interests at any one time. Yet there may be a more effective reform path in considering structural alternatives to the banking system: either reducing the size of TBTF banks so they can more safely fail, or regulate them as utilities to prevent their failure. There are no easy, quick fixes. If there were, they would have been tried already. Reform efforts must guard against creating a false sense of security leading potentially to disastrous governmental inaction during a crisis. The idea that orderly liquidation under Dodd-Frank, reforming the bankruptcy code or some other means will fix the TBTF problem is a myth. Whether you like bailouts is irrelevant to the TBTF issue. If these institutions exist, then bailouts are required. The only way to end bailouts is to eliminate TBTF-sized institutions. Address the problem, not the symptom, to avoid a cure worse than the disease. J.V. Rizzi is a banking industry consultant and investor. The views expressed are his own.

INNOVATE 5 Industries Ripe for Disruption in 2017 From live sports to real estate, it's been a long time coming for a lot of these spaces. By Kevin J. Ryan Kevin J. Ryan is a staff writer for Inc. He has written for ESPN The Magazine and the Long Island Press and contributed to Mental Floss. He lives in Queens, New York. @wheresKR Staff writer, Inc.@wheresKR 1 COMMENTS Members of the Chicago Cubs celebrate winning the 2016 World Series. In many cases, it's impossible to legally stream live sporting events, even if you're willing to pay. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The customer experience is uniformly bad. The business model hasn't changed in decades. The products overpromise and underdeliver. These are just some of the signs when a staid industry is in need of a serious shakeup. Expect to see several shakeups in 2017. Here are five industries we'll be watching. 1. Mobile banking Fees to use other banks' ATMs? Three days for transfers to clear? Sometimes it feels like you'd be better off keeping a wad of cash under your bed--at least your piggy bank won't charge you a monthly maintenance fee. Already, companies like Square and Stripe have moved customers toward cashless and cardless transactions; it's just a matter of time till those customers will want to become bankless, too. Mobile banking startups like GoBank, Moven, and Simple appeal to the "de-banked" customer. Zero, which launches in 2017, is looking to give customers a more convenient and rewarding banking option--think credit card perks but with a debit card. "I think we'll see more innovation in [mobile banking], and companies going deeper with their product offerings," says Matthew Wong, senior research analyst at CB Insights. Even big banks have taken notice, but are moving slowly to join the fast-paced, convenient, and customer-focused modern age. "Silicon Valley is coming," wrote JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in a letter to shareholders in 2015. "There are hundreds of startups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking." 2. Live sports Thanks to services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, viewers have already started cutting the cord. But there's one big factor that keeps many people tethered to their cable deals: live sports. In many cases, it's impossible to view a live sporting event online legally, even if you're willing to pay, mostly because of agreements between sports leagues and TV networks established long before live streaming. In November, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon had talked with several of the U.S.'s biggest sports leagues about acquiring the rights to stream games, calling live sports "the last bastion of traditional pay-television." A few weeks before that, popular Italian soccer club A.C. Milan signed a deal with Los Angeles-based sports streaming startup Sportle to broadcast exclusive live video--the first such deal between a major sports team and a third party. And in 2016, Twitter began live streaming Thursday Night Football games for its users. Cable and satellite companies won't like it, but leagues like the NFL, NBA, NHL, and Major League Baseball have a lot to gain by inking deals with streaming services and getting their products--behind-the-scenes events and eventually live games--in front of more eyeballs. 3. Real estate In the first half of 2016, investors poured $1.8 billion into real estate tech startups--an 85 percent increase from the previous year, according to CB Insights. These deals included everything from property management platforms, such as Homelink and Buildup, to online tools for lenders and brokers. But the bigger opportunity might be where the stakes are higher: the home buying and selling process. One startup, San Francisco-based Opendoor, uses location, size, and other variables to calculate a home's price, and then makes an offer. If the seller accepts, he or she gets paid immediately, the home is placed in escrow, and the company arranges an inspection before putting it back on the market for buyers. The company has had some success selling homes in the Phoenix area, where traditionally listed homes spend an average of more than 70 days on the market. Opendoor's process takes about 90 days on average, but the seller gets paid quickly. Says Wong: "That's definitely a theme we've seen lately: building algorithms and using machine learning to take something as complex as buying real estate and reduce the process to a much shorter time span." Don't be surprised to see competitors springing up soon. 4. Energy Despite some progress, 86 percent of America's energy supply still comes from coal, gas, or nuclear power plants. In 2017, that could start to change in a significant way. The price of solar installations has been cut in half in the U.S. since 2010, and, according to a new report from the World Economic Forum, wind and solar energy now cost less than fossil fuels in 30 countries, with two-thirds of the world's nations expected to reach that threshold within the next several years. That low, stable price point is a big reason why Google will offset 100 percent of its energy needs with renewable sources in 2017; Apple and Facebook are close to hitting that milestone as well. This year, Tesla's solar roofs will roll out, offering an alternative to the ugly panels that have adorned roofs since the '80s--perhaps the last consumer pain point preventing widespread adoption. Companies that can follow Tesla's lead in delivering solar through attractive or disguised means--like Solar Roadways, which is embedding solar panels in a rest stop's concrete parking lot--could help turn the energy industry upside down. "Renewable energy has reached a tipping point," Michael Drexler, head of infrastructure and development investing at the WEF, told Quartz in December. "It is not only a commercially viable option, but an outright compelling investment opportunity with long-term, stable, inflation-protected returns." 5. Athletic equipment The sports industry has internet-connected shirts, pants, and even socks. But what about equipment that reliably protects athletes' heads? With the revelations about the health risks of impact sports like football and lacrosse, there is a huge opportunity to nail down a desirable helmet design that can help reduce concussions and other head traumas. According to Bloomberg, Ridell and Schutt Sports own 90 percent of the $100 million to $150 million football helmet market--and the vast majority of available products look almost exactly the same as they did in the 1960s. Making the space difficult to tap into is the fact that lower levels of competition tend to follow the lead of the big leagues--and top athletes are notoriously particular about their equipment. Seattle-based Vicis has come close to cracking open the market: Several college programs adopted its "crumpling" helmets that bent upon impact during training camp, but they were eventually pulled when players complained about their fit. Some company will eventually design the helmet that NFL and college teams come to embrace, and when it does, the heads of those athletes, plus one million high school football players, are sure to provide lots of profits.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter RyanVlastelica Markets reporter The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at a record Thursday, as the broader stock market finished lower, dragged down by a steep slide in the financial sector and major retailers. Mixed data on jobs also raised concerns a day before the closely watched December employment report due Friday. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.48%  closed up 10.93 points, or 0.2%, at 5,487.94, following a day of slight gains and losses. Shares of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.43%  supported the index with a 3.1% gain. The last time the Nasdaq notched a record close was Dec. 27. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  fell 42.87 points, or 0.2%, to close at 19,899.29, paring losses after being down by as much as 131 points. Among the biggest decliners were Travelers Cos. TRV, +0.26% shedding 1.6%, and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.01% down 1.5%. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.53% finished down 0.9% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., GS, +0.19%  declined 0.7%, paring sharp losses from earlier in the session. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.18%  declined 1.75 points, or 0.1%, to finish at 2,269.00. The financial sector was the index’s biggest drag, falling 1%, while retailers, Kohl’s Corp. KSS, -1.26% and Macy’s Inc. M, -0.33% were taking it on the chin after disappointing holiday sales and announcing stores closures. Shares of Macy’s plummeted to close down 14% after the department-store chain late Wednesday announced plans to close 68 stores and lay off 10,000 employees in 2017. Fellow retailer Kohl’s, saw its worst trading day ever, finishing down 19%, after it cut its fiscal 2016 earnings outlook late Wednesday, following volatile holiday sales. Markets have enjoyed an upswing lately, with investors betting that President-elect Donald Trump will accelerate economic growth by emphasizing corporate tax cuts and deregulation. While most view the market’s uptrend as intact, the pace of the rally—which has taken major indexes to repeated records and pushed the Dow within striking distance of 20,000—has some concerned that equity valuations are getting ahead of fundamentals, notably earnings growth. But the uptrend that got the stock market to this point—a strong dollar trade, rallying financials, and a jump in bond yields—is showing signs of faltering, and that has many investors anticipating a downturn, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, in an interview. “What’s interesting is that yesterday we saw some shift in terms of higher-than-expected inflation out of the eurozone and that took starch out of the dollar’s rally,” Stone said. Read: Will surging Chinese yuan wreck the dollar rally? On Thursday, eurozone producer prices data showed a 0.1% rise for November, following Wednesday’s data showing that eurozone inflation jumped to 1.1% in December. Since the election, both the S&P 500 and the dollar both rallied in lockstep about 6% before hitting recent resistance. An uptick in inflation will make it more difficult for the European Central Bank to push for stimulus measures, which means the strong dollar trend could weaken, he said. Add to that the anticipation that stocks generally sell off during the first quarter following an election, and the worry that the Trump rally is heading for a reversal only grows, Stone said. See: ‘Trump rally’ could end when president-elect takes office: Morgan Stanley Others are worry that the postelection rally has simply overextended itself. “We must be careful with the strength in equity markets; the upside has been undoubtedly strong, and for me a little too strong,” said James Hughes, chief market analyst, at GKFX, in a note. Hughes also speculated that the speedy rise in stocks was encouraging investors to take some money off the table. “There is a big chance that the importance and focus of the 20,000 level could mean it is a key area of resistance on the upside, but also a key area for traders looking to exit long positions. A break could see a whole raft of profit-taking that could well be the catalyst for a medium-term correction in equity markets, a much-needed correction after two months of pure upside,” he added. Financials could be particularly vulnerable to profit-taking; the group has accounted for the bulk of the market’s postelection advance. Economic news: The market digested two reads on the labor market that pointed to mixed conditions. The private sector added 153,000 jobs in December, according to ADP, a rate that was below forecasts, while first-time jobless claims fell 28,000 in the latest week, dropping to a nearly 43-year low. The reports gave little clarity on what investors could expect with Friday’s closely watched December jobs report. See: 4 things to watch in the December jobs report Separately, a read on the U.S. services sector held steady at a 12-month high in December, suggesting growth in nonmanufacturing activity, mainly the service sector, remains strong.

Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s respected chief executive, is said to have told Francois Hollande in October that France must loosen its tight labour laws, which currently make it difficult for banks to recruit and shed staff, if Paris is to rival London as a financial hub.  Mr Dimon is believed to have been seeking a change of  legislation specifically regarding the employment of high-paid staff at financial firms. Mr Hollande, who in December announced he would not seek a second term, reassured the US bank boss that a revamp would be instigated by the next president, according to The Wall Street Journal.  The comments were made in a meeting between Mr Hollande, Mr Dimon, and a host of advisers to JP Morgan. They are significant as competition is now hotting up among cities around the world to attract financial services jobs away from the City in the wake of the June vote for the UK to leave the European Union. Banks, insurers, and asset managers that have their European operations based in Britain are fearful that they will lose their access to the EU’s single market once the UK secedes from the 28-nation bloc. The Government, which has committed to starting the two-year EU exit process by the end of March, is yet to give the City any clarity on the terms of the Brexit deal it will try and strike with Brussels. As a result, firms are already drawing up contingency plans in case single market access is lost and industry insiders believe banks could start the laborious process of moving jobs in the next few months. It would deal a blow to London’s status as a global powerhouse that acts as a hub for European finance. Before the EU referendum JP Morgan, which employs about 16,000 people in the UK, had warned it could move about 4,000 jobs as a result of Brexit, and Mr Dimon said earlier this week that the bank was examining a range of options. Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg are among the European cities vying to attract bank staff away from London, while further afield New York and Singapore are also considered potential beneficiaries of Brexit. JP Morgan declined to comment.

Photo: Mark Lennihan-Pool/Getty Images Two New Yorkers running for president (three if you count Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders)—what could be better? Well, just about anything, it turns. The ball dropped Sunday on an uncertain and despondent city, fearful for the future. Will our native-born billionaire president-elect follow through on vows to sap sanctuary cities like this one of federal funding? Will he set in motion a global trade war? Or, you know, an actual war? Will he at least get Congress to pick up the tab for the NYPD security around his family and properties? Last week, we gave a glimpse of those New Yorkers who entered 2017 more broken up than Mariah Carey. But what about those who got to pop their champagne bottles early? Read on. Mayor Bill de Blasio, left, with Police Commissioner James O’Neill after the Chelsea bombing. Spencer Platt/Getty Images 1. James O’Neill There’s an episode of The Simpsons where Homer tries to get himself out of an escalating series of crises by explaining “it’s my first day.” On James O’Neill’s first day as commissioner of the country’s largest police department, a bomb went off in Manhattan while the president of the United States was in town. The newly-minted top cop was not a nationally-known quasi-celebrity crime fighter or terrorism-crusher like his two immediate predecessors. He was a Flatbush, Brooklyn native who had spent more than three decades rising through the ranks first of the old Transit Police, then of the NYPD. It was in the former role that he forged a bond with Mr. Bratton during the 1980s. O’Neill’s ascent slowed during the 2000s, but Bratton promoted him to Chief of Patrol in June 2014—then Chief of Department just four months later, after the resignation of Phillip Banks. When Bratton revealed his plans to depart the department in August of this year, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced O’Neill would fill his role. Working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and New Jersey authorities, NYPD identified the bomber as Ahmad Khan Rahami. After a brief, desperate manhunt, Rahami was in custody, and calm restored to the city. If the administration’s grand plans prove successful, that may prove just a footnote in the ledger of O’Neill’s accomplishments. Even before reaching his current perch, O’Neill was charged with designing and implementing de Blasio’s “neighborhood policing” program, aimed at healing the rifts between the department and many nonwhite communities. Just a month after the Chelsea bombing, an NYPD sergeant fatally shot a mentally unstable baseball bat-wielding grandmother in the Bronx. The commissioner’s response was jarring in its candor. “What is clear in this once instance, we failed,” O’Neill said. “We do have policies and procedures for handling emotionally disturbed people and it looks like some of those procedures weren’t followed.” This comment predictably outraged the Sergeants Benevolent Association, but it’s unclear that anger permeated the rank and file that O’Neill came up from. Bratton was immensely popular among officers even during his boss’s darkest days. But his abrasive persona and tough reputation alienated reform-minded members of the City Council and the activist class. Many of those same people, including Brooklyn Councilman Jumaane Williams and Bronx Councilman Ritchie Torres, greeted O’Neill’s promotion optimistically, and praised his record of cooperation and diplomacy. If O’Neill can enact his agenda with success, and while appeasing cops and advocates alike —and while keeping crime rates down—he will have succeeded where his predecessors never could. The new commissioner has one other item on the agenda, and it’s a doozy: he’ll inevitably have to make a pilgrimage to D.C. to beg Congress to reimburse his department for its work shielding Donald Trump and his properties. But while plenty of Republicans revile New York City, respect for the NYPD is common to both sides of the aisle, and with a little Irish luck O’Neill will leverage that to his advantage. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. Spencer Platt/Getty Images 2. Preet Bharara None of the U.S. Attorney’s victims this year matched the scalps he collected in 2015: those of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos. But he took out Norman Seabrook, president of the powerful city correction officers’ union, a handful of top NYPD brass and a top de Blasio money man, and a raft of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s most important aides and campaign donors. On top of that, thanks to some finangling by his old boss Sen. Charles Schumer, Bharara will get to keep his post in the Trump administration—an almost unheard of triumph, since presidents usually like to have their personally picked prosecutors in the powerful Southern District Office. This will let the ambitious anti-corruption crusader to continue to target big game, with the mayor and his top political aides now in his sights. It’s unlikely he’s done taking shots at the governor, either. Bharara is clearly positioning himself for a higher post. Under the Obama administration, he was known to covet the office of U.S. Attorney General. That honor eluded him. With two well-cemented U.S. Senators in New York and a Republican regime in Washington, all that appears to remain for him is the top job in Albany—meaning he will have to evict its current occupant somehow. New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman Andrew Burton/Getty Images 3. Eric Schneiderman The state attorney general is the epitome of an activist prosecutor, and courts press attention at every opportunity. Some of his suits have failed, and his recent attempt to indict oil giant ExxonMobil for defrauding investors about the prospects of climate change appears to have run into a reef. But he has enjoyed tremendous success over the last several years wringing big banks for massive settlements over their role in the 2008 financial crisis, thanks in part to President Barack Obama, who appointed him chair of a national task force probing the mortgage industry. Yet Schneiderman has languished in relative obscurity compared to his predecessors, Eliot Spitzer and Cuomo, lacking both Spitzer’s steamroller persona and Cuomo’s bankable name. And Schneiderman clearly longs to follow them into the governor’s mansion. But Trump’s improbable ascent to the White House has offered Schneiderman a chance at some of the recognition he craves. He led a multi-state case against the dubious Trump University real estate seminar, and helped secure a $25 million settlement from the president-elect—$1 million of it going straight to the State of New York. His ongoing probe of the president-elect’s personal foundation, its unlicensed fundraising and its questionable expenditures, could reap even more headlines in the months to come. Already it appears the A.G. will try to block Trump from shutting down the sketchy charity, which could turn into a legal showdown with national repercussions. Schneiderman has also joined Bharara in indicting Alain Kaloyeros, the former State University of New York Polytechnic Institute president and point man for Cuomo’s flagship economic development programs. Kaloyeros stands accused of rigging multiple contracts so that only donors to Cuomo’s campaign could qualify. A successful conviction could open up a path to the governor’s office for an ambitious prosecutor—but there’s only room for one. Hungry as Schneiderman is, he’s shied away from going after Cuomo directly, even though the governor has repeatedly flouted and embarrassed him during their shared six years in statewide office (Cuomo also favored Schneiderman’s 2010 primary rival, then-Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice). Bharara, on the other hand, has shown he’s willing and eager to bite down hard, promising “gory detail” on the corruption at the heart of the governor’s signature initiatives. If the Silver and Skelos cases are any indication, the trials of Kaloyeros and indicted Cuomo confidante Joseph Percoco are bound to be ugly and humiliating affairs, deeply compromising to Cuomo. Schneiderman will have to develop a taste for the governor’s blood, or the U.S. Attorney alone will feast on the spoils. The Goldman Sachs booth at the New York Stock Exchange. Chris Hondros/Getty Images 4. Wall Street You know you’re a real winner when you bet on the wrong horse and still get to take the pot. The Masters of the Universe put their money—literally—on Hillary Clinton capturing the presidency, in one of their finest predictions since forecasting that the housing market would continue to expand indefinitely. Goldman Sachs forbade its employees from donating to Trump. Citi warned immediately ahead of the election that a devastating global economic crash would ensue should the Queens-born businessman triumph—though the company gave him only a one-in-three chance of winning. Both banks had hosted the former first lady for a few of her infamous speeches, as did JPMorgan Chase, and their money-handlers flooded her campaign coffers. This, of course, became fodder for both Sanders and Trump, who depicted her as a pawn of a vast financial conspiracy. The Republican nominee even included an image of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein in a late ad assailing the “global power structure.” Yet doomsday came and went without Citi’s predicted crash. Quite the opposite—the Dow is close to smashing through the 20,000 point barrier, riding a wave of trader euphoria over Trump’s imminent trashing of the post-crash Dodd-Frank regulations. Trump placed JPMorgan Chase CEO James Dimon (a longtime Clinton donor) on his “Strategic and Policy Forum,” and reportedly offered him the job of Secretary of the Treasury. Dimon turned him down, and that role instead went to Steven Mnuchin, a Goldman Sachs alum. The firm’s president, Gary Cohn, will be Trump’s chief economic advisor. Moral of the story: win or lose, these guys get paid. State Senator Jeffrey Klein. Ross Barkan/Observer 5. Jeffrey Klein Since 2012, the leader of the State Senate’s Independent Democratic Conference has enjoyed some kind of coalition agreement with the State Senate Republicans, granting him many of the perquisites of power his former colleagues in the mainline Democratic caucus once sought to deny him. Shortly after New Year’s Day, he revealed he would collaborate with them again. That decision was coming for weeks, even months. Klein peeled two seats away from the larger Democratic deputation—those of Brooklyn State Senator Jesse Hamilton and freshly elected Upper Manhattan State Senator Marisol Alcantara—ahead of Election Day, finally adding some members of color to the previously snow-white IDC and swelling their ranks to seven. Alcantara in particular is a valuable pick-up, given her ties to the Rev. Al Sharpton and new Congressman Adriano Espaillat. With a GOP majority so fragile a well-timed sneeze could blow it apart (another defecting Democrat, Brooklyn State Senator Simcha Felder, gives the Republicans just a one-seat advantage), the IDC can provide the votes necessary for a quorum if somebody falls ill, leaves the chamber or gets arrested. The splinter faction also has more money in its campaign fund than the other Democratic delegation, and Klein one of the few people left in Albany with an amicable relationship with the governor. But by absorbing Hamilton and Alcantara, Klein has taken something of a risk. The other IDC members hailed from districts with a decent Republican population, or at least some conservative inclinations, where relatively few would see propping up a GOP leadership structure as an outrage or apostasy. The two new members represent fiercely blue areas, where many might frown on empowering Republicans. And so Klein will have to extract some liberal concessions from the GOP on their behalf. Majority Leader John Flanagan is probably receptive to this, but his moderate Long Island delegation makes up a shrinking share of the Republican conference, relative to hard-right upstate members. Assemblyman Ronald Castorina, left, and Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, right. Will Bredderman/Observer 6. Staten Island Republicans Since the election there’s been a lot of jawing in Manhattan cable news studios about Trump’s surprising performance in once solid-blue counties of the old industrial Midwest, and plenty of fretting about how “coastal elites” have lost touch with the American core. But if any of these hand-wringing coastal elites bothered to take a short boat ride, they’d find themselves in a county with a five-to-three Democratic enrollment advantage that Trump won with nearly 60 percent of the vote. Staten Islanders broke for Obama in 2012 and Cuomo in 2014. But in 2016, they favored the candidate who shared their accent and worldview. Trump showed up at the local GOP’s Lincoln Day Brunch two days before the New York primary April, and subsequently carried Richmond County by his bigliest margin in the whole state. South Shore Councilman Joseph Borelli became one of the braggadocious developer’s earliest and most ardent supporters, and made multiple TV appearances as a surrogate. It was Staten Islanders who booed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz the loudest when he refused to endorse Trump in his speech at the GOP convention in July. But Borelli and party chairman John Antoniello weren’t the only Republicans who scored points last year. Congressman Daniel Donovan scarcely drew a challenge for what was once a hotly-contested seat, and appears to have ingratiated himself with the mayor and the rest of the city’s Democratic political class. Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis and Assemblyman Ronald Castorina, meanwhile, obtained an injunction in December blocking de Blasio from going through with plans to flush the records of his municipal identification program. Part of the idea behind IDNYC initiative was to provide a government-verified credential to people lacking other forms of paperwork, allowing them to do things like open a bank account. The city’s files are believed to contain the personal information of thousands upon thousands of undocumented immigrants. To prevent these logs from becoming a deportation database under a hostile administration, the City Council deliberately wrote a clause into the legislation that created the program enabling the administration to purge the files when the clock struck midnight on 2017. But Malliotakis and Castorina argued that wiping those records could compromise a future criminal investigation into a cardholder who used his IDNYC for illicit purposes—for instance, to open a bank account that financed terrorist activity. They triumphed in the preliminary round of legal proceedings, stopping de Blasio from dropping the records at year’s end, and prompting the mayor to announce the city would no longer retain any records relating to the municipal I.D. program at all. Politically speaking, this actually benefits all parties: Malliotakis and Castorina get to tell their voters they’re fighting de Blasio, de Blasio gets to tell his base he’s fighting Trump—everybody wins. Unless, of course, the Trump administration actually requisitions the records and uses them to start deporting people. Congressman Joseph Crowley delivers remarks on the second day of the Democratic National Convention. Alex Wong/Getty Images 7. Joseph Crowley The Queens congressman and county Democratic boss had an uneven batting average at home this year, but his stats on the road were great. He got an evening speaking slot at the party convention in Philadelphia, where he recalled how a firefighter cousin of his gave his life on 9/11—and how Trump, a fellow Queens native, “cashed in” on programs aimed at helping small businesses in the aftermath of the attack. His colleagues voted him up from vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus to chairman, making him the fourth-ranked Democrat in the House, bolstering his status as the top New York member—and potentially positioning him to one day replace Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Several of his colleagues reportedly even encouraged him to try to topple the San Francisco Democrat, and his pitch to his colleagues invoked his working-class roots, and sounded an awful lot like the argument Ohio Congressman Timothy Ryan gave in his bid to oust the incumbent leader. On top of all that, Congressman Steve Israel, a rival Democrat whose district covered parts of Nassau County and Queens, just retired. So far, though, Crowley has risen in stature without actually expanding his power. Democrats are still in the minority in the House. The Queens delegation wields little influence in the City Council. And Queens State Senator Michael Gianaris, a county loyalist who heads the Democratic State Senate Campaign Committee, failed to lead the party into political dominance in the upper chamber of the State Legislature. Crowley is in a position to help his party create a message that will allow it to capitalize on the anti-incumbent spirit of the midterms. He can also seek to reassert his influence at City Hall in the aftermath of local elections this fall, as the now-dominant Progressive Caucus appears poised to fracture. Finally, Crowley’s district stretches well into the Bronx, and he and State Senator Klein share both considerable turf and a close relationship with Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, the borough’s Democratic boss. The congressman unsuccessfully sought to boot Queens State Senator Tony Avella, a member of Klein’s caucus, from office in 2014. Still, few are better positioned than the Queens chairman to try to forge a coalition deal between Albany’s fractious Democratic factions following the next round of elections. The question is, does he have the juice to do it? Hillary Clinton confers with Congressman Hakeem Jeffries at Junior’s Restaurant in Brooklyn before the April Democratic primary. Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images 8. Hakeem Jeffries The Brooklyn congressman enjoyed a reputation as one of the city’s most promising political talents even before his election to the House in 2012. He’s used his seat as a pulpit to advocate for his signature issue of criminal justice reform, and occasionally as a platform for taking shots at de Blasio. But he was still a junior member of the Democratic minority, and seniority determined that if any benefits accrued to a representative from New York, they would go to Crowley. Rumors flew that he might challenge the mayor in next September’s primary, but it appeared a daunting prospect, given that they share a base in Central Brooklyn’s black community. The presidential race gave Jeffries a chance to burnish his star. He became an early supporter of Clinton’s candidacy, and an early basher of Sanders’. Throughout the campaign, he regularly unloaded on both the Vermont socialist and the billionaire GOP nominee, perhaps seeing a more prominent role for himself in an incoming Democratic administration. That didn’t happen. But when Minority Leader Pelosi faced a challenge for her perch in November, Jeffries publicly aligned with her, as she had indicated she was “open-minded” about letting newer members have a role in leadership. The congressman secured such a role for himself last month, becoming one of three members elected by his colleagues to lead the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee—which will craft the minority party’s platform. State GOP Chairman Edward Cox. Facebook 9. Edward Cox Rumor has it the state GOP chairman personally favored Ohio Gov. John Kasich for the nomination last year. He stayed neutral during the primary, even as many local Republican leaders flocked to the state’s native son. Apparently Trump hasn’t held it against him. Cox, who famously married Richard Nixon’s daughter, got front-row seats at the party convention and attention not usually given to a Republican leader from an overwhelmingly blue state. For once, it wasn’t such a lonely and thankless job. Cox’s apparatus raised cash for the Trump Victory Fund, and lent its precious tax-free postal indicia to mailings in swing states. The New York chairman is also tight with Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman and Trump’s chief of staff-to-be, and his son may soon receive an ambassadorship. On top of that, one of his chief rivals for the president-elect’s affections (and a general irritant), Buffalo developer Carl Paladino, has finally sunk so deep into his own vile racist juices that even Trump wants nothing to do with him. What clinched it was when the failed 2010 gubernatorial candidate, who co-chaired Trump’s New York campaign, told a local newspaper that his biggest hopes for 2017 were that Obama would die of a bovine ailment after having intercourse with a cow and that the first lady would take up residence with a gorilla in Zimbabwe. And yes, that’s actually what he said. Back on the topic of Cox, the New York Post has it that he snagged 200 D.C. hotel rooms for the inauguration on the cheap from Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Now all that’s left for the chairman to do is actually win a statewide election. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Alex Wong/Getty Images 10.

That's because credit card issuers have begun to respond to the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate hike last month by boosting rates on credit card offers. I began tracking variable rate offers in November on 14 cards from popular credit card issuers in anticipation of the rate increases. All of those cards now have higher rates -- both on the low and high end of the ranges you see when applying for a card. RATE SEARCH: Look now for a low-interest credit card offer. The issuer determines your interest rate within the range based on your creditworthiness at the time of application. Increased rates on both ends of the credit spectrum means excellent credit won't provide you an escape from higher APRs. Every issuer I surveyed that has increased annual percentage rates since the Fed meeting has done so by the same 0.25 percent the central bank increased its benchmark interest rate. Credit card interest rates on the rise Credit card APR range as of Nov. 28, 2016 APR range as of Jan. 3, 2017 American Express Blue Cash Everyday 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% BankAmericard Cash Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Capital One Venture Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Capital One Quicksilver Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Chase Freedom 14.24% to 23.24% 14.49% to 23.49% Chase Slate 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Chase Sapphire Reserve 16.24% to 23.24% 16.49% to 23.49% Citi Simplicity 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Double Cash 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Thank You Preferred 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Diamond Preferred 12.24% to 22.24% 12.49% to 22.49% Citi Prestige 15.49% 15.74% Discover it Card 11.24% to 23.24% 11.49% to 23.49% Wells Fargo Visa Signature 12.4% to 26.24% 12.65% to 26.49% Source: Issuer websites The only issuer among the ones I tracked not showing a rate change on its website: JPMorgan Chase. A spokeswoman for the bank's credit card division said its rates increased on Dec. 20, but had not yet been updated on marketing materials. Still, the impact of these rate increases across all cards hasn't yet been felt. Bankrate surveys 131 credit cards across 50 different issuers each week. As of the last week of 2016, the average variable interest rate was 16.27%, a slight increase over the previous week, although it's not even the high-water mark for the month. Impact on existing balances If you don't plan to apply for a new card in the new year, you're still not immune to a rate hike. While the Credit CARD Act of 2009 bans most retroactive rate increases, it does allow issuers to adjust APRs on variable rate cards tied to an index. Most cards are tied to the prime rate, which increases or decreases based on the Fed's own rate adjustments. CARD SEARCH: Delay your own personal interest rate hike by grabbing a good balance transfer card. Your credit card agreement will spell out how soon after the prime rate changes that you can expect a rate hike on your card. The most recent credit card agreements the issuers of the 14 credit cards I tracked filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau show generally you should feel the hike soon -- if you haven't already. The agreement for the Chase Freedom card, for example, says it will use the prime rate as published two business days before the end of each billing cycle. "If the U.S. Prime Rate changes, we’ll apply the new variable APR starting from the first day of the Billing Period when we take the U.S. Prime Rate from the (Wall Street Journal)," according to the agreement. My most recent American Express statement -- dated Dec. 22, little more than a week after the Fed increased rates -- already showed a change in my APR. The issuer bumped my interest rate from 17.49% APR to 17.74% APR. This isn't a big deal for me because I pay in full every month. But for others, this hike may pinch. Late payments could increase Prior to the rate hike, the credit bureau TransUnion calculated that a 0.25 percentage point rate hike would increase the average monthly payment on adjustable rate accounts by $6.45. Most consumers will be able to handle that additional cost, but 9.3 million Americans are expected to feel "payment shock" that could lead to late payments and defaults, TransUnion found.

If you CAN'T pay them off every month, then you couldn't afford whatever you bought in the first place... adam January 04, 2017 at 7:24 pm discover gives you worst apr regardless of creditworthiness.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Despite Strong Bullish Stock Action, Some Analysts Remain Bearish January 5, 2017 6:29am INDEXDJX:.DJI NYSE:DIA ShareTweet From Brad Hoppmann: The bull has been running wild on Wall Street since Election Day. The Dow is within about 50 points of the vaunted 20,000 mark. And the mood beyond the markets appears to be a good one. In fact, consumer confidence is as high as it’s been in some 15 years. Yet despite the positive backdrop, Wall Street isn’t buying in. That’s the conclusion of a recent article at CNBC.com. It shows that even after post-election animal spirits boosted the S&P 500 to a near-double-digit annual return in 2016, Wall Street’s biggest firms are the most-bearish they’ve been on equities for 2017 since 2005. So, it seems like the favorite animal spirit on Wall Street for 2017 is the bear. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the average S&P 500 forecast among 16 top investment firms calls for a 4.05% gain in 2017. That’s the smallest yearly increase predicted since the beginning of 2005. So, why the relatively negative outlook on stocks here, especially given the current buying mood on the Street? Source: CNBC.com / Bespoke Investment Group The CNBC piece cites comments by JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Dubravko Lakos-Bujas. He is about in the middle of the pack of analysts here, calling for the S&P 500 to finish 2017 at 2,400. Per the CNBC piece: “The prospects of pro-growth policy reforms under the Trump administration (i.e., deregulation, tax reform, fiscal spending) should continue to push the market higher. … However, rising yields and (the U.S. dollar) are the main risks to our positive equity outlook.” And there you have it — the push vs. pull of the potential for pro-growth policies from the Trump/Republican government vs. higher interest rates and a higher greenback. *** To that conflict, I would add the possibility of rising inflation. Especially if the aforementioned consumer confidence levels cause people to borrow and spend more money. Then we have the prospect of the Fed hiking rates at least a couple of times in 2017. And possibly more if the economy gets hot … and/or if there is a fiscal stimulus package that revs up GDP and inflation. On the flipside, we have the bullish outlook as articulated by RBC analyst Jonathan Golub. He is calling for a 10.1% move in the S&P 500 in 2017. Per the CNBC article: “Following two years of near-zero growth, we expect profits to re-accelerate … 2018 EPS growth (+9.4%) assumes a 2–3% impact from Trump policies. This placeholder for changes in taxes, regulation, and spending is quite modest, in our view, as an adjustment to corporate taxes alone could easily double this impact.” As you can see, there are a lot of “what ifs” wafting about as we settle into the first week of 2017, as well as a lot of conflicting opinions. Fortunately, I don’t think it will take too long to begin finding out how bullish (or how bearish) the smart money is going to view the Trump/Republican administration. With Inauguration Day a little more than two weeks away, I think we’ll start to see this market solidify a bit more by month’s end … so stay sharp, and stay tuned in!

Markus managed to build up his small pastry business through micro-credit loans. By BenPimentel This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. What is a microloan, and is one right for your small business? If you’re a small-business owner on a quest for capital, there are several smart reasons to turn to nonprofit microlenders. These lenders go beyond making small loans to entrepreneurs and provide some benefits that traditional lenders don’t: Profit is not their objective. Many microlenders are called mission-focused or mission-based lenders. They offer loans from government or nonprofit programs geared to helping disadvantaged communities, including areas that are struggling economically. Some microlenders also operate internationally, helping entrepreneurs in developing nations. Microlenders typically offer loans of $50,000 or less to startups and other small-scale operations. Some make bigger loans to more established businesses. Many microlenders and nonprofits provide pro bono consulting and training, including helping small businesses build credit. Good options for nonprofit financing Below, we list 13 sources for nonprofit financing. They include the top lenders based on information from two major small-business institutions, the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Aspen Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based policy and educational research nonprofit. When considering these lenders, keep in mind that microloans have limitations. Because many nonprofits rely on grants, donations or government guarantees or allocations, the number of loans they offer and the amount you can borrow are limited. Funding constraints can also mean strict borrower requirements. And many nonprofits operate only in specific states or regions. Nonprofit microlenders are also grappling with a major trend in small-business financing: the rapid rise of online lending. It offers quicker but usually more expensive access to cash, says Steven Cohen, president of Excelsior Growth Fund, a New York-based community development lender. “You see a lot of businesses trading off speed and efficiency for cost,” he says. “But you also see an incredibly crowded marketplace where there isn’t a whole lot of transparency. Nonprofits have the challenge of getting the word out there that, ‘We’re here.…We’re more affordable.’ ” Top U.S. microlenders The Aspen Institute’s FIELD program runs the U.S. Microenterprise Census, which collects data from microlenders across the country. Here are the top five microlenders by total loan amount disbursed, according to the program’s 2014 survey, the most recent data available. Grameen America Grameen America is affiliated with the Grameen Foundation, an international organization known for programs that help poor communities address their own needs. Grameen America has disbursed more than $490 million in loans to tens of thousands of women in the U.S. The organization has a nontraditional lending system: Borrowers must form a group with four other women they trust. That group then participates in a week of financial training, at the end of which each member opens a savings account and receives a $1,500 microloan to build a small business. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $100.7 million LiftFund San Antonio-based LiftFund offers microloans in the southern U.S., including Texas, Georgia and Florida. Borrowers typically use the financing to buy equipment and supplies.

Excelsior Growth Fund Excelsior Growth Fund offers online loans of up to $100,000 for approved borrowers in less than five days and funding of up to $500,000 through its ImpactLoan program. The lender deals with borrowers who typically wouldn’t qualify for traditional financing because their company is a startup or has poor credit. Through affiliates, it also provides SBA 7(a) and Community Advantage loans. Business Center for New Americans Business Center for New Americans provides financing of between $500 and $50,000 to small businesses in New York City.

Markus managed to build up his small pastry business through micro-credit loans. By BenPimentel This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. What is a microloan, and is one right for your small business? If you’re a small-business owner on a quest for capital, there are several smart reasons to turn to nonprofit microlenders. These lenders go beyond making small loans to entrepreneurs and provide some benefits that traditional lenders don’t: Profit is not their objective. Many microlenders are called mission-focused or mission-based lenders. They offer loans from government or nonprofit programs geared to helping disadvantaged communities, including areas that are struggling economically. Some microlenders also operate internationally, helping entrepreneurs in developing nations. Microlenders typically offer loans of $50,000 or less to startups and other small-scale operations. Some make bigger loans to more established businesses. Many microlenders and nonprofits provide pro bono consulting and training, including helping small businesses build credit. Good options for nonprofit financing Below, we list 13 sources for nonprofit financing. They include the top lenders based on information from two major small-business institutions, the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Aspen Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based policy and educational research nonprofit. When considering these lenders, keep in mind that microloans have limitations. Because many nonprofits rely on grants, donations or government guarantees or allocations, the number of loans they offer and the amount you can borrow are limited. Funding constraints can also mean strict borrower requirements. And many nonprofits operate only in specific states or regions. Nonprofit microlenders are also grappling with a major trend in small-business financing: the rapid rise of online lending. It offers quicker but usually more expensive access to cash, says Steven Cohen, president of Excelsior Growth Fund, a New York-based community development lender. “You see a lot of businesses trading off speed and efficiency for cost,” he says. “But you also see an incredibly crowded marketplace where there isn’t a whole lot of transparency. Nonprofits have the challenge of getting the word out there that, ‘We’re here.…We’re more affordable.’ ” Top U.S. microlenders The Aspen Institute’s FIELD program runs the U.S. Microenterprise Census, which collects data from microlenders across the country. Here are the top five microlenders by total loan amount disbursed, according to the program’s 2014 survey, the most recent data available. Grameen America Grameen America is affiliated with the Grameen Foundation, an international organization known for programs that help poor communities address their own needs. Grameen America has disbursed more than $490 million in loans to tens of thousands of women in the U.S. The organization has a nontraditional lending system: Borrowers must form a group with four other women they trust. That group then participates in a week of financial training, at the end of which each member opens a savings account and receives a $1,500 microloan to build a small business. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $100.7 million LiftFund San Antonio-based LiftFund offers microloans in the southern U.S., including Texas, Georgia and Florida. Borrowers typically use the financing to buy equipment and supplies. The microloans are also meant to help small-business owners improve their credit and more likely to qualify for a bank loan in the future, the lender says on its website. LiftFund got a boost in October 2016 when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced almost $5 million in funding for its new small-business loan program in New Orleans, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin, Texas. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $18.7 million Opportunity Fund California-based Opportunity Fund has been serving residents of the state since 1994, with more than $160 million in microloans.

Opportunity Fund also provides financial literacy education to business owners. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $17.7 million Accion New Mexico Accion New Mexico offers small-business loans from $1,000 to $1 million in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Texas.

The international Accion nonprofit offers financing services and assistance, including microloans, in 32 countries. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $8.9 million Justine Petersen Justine Petersen, which is based in St. Louis, offers small-business loans, typically of less than $10,000. The nonprofit also finances businesses in rural areas through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Intermediary Relending Program and originates loans of up to $150,000 as part of the SBA’s Community Advantage Program. Microloans disbursed in 2014: $8.4 million Top SBA nonprofit lenders Aside from its signature 7(a) term loans, the SBA issues low-cost small-business financing through a network of nonprofits. The SBA Microloan Program offers loans of up to $50,000 administered through community-based nonprofit groups. The SBA Community Advantage Program offers loans of up to $250,000 in communities that historically have had limited access to capital.

SBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $7.6 million Main Street Launch Main Street Launch, previously known as OBDC Small Business Finance, serves clients in the San Francisco Bay Area.

SBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $7.4 million LiftFund LiftFund, listed above among top U.S. microlenders, also offers SBA Community Advantage loans of $50,000 to $250,000 to businesses in low- to moderate-income communities in 13 states.

SBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $6.6 million Other notable nonprofits Kiva U.S. Kiva U.S. is a part of Kiva, a nonprofit working in more than 80 countries. To receive an interest-free microloan through Kiva U.S., borrowers first must have friends and family members lend to the venture. This helps establish the borrower’s creditworthiness. Once that happens, Kiva opens the loan to its lenders for funding. Pacific Community Ventures Pacific Community Ventures is a San Francisco-based community development lender that offers loans of between $10,000 and $200,000 to small businesses in California. You need to have been in business at least a year and have at least two employees. However, if you have a solid business record and a firm grasp of your business finances, PCV may offer you a loan even if you fall short on some requirements. Excelsior Growth Fund Excelsior Growth Fund offers online loans of up to $100,000 for approved borrowers in less than five days and funding of up to $500,000 through its ImpactLoan program. The lender deals with borrowers who typically wouldn’t qualify for traditional financing because their company is a startup or has poor credit. Through affiliates, it also provides SBA 7(a) and Community Advantage loans. Business Center for New Americans Business Center for New Americans provides financing of between $500 and $50,000 to small businesses in New York City. Borrowers must be in the retail, light manufacturing, restaurant or service industry, and existing businesses must have at least three to six months of “verifiable revenue,” according to the organization.

He brokers the sale of private jets, and already he's seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5 percent more than anticipated. "My phone is ringing off the hook" from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation in the Washington suburb of Manassas, Va. "Just the business climate feels like it's getting better." The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. VIDEOS TOP JOBS But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business. Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who'll be an advocate for the industry but he also replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong an almost-decade-long sales slump. "You'll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet," said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business. Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12 percent since November 2015, the bank said. It's far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump's victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron gained 19 percent, General Dynamics rose 12 percent and Bombardier jumped 22 percent. Aircraft sales amount to about 30 percent of their revenue. "The Trump win looks positive for bizjet demand given the post-election stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama's anti-bizjet rhetoric," Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month. Alain Bellemare, chief executive of Canadian planemaker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees "somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates." "Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure — it's all good for our business," he said. "So I hear the tone now and I'm optimistic." Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump's theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron's Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kan. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Ga. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer SA manufactures planes in Melbourne, Fla. Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multi-city visits they otherwise couldn't with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane. That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup, which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation. » Next page...

"Towards the second half of this year, U.S. shale starts to kick in," said Scott Darling, the investment bank's Asia-Pacific oil and gas research head. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures were moving around $53 a barrel and Brent crude futures at around $56 a barrel on Thursday morning in Asia, up from sub-$50-a-barrel levels before the OPEC production cuts were announced. Late last year, OPEC and major non-OPEC countries announced join production cuts of around 1.8 million barrels a day starting this year. David McNew / Stringer | Getty Images News Pump jacks and wells on the Monterey Shale formation in California Darling said sustained crude prices of $50 a barrel in the second half of 2017 will aid U.S. shale growth of 200,000 barrels a day while the jump will be at 600,000 barrels a day if crude prices move up to $60 a barrel. Any further rise may even see shale production growth breaching 1 million barrels a day, he added. Rival Goldman Sachs noted Thursday U.S. shale activity has already picked up strongly, with the horizontal oil rig count at a 13-month high, and it expect U.S. shale producers to continue to ramp up activity at current price levels. JPMorgan's forecast for Brent crude averages $58 a barrel in 2017 with prices sliding to $55 in the fourth quarter as shale production starts to impact the market.

Other deals continue in the competitive card landscape. Chase had put an extraordinary incentive on a new credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve. (Photo: JPMorgan Chase) Ever imagine that anyone would rush out to sign up for a credit card with a $450 annual fee? Well, some big spenders could be writing that one on their to-do lists in the next week. Chase had put an extraordinary incentive on a new credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, which was rolled out in August. You get 100,000 in bonus rewards if you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months after opening the account. Chase said the rewards would add up to as much as $1,500 toward travel when you redeem through Chase Ultimate Rewards. But Chase noted on its website Tuesday that the 100,000 bonus points will come to an end soon, falling to 50,000 points instead. Read more: DETROIT FREE PRESS The hottest new plastic is metal Did the Chase Sapphire Reserve stand out from a crowded card landscape? You betcha. The buzz was big and the card went viral before Chase did any other marketing. At one point, Chase ran out of the card’s metal stock and sent out temporary plastic cards until the handcrafted, embossed metal cards were available. In December, JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon told investors that the card has been doing great and now Chase would have to account for the cost. Dimon said then that the Sapphire Reserve card would reduce the bank’s profit by $200 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter. Is Chase reducing the bonus because it was too successful? Are we likely to see far smaller bonuses in the future? Not necessarily, according to some credit card experts. "The reduction in the Chase Sapphire Reserve introductory bonus was inevitable. The 100,000 point sign-up bonus was only a temporary offer," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. Chase said online that consumers need to apply by Jan. 11 online to get the 100,000 bonus.See www.chase.com/creditcards. After that, you can sign up at a bank branch to get the bonus through March 11. And after that, the offer will decrease to 50,000 bonus points, worth up to $750 for travel if you sign up through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal. The points do not expire as long as your account is open. If you're shopping for a credit card, always consider how you'd use the points, how much you typically spend and what kind of points you'd build over time. One resource: The Points Guy — at www.thepointsguy.com — lists some of the bonus rewards being offered, as well as tips on how best to use some travel-related cards. The Points Guy site is owned by Bankrate.com. Remember, if you don't pay the balance off each month, pay attention to the interest being charged on a credit card. The Chase Sapphire Reserve card states online that its rate will range from 16.24% to 23.24%, based on your credit worthiness. And remember, these rates would go up should the prime rate climb as expected. Are these Sapphire Reserve cards worthwhile?  Well, if you're trying to put a lid on spending right after the holidays, this card might be too great a temptation to spend even more early in 2017. And read the fine print. You would not earn that 100,000 in rewards points with a balance transfer or cash advance. And you'd pay another $75 a year in fees for each additional card for other users. Then again, this deal could work for some consumers who know for certain they'll spend $4,000 in the first three months. "The bonus more than outweighs the annual fee," said Bill Hardekopf, CEO of LowCards.com. "If you wanted to, you could then cancel the card before you are hit with the second year annual fee of $450." McBride noted that the card may still be worth keeping for many consumers. The $450 fee is partially offset by a $300 annual travel credit applied to your account for travel purchases on your card. The Chase Sapphire Reserve card pays three times the points on travel and dining purchases, compared with double the points on those categories on the Chase Sapphire Preferred, a card with a $95 annual fee. On other purchases, you'd earn one point per dollar on both Reserve and Preferred. Chase notes that travel is defined relatively broadly for the triple-points rewards, including using the credit card to pay for tolls and taxis. Hardekopf said consumers often like to use bonus points and rewards on airline tickets or hotel rooms. But sometimes consumers are disappointed by a limited number of rooms or flights available under some rewards programs. Or they're only able to use those rewards for a certain hotel or airline. "What happens if the hotel down the street has a much better rate when you want to take your trip? Your rewards are not very rewarding at that time," he said. For that reason, some consumers prefer cash-back programs. And there are plenty of those too. Hardekopf points to the Citi Double Cash card, which pays 1% when you make the transaction and 1% when you pay Citi for the purchase. These rewards apply for all purchases, so you don't have to keep track of any specific categories. Another popular card: The Capital One Quicksilver card gives 1.5% back on all transactions, plus consumers receive a $100 bonus when they spend at least $500 during the first three months of being a cardholder. It's likely to be another good year to shop for rewards cards — even after the end of the 100,000-point deal at Chase. "The rewards program arms race will continue in 2017, with new cards and stepped-up introductory offers appearing throughout the year just as we've seen the past few years," McBride said.

Trump announced his nomination of Jay Clayton, a partner in the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, as chairman of the independent agency that oversees Wall Street and the financial markets. If confirmed by the Senate, his responsibilities will include enforcing the scores of rules already written by the agency under the 2010 law that reshaped financial regulation after the 2008-09 crisis. The law, known as Dodd-Frank, has long been scorned by Republicans and is high on Trump’s target list. Clayton has worked on many of the securities deals that the SEC regulates and has represented Wall Street powerhouses including Goldman Sachs and Barclays. He is the latest Trump choice with Wall Street connections. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman executive. Trump also has tapped Gary Cohn, until recently Goldman’s president, to be his top economic adviser, and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department. Clayton would succeed Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor who also had worked as a corporate attorney before being named SEC chair by President Obama. Clayton played a legal role in a raft of major deals. Some of the biggest came in the panicky days of 2008: He represented Goldman in billionaire Warren Buffett’s $5 billion investment in the Wall Street bank, and the teetering Bear Stearns in its rescue sale to JPMorgan Chase. He worked on a multitude of deals bringing companies public, notably the 2014 U.S. stock market debut of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba — the biggest IPO ever. In announcing the appointment, Trump’s transition team said Clayton will encourage investment, “while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries.” “Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority,” the statement said. But some key Democrats were unimpressed with the choice of Clayton. “It’s hard to see how an attorney who’s spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder,’ ” said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. The committee, with a Republican majority, will conduct Clayton’s confirmation hearing. “I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from the financial institutions the SEC oversees, and work to prevent another financial crisis,” Brown said in a statement. Trump will be able to put an even broader stamp on the SEC. In addition to Clayton, he’ll have a chance to name two of the other four commissioners. The five-member body has been down two since December 2015. Two candidates nominated by Obama to fill vacancies, one Democrat and one Republican, have been stalled in Congress over whether they support requiring publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. Rather than offer quick remedies, the complex Dodd-Frank legislation laid down prescriptions for regulators to flesh out. The SEC was responsible for writing a large chunk of the nearly 400 required rules. Overall, federal regulators have completed about 70 percent of the rules more than six years after Dodd-Frank became law. With Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, a major overhaul of the law is expected, if not an outright dismantling. Republicans also have been pushing the SEC to ease the rules for smaller companies to raise capital in the markets — an area related to Clayton’s experience. “We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a statement.

That's because credit card issuers have begun to respond to the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate hike last month by boosting rates on credit card offers. I began tracking variable rate offers in November on 14 cards from popular credit card issuers in anticipation of the rate increases. All of those cards now have higher rates -- both on the low and high end of the ranges you see when applying for a card. RATE SEARCH: Look now for a low-interest credit card offer. The issuer determines your interest rate within the range based on your creditworthiness at the time of application. Increased rates on both ends of the credit spectrum means excellent credit won't provide you an escape from higher APRs. Every issuer I surveyed that has increased annual percentage rates since the Fed meeting has done so by the same 0.25 percent the central bank increased its benchmark interest rate. Credit card interest rates on the rise Credit card APR range as of Nov. 28, 2016 APR range as of Jan. 3, 2017 American Express Blue Cash Everyday 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% BankAmericard Cash Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Capital One Venture Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Capital One Quicksilver Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Chase Freedom 14.24% to 23.24% 14.49% to 23.49% Chase Slate 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Chase Sapphire Reserve 16.24% to 23.24% 16.49% to 23.49% Citi Simplicity 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Double Cash 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Thank You Preferred 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Diamond Preferred 12.24% to 22.24% 12.49% to 22.49% Citi Prestige 15.49% 15.74% Discover it Card 11.24% to 23.24% 11.49% to 23.49% Wells Fargo Visa Signature 12.4% to 26.24% 12.65% to 26.49% Source: Issuer websites The only issuer among the ones I tracked not showing a rate change on its website: JPMorgan Chase. A spokeswoman for the bank's credit card division said its rates increased on Dec. 20, but had not yet been updated on marketing materials. Still, the impact of these rate increases across all cards hasn't yet been felt. Bankrate surveys 131 credit cards across 50 different issuers each week. As of the last week of 2016, the average variable interest rate was 16.27%, a slight increase over the previous week, although it's not even the high-water mark for the month. Impact on existing balances If you don't plan to apply for a new card in the new year, you're still not immune to a rate hike. While the Credit CARD Act of 2009 bans most retroactive rate increases, it does allow issuers to adjust APRs on variable rate cards tied to an index. Most cards are tied to the prime rate, which increases or decreases based on the Fed's own rate adjustments. CARD SEARCH: Delay your own personal interest rate hike by grabbing a good balance transfer card. Your credit card agreement will spell out how soon after the prime rate changes that you can expect a rate hike on your card. The most recent credit card agreements the issuers of the 14 credit cards I tracked filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau show generally you should feel the hike soon -- if you haven't already. The agreement for the Chase Freedom card, for example, says it will use the prime rate as published two business days before the end of each billing cycle. "If the U.S. Prime Rate changes, we’ll apply the new variable APR starting from the first day of the Billing Period when we take the U.S. Prime Rate from the (Wall Street Journal)," according to the agreement. My most recent American Express statement -- dated Dec. 22, little more than a week after the Fed increased rates -- already showed a change in my APR. The issuer bumped my interest rate from 17.49% APR to 17.74% APR. This isn't a big deal for me because I pay in full every month. But for others, this hike may pinch. Late payments could increase Prior to the rate hike, the credit bureau TransUnion calculated that a 0.25 percentage point rate hike would increase the average monthly payment on adjustable rate accounts by $6.45. Most consumers will be able to handle that additional cost, but 9.3 million Americans are expected to feel "payment shock" that could lead to late payments and defaults, TransUnion found.

President-elect Donald Trump wants Wall Street lawyer Clayton to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump says in a statement that Clayton is “a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law.” Trump says his nominee will work to ensure that financial institutions “can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time.” (Dick Duane via AP) (Associated Press) By Marcy Gordon | AP January 4 WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday chose a Wall Street attorney with experience in corporate mergers and public stock launches as his nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump announced his nomination of Jay Clayton, a partner in the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, as chairman of the independent agency that oversees Wall Street and the financial markets. If confirmed by the Senate, his responsibilities will include enforcing the scores of rules already written by the agency under the 2010 law that reshaped financial regulation after the 2008-09 crisis. The law, known as Dodd-Frank, has long been scorned by Republicans and is high on Trump’s target list. Clayton has worked on many of the securities deals that the SEC regulates and has represented Wall Street powerhouses including Goldman Sachs and Barclays. He is the latest Trump choice with Wall Street connections. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman executive. Trump also has tapped Gary Cohn, until recently Goldman’s president, to be his top economic adviser, and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department. Clayton would succeed Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor who also had worked as a corporate attorney before being named SEC chair by President Barack Obama. Clayton played a legal role in a raft of major deals. Some of the biggest came in the panicky days of 2008: He represented Goldman in billionaire Warren Buffett’s $5 billion investment in the Wall Street bank, and the teetering Bear Stearns in its rescue sale to JPMorgan Chase. He worked on a multitude of deals bringing companies public, notably the 2014 U.S. stock market debut of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba — the biggest IPO ever. In announcing the appointment, Trump’s transition team said Clayton will encourage investment, “while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries.” “Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority,” the statement said. But some key Democrats were unimpressed with the choice of Clayton. “It’s hard to see how an attorney who’s spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder,’” said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. The committee, with a Republican majority, will conduct Clayton’s confirmation hearing. “I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from the financial institutions the SEC oversees, and work to prevent another financial crisis,” Brown said in a statement. Trump will be able to put an even broader stamp on the SEC. In addition to Clayton, he’ll have a chance to name two of the other four commissioners. The five-member body has been down two since December 2015. Two candidates nominated by Obama to fill vacancies, one Democrat and one Republican, have been stalled in Congress over whether they support requiring publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. Rather than offer quick remedies, the complex Dodd-Frank legislation laid down prescriptions for regulators to flesh out. The SEC was responsible for writing a large chunk of the nearly 400 required rules. Overall, federal regulators have completed about 70 percent of the rules more than six years after Dodd-Frank became law. With Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, a major overhaul of the law is expected, if not an outright dismantling. Republicans also have been pushing the SEC to ease the rules for smaller companies to raise capital in the markets — an area related to Clayton’s experience. “We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a statement. __ This story has been corrected to show that Gary Cohn was until recently president of Goldman Sachs, not currently.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Wall Street’s Favorite 2017 Animal is … the Bear? Posted on January 4, 2017 by Brad Hoppmann The bull has been running wild on Wall Street since Election Day. The Dow is within about 50 points of the vaunted 20,000 mark. And the mood beyond the markets appears to be a good one. In fact, consumer confidence is as high as it’s been in some 15 years. Yet despite the positive backdrop, Wall Street isn’t buying in. That’s the conclusion of a recent article at CNBC.com. It shows that even after post-election animal spirits boosted the S&P 500 to a near-double-digit annual return in 2016, Wall Street’s biggest firms are the most-bearish they’ve been on equities for 2017 since 2005. So, it seems like the favorite animal spirit on Wall Street for 2017 is the bear. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the average S&P 500 forecast among 16 top investment firms calls for a 4.05% gain in 2017. That’s the smallest yearly increase predicted since the beginning of 2005. So, why the relatively negative outlook on stocks here, especially given the current buying mood on the Street? Source: CNBC.com / Bespoke Investment Group The CNBC piece cites comments by JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Dubravko Lakos-Bujas. He is about in the middle of the pack of analysts here, calling for the S&P 500 to finish 2017 at 2,400. Per the CNBC piece: "The prospects of pro-growth policy reforms under the Trump administration (i.e., deregulation, tax reform, fiscal spending) should continue to push the market higher. … However, rising yields and (the U.S. dollar) are the main risks to our positive equity outlook." And there you have it — the push vs. pull of the potential for pro-growth policies from the Trump/Republican government vs. higher interest rates and a higher greenback. *** To that conflict, I would add the possibility of rising inflation. Especially if the aforementioned consumer confidence levels cause people to borrow and spend more money. Then we have the prospect of the Fed hiking rates at least a couple of times in 2017. And possibly more if the economy gets hot … and/or if there is a fiscal stimulus package that revs up GDP and inflation. On the flipside, we have the bullish outlook as articulated by RBC analyst Jonathan Golub. He is calling for a 10.1% move in the S&P 500 in 2017. Per the CNBC article: "Following two years of near-zero growth, we expect profits to re-accelerate … 2018 EPS growth (+9.4%) assumes a 2–3% impact from Trump policies. This placeholder for changes in taxes, regulation, and spending is quite modest, in our view, as an adjustment to corporate taxes alone could easily double this impact." As you can see, there are a lot of "what ifs" wafting about as we settle into the first week of 2017, as well as a lot of conflicting opinions. Fortunately, I don’t think it will take too long to begin finding out how bullish (or how bearish) the smart money is going to view the Trump/Republican administration. With Inauguration Day a little more than two weeks away, I think we’ll start to see this market solidify a bit more by month’s end … so stay sharp, and stay tuned in! *** What do you think the market will do in 2017? Do you think Wall Street is too bearish, not bearish enough, or just about right? I am curious to find out what you think, so please share your thoughts with me by leaving me a comment on our website or sending me an e-mail. *** The markets drifted higher today even as traders dissected the December Fed minutes, particularly the "considerable uncertainty" that the new administration presents. One group that analyzed the text of the minutes, named Prattle, scored the Fed’s language with an algorithm. They determined that the minutes were the most hawkish in two years. The Dow remained within striking distance of 20K in Wednesday’s session, ending the day at 19,942 (+0.3%). • A big post-holiday gain for Weight Watchers (WTW): Shares ballooned 21% after company spokesperson and shareholder Oprah discussed her recent 40-pound weight loss on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" last night. Plus, U.S. News & World Report just put Weight Watchers at the top of its 2017 Best Diets list — which it has done for the previous six years as well. • Final clearance sales, indeed: Macy’s (M) said it is closing 100 stores and eliminating about 10,000 jobs over the next few years. It also said that same-store sales fell 2.1% in November and December. Shares had gained 1.7% in today’s trade but are down more than 10% after-hours. • Kohl’s (KSS) crushed: The retailer also saw a slip in same-store sales over the holidays, and reined in its full-year earnings guidance. The stock gained 4.2% in today’s session but is down close to 14% in after-market trade. Good luck and happy investing, Brad Hoppmann Publisher Uncommon Wisdom Daily Your thoughts on “Wall Street’s Favorite 2017 Animal is … the Bear?” tommr says: January 4, 2017 at 7:31 pm As you all know, the DOW is an index of just 30 large cap stock and it is PRICE weighted! In other words, the DOW does NOT represent the Stock Market as a whole. It is almost meaningless except that it moves generally the same way as the rest of the Market. DOW 20,000 is even more meaningless. Well it is completely meaningless, really! Focus on this number is about as meaningless as the focus that was placed on the “Turn of the Century”! Did that take place with the arrival of the calendar year 2,000 or was it 2001? Didn’t matter. It was meaningless! The number doesn’t mean anything! Reply Frank says: January 4, 2017 at 7:59 pm I’ve been a technical trader for the last 50 years and almost everything I look at has been saying down for the last 12-15 months. Plus people like Bill Bonner, Doug Casey, and others have been saying a big decline is coming and these guys have been pretty good for a long time. Prechter has been saying the Dow is going to way down but I don’t see it happening, not with all the enthusiasm and optimism around the country about Trump’s election. I don’t know. Maybe after 200 years all this technical stuff doesn’t work anymore. Reply Les says: January 4, 2017 at 9:25 pm I am 85 years old and have seen this show before…..The market and our currency are going to crash this year…..Equities are being held up by low interest rates which are going higher this year.Trade wars are on the horizon….Europe’s economy is in shambles…..Events in the middle east are getting worse…….We have a new president who is totally inexperienced…….The last 11 republican presidents have had a recession during their years in office……Healthcare costs are going to skyrocket…..taxes will have to go up to contain the national debt….China and N. Korea are problematic…..and the dollar is rising to levels that are making American corporations unable to compete in world trade….Does this sound like a bullish scenario? Reply Billy says: January 4, 2017 at 11:05 pm Hi Brad, Interesting comments from Frank above, but the bottom line is technical and cyclical analysis CANNOT be denied long term. Frank, Bill Bonner, Doug Casey, Robert Prechter are ALL right that a major correction is coming. ALL the signs have been there for AT LEAST 15 months. All that is needed now is a rogue wave or black swan event. (anyone say Italian and European Bank Sovereign Debt Crisis???) That is just one of MANY black swans worldwide. The bottom line is that this Trump rally WILL be temporary. One man can simply not change what Larry Edelson has pointed out with technical and cyclical analysis that major problems are there. As Larry says, with $400 TRILLION IN WORLDWIDE DEBT AND LESS THAN 100 PEOPLE/FAMILIES HAVING MORE WEALTH THAN THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE WORLDS POPULATION. You know the time is getting closer and closer. This next correction, by historical definition HAS TO BE MAJOR just to get back to a more stable and equal financial and capital market situation. We did not even get to the the ultra important DEMOGRAPHICS DISASTER that is spreading beyond Japan and hitting Germany very hard soon. If you don’t have enough marriages and families and children you will NOT be able to grow your economy and capital markets NO MATTER HOW MUCH QE and money printing is done. Go ask the Japanese if you have any doubts Reply mike bazylak says: January 5, 2017 at 2:52 pm I don’t believe that our big firms are factoring in the world and especially Euorpean situation. there is alot of out of country money that can change our situation quickly.

President-elect Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he will nominate Wall Street lawyer, Jay Clayton, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. What’s Clayton’s background? As a defense attorney, he’s worked to get big banks out of trouble when they break the rules. Among others, Clayton has worked for JPMorgan Chase, big Trump lender Deutsche Bank, and, of course, Goldman Sachs—because a Goldman connection seems to be a Trump cabinet prerequisite. Clayton also worked for Bear Stearns, the failed company whose massive stack of toxic loans helped trigger the fiscal crisis. Clayton’s bio shows just how often he worked to arrange a settlement for banks found violating mortgage regulations by DOJ, HUD, FHFA and states. His previous experience with the SEC involves representing oil companies involved in a decade long bribery scandal that ended in a $365 million fine. There’s little doubt that Trump appointed Clayton because he wants to deregulate investment banking. That gave him a big edge over the competition. Clayton beat out former federal prosecutor Debra Wong Yang for the SEC job. While Yang is a star corporate lawyer like Clayton, she earned a reputation for toughness as a prosecutor by taking down a violent drug-dealing gang and investigating financial fraud. Toughness? Investigating financial fraud? Definitely not on the Trump check list. Still, there is something in Clayton’s resume that Trump might not have noticed. Clayton is the co-author of an article calling on the US to create a bipartisan 9-11 style commission on cyber attacks. Clayton’s cyber initiative is titled “We Don’t Need a Crisis to Act Unitedly Against Cyber Threats” and it calls on all parties to come together against the threat that cyber attacks represent. The U.S. President and Congress should appoint a 9-11-type Cyber Threat Commission. This Commission should: Convene the best minds and intents from all sectors and political parties –divorced from self-interest and outside influences — with sufficient power and authority to move quickly and effectively. … Cybercrime remains a “virtually” perfect crime and act of war. It is low risk and high reward. It is agile, cheap and remotely scalable. It morphs and innovates in ways that leave enforcement officials responding to yesterday’s battles. Victims have little or no recourse. And while Donald Trump may be anxious to find fault in those whose email was pilfered, his SEC nominee had a different take. Cyber-attack victims unfairly shoulder the blame. In the “Alice-in-Wonderland” aftermath of cyber-attacks, the perpetrators are often beyond the law and the victimized enterprise stands trial. As “defendants,” they are convicted of knowing that they were attractive, inviting the assault and then failing to fend-off their attackers. Of course, now that he has the whole of Wall Street regulations to play with, Clayton will likely be too busy with his other concerns. x I'm sure Trump campaigned on appointing a Wall Street attorney who represented Goldman Sachs to oversee Wall Street at SEC, right? https://t.co/0Gki9nxqg5— Jesse Ferguson (@JesseFFerguson) January 4, 2017 24 Comments Share this article 51 51 51 24 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Photo/ Bloomberg Photo by Mark Elias. Ever since the US presidential election, Ed Dahlberg has pretty much had a smile on his face. He brokers the sale of private jets, and already he's seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5 per cent more than anticipated. "My phone is ringing off the hook" from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation in the Washington suburb of Manassas, Virginia. "Just the business climate feels like it's getting better." The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business. Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who'll be an advocate for the industry but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong an almost-decade-long sales slump. "You'll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet," said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business.

Related Content The battle for Obamacare National election promise to create recreational fishing-only zones running behind schedule Your views: Readers' letters Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12 per cent since November 2015, the bank said. More Economy The Economy Hub Business Videos Business Toolbox More Liam Dann It's far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump's victory. Since November 9, Textron gained 19 per cent, General Dynamics rose 12 per cent and Bombardier jumped 22 per cent. Aircraft sales amount to about 30 per cent of their revenue. "The Trump win looks positive for bizjet demand given the post-election stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama's anti-bizjet rhetoric," Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co, wrote in a report earlier this month. Alain Bellemare, chief executive officer of Canadian planemaker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees "somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates." "Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure - it's all good for our business," he said. "So I hear the tone now and I'm optimistic." Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump's theme of keeping factory workers in the US Both Bombardier and Textron's Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kansas. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Georgia. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer SA manufactures planes in Melbourne, Florida. Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multi-city visits they otherwise couldn't with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane. That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup, which was getting US government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a US$50 million ($71.9m) Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation. In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing "disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation." But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it. "I've noticed that while there's still a huge amount of inventory, people just don't keep dropping the price every week," he said. "You can really feel the floor in the market right now." - Bloomberg Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Mr. Trump announced his nomination of Jay Clayton, a partner in the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, as chairman of the independent agency that oversees Wall Street and the financial markets. If confirmed by the Senate, his responsibilities will include enforcing the scores of rules already written by the agency under the 2010 law that reshaped financial regulation after the 2008-09 crisis. The law, known as Dodd-Frank, has long been scorned by Republicans and is high on Trump’s target list. Clayton has worked on many of the securities deals that the SEC regulates and has represented Wall Street powerhouses including Goldman Sachs (GS) and Barclays (BCS). Play Video CBS This Morning Trump Cabinet picks contrast Wall Street attacks during campaign As a candidate, Donald Trump was quick to criticize Wall Street, but that's where the president-elect found two key figures for his economic team... He is the latest Trump choice with Wall Street connections. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman executive and more recently ran OneWest bank. Mr. Trump also has tapped Gary Cohn, until recently Goldman’s president, to be his top economic adviser and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department. Clayton would succeed Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor who also had worked as a corporate attorney before being named SEC chair by President Barack Obama. Clayton played a legal role in a raft of major deals. Some of the biggest came in the panicky days of 2008: He represented Goldman in billionaire Warren Buffett’s $5 billion investment in the Wall Street bank, and the teetering Bear Stearns in its rescue sale to JPMorgan Chase (JPM). He worked on a multitude of deals bringing companies public, notably the 2014 U.S. stock market debut of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) -- the biggest IPO ever. In announcing the appointment, Mr. Trump’s transition team said Clayton will encourage investment, “while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries.” “Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority,” the statement said. But some key Democrats were unimpressed with the choice of Clayton. “It’s hard to see how an attorney who’s spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder,’” said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. The committee, with a Republican majority, will conduct Clayton’s confirmation hearing. “I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from the financial institutions the SEC oversees, and work to prevent another financial crisis,” Brown said in a statement. Trump will be able to put an even broader stamp on the SEC. In addition to Clayton, he’ll have a chance to name two of the other four commissioners. The five-member body has been down two since December 2015. Two candidates Mr. Obama nominated to fill vacancies, one Democrat and one Republican, have been stalled in Congress over whether they support requiring publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. Rather than offer quick remedies, the complex Dodd-Frank legislation laid down prescriptions for regulators to flesh out. The SEC was responsible for writing a large chunk of the nearly 400 required rules. Overall, federal regulators have completed about 70 percent of the rules more than six years after Dodd-Frank became law. With Mr. Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, a major overhaul of the law is expected, if not an outright dismantling. Republicans also have been pushing the SEC to ease the rules for smaller companies to raise capital in the markets -- an area related to Clayton’s experience. “We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a statement. © 2017 The Associated Press.

Jay Clayton, the Wall Street lawyer picked on Wednesday by President-elect Donald Trump as his nominee to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has such a small public presence that major wire services don’t even have a photograph of him. His public pronouncement at being nominated suggests he wants to ease regulations. “If confirmed, we are going to work together with key stakeholders in the financial system to make sure we provide investors and our companies with the confidence to invest together in America. We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a prepared statement. His profile at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm known in particular for its representation of J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.53% and other Wall Street titans, suggests one area of focus could be reforming the agency’s prosecution of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A 2011 paper Clayton was involved in drafting for the New York City Bar Association complains about the federal government’s broad enforcement of that law. The paper — titled “The FCPA and its Impact on International Business Transactions: Should Anything Be Done to Minimize the Consequences of the U.S.’s Unique Position on Combating Offshore Corruption?” — states that foreign companies are leery of deals that would bring them under the act’s jurisdiction, such as listing on a U.S. exchange in an initial public offering or acquiring a U.S. company in a stock-for-stock exchange. Related story: Trump’s SEC may take aim at corporate disclosure That hasn’t deterred them completely, of course. In 2015, foreign companies represented about 16% of all U.S. public offerings, according to data from S&P Capital IQ, and a similar percentage in 2016 through November. Clayton himself helped represent Alibaba BABA, +0.39% in its New York Stock Exchange listing, which was the largest IPO of all time, not to mention the largest Chinese listing in the U.S. But the SEC has been active in FCPA prosecution. Last year, 27 companies paid $2.48 billion to resolve FCPA cases, the biggest enforcement year in history, according to the FCPA blog. It’s also the types of cases the SEC has brought that have raised some eyebrows. One high-profile case that wrapped up in November was a $264 million fine brought against J.P. Morgan over its “sons and daughters” program in China, wherein the bank gave prestigious jobs to relatives and friends of Chinese government officials to win business. A number of other Wall Street banks — including Deutsche Bank DB, +2.46%  , an institution President-elect Trump does much of his business with — are facing similar charges, according to regulatory filings. Such conduct hasn’t until recently been a target of FCPA prosecutions. Clayton didn’t represent J.P. Morgan in that matter. He did represent Italian oil group Eni in an FCPA case over allegations that it bribed Nigerian government officials with cash-filled suitcases.

Trump says his nominee will work to ensure that financial institutions "can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time." (Dick Duane via AP) WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday chose a Wall Street attorney with experience in corporate mergers and public stock launches as his nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump announced his nomination of Jay Clayton, a partner in the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, as chairman of the independent agency that oversees Wall Street and the financial markets. If confirmed by the Senate, his responsibilities will include enforcing the scores of rules already written by the agency under the 2010 law that reshaped financial regulation after the 2008-09 crisis. The law, known as Dodd-Frank, has long been scorned by Republicans and is high on Trump's target list. Clayton has worked on many of the securities deals that the SEC regulates and has represented Wall Street powerhouses including Goldman Sachs and Barclays. He is the latest Trump choice with Wall Street connections. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman executive. Trump also has tapped Gary Cohn, until recently Goldman's president, to be his top economic adviser, and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department. Clayton would succeed Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor who also had worked as a corporate attorney before being named SEC chair by President Barack Obama. Clayton played a legal role in a raft of major deals. Some of the biggest came in the panicky days of 2008: He represented Goldman in billionaire Warren Buffett's $5 billion investment in the Wall Street bank, and the teetering Bear Stearns in its rescue sale to JPMorgan Chase. He worked on a multitude of deals bringing companies public, notably the 2014 U.S. stock market debut of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba — the biggest IPO ever. In announcing the appointment, Trump's transition team said Clayton will encourage investment, "while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries." "Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority," the statement said. But some key Democrats were unimpressed with the choice of Clayton. "It's hard to see how an attorney who's spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump's promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from 'getting away with murder,'" said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. The committee, with a Republican majority, will conduct Clayton's confirmation hearing. "I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from the financial institutions the SEC oversees, and work to prevent another financial crisis," Brown said in a statement.

Trump will be able to put an even broader stamp on the SEC. In addition to Clayton, he'll have a chance to name two of the other four commissioners. The five-member body has been down two since December 2015. Two candidates nominated by Obama to fill vacancies, one Democrat and one Republican, have been stalled in Congress over whether they support requiring publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. Rather than offer quick remedies, the complex Dodd-Frank legislation laid down prescriptions for regulators to flesh out. The SEC was responsible for writing a large chunk of the nearly 400 required rules. Overall, federal regulators have completed about 70 percent of the rules more than six years after Dodd-Frank became law. With Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, a major overhaul of the law is expected, if not an outright dismantling. Republicans also have been pushing the SEC to ease the rules for smaller companies to raise capital in the markets — an area related to Clayton's experience. "We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs," Clayton said in a statement. __ This story has been corrected to show that Gary Cohn was until recently president of Goldman Sachs, not currently.

(Bill Denver For NY Daily News) BY Adam Edelman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Wednesday, January 4, 2017, 5:02 PM President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Bill Stepien — Chris Christie’s former campaign manager whom the New Jersey governor axed after becoming mired in the Bridgegate scandal — as his White House political director, his transition team said Wednesday. Stepien, who ran both of Christie’s gubernatorial campaigns and who the oversized guv fired after his name came up in emails related to the scandal over the George Washington Bridge lane closures, had been working with the Trump transition team in recent months and had previously worked on the presidential bids of George W. Bush and John McCain. While Stepien’s hire had been expected, it was nevertheless ironic, considering Christie — who had supported Trump quickly after he abandoned his own bid and who became a prominent surrogate for the mogul — will be awarded with no title or responsibilities in the incoming administration. Christie had fallen out of favor within Trump’s circle after he refused to offer a full-throated defense of the mogul following the emergence of a tape showing him making lewd comments about women.

Stepien, who court testimony showed was aware of the alleged plot to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for refusing to endorse Christie's reelection in 2013, was not charged in connection to the lane closures and has denied having any knowledge of them. His appointment Wednesday came amid a raft of other personnel announcements for Trump’s incoming administration, including Keith Schiller, a retired NYPD officer who had been running Trump's private security detail, as director of Oval Office operations. Trump’s transition team said the President-elect will nominate Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton as his Securities and Exchange Commission chairman.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) "Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time," Trump said in a statement. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers." Clayton will be the latest member of Trump's incoming cabinet and cabinet-level advisers whose career was on Wall Street, joining fellow investment honchos Steve Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs partner who is now the Treasury secretary designate; Stephen Bannon, a former Goldman banker who is Trump's chief White House strategist; Wilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary designate who enjoyed a decades-long career in private equity; and Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn, who will head Trump’s National Economic Council. Trump still has vacancies for the secretary of agriculture and secretary of veterans affairs posts.

Katz appeared in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, where he admitted to participating in a conspiracy with other bankers to manipulate emerging-market currency trades while working at three different financial institutions from 2007 to 2013. Separately, the Federal Reserve Board said it banned Katz from the banking industry. Katz’s conviction comes one day before five banks are scheduled to be sentenced in connection with the Justice Department’s three-year investigation. The banks -- Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc -- pleaded guilty in May 2015 to charges that their traders conspired to manipulate trading in U.S. dollars and euros. UBS Group AG also pleaded guilty to a related charge. Bloomberg previously reported that the currency-rigging investigation had ex panded to additional chatrooms involving trading in emerging market currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble and the South African rand. Katz was released on a $150,000 bond to be secured by property in New York’s Delaware County. His travel is limited to New York, Connecticut and London until April 1 when he is to turn over his passport and remain in the U.S. Trading History Katz spent a year as director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading at Barclays beginning in 2010, according to regulatory filings and his LinkedIn profile. He joined BNP Paribas in September 2011 as its director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading, before leaving for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. two years later, the documents show. Before joining Barclays, Katz spent more than nine years at Standard Bank, where he was head of foreign exchange, according to his LinkedIn profile. Prosecutors say Katz was a dealer of central and eastern European, Middle Eastern and African currencies and conspired to manipulate prices through "non-bona fide trades," coordinating the placement of bids and offers, and agreeing on currency prices quoted to specific customers. Katz has agreed to cooperate with the government’s investigation. The conspiracy charge Katz admitted to has a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine, which may be increased based on the proceeds gained or the loss to investors.

It isn’t clear whether Katz had any interaction with Ashton or other members of The Cartel. Those chatroom discussions formed the basis of guilty pleas by four of the banks, which are scheduled to be sentenced Thursday in Connecticut. Barclays, JPMorgan and Citigroup provided evidence of a potential new antitrust conspiracy in the currency spot market that prosecutors say involves different currencies than the ones at the center of their 2015 guilty pleas.

Coats for top intelligence post Home » Management » People » Trump names Wall Street… Trump names Wall Street lawyer Clayton as SEC chairman By MARCY GORDON January 4, 2017 7:42 pm 2 Shares WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday chose a Wall Street attorney with experience in corporate mergers and public stock launches as his nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump announced his nomination of Jay Clayton, a partner in the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, as chairman of the independent agency that oversees Wall Street and the financial markets. If confirmed by the Senate, his responsibilities will include enforcing the scores of rules already written by the agency under the 2010 law that reshaped financial regulation after the 2008-09 crisis. The law, known as Dodd-Frank, has long been scorned by Republicans and is high on Trump’s target list. Federal News Radio conducted an exclusive data center survey to assess how agencies are storing data. Download the results. Clayton has worked on many of the securities deals that the SEC regulates and has represented Wall Street powerhouses including Goldman Sachs and Barclays. Advertisement He is the latest Trump choice with Wall Street connections. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman executive. Trump also has tapped Gary Cohn, until recently Goldman’s president, to be his top economic adviser, and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department. Clayton would succeed Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor who also had worked as a corporate attorney before being named SEC chair by President Barack Obama. Clayton played a legal role in a raft of major deals. Some of the biggest came in the panicky days of 2008: He represented Goldman in billionaire Warren Buffett’s $5 billion investment in the Wall Street bank, and the teetering Bear Stearns in its rescue sale to JPMorgan Chase. He worked on a multitude of deals bringing companies public, notably the 2014 U.S. stock market debut of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba — the biggest IPO ever. In announcing the appointment, Trump’s transition team said Clayton will encourage investment, “while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries.” “Robust accountability will be a hallmark of his tenure atop the SEC, and the financial security of the American people will be his top priority,” the statement said. But some key Democrats were unimpressed with the choice of Clayton. “It’s hard to see how an attorney who’s spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder,'” said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the senior Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. The committee, with a Republican majority, will conduct Clayton’s confirmation hearing. “I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited, demand real accountability from the financial institutions the SEC oversees, and work to prevent another financial crisis,” Brown said in a statement. Trump will be able to put an even broader stamp on the SEC. In addition to Clayton, he’ll have a chance to name two of the other four commissioners. The five-member body has been down two since December 2015. Two candidates nominated by Obama to fill vacancies, one Democrat and one Republican, have been stalled in Congress over whether they support requiring publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. Rather than offer quick remedies, the complex Dodd-Frank legislation laid down prescriptions for regulators to flesh out. The SEC was responsible for writing a large chunk of the nearly 400 required rules. Overall, federal regulators have completed about 70 percent of the rules more than six years after Dodd-Frank became law. With Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, a major overhaul of the law is expected, if not an outright dismantling. Republicans also have been pushing the SEC to ease the rules for smaller companies to raise capital in the markets — an area related to Clayton’s experience. “We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a statement.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) "Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time," Trump said in a statement. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers." Clayton will be the latest member of Trump's incoming cabinet and cabinet-level advisers whose career was on Wall Street, joining fellow investment honchos Steve Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs partner who is now the Treasury secretary designate; Stephen Bannon, a former Goldman banker who is Trump's chief White House strategist; Wilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary designate who enjoyed a decades-long career in private equity; and Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn, who will head Trump’s National Economic Council. Trump still has vacancies for the secretary of agriculture and secretary of veterans affairs posts.

The average card rate climbed to 15.36 percent Wednesday after ending 2016 at a record high of 15.29 percent.   It is the third consecutive week the average APR climbed to an all-time high, and all have been for the same reason: Multiple issuers adjusted APRs in response to a rate hike from the Federal Reserve. In mid-December, the Fed hiked its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percent, prompting issuers to increase rates by the same amount. Among the 100 cards tracked by CreditCards.com, 73 followed suit with 0.25 percent rate increases. One issuer, Pentagon Federal Credit Union, cut rates this week. The PenFed Promise Visa now advertises a minimum APR of 8.99 percent, while the PenFed Platinum Cash Rewards card charges a minimum rate of 9.24 percent. Issuers trim perks Consumers who are in the market for a new card may want to apply now before card offers drop in value in the New Year. In addition to hiking rates on new card offers, some credit card issuers are advertising fewer perks on their latest offers. J.P. Morgan Chase confirmed Monday to our sister site, ThePointsGuy.com, that it plans to dramatically size down the famously generous sign-up bonus on the Chase Sapphire Reserve card this month. For now, the super-premium card offers new applicants 100,000 bonus points – worth roughly $1,500 – in exchange for signing up. Beginning Jan. 12, the card issuer plans to halve the offer. New applicants will get 50,000 bonus points, an amount that’s more in line with the bonuses offered by its competitors in the luxe card field. Analysts predicted earlier this fall that the ultra-generous card offers that many consumers were seeing on a wide variety of cards were likely to deflate. According to an October 2016 survey by CreditCards.com, at least six major credit cards offered bonuses worth at least $1,000 or more while many others offered bonuses totaling several hundred dollars. The super generous offers indicated that card issuers were locked in a card rewards arms race for much of 2016; but analysts warned that the bubble in rewards promotions was too expensive to last. According to analysts at Credit Suisse, issuers are also being selective about which cardholders receive advertisements for new rewards. In November, Credit Suisse found that many issuers cut the number of card offers advertising some kind of rewards program. Card issuers also mailed fewer offers advertising a 0 percent APR on purchases, and cut the number of interest-free balance transfer offers consumers received. The average balance transfer promotion did get slightly longer in November, though, indicating that card issuers are still using lengthy promotions to lure customers. The average balance transfer period rose to 14.9 months in November, up from 13.9 months in November 2015. Credit Suisse also reported in a November 2016 research note that it expects card issuers to continue to spend heavily on rewards programs and overall marketing in 2017 as issuers try to attract a wider group of customers.  If so, cardholders could still see juicy rewards and lengthy promotions over the next year. However, the card offers may not be nearly as enticing as they were in the last few months of 2016. CreditCards.com's Weekly Rate Report   Avg.

Trump nominated prominent Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton as the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency responsible for enforcing securities laws and proposing new rules. “Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time,” Trump said in a statement, adding, ”We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers.” “If confirmed, we are going to work together with key stakeholders in the financial system to make sure we provide investors and our companies with the confidence to invest together in America. We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a statement. Advising Wall Street A partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP — a prestigious law firm that represents many corporations and financial firms — Clayton has advised companies on numerous mergers-and-acquisitions, private equity transactions, and initial public offerings. While at Sullivan & Cromwell, Clayton advised a number of high-profile deals during the height of the financial crisis. He advised Barclays in connection with its purchase of Lehman Brothers assets, Bear Sterns on its sale to JPMorgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs on its $5 billion investment it received from Warren Buffett, according to his bio. In the wake of the crisis, he represented an unnamed “large financial institution” in connection with the settlement of mortgage-related securities claims with the Federal Housing Finance Agency. He also advised a “large financial institution” in connection with the settlement of mortgage-related claims with the Department of Justice, Housing and Urban Development, and the FHFA. Other financial firms he’s worked with include Ally Financial, AMBAC, Oaktree Capital, Och-Ziff, and Moelis. He also advised Alibaba (BABA) on its $25 billion IPO, one of the largest public offerings ever. During his career, Clayton has received a number of accolades for being among the top lawyers in the business. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor’s in engineering in 1988. He earned his bachelor’s in economics from the University of Cambridge in 1990. He received his JD from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1993. After law school, he served as a law clerk for Judge Marvin Katz in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from 1993 until 1995. He was a lecturer for “M&A Through the Business Cycle” at this alma mater between 2009 and 2015. A Cybersecurity Commission One of the fascinating facets of Clayton’s career is his experience in cybersecurity. Clayton helps lead Sullivan & Cromwell’s cybersecurity practice, advising clients who are preparing for risks or responding to breaches. In 2015, he co-authored an opinion piece for Knowledge@Wharton that called for the creation of a Cyber Threat Commission that would be similar to the model of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. The idea would be for the commission to offer recommendations in advance of a crisis. The authors described cybersecurity as a “black elephant,” which is a combination of a “black swan,” an unexpected event with huge consequences, and the classic “elephant in the room” saying. Here’s an excerpt from their opinion piece on what the commission should do: The U.S. President and Congress should appoint a 9-11-type Cyber Threat Commission. This Commission should: Convene the best minds and intents from all sectors and political parties –divorced from self-interest and outside influences — with sufficient power and authority to move quickly and effectively. Recruit beyond national borders — reaching the leading authorities from around the world. Produce a report on the state of the digital union, including an assessment of the risks and a plan for addressing them in plain language that all can understand. Follow the lead of the 9-11 Commission and communications experts in offering the narrative — not a typical government report — that all will want to read and follow. Utilize social media to continue to communicate and gain feedback. There doesn’t have to be a cyber attack to start working on this, the authors noted. — Julia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Jayson Derrick , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} January 04, 2017 1:11pm   Comments Share: Walter "Jay" Clayton is a name many investors aren't familiar with, but this will change very quickly. The Wall Street attorney has been tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Financial Experience As noted by Reuters, Clayton is a partner at the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. He is an expert on mergers and acquisitions and capital-raising efforts, and he has advised many public and private companies. Clayton also focused his practice on advising clients on how to navigate regulatory and enforcement actions. Clayton has worked on many large deals involving the world's biggest banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Specifically, he worked on Barclays PLC (ADR) (NYSE: BCS)'s acquisition of Lehman Brothers' assets as well as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM)'s acquisition of Bear Stearns. Beyond The Financial Sector Clayton's experience outside of the financial sector include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA)'s initial public offering. "Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time," Trump said in a statement released on Wednesday. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers." Reuters suggested Clayton's appointment is a signal that Trump's administration will scale back regulations that may be counterproductive and restricting corporate growth. For example, CNBC suggested that Trump's administration will scale back on several banking and finance regulations such as Dodd-Frank. "In light of Jay's vast experience in capital formation, his appointment as SEC Chair is a strong positive signal the economy is a top priority of President-elect Trump and his team, and that the SEC will work together with Main Street to meet the country's economic goals of full employment and healthy growth," Jonathan Macey, a professor at the Yale Law School told Reuters.

Jay Clayton, the Wall Street lawyer picked on Wednesday by President-elect Donald Trump as his nominee to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has such a small public presence that major wire services don’t even have a photograph of him. His public pronouncement at being nominated suggests he wants to ease regulations. “If confirmed, we are going to work together with key stakeholders in the financial system to make sure we provide investors and our companies with the confidence to invest together in America. We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs,” Clayton said in a prepared statement. His profile at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm known in particular for its representation of J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.53% and other Wall Street titans, suggests one area of focus could be reforming the agency’s prosecution of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A 2011 paper Clayton was involved in drafting for the New York City Bar Association complains about the federal government’s broad enforcement of that law. The paper — titled “The FCPA and its Impact on International Business Transactions: Should Anything Be Done to Minimize the Consequences of the U.S.’s Unique Position on Combating Offshore Corruption?” — states that foreign companies are leery of deals that would bring them under the act’s jurisdiction, such as listing on a U.S. exchange in an initial public offering or acquiring a U.S. company in a stock-for-stock exchange. Related story: Trump’s SEC may take aim at corporate disclosure That hasn’t deterred them completely, of course. In 2015, foreign companies represented about 16% of all U.S. public offerings, according to data from S&P Capital IQ, and a similar percentage in 2016 through November. Clayton himself helped represent Alibaba BABA, +0.39% in its New York Stock Exchange listing, which was the largest IPO of all time, not to mention the largest Chinese listing in the U.S. But the SEC has been active in FCPA prosecution. Last year, 27 companies paid $2.48 billion to resolve FCPA cases, the biggest enforcement year in history, according to the FCPA blog. It’s also the types of cases the SEC has brought that have raised some eyebrows. One high-profile case that wrapped up in November was a $264 million fine brought against J.P. Morgan over its “sons and daughters” program in China, wherein the bank gave prestigious jobs to relatives and friends of Chinese government officials to win business. A number of other Wall Street banks — including Deutsche Bank DB, +2.46%  , an institution President-elect Trump does much of his business with — are facing similar charges, according to regulatory filings. Such conduct hasn’t until recently been a target of FCPA prosecutions. Clayton didn’t represent J.P. Morgan in that matter.

The pan-European STOXX 600 closed 0.1 percent lower, pulling back from its highest level since December 2015, reached in the previous session. The index was dragged down by a 14.4 percent slump in shares of UK fashion retailer Next, making it the biggest percentage faller on the STOXX 600. The stock has lost nearly 40 percent over the past year. Next's warning put pressure on other high street retailers with UK exposure. Marks & Spencer slumped 6.1 percent and Primark-owner Associated British Foods fell 3.7 percent. The STOXX 600 retail index was down 1 percent, the biggest sectoral faller. "We are already seeing signs of inflation picking up as import prices rise in the wake of sterling's fall," said Stephen Macklow-Smith, head of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management. "Retailers are likely to respond with price competition, which is likely to put pressure on their margins ... The only question is how much of this is already in the price, given that retailers have underperformed since late 2015. My sense is that further pressure on real incomes is not yet fully discounted." The exception was B&M. The value retailer was the top STOXX 600 riser, up 9.5 percent after reporting record Christmas trading. The STOXX 600 is up nearly 12 percent in the seven weeks since lows hit following the U.S. presidential election, as investors bet that global growth and inflation will rise under President-elect Donald Trump. Euro zone services PMIs provided further evidence of economic strength, as businesses ended 2016 by ramping up activity at the fastest pace for five-and-a-half years. In financials, Credit Suisse rose 3.5 percent following a positive sector note by Barclays. European banks rose 0.6 percent, the top sectoral riser. "The calendar of political events remains full, and economic variables open to a wide range of outcomes, whose ebbs and flows should stimulate trading further in 2017, giving upside to investment bank revenues," Barclays analysts said in a note. UK-listed housebuilders were also among top sectoral gainers, after Deutsche Bank said there was close to 30 percent upside in the sector. Shares in Barratt Developments, Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon rose between 2.8 percent and 4.1 percent, also helped by UK mortgage approvals in November reaching an eight-month high, indicating a post-Brexit recovery. French pharma firm Ipsen hit a record high after Natixis upgraded the stock to "buy" from "hold". It closed 3 percent higher.

Details of the case against Katz haven’t been made public. According to the court documents, the case will be filed as a "criminal information," which is often part of a plea agreement with prosecutors. Bob Knuts, Katz’s lawyer, confirmed his client would appear in court but declined to provide further details. The Justice Department has spearheaded a global investigation into currency-rigging since at least the fall of 2013. In May 2015, four banks -- Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc -- pleaded guilty to charges that their traders conspired to manipulate trading in U.S. dollars and euros. UBS Group AG pleaded guilty to a related charge. Katz spent a year as director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading at Barclays beginning in 2010, according to regulatory filings and his LinkedIn profile. He joined BNP Paribas in September 2011 as its director of emerging markets-foreign exchange trading, before leaving for Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. two years later, the documents show. Before joining Barclays, Katz spent more than nine years at Standard Bank, where he was head of foreign exchange, according to his LinkedIn profile. The most important market news of the day.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Katz’s time at Barclays coincides with that of Chris Ashton, the former global head of spot trading at the London-based bank. Prosecutors have been investigating allegations that Ashton and a group of other traders participated in an electronic chatroom called The Cartel where they conspired to rig currency prices. Ashton was permanently banned from U.S. banking by the U.S. Federal Reserve in August. It isn’t clear whether Katz had any interaction with Ashton or other members of The Cartel. Those chatroom discussions formed the basis of guilty pleas by four of the banks, which are scheduled to be sentenced Thursday in Connecticut. Bloomberg reported in August 2015 that the U.S. currency-rigging investigation had expanded to emerging market currencies, including the Brazilian real and the Russian ruble.

Trump appeared disciplined -- much unlike past campaign rallies when he broke from his... By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Bank stocks soared after Donald Trump's victory in November. And the sector is off to a hot start in 2017 as investors continue to bet on an unwinding of some of President Obama's Wall Street reforms and more rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan Chase hit an all-time high Wednesday. So did shares of several other big and mid-sized banks: PNC, M&T Bank, First Republic, Citizens, Cullen/Frost and SVB -- a bank in California that does a lot of lending to tech startups. Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and even scandal ridden Wells Fargo have all shot up about 2% so far in 2017. So can the rally continue? Investors are clearly hoping that Trump and the Republican-led Congress may be kinder to Wall Street than Obama was. If some of the more onerous regulations of Dodd-Frank are rolled back, that could be good news for many big banks. Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, said that even though the stocks have already shot up on expectations of some regulatory relief, Wall Street's profits forecasts may still be too low for many big banks. "Earnings estimates are only starting to creep up. There is more room to run," Bailey said. He thinks that the likelihood of tax cuts from Trump and Congress will help. And unlike last year, when the Fed only raised rates once despite expectations at the start of 2016 for multiple increases, Bailey believes the Fed will hike rates two or three times this year. That would boost the profits that banks generate from loans. Bailey said PNC and Wells Fargo are two of his firm's top holdings -- even though he concedes that Wells Fargo is in the "middle innings" of cleaning up the fake account mess that hit the company last year and led to its CEO stepping down. Rob Lutts, chief investment officer of Cabot Wealth Management, also thinks that big banks could go even higher. He said investors shouldn't be too concerned that the stocks have moved up so quickly. "The bigger issue is that banks have underperformed for a number of years. The strength of the rebound may be unusual, but not crazy. Is there still upside? Yes," he said. Lutts notes that Bank of America and Citigroup still trade below their book value for example -- a key measure for banks. He thinks both banks don't deserve to be that cheap anymore now that the financial crisis of 2008 is well behind them. Lutts added that all of the talk from Trump about boosting growth in the U.S. is another good sign for banks. "There's a new sheriff in town. Investors shouldn't underestimate the importance of that. If just one out of 10 corporate boards in America decides to do more deals because of Trump's policies, that would have a real positive impact for banks," he said. There's a flip side to this domestic focus -- and it may be a significant concern for larger banks. Bailey said Trump's populist rhetoric could pose a problem for big banks that have major operations outside of the U.S. United Technologies, Ford and GM have all been fodder for critical Trump tweets because of business they do in Mexico. It's hard to imagine how Wall Street giants would continue to thrive if Trump wants them to ignore growth potential in emerging markets -- or if, even worse, Trump's policies lead to trade wars. "Protectionism is a risk. Global banks would get squeezed," Bailey said. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

(Bill Denver For NY Daily News) BY Adam Edelman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Wednesday, January 4, 2017, 5:02 PM President-elect Donald Trump has tapped Bill Stepien — Chris Christie’s former campaign manager whom the New Jersey governor axed after becoming mired in the Bridgegate scandal — as his White House political director, his transition team said Wednesday. Stepien, who ran both of Christie’s gubernatorial campaigns and who the oversized guv fired after his name came up in emails related to the scandal over the George Washington Bridge lane closures, had been working with the Trump transition team in recent months and had previously worked on the presidential bids of George W. Bush and John McCain. While Stepien’s hire had been expected, it was nevertheless ironic, considering Christie — who had supported Trump quickly after he abandoned his own bid and who became a prominent surrogate for the mogul — will be awarded with no title or responsibilities in the incoming administration. Christie had fallen out of favor within Trump’s circle after he refused to offer a full-throated defense of the mogul following the emergence of a tape showing him making lewd comments about women.

Stepien, who court testimony showed was aware of the alleged plot to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for refusing to endorse Christie's reelection in 2013, was not charged in connection to the lane closures and has denied having any knowledge of them. His appointment Wednesday came amid a raft of other personnel announcements for Trump’s incoming administration, including Keith Schiller, a retired NYPD officer who had been running Trump's private security detail, as director of Oval Office operations. Trump’s transition team said the President-elect will nominate Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton as his Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. (BRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS) Schiller had led a private security team — which Trump had employed on top of his Secret Service detail — to help protect the President-elect. Vice President-elect Mike Pence promises early Obamacare action If Schiller brings his entire team to the White House, it would mark a radical departure from the standard protocol of having the President rely solely on the Secret Service for protection. Earlier Wednesday, Trump’s transition team announced he would nominate Wall Street lawyer Jay Clayton as his Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. Chris Christie was left with no role in Trump's administration. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) Clayton is a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell who specializes in public and private mergers and offerings, an area that requires expertise on complex securities regulations and corporate governance. Throughout his legal career, Clayton worked on high-profile initial public offerings, and during the peak of the 2008 financial crisis, he worked on major deals involving big banks, including Barclays Capital's acquisition of Lehman Brothers' assets, the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, and the U.S. Treasury Department's capital investment in Goldman Sachs. President Obama addresses the troops one last time As SEC chairman, Clayton would be instrumental in helping to carry out Trump's vows to scale back on financial regulation. Stephen Miller (l.) senior policy adviser for the Trump campaign, and Keith Schiller, chief of security for the Trump campaign, check the podium before Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during an event at Trump SoHo Hotel. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) "Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time," Trump said in a statement. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers." Clayton will be the latest member of Trump's incoming cabinet and cabinet-level advisers whose career was on Wall Street, joining fellow investment honchos Steve Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs partner who is now the Treasury secretary designate; Stephen Bannon, a former Goldman banker who is Trump's chief White House strategist; Wilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary designate who enjoyed a decades-long career in private equity; and Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn, who will head Trump’s National Economic Council. Trump still has vacancies for the secretary of agriculture and secretary of veterans affairs posts.

Mr Hazlewood will probably stay with Deutsche Bank in a different role, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn't public. Mr Hazlewood joined Deutsche Bank in July, after previously working at lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co and HSBC Holdings Plc. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Mr Hazlewood couldn't immediately be reached. Chief Executive Officer John Cryan is trying to resolve the bank's remaining legal battles, following a US$7.2 billion settlement with the US over its role in the sale of mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Deutsche Bank is still being probed by US and UK authorities over whether it failed to catch transactions that may have moved billions of dollars out of Russia from 2012 to 2015, people familiar with the matter have said.  After settling the US case last month, Cryan said in a memo to staff that an internal investigation by the bank had found "no indication of a breach of sanctions" in Russia. The probe did detect "deficiencies" in the bank's systems and controls that were being addressed, according to the memo. Mr Hazlewood currently reports to Deutsche Bank's chief regulatory officer, Sylvie Matherat. News that he was stepping down was reported earlier Wednesday by Manager Magazin.

 Trump's pick to head the SEC has a history of defending big banks Bob Bryan Jan. 4, 2017, 11:05 AM 4,311 facebook linkedin twitter email print Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump will nominate Jay Clayton, a Wall Street lawyer, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to transition sources. Clayton, a partner at Sullivan and Cromwell, has represented numerous Wall Street giants and has even defended financial institutions against regulators. According to Clayton's biography on Sullivan and Cromwell's website, he represented multiple banks during the financial crisis including Barclays during its purchase of Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns in its sale of itself to JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs during its investment from Warren Buffett and the US TARP program. Clayton has also represented large financial institutions — as his website puts it — against government agencies such as the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and even the SEC. The various cases include: "A large financial institution in connection with the settlement of mortgage related claims with the DOJ, HUD and FHFA." "A hedge fund in connection with a regulatory review of various credit market transactions." "A large financial institution in connection with a regulatory review of transactions in government securities." Clayton also has experience in capital markets, advising on the initial public offerings of Alibaba, Ally Financial, Oaktree Capital Group, and Och-Ziff. "Jay Clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law, and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time," Trump said in a statement from the transition. "We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers." While Clayton, who also was quoted, did not mention rolling back regulation specifically, he emphasized encouraging investment from businesses. "If confirmed, we are going to work together with key stakeholders in the financial system to make sure we provide investors and our companies with the confidence to invest together in America," Clayton said in the statement. "We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs." Want to get ahead on Wall Street?

Here are the 21 banks stocks on the S&P 500. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 4, 2017 at 8:48AM To figure out bank stocks, it helps to come up with ways to organize them. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. You can slice and dice bank stocks a number of different ways. In the past, I've done so based on their size, type, how much capital they have, and whether they're considered too big to fail. All of these are good ways to organize the bank industry in your head. There's another way that's also worth considering: looking at which bank stocks are on the S&P 500. S&P 500 selection criteria S&P 500 serves as a screen of the biggest and most profitable banks in the United States. You can get a sense for this by examining the S&P 500's selection criteria. To make the list, a company must, among other things: Have a market capitalization of at least $5.3 billion Have a liquid stock -- a quarter of a million of its shares must change hands each month Be based in the United States And be "financially viable" -- meaning that it must generally earn a profit over the preceding 12 months By using the S&P 500 as a screen for bank stocks, you all but eliminate the risk of investing in a new, untried bank that has yet to prove its mettle through different stages of a credit cycle. So, which bank stocks have made the cut and are included on the world's leading large-cap index? Here are the 21 bank stocks on the S&P 500: Name Total Assets (Millions) Return on Equity (TTM)* Bank of America $2,195,314 6.37% BB&T $222,622 9.09% Bank of New York Mellon $374,114 9.40% Citigroup $1,818,117 7.02% Citizens Financial $147,015 5.00% Comerica $74,124 5.61% Capital One $345,061 8.12% Fifth Third Bancorp $143,279 12.24% Goldman Sachs $879,987 7.68% Huntington Bancshares $100,765 9.40% JPMorgan Chase $2,521,029 10.47% KeyCorp $135,805 6.97% Morgan Stanley $813,891 7.61% M&T Bank $126,841 8.71% People's United $40,692 5.76% PNC Financial $369,348 8.60% SunTrust Banks $205,091 8.32% State Street $256,140 11.33% U.S. Bancorp $454,134 14.26% Wells Fargo $1,942,124 12.78% Zions Bancorp $61,039 6.39% *TTM = trailing 12 months. Data source: Finviz.com and YCharts.com. Banks of different shapes and sizes As you can see, the bank stocks on the S&P 500 come in different shapes and sizes, though, of course, they're all big. The smallest on the list, People's United, nevertheless has a $41 billion balance sheet. You have the nation's four megabanks, all of which have close to or over $2 trillion worth of assets on their balance sheets: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). You have the stand-alone investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Although these are formally bank holding companies, getting charters during the financial crisis in order to have access to the Federal Reserve's discount window, they're focused almost exclusively on investment banking. You have the nation's two biggest custodial banks, Bank of New York Mellon (what I consider to be the most interesting bank in America), and State Street, which serve large institutional customers. You have a smattering of regional banks, including BB&T, Citizens Financial, Comerica, Fifth Third, Huntington Bancshares, KeyCorp, M&T Bank, People's United, PNC Financial, SunTrust Banks, U.S. Bancorp, and Zions. And you have Capital One, a monoline credit card company that's only recently transformed into a regional bank. An important caveat Inclusion on the S&P 500 is just one of many things investors should consider when selecting a bank stock for their portfolio. After all, stocks are both added to and subtracted from the index on a regular basis. Prior to the financial crisis, Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, National City Corp., and Merrill Lynch were all members of the widely followed index. These banks have since either gone belly-up or were acquired by other banks at discounts to their pre-crisis share prices. Moreover, even banks that have remained on the list have dealt their shareholders serious losses. Bank of America and Citigroup come immediately to mind. Bank of America's stock is still down roughly 60% since its pre-crisis high; Citigroup's shares are off 90%. But for every Bank of America and Citigroup, there's a Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, shares of which have gone on to new highs even in the wake of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. In short, while using the S&P 500 to identify good banks stocks to invest in certainly isn't a panacea, it can be used as an initial screen for beginning investors who are thinking about investing in the sector.

But if you’re a financial stock lover, more of the same will do just fine, thank you very much. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) closed out 2016 in bullish fashion with bank stocks from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) soaring into the Christmas season. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr BAC stock closed out the year with an impressive 31% gain. What’s more, BofA scored the entirety of the gains after the November election. The first 10 months of the year were a bust for the entire financial sector. With higher rates and deregulation on the horizon, the denizens of the Street are buying up bank stocks with abandon. Bank of America has now climbed to an eight-year high. Indeed, the $20 level (which was breached during the post-election buying binge) has sat untouched since BAC shares plunged beneath it during the 2008 meltdown. With mega-resistance now shattered, BAC stock holders are hoping a new bull market has begun — one with the mustard to carry shares higher for years to come. At a minimum, spectators have to admit the weekly price chart of BofA looks better than at any time over the past decade.

Of course, the recent chop can’t be too surprising given how overbought the stock had become following the financial stock explosion. The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New Year Fortunately for would-be buyers, a lower-risk entry is now in the offing. How to Trade BAC Stock Here If you think the good times keep rolling for Bank of America, consider grabbing the BAC April 22 calls for $1.68 or better. Fear has fled in the wake of the rousing rally. And that means options can now be snatched up on the cheap. Your max loss is limited to the initial $1.68 and will be forfeited if BAC stock sits below $22 at expiration. The max gain is unlimited, which means you can continue banking coin on the back of BofA bulls. As of this writing, Tyler Craig owned bullish positions on XLF.

(AAPL) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU) 2 Trades to Play the Exxon Mobil (XOM) Stock Breakout (or Breakdown) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are on the rise again this morning, as Wall Street is once again on Dow 20K watch. The Dow Jones Industrial Average crept back above the 10,900 mark yesterday, and if investors like what they see in today’s release of last month’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, we could see the Dow challenge 20,000. What’s more, December auto sales will also begin to leak onto the Street today. Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.18%, S&P 500 futures have gained 0.19% and Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.15%. On the options front, volume finally returned to normal levels on Tuesday, with roughly 15.9 million calls and 11.2 million puts changing hands. The heavy skew toward call activity bled over into the CBOE, where the single-session equity put/call volume ratio hit retreated from one-week high to rest at 0.69. The 10-day moving average held at a one-month high of 0.67. Turning to Tuesday’s volume leaders, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) saw record short-term options volume on Tuesday ahead of today’s ex-dividend date and next Friday’s earnings report. Elsewhere, put activity ramped up on Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) despite Citigroup’s upgrade to “buy,” while Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) received a bullish lift in sentiment after it cancelled its plans for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) JPM stock trades ex-dividend today, with shareholders of record as of the close last night receiving a payout of 48 cents per share on Jan. 31. As with all ex-dividend dates, JPM stock was flooded with deep-in-the-money call activity as traders implemented dividend capture strategies. The 10 Best Contrarian Stocks to Buy in the New Year That said, some of yesterday’s VZ options volume may have been geared toward next week’s quarterly earnings report. Verizon is expected to post a profit of $1.42 per share on Friday next week, with revenue seen coming in at $23.87 billion. EarningsWhispers.com places the whisper number at $1.47 per share, though given President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of decreased regulation and the Federal Reserve’s threat of three interest rate hikes in 2017, guidance may well be the real driver for JPM stock next week. Still, don’t expect to see options volume similar to yesterday’s activity, where roughly 2.1 million contracts traded with calls snapping up 95% of the day’s take.

COURTESY BLOOMBERG Print Email Comment Tweet Posted: Wednesday, January 4, 2017 9:01 am By Martin Z. Braun Bloomberg News transportation They’re giddy in the private-jet industry at dawn of Trump era (Jan. 3, 2017) financial services Record run for company-bond sales seen screeching to a 2017 halt (Dec. 28, 2016) banking BofA’s Moynihan says businesses are friskier after Trump victory (Dec. 22, 2016) NEW YORK - Bank of America Corp. is extending its lead in the municipal-bond business. The Charlotte, N.C.-based bank held its spot as the top underwriter of U.S. state and local debt for a fifth straight year by overseeing $67.8 billion of sales in 2016, boosting its share of new issues by 2 percentage points to 15 percent, a bigger gain that any other bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup Inc. also captured a larger piece of the business, overtaking JPMorgan Chase & Co. to become the second-largest underwriter. The banks benefited from a record pace of municipal-securities sales after yields tumbled to the lowest on record in July, spurring governments to refinance or borrow for public works before the Federal Reserve resumed raising interest rates, as it did last month. Bank of America was the lead manager for the second-biggest issue of the year, a $2.74 billion sale by New Jersey’s Transportation Trust Fund Authority to finance roadwork. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. served as joint senior managers on the biggest deal of the year, a $2.95 billion general-obligation issue by the state of California, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan’s biggest deal was another $2.65 billion California sale, on which it served as a co-lead along with Bank of America. <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> Selena Morris, a Bank of America spokeswoman, declined to comment, as did Citigroup spokesman Scott Helfman. JPMorgan spokeswoman Jessica Francisco also declined to comment. The pace of municipal-bond offerings are largely projected to decline this year, with refinancing expected to slow because of higher interest rates. Even so, first time borrowing may increase “slightly” as governments whose finances have benefited from the more than seven-year economic expansion pour more money into infrastructure, according to a forecast from Barclays Plc. U.S. state and local governments won approval to sell at least $55 billion of bonds in November ballot measures, debt that governments may start issuing in 2017. The prices Wall Street banks charged U.S. cities and states to sell bonds in 2016 were little changed. Fees averaged $5.21 per $1,000 of long-term bonds compared with $5.08 in 2015. Among the 20 biggest underwriters of such debt, the weighted average disclosed fees ranged from $3.82 for Loop Capital Markets LLC to as much as $10.61 for Robert W. Baird & Co. About three-quarters of the long-term debt issued in 2016 was arranged through so-called negotiated offerings, in which banks are picked ahead of time instead of competing against each other in an auction. One of the firms that boosted its ranking the most was New York City-based Samuel A. Ramirez & Co. The dealer, which has about 80 people in its municipal securities division and was promoted to the ranks of New York City’s senior underwriters, rose 12 places to 14th by managing $6.9 billion of bonds in just 30 deals. In 2016, Ramirez hired Paula Dagen, Morgan Stanley’s former lead banker for New York City and plans to expand “selectively and opportunistically,” said Ted Sobel, head of municipal finance. New York, one of the largest issuers of municipal bonds, plans to sell about $29 billion of debt through June 2020, according to the city’s financial plan. “Our game plan has been very focused on providing great banking work -- ideas, solutions, service, to major clients in core regions and in core competencies,” said Sobel, who joined Ramirez in 2009 after 13 years at UBS Group AG. “We’ve found that’s been a pretty good path to success.” Keywords Bank of America, Rhode Island, Providence, Bank of America and municipal bonds Print Email Comment Tweet Comments No comments on this story | Please log in to comment by clicking here Please log in or register to add your comment Related Stories transportation They’re giddy in the private-jet industry at dawn of Trump era (Jan. 3, 2017) financial services Record run for company-bond sales seen screeching to a 2017 halt (Dec. 28, 2016) banking BofA’s Moynihan says businesses are friskier after Trump victory (Dec. 22, 2016) Popular Most Read 1.

We now know how Wall Street banks stack up in dealmaking, and it isn't even close Matt Turner Jan. 4, 2017, 7:06 AM 17,393 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Dylan Martinez The results are in, and, really, it isn't even that close. JPMorgan finished 2016 in a dominant position when it comes to Wall Street dealmaking revenue, according to figures from Dealogic. The US bank earned the most in fees in global investment banking, US investment banking, and investment banking in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. It also finished the year top of the table for debt capital markets revenue, equity capital markets revenue, and syndicated loans revenue, according to figures from Dealogic. It made more money than its rivals in seven of the 11 product areas and in eight of the 10 most important sectors. Only Goldman Sachs offered much resistance. The US investment bank ranked top for mergers and acquisitions revenue, and it generated the most fees from clients in the industrials and consumer and retail industries. Though based on estimates, these tables are the broadest possible and a closely watched indicator of who is up and who is down. Here's how the banks stacked up this time around. View As: One Page Slides JPMorgan earned $5.9 billion in deal fees in 2016, more than $1 billion more than Goldman Sachs Dealogic JPMorgan ranked top in just about every single product except for securitization and covered bonds, initial public offerings, and mergers and acquisitions Dealogic It also ranked at the top in eight of the top 10 industry groups, ranking second in the remaining two Dealogic SEE ALSO: Goldman Sachs is crushing the competition in a marquee business More: Features JPMorgan Goldman Sachs Investment Banks Dealogic facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru We now know how Wall Street banks stack up in dealmaking, and it isn't even close We now know how Wall Street banks stack up in dealmaking, and it isn't even close The results are in, and, really, it isn't even...

Indonesia cut its business ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co because its research was "not credible and not objective", Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told reporters. Some analysts have said that the decision has raised concern about whether the government would penalise other research providers for reports that are deemed to be negative. Nazara dismissed such worries. "There is no need to be afraid as long as it's credible," he said. "The point is, don't worry, go ahead with an analysis of Indonesia's economy that is as credible as possible, by using the available data and facts." In a note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan analysts downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight", citing higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Indonesia has dropped JPMorgan's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global markets, Nazara said. The U.S. bank is also no longer what Indonesia terms a perception bank. The government said in a 2006 decree that perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. JPMorgan is allowed to continue its business in the private sector, Nazara said. The government assurances are unlikely to dispel the worries. "This has made us more cautious although we'll still try our best to safeguard our research independence," said a Jakarta-based analyst at a foreign bank, who declined to be identified.

Business Bankers in line for their biggest bonuses in years JIM ARMITAGE Wednesday 4 January 2017 10:34 BST Click to follow The Evening Standard Champagne lifestyles: City bankers could soon be celebrating — perhaps in the way depicted by the models posed above Getty Images As the rest of us dread returning to the office after the Christmas break, the feeling for many London bankers is a mixture of fear and excitement. Why? Because, for the City’s biggest US investment banks, back to school means bonus time — that moment when a long walk to the department boss’s office results in you being given your “number”, the figure of how much you’ve made for 2016. The “comp” (compensation) figure can dictate which car bankers will be driving for the next 12 months, the holidays they’ll be having, even what school the children will be attending. Traditionally, Goldman Sachs comes out of the blocks first after it announces full-year profits in the next week or two. It’s the biggest-paying, ballsiest bank in town, and — some say — it sets the bonus benchmark for Wall Street rivals.  After a shaky start, 2016 turned out to be a strong year for most departments, meaning bonuses should follow suit. Says one investment banker: “If you’d asked me nine months ago, you’d have got a pretty miserable response but since that horrible first quarter, things have picked up nicely.” For the first time in years, bond traders should be getting decent bonuses, while the suave investment bankers advising clients on takeovers also had a healthy second half of 2016. In the bond world — stuck since the early years of the financial crisis with what one trader describes as “shite” bonuses — confidence came back with a bang even before Donald Trump’s US presidential election victory triggered hopes of interest-rate rises and a borrowing boom. The Federal Reserve’s positive signals through much of the year gave credit investors a reason to bet again.  Donald Trump named Time's Person of the Year At last, bond traders aren’t cowed by feeling they’re lucky just to have a job. The old implied threat to the boss— pay me right or I’m going down the street to  our biggest competitor — just might re-emerge. As one veteran puts it: “In the old days, the best tactic when getting your number was always to be furious. Whatever it was, you’d say: ‘I don’t call that a bonus, I call that a tip’. You had the power to keep the boss on his toes. But then, for years, it was just ‘thank you for not firing me, sir’. This year, though, perhaps those old days might be coming back again.”  Banks say the percentage of profits they pay out in bonuses is sharply down on a decade ago, that they’ve been through a major retrenchment since the financial crisis, and that their trading arms have cut back on the risk-taking that spurred the bonuses of old. But recent profits suggest many traders should still expect some decent payola. At $2.7 billion (£2.2 billion), Goldman earned  $1 billion more in its market-making division in the third quarter of 2016 than a year earlier. JPMorgan’s markets arm surged by a fifth to $6.5 billion, fuelled by a 48% increase in bond trading revenues, while Morgan Stanley’s bond income leaped from $583 million to  $1.5 billion. So expect a $2 million-$5 million bonus for Goldman’s trading boss Isabelle Ealet, plus more for outgoing bond veteran Michael Sherwood, co-head of Europe, who should — for the sake of appearances — beat last year’s $21 million. Morgan Stanley’s fixed-income boss Jakob Horder will also be in for a big package, as will JP’s Charles Bristow. Some trickle-down economics to boost their staffs’ pay by hundreds of thousands is on the cards, too. Read more Jim Armitage: He ruffled feathers but London owes Goldman’s Woody A flurry of heavyweight mergers and acquisitions — perhaps spurred by Brexit — will be great news for the bank accounts of Goldman’s big dealmakers, including Karen Cook and Mark Sorrell — who can both bank on picking up a few million after advising on big deals such as the bumper Shell-BG merger, which completed during the year.  Paul Baker’s team at Morgan Stanley will have pulled in big money for advising Sainsbury’s on its takeover of Home Retail Group, while Jonathan Bewes’ crew at Bank of America Merrill Lynch will have been major earners after squeezing out a top price for the other side on that deal. Anthony Gutman, who with Sherwood was forced to testify to MPs over Goldman’s embarrassing entanglement with Sir Philip Green’s sale of BHS, will be set for another multi-million-dollar pay cheque for advising ARM Holdings on its takeover by SoftBank. At Morgan Stanley, second after Goldman in the Dealogic M&A league tables for Europe, headhunters predict top dollar for publicity-shy Irishman Colm Donlon. JPMorgan, number two for takeovers in the UK behind Goldman, had a decent year, too — expect heady bonuses for new European vice chair Isabelle Seillier and UK M&A chief Dwayne Lysaght. Notice how they’re all American banks in the roster? No surprise. When it comes to the bulge-bracket banks’ bonuses, Europe’s will be struggling to keep up. Deutsche Bank has been holding back in light of its US fines and Barclays is still sorting out its corporate and investment banking arm. UBS and Credit Suisse, meanwhile, may have been racing up the M&A league tables but they’re still in sackcloth and ashes where bonuses are concerned. Barclays is revamping its investment bank (AFP/Getty Images ) As one Brit working for a US firm says: “For the last few years, US banks have been eating the lunch of European firms in their own backyard. We’re gaining market share, and the share of customers’ wallets that goes with it.” Even in US firms, the poor folks running — or not — stock-market flotations will not have a bonus to remember this year. Revenues have been lousy as uncertainty before and since the Brexit vote has made investors wary of backing new share sales. Pity IPO bankers like Goldman’s Richard Cormack and JPMorgan’s Nicholas Hall, whose names were on the ticket for Misys and TI Fluid Systems, two of the big pulled floats of the year.  But they will be in the minority when it comes to the bonus season. For most, there will be plenty to cheer about as 2017 gets under way. And the taxman, with his 45% cut of all cash paid out, should be raising a glass as well. Boutiques eye rich pickings, too The UK mergers and acquisitions bonuses gold mine hasn’t all gone Wall Street’s way.  Boutique advisory firms set up by veteran investment bankers fleeing their old institutions (and the compliance burden that goes with them) have continued to make big gains on M&A mandates. That’s undoubtedly sucked some of the big European M&A fees from the Wall Street giants. Robey Warshaw, which advised Japan’s SoftBank on buying ARM and the London Stock Exchange  on its Deutsche Börse deal, is increasingly being joined in the rankings by Evercore, where Jane Gladstone’s team advised Michael Spencer on selling Icap’s voice broking business to Tullett, and Centerview, which is advising BAT on its Reynolds merger. A relatively new boutique team burst into town just before Christmas in the form of PJT Partners, where former Morgan Stanley rainmaker Scott Matlock’s long relationship with Sky led to his boutique being hired to advise on the Fox takeover. Says one boutique banker: “Robey Warshaw are brilliant, but it’s good that there’s some proper competition emerging to tackle their dominance on the London boutique scene.” More about: Business Investment Banking Banking Bonuses Goldman Sachs JPMorgan Morgan Stanley Barclays Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps Close We have noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Sir Ivan Rogers, one of the UK’s most experienced negotiators, was said by colleagues to be “frustrated” that his warnings about Brexit’s complexity were being ignored by conservative politicians. In a letter to his staff he warned of “muddled thinking” on the EU and urged them to “speak truth to those in power”. Supporters of Brexit, who criticised what they said was Sir Ivan’s “gloomy pessimism” have wasted no time in urging prime minister Theresa May to appoint a pro-Brexit replacement for Sir Ivan. But former officials and diplomats warn it will be difficult to replace one of the country’s most experienced experts on the EU. (FT, Daily Mail, Guardian) In the news Tillerson payout deal Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state will receive a $180m payout to sever ties to ExxonMobil if his selection is confirmed. The pay deal is intended to clear concerns that Mr Tillerson, Exxon’s chairman and chief executive, would have an incentive to favour the company’s interests while serving as the most senior US diplomat. (FT) Backtracking on fracking Environmental charity Friends of the Earth has been forced to withdraw notices about the impact of fracking for shale gas after Britain’s advertising regulator found they could not be backed up with evidence. Energy companies called the decision a victory against “anti-fracking myths” propagated by opponents of the process. In Russia, though, Gazprom Neft, the oil division of Gazprom, the state-controlled gas giant, is going it alone when it comes to trying to deliver a Russian shale energy revolution. (FT) France takes long view on bonds With plans to this week tap an existing 50-year bond that matures in 2066, France is asking bond investors to take the long view in what is expected to be a challenging year for the eurozone’s second-largest economy, as the country braces for a bruising presidential election. (FT) Dolphins given higher porpoise In a last-ditch effort to save Mexico’s vaquita porpoises from extinction, US Navy-trained dolphins will use their sonar to locate the world’s smallest and most endangered porpoise species then advise their handlers of their location. (Guardian) Turkish attacker identified Turkey has identified the gunman who killed 39 people at a nightclub on New Year’s Eve, according to the country’s foreign minister. Mevlut Cavusoglu stopped short of identifying him but said the attack was staged by “professionals”. His comments came as the Turkish parliament is set to extend a state of emergency that has been in place since a coup attempt in July for another 90 days. (Jazeera, FT) It’s a big day for The Fed The US Federal Reserve will release minutes from its final meeting of 2016, during which it raised interest rates for the second time in a decade. Food for thought China’s economic future Fears last January that a plunging stock market and currency were the death knell for China’s economy in 2016 proved to be misplaced. Yet despite the likelihood GDP grew last year by close to the government’s target of 6.5 per cent, there are still concerns the country’s fundamental economic challenges have yet to be addressed. (FT) Investing in 2017 The overwhelming probability is that the world economy will grow in 2017, writes the FT’s Martin Wolf. But while political risk did not have a huge effect on economic outcomes in 2016, that could change in 2017. The full repercussions of Donald Trump’s win, Brexit, the oil market and China’s debt will all affect markets. FT reporters have compiled the most pressing market issues facing investors in 2017. (FT) Putting out fires with half the water Fires in Indonesia during 2015 were the worst since 1997, forcing the state-run airline Garuda Indonesia to cancel more than 400 flights. One Japanese soap maker is taking on the annual forest fires on by developing a foam agent that is easier on the environment by using less water. (NAR) Rethinking diet drinks If diet drinks are your new year solution to shedding excess weight, think again. Scientists have found that people who switch to sugar-free fizzy drinks may eat more because they feel that they are being healthy and still crave sweet foods. The academics criticised drinks companies for marketing sugar-free alternatives as healthy and encouraged people to stick to water. (Times) No elites here The word “elite” has become one of the most effective partisan political stereotypes of our age. But what started out as an aspirational concept was transformed thanks to a conservative movement to redefine the term away from class and towards culture. (NYT) Video of the day Bitcoin passes $1,000 (FT) The cryptocurrency passed a notable round number in dollars this week, but there’s only one figure that really matters, argues Short View.

Business Home LBoard Would you live near a cemetery? Robin Augustin Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Indonesia penalises JPMorgan for ‘underweight’ rating Reuters | January 4, 2017 The official said the bank's analysis "did not make sense" because it recommended a "neutral" position for Brazil, a better rating than for Indonesia, despite a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. JAKARTA: Indonesia has penalised JPMorgan Chase & Co after the investment bank’s research arm recommended a smaller exposure to the country’s stocks. “After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan’s services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank,” Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry’s fiscal policy office, told Reuters on Tuesday. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan has already taken effect. The decision was taken after JPMorgan issued a note in November downgrading its rating for Indonesia to “underweight” from “overweight,” he said. The official said the bank’s analysis “did not make sense” because it recommended a “neutral” position for Brazil, a better rating than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. “We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They’ve explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It’s not that we think we’re so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries’ economies,” Nazara said. “Our mindset is, if you’re doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don’t create unnecessary volatility to create business,” he added. Business as usual A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” she said in an email. In the note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan equities analysts downgraded emerging markets including Indonesia and Brazil, citing higher risk premiums for their credit default swaps after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. “Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit,” the bank wrote, adding that the “spike in volatility” may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a “tactical” response to Trump’s victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. Indonesia’s 10-year credit default swap, a swap contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield of its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the US election, though they have since dipped. Trump signalled more protective US trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said that Indonesia’s economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia’s lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. In 2015, then-Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said he had given JPMorgan a sanction that “will be disturbing for them and make them uncomfortable” after it recommended an “underweight” position on Indonesian bonds. He didn’t say what the sanction was. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story. We welcome your opinions to allow a healthy debate.

Picture: Reuters London — Paris could lure as many as 20,000 workers from Britain’s finance industry with the exodus potentially starting within weeks as the UK begins its withdrawal from the EU, according to Europlace, the French capital’s lobby group. Paris will make its case to London-based executives in a series of February meetings as it competes for talent with rival cities such as Frankfurt. Europlace’s marketing materials show it will extol how Paris already employs more than 180,000 financiers, is home to the region’s biggest bond market and boasts the second-largest pool of asset managers. The continental race to take advantage of Brexit is heating up as British Prime Minister Theresa May plans to trigger the start of negotiations by the end of March. Global bank chiefs have warned they will soon start shifting operations and jobs from the UK to elsewhere in the EU unless she can protect their easy access to its market.

World 23 days ago Tis the season for talk of black swans, market trends and bold calls for 2017 It looks as if it will be up to governments to blow life back into the global economy. This is one of the ideas mooted as market pundits try to gauge ... Markets 25 days ago "We feel decisions will be taken in the first semester of the new year," Arnaud de Bresson, Europlace’s MD, said in an interview in London. "We see institutions are accelerating their process of thinking." With time at a premium, bankers say they want to establish new or expanded offices in the EU before the UK leaves, which is currently set for sometime in 2019. May says she wants to strike the best possible deal for banks, yet has not detailed what she will seek and has declined to fully endorse the transitional phase industry wants to smooth the departure. Selling Points In the run-up to the June referendum, HSBC Holdings said that it planned to move as many as 1,000 employees to Paris from London if voters backed Brexit, while Citigroup is now considering relocating some of its London-based equity and interest-rate derivatives traders to Frankfurt. TheCityUK lobby group warns that almost 70,000 jobs are up for grabs. JPMorgan Chase & Co could, in "some scenarios," move 4,000 jobs away from the UK because of Brexit, CEO Jamie Dimon said in an interview with Financial News published Tuesday, reiterating a figure he laid out before the vote. Dimon said the shift would take place over several years and could be accelerated if an interim agreement on banking services is not reached. Ireland Interest The state agency for winning investment in Ireland said on Tuesday the country is among a small number of European locations being studied by firms to mitigate risks from Brexit. IDA Ireland says it has received a "significant volume" of queries from firms in the UK, US, and Asia since the referendum vote. Europlace will argue Paris is better placed than other aspirants for London’s crown. It touts the city as the top hub in continental Europe for interest-rate swaps trading with some $141bn of the derivatives changing hands in France every day. That compares with $1.18-trillion in the UK. It will also promote itself as a city of requisite skills, contrasted with Frankfurt employing fewer than 100,000 people in finance and Dublin just 30,000. Another asset in its eyes is that French corporations are typically based in Paris, whereas German ones are sprayed around their country. Although it hosts some of Europe’s biggest banks, including Société Générale and BNP Paribas, France has nevertheless long lagged behind the UK and Germany as an international hub for banking. The country is perceived as hostile to financial companies and ranks 29th in the Global Financial Centres index, only one spot above Casablanca. Even its stock exchange, Euronext, is threatened by Deutsche Boerse’s planned takeover of London Stock Exchange Group, which would create Europe’s dominant market operator. France’s tight labour laws have also put off banks that value longer work weeks and an employment regime that allows easy hiring and firing. Bloomberg Please login or register to comment.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: The Nasdaq squeaked out a record high close on Thursday thanks to Amazon.com, while deep drops in Macy's, Kohl's and other department stores weighed on the broader stock market. U.S. stocks have wavered over the past three weeks following a strong surge in the wake of the November election, with investors expecting President-elect Donald Trump to stimulate the economy through tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Many on Wall Street want evidence that his campaign-trail promises will be approved by Republican lawmakers and come to fruition. "The market is pausing for a reason, it’s waiting for confirmation from Washington and the Trump agenda," said Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Palm Beach, Florida. Department stores Macy's dropped 13.89 percent while Kohl's slumped 19.02 percent after the companies said their holiday sales fell more than expected. The warnings swept up other department stores in their wake - Nordstrom fell 6.87 percent and J.C. Penney fell 7.20 percent. But online retailer Amazon.com , which has been luring customers away from department stores, rose 3.07 percent, helping push the Nasdaq Composite to a record high close. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 percent to end at 5,487.94, less than 1 point higher than its previous record high close on Dec 27. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.21 percent to end at 19,899.29 while the S&P 500 lost 0.08 percent to 2,269. Six of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors fell, with financials down 1.02 percent and hurt by JPMorgan , Wells Fargo and Bank of America . Adding to downbeat sentiment was the ADP National Employment report, which showed fewer jobs than expected were added in the private sector in December. The report was seen as a hint ahead of Friday's more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report that includes both private and public sector hiring. Broadly, the economy is seen by many economists as near full employment, a factor that may help corporate profits - and stock prices - as fourth-quarter earnings season starts in the next few weeks. "If we get a 5- or 10-percent pullback here, most people will be buying, because the fundamental backdrop is still pretty good, and getting better. This is probably the best economic environment for a new incoming president in 20 years," said John Canally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.46-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 86 new highs and 15 new lows. About 7.2 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, more than the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.
