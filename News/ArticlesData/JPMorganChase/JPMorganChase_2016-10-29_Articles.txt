John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 29, 2016 at 8:21AM Image source: The Motley Fool. The best thing about JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) stock has little to do with the stock itself, and more to do with the underlying fundamentals of the business. More specifically, if you buy shares of the nation's biggest bank by assets, you'll be aligned with one of the best bankers alive today. Getting to know Jamie Dimon JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon didn't follow the conventional path. After graduating near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, Dimon turned down some of the most coveted jobs in the financial industry, including the opportunity to work at Goldman Sachs. He instead chose to go and work under Sandy Weill, the president of American Express at the time and a well-known financial services empire builder. Weill was soon ousted from his post at the credit card giant and, along with Dimon, took control of a consumer credit company. They then expanded it over the years until, eventually, after merging with Citicorp in 1998, the company became what's known today as Citigroup. JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Dimon became president at Citigroup, but was himself ousted by Weill not long after the merger, which created the first true universal bank in the United States since the Glass-Steagall Act was passed in the midst of the Great Depression. Dimon wasn't fired because he did anything wrong, but rather because he refused to promote Weill's daughter to a position Dimon didn't believe she was qualified for. After a brief hiatus, Dimon was hired to run Bank One, a regional bank based in Chicago at the time that ranked fifth in the country in terms of assets. He turned Bank One around, boosting not only its efficiency but also morale. He did the latter in part by investing a substantial part of his net worth in the bank's stock upon taking the helm. Dimon joins JPMorgan Chase Fast-forward to 2004, when JPMorgan Chase approached Bank One about a potential merger. The deal was attractive to JPMorgan Chase not only because it would give the Wall Street bank access to Bank One's plentiful retail deposit base, but also because it secured Dimon as the successor to William Harrison atop the combined firms. This was a prudent move. Dimon proceeded to improve the operations at JPMorgan Chase, much like he did at Bank One. And he was the single most important reason that the New York City-based bank not only survived the financial crisis of 2008, but actually thrived because of it. At the darkest points of the crisis, the government came to JPMorgan Chase twice for assistance (most other banks went in the opposite direction, hat in hand to the government). In March 2008, JPMorgan Chase rescued Bear Stearns, the fifth-largest stand-alone investment bank at the time. And six months later, JPMorgan Chase came to the rescue again, taking over the failed savings and loan giant Washington Mutual. These moves, combined with impressive organic growth under Dimon's watch, enabled JPMorgan Chase to climb once again to the apex of American finance, after years of lingering behind Citigroup and Bank of America. To this end, JPMorgan Chase is now the biggest bank in America by assets. And if you include assets under custody, it oversees around $30 trillion worth of on- and off-balance-sheet assets. And I'm not the only one who thinks highly of Dimon. Warren Buffett, one of the greatest bank investors in American history, praises the bank CEO regularly. Most recently, Buffett described an interview that Dimon sat for as "off the charts." And while Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, doesn't own shares of JPMorgan Chase, Buffett himself does. It was recently announced as well that one of Buffett's lieutenants at Berkshire has agreed to join JPMorgan Chase's board of directors. If you're considering buying shares of JPMorgan Chase and are wondering about the best reason to do so, I'd say it's none other than Jamie Dimon.

A consortium of 23 financial institutions previewed Zelle, which will be available next year, at an industry conference Sunday, according to Recode. Zelle’s website says users will be able to send money to almost anyone as long as they have a debit card. The money would be transferred immediately and could be used to pay bills or make payments to friends or others. Zelle will be available to more than 76 million customers who already do mobile banking with the large financial firms, according to Bloomberg. The initiative is designed to keep Square Cash, PayPal-owned Venmo and other mobile payment platforms from eating into bank business.

This is because fossil fuel plants that emit carbon would have used up the carbon allotment SA committed to in the historic Paris Agreement, and the plants would have to be shut down. Expensive infrastructure such as railways and mines would become obsolete. However, power utility Eskom, banks such as Nedbank and energy investors still believe there is a bright future for coal projects in the country. Yolandi Groenewald investigates. THE CASE AGAINST All of South Africa’s planned coal power stations fall within the outdated Integrated Resources Plan (IRP), which determines the country’s energy policies. Jesse Burton, a researcher at the University of Cape Town’s Energy Research Centre, said there was a huge disconnect between the current energy policy and the pledges South Africa made in the Paris Agreement to cap emissions. “There is mismatch between the IRP and the least cost mitigation plan,” said Burton, whose team examined several potential future energy simulations. The least cost mitigation plan is the cheapest investment option available to rid South Africa of its coal dependancy. The country has a carbon budget limit of 14 gigatons to 2050, but cumulative emissions of new coal projects in the pipeline, such as Medupi and Kusile, will spend at least about 7.4 gigatons of that budget between now and 2050. “And eight gigatons of the budget is gone, before Medupi and Kusile even come online,” she said. “Our research showed that we should not be building new coal power plants only to turn them off when the world tells us to. It is extremely risky to plan new plants that you won’t reap profits from.” Sasol, South Africa’s second-biggest carbon emitter, plans to run its coal-to-liquids plant until at least 2040. If Sasol’s plant is not turned off sooner, coal-fired power will shut down much sooner at a high cost. Burton said the research showed that it was cheaper to shut down Sasol than retire South Africa’s new coal power plants early. “If Sasol’s plant keeps on running, other sectors will have to take up the burden,” she said. Internationally, economists are also increasingly concerned that the fossil fuel bubble might be the next to burst, as regulations to limit climate change forces fossil fuel investment out of business. For the past two years, coal use has dropped globally. Big banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are backing away from coal. According to an analysis done by Citigroup, there could be $100 trillion (R1 384 trillion) of potential stranded assets in the fossil fuel industry in the next few years. Ratings agency Moody’s also recently warned that coal “has undergone a long-term structural decline, with little prospect for near-term recovery”. In December, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that the majority of the world’s fossil fuel reserves could become stranded assets if the world implemented the emissions caps of the Paris Agreement. More than half the assets in the global coal industry are now held by companies that are either in bankruptcy proceedings or don’t earn enough money to pay their interest bills, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. THE CASE FOR Eskom, which has invested in two of the world’s biggest coal-fired plants, and developers such as Pele Natural Energy, a joint developer in the new privately owned Khanyisa coal power plant, believe that it is critical for South Africa’s developing economy to build new coal power stations. An Eskom spokesperson said that any policy-driven transition to a low-carbon society must take into account the overriding priority to address poverty and inequality. “Zero growth in CO2 emissions from 2025 means no new coal coming online after 2025 without decommissioning or lowering load factors,” he said. Based on the current coal burn of 113 megatons a year, Eskom calculates it would have to reduce to 27 megatons a year, which is equivalent to shutting down more than half of South Africa’s current collieries. “This will have an impact on job security in the coal mining sector, which is the largest employer of semiskilled and unskilled labour,” said the spokesperson. Eskom said the answer was not simple, adding that a balance needed to be found regarding loss of jobs, poverty eradication, affordability and aspirations for a lower carbon output. “All of these are national priorities, and they are conflicting.” Nedbank is part of the lending pool on both of the privately owned coal projects, together with other South African commercial banks. Spokesperson Joanne Isaacs said Nedbank had to date invested R35 billion in renewable energy projects, but the bank believed that the base load provided by coal was still a critical component in the energy mix as it complements the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation. “By funding projects in coal, Nedbank is lending into a sector that is critical to economic growth and energy security, playing a vital role in South Africa’s development,” she said. “Further, the funding requirements of the coal independent power producer procurement programme are of such a scale that the support of all South African lending institutions is required.” But she said the bank would gradually scale down its investments in fossil projects and would increase investments in renewables. Obakeng Moloabi, executive director at Pele Natural Energy, agreed that, globally, it was becoming more difficult to finance coal, adding that it was important to grow a renewable portfolio and increase investment into the sector. “But we can’t ignore South Africa’s context. When you talk about stranded assets in 2050, you have to balance it against the country of today. South Africa needs to create jobs, and coal offers more job opportunities than renewables do.” He said Khanyisa’s developers had to secure finance over the long term. “Our financing package enables us to pay back debt timeously.” Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Follow Fin24 on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

Three people familiar with the case say the government has been investigating at least a dozen Venezuelans and is expected to file charges in Houston against a few of them as soon as next month. Those on the list, including former executives of Petroleos de Venezuela SA, known as PDVSA, are suspected of having taken bribes from middlemen to award contracts at inflated prices, helping to siphon more than $11 billion out of the country. All three people spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing and sensitive due to its impact on U.S. foreign policy. The government has set its sights on a number of U.S. assets, including about 20 residential properties, some in West Palm Beach and the Houston suburbs. Switzerland has seized $118 million in assets from Swiss banks related to the matter and sent $51 million to U.S. authorities, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Venezuela’s Congress Accuses Venezuela’s opposition-run congress is separately seeking to recover $11.3 billion that went missing from PDVSA between 2004 and 2014 while Rafael Ramirez, currently Venezuela’s ambassador to the United Nations, was company president. It seeks to hold him politically responsible. Ramirez has rejected the congressional accusations as lies. Investigators are also looking at the dealings involving PDVSA and a number of companies, including Pratt & Whitney, General Electric Co. and Rolls Royce Holdings Plc, as well as ProEnergy Services, a Missouri-based firm, two of the people said. The prosecutors have been tracking money that flowed through Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., they added. A Pratt & Whitney spokesperson declined to comment and noted that its power systems business, which operated in Venezuela, was divested in June 2013 and became PW Power Systems. PW Power Systems did not respond to requests for comment. The other three companies declined to comment, as did all three banks and PDVSA. The banks handled transactions through accounts held by the individuals who transferred some of their gains out of the country, two of the people said. Money-laundering controls may not have caught transactions done through shell companies, they said. Cocaoine trafficking The people under investigation include current Venezuelan government officials, prominent businessmen and individuals suspected of involvement with cocaine trafficking, two of the people said. Homeland Security Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI are all involved in the investigation, which has been under way for at least three years and looks at activity going back to 2005. The FBI declined to comment, as did the DEA, the Justice Department, Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Attorney’s office in Houston. The investigation comes at a time when the cost of corruption is vividly apparent in Venezuela’s crumbling economy. A former finance minister, Jorge Giordani, has said that as much as $300 billion was embezzled from Venezuela in the last decade through high-level corruption. Meanwhile, hunger is spreading in a country that was once one of the world’s wealthiest. Struggling to avoid default, PDVSA on Monday reached an agreement with some creditors to push back bond maturities. Confrontation with Maduro In response to the national crisis, the opposition has sought a voter signature drive aimed at recalling President Nicolas Maduro. Last week the National Electoral Council, which is run by Maduro loyalists, suspended that effort. On Sunday, the opposition accused the president of carrying out a coup and vowed to try to replace key figures on the Supreme Court and electoral council and appeal to the International Criminal Court. The U.S. has a strong legal interest in the case because the allegedly ill-gotten money passed through its banks and was used to buy property here. The people under investigation have been linked to billions of dollars of gains, much of which was transferred to offshore accounts in Panama, the people said. The U.S. would seize homes and properties — many of them worth tens of millions each — as well as private jets and other assets to create a fund that would eventually be returned to the Venezuelan government after a democratic election, one of the people said. Ricardo Hausmann, a Venezuelan economist at Harvard who would like to see the current government replaced, said U.S. leadership in this area could prove important. ‘Devastating Political Effect’ “If the U.S. were to say, ‘We’ve identified billions of dollars,’ it would have a devastating political effect at home with Venezuela’s current government,” he said. Washington would also earn goodwill if it later returned any stolen funds, he added. Javier Corrales, a political scientist at Amherst College, said that in dealing with Venezuela the U.S. has made a point of sanctioning individuals rather than the government as a whole. Some within law enforcement have nonetheless alleged that the Obama administration is dragging its feet in pursuing Venezuelan officials because of its desire to avoid a political and economic implosion there and to help negotiate a soft landing from the current crisis. Corrales said that while political interference may play a role in the sealing of some indictments, the U.S. government largely lets its justice system do its work. PDVSA’s U.S. affiliate that handles international purchasing is in Houston, where the U.S. recently prosecuted a case which investigators say resembles this one. Roberto Rincon-Fernandez, a Venezuelan national living there, took part in a $1 billion bribery scheme to secure contracts with PDVSA. He pleaded guilty to two counts, including conspiracy to violate corruption laws. Ever since the leftist party of Hugo Chavez was elected in 1998, Venezuela has allied itself with historic opponents of the U.S., including Cuba and Iran. The U.S. accuses Venezuela of allowing itself to be used as a route for illegal drugs and of failing to adhere to international counter-narcotics agreements. Two nephews of President Maduro arrested in Haiti are being held in the U.S. on charges that they were involved in a drug-trafficking ring. They have denied it. A State Department official said they are cooperating with federal investigators. Click Tag(s) for Related Articles: BriberyCorruptionCourt of JusticePDVSAU.S.A.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 29, 2016 at 8:21AM Image source: The Motley Fool. The best thing about JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) stock has little to do with the stock itself, and more to do with the underlying fundamentals of the business. More specifically, if you buy shares of the nation's biggest bank by assets, you'll be aligned with one of the best bankers alive today. Getting to know Jamie Dimon JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon didn't follow the conventional path. After graduating near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, Dimon turned down some of the most coveted jobs in the financial industry, including the opportunity to work at Goldman Sachs. He instead chose to go and work under Sandy Weill, the president of American Express at the time and a well-known financial services empire builder. Weill was soon ousted from his post at the credit card giant and, along with Dimon, took control of a consumer credit company. They then expanded it over the years until, eventually, after merging with Citicorp in 1998, the company became what's known today as Citigroup. JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Dimon became president at Citigroup, but was himself ousted by Weill not long after the merger, which created the first true universal bank in the United States since the Glass-Steagall Act was passed in the midst of the Great Depression. Dimon wasn't fired because he did anything wrong, but rather because he refused to promote Weill's daughter to a position Dimon didn't believe she was qualified for. After a brief hiatus, Dimon was hired to run Bank One, a regional bank based in Chicago at the time that ranked fifth in the country in terms of assets. He turned Bank One around, boosting not only its efficiency but also morale. He did the latter in part by investing a substantial part of his net worth in the bank's stock upon taking the helm. Dimon joins JPMorgan Chase Fast-forward to 2004, when JPMorgan Chase approached Bank One about a potential merger. The deal was attractive to JPMorgan Chase not only because it would give the Wall Street bank access to Bank One's plentiful retail deposit base, but also because it secured Dimon as the successor to William Harrison atop the combined firms. This was a prudent move. Dimon proceeded to improve the operations at JPMorgan Chase, much like he did at Bank One. And he was the single most important reason that the New York City-based bank not only survived the financial crisis of 2008, but actually thrived because of it. At the darkest points of the crisis, the government came to JPMorgan Chase twice for assistance (most other banks went in the opposite direction, hat in hand to the government). In March 2008, JPMorgan Chase rescued Bear Stearns, the fifth-largest stand-alone investment bank at the time. And six months later, JPMorgan Chase came to the rescue again, taking over the failed savings and loan giant Washington Mutual. These moves, combined with impressive organic growth under Dimon's watch, enabled JPMorgan Chase to climb once again to the apex of American finance, after years of lingering behind Citigroup and Bank of America. To this end, JPMorgan Chase is now the biggest bank in America by assets. And if you include assets under custody, it oversees around $30 trillion worth of on- and off-balance-sheet assets. And I'm not the only one who thinks highly of Dimon. Warren Buffett, one of the greatest bank investors in American history, praises the bank CEO regularly. Most recently, Buffett described an interview that Dimon sat for as "off the charts." And while Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, doesn't own shares of JPMorgan Chase, Buffett himself does. It was recently announced as well that one of Buffett's lieutenants at Berkshire has agreed to join JPMorgan Chase's board of directors. If you're considering buying shares of JPMorgan Chase and are wondering about the best reason to do so, I'd say it's none other than Jamie Dimon.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 31 October 2016 Will KLK increase its offer for MP Evans? by cecilia kok PETALING JAYA: The ball is now in Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd’s (KLK) court to sweeten its offer for MP Evans Group Plc in order to take over the UK-based plantation company that owns and operates oil palm estates in Indonesia and Malaysia. This followed the revelation that more than half of MP Evans’ shareholders would stand by its board of director’s decision to reject the offer from the Malaysian plantation giant a day after the hostile takeover attempt was announced last Tuesday. “Clearly, the strong resistance from MP Evans’ shareholders is meant to put pressure on KLK to increase its offer price, which they deemed to have significantly undervalued the company and its prospects,” a merchant banker said. “So, if KLK really wanted to take over MP Evans, which it said could provide synergistic benefits to the group, it would have to sweeten the deal and make it more palatable to the shareholders of the target company in order for the deal to go through,” he added. MP Evans, in a statement last week, announced that 54.72% of its shareholders had confirmed their decision of not accepting KLK’s £360.5mil (RM1.83bil) cash offer for the company. On that basis, the London Alternative Investment Market (AIM)-listed company declared that KLK’s bid would fail. KLK’s offer at 642.25 pence per share, comprising 640 pence apiece in cash and an interim dividend of 2.25 pence per share, represented a 51% premium to the last closing price of MP Evans’ shares before the announcement of the public offer. However, MP Evans said the deal had “very substantially” undervalued the company. Calling KLK’s offer “highly opportunistic and wholly inadequate”, MP Evans chairman Peter Hadsley-Chaplin said the offer did not reflect the existing value of the group’s plantations or the future value from its clearly defined strategy in substantially increasing its planted hectarage. Similarly, UK-based investment bank VSA Capital said KLK’s offer undervalued MP Evans, considering previously completed deals for London-listed palm oil producers. “We agree with the board that this offer undervalues the business,” VSA Capital head of research, Edward Hugo, was quoted as saying to agriculture business news website Agrimoney.com. “We would now look to see whether KLK increases its offer, or a counter-bid is made by another party,” he added. KLK’s offer for MP Evans would translate into an acquisition valued at about US$12,635 (RM52,865) per planted hectare. This compared with Sime Darby Bhd’s acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil Ltd in March 2015 at US$24,422 per planted hectare and Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd’s buyout of Asian Plantations in October 2014 at US$21,098 per planted hectare. KLK had expected to complete the proposed takeover of MP Evans by end of this year or early 2017, but the deal would turn out to be a long-drawn-out process. KLK’s offer was conditional upon total valid acceptances of more than 50%. According to MP Evans, among those that had stated their intention of not accepting KLK’s offer were its biggest shareholder Aberdeen Asset Management (16.05%); Alcatel-Lucent Bell Pensioenfonds ofp (10.32%); Fidelity Investment International (9.8%); members of the Hadsley-Chaplin family (9.35%); JP Morgan Asset Management (UK) Ltd (5.06%); Montanaro Asset Management (2.69%); El Oro Ltd (0.68%). In addition to the above, the directors of MP Evans, who collectively own a 0.77% stake (excluding the shares held by Peter Hadsley-Chaplin and Philip Fletcher, which had been included as part of the Hadsley-Chaplin family holding), also would not accept KLK’s offer. MP Evans’ assets included 26,600 ha of planted area and three palm oil mills in Kalimantan and South Sumatra; 70 ha of plantation land in Malaysia, with property-development premium; 19,500 ha of planted areas in South Sumatra through joint venture PT Agro Muko; and a 40% stake in Bertam Properties Sdn Bhd, which owns a landbank of 330 ha near Penang island. The group’s oil palms had an average age profile of 7.9 years, compared with KLK’s oil palm tree age profile that was considered prime. KLK said there was strategic merit in synergising the operations of MP Evans with KLK from the geographical and capabilities perspectives. Analysts said the success of the deal would benefit KLK in terms of earnings accretion and asset enhancement at attractive pricing.

Honeywell International Inc. lowered its annual long-term forecast for private jets by 7 percent, or 600 aircraft, as emerging markets suffer from low commodity prices and the U.S. economy limps along at a slow pace. As many as 8,600 new planes are expected to be delivered from 2016 through 2026, down from 9,200 in last year’s outlook, according to a survey of more than 1,500 business-jet operators worldwide. Sales of those aircraft are estimated at $255 billion, down from $270 billion in the previous study. “We have a fair amount of uncertainty and instability in the economy and political environment around the world right now,” said Charles Park, director of market analysis at Honeywell’s aerospace unit. The number of used jets for sale that are less than five years old has increased and prices continue to drop, which drags on demand for new aircraft, Park said. The introduction of new models from manufacturers such as Gulfstream and Bombardier Inc. in 2018 should stimulate sales, he said. Cutting Back Those planemakers have announced production cuts for some models that eventually will help stem supply in the market and reduce the drop in used-jet prices, said Shawn Vick, chairman of Global Jet Capital, which finances aircraft purchases and is backed by Blackstone Group, Franklin Square Capital Partners and the Carlyle Group. Although it will take time for the lower output to affect the market, Vick said he’s starting to see some pockets of “value stabilization.” “We’re clearly in an environment where there has been oversupply,” said Vick, whose company agreed last year to buy General Electric Co.’s corporate-jet-financing business and expects to underwrite $500 million of aircraft purchases this year. “It’s the right course of action.” Over the next five years, North America is expected to garner 65 percent of jet purchases, up from 61 percent in last year’s survey, while Europe’s share is set to remain unchanged at 14 percent, Honeywell said. Asia’s share will increase to as much as 6 percent from 4 percent and the Middle East will be less than 4 percent, falling short of its historical range of 4 percent to 7 percent. Latin America’s estimated share over the next five years will fall to 12 percent from 18 percent last year as sales cool in Mexico and Venezuela, Park said. Pent-up demand in Brazil will boost purchases in that country over the period, Park said. 2018 Rebound Worldwide business-jet deliveries will decline to 645 this year and to 625 next year before rebounding back to 645 in 2018, according to a report by Seth Seifman, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase & Co. Deliveries had increased in 2014 to 689 and remained the same last year. They hit an all-time high of 1,136 in 2008. Not everyone sees gloom in the private-jet market. Business for Directional Aviation, which owns the fractional operator Flexjet, is up about 15 percent from last year and profit will increase more than that. “People are flying,” said Kenn Ricci, principal of Directional. “Excuse me for not commiserating with my manufacturer friends, but that helps us because we get better deals on airplanes.” Flexjet increased its order for Bombardier Challenger 350s to 40 last year. A year earlier, the company agreed to purchase 50 Gulfstream jets manufactured by General Dynamics Corp., including a G650 that will be delivered this year. It also is taking deliveries of Legacy 450s made by Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA. In the end, it will take faster economic growth to rev up sales of new business jets. The need for flying privately increases when companies are growing quickly and executives must travel to multiple cities in a hurry, Vick said. “People are going to be very, very certain that marketplaces are there before they double-down and expand rapidly,” Vick said. “That’s the mode that everybody is in and I think it’s appropriate.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

By Jon C. Ogg October 30, 2016 4:00 pm EST Print Email Tweet When it comes to getting a mortgage, there have always been many options. Traditional banks have still dominated this scale, but it turns out that the so-called nonbanks are gaining traction in the fight for your mortgage. Some of this may have to do with less regulation after the financial crisis, some may also have to do with fees. A fresh report from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed that, in 2015, nonbanks accounted for 48% of all new mortgages in the United States. This is up from 45% in 2014. S&P sourced the newly released data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA. Again, there have always been many options outside of the banking sector. Still, should this raise any red flags? S&P showed that the last year nonbanks accounted for that much mortgage activity was in 2006. That was just a year before the subprime mortgage crisis began, and nonbanks accounted for 55% of mortgages that year. As a reminder, the waves of bankruptcies, delinquencies and foreclosures wiped out many of the nonbank subprime lenders. Then there was also the big bank bailout that came into play as well. One issue driving the nonbank dominance here is that the nation’s large banks are focusing their efforts on the jumbo or non-conforming loans. Details are shown in a table below, but here are some of the data by company shown in an SNL report that was sourced: LoanDepot.com moved up to the No. 7 mortgage originator from No. 9 in 2014, with roughly 32% of its mortgage originations come from FHA-insured loans or Veterans Administration-guaranteed loans. JPMorgan Chase regained its second place spot with barely any government loans, as FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed loans accounted for roughly 1% of its origination volume. Wells Fargo maintained its number-one position as roughly 10% of its loans come from the two programs. Despite heavy advertising, Quicken Loans was shown to be in third place in 2015 versus second place in 2014. The table from SNL below shows the market share rank, including the nonbank lenders. Again, Wells Fargo was number one and JPMorgan Chase was number two. Source: SNL.com I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Chernin and AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson met over dinner on Martha's Vineyard in early August as guests of Glenn Hutchins, a board member at the phone company and a top dealmaker with private equity firm Silver Lake, Stephenson said Sunday in an interview. Earlier, Chernin had met with Gary Ginsberg, an executive vice president of Time Warner and close associate of CEO Jeff Bewkes, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named discussing private conversations. "Chernin was the one who first got me to appreciate the library that this company owns," Stephenson said. "There's nothing like it. And that's when I got it in my mind that these two companies could work together." Already partners in an online media venture, Stephenson and Chernin, a former deputy to media mogul Rupert Murdoch, had discussed the changes sweeping their industries. The growth of online and mobile viewing was a huge threat to pay-TV operators, like AT&T's DirecTV. What Stephenson hadn't considered was the value that Time Warner, the owner of the Warner Bros. film studio and HBO, could provide as part of AT&T. "Peter Chernin knows movie studios," Stephenson said. Chernin couldn't be reached for comment. Courtship That August dinner sparked a two-month courtship that culminated with Dallas-based AT&T agreeing to buy Time Warner for about $107.50 a share in cash and stock. Including the New York-based media company's debt and cash, the purchase is valued at $108.7 billion, making it the biggest takeover announced in 2016. If the deal goes through, AT&T will own a prized cache of movies and TV shows it can deliver to millions of pay-TV homes, mobile phones and internet customers. Details of the whirlwind courtship were described by Stephenson and by other people involved in the talks who asked not to be identified. Within days, Bewkes, 64, was hosting Stephenson in a 10th floor dining room at Time Warner's headquarters, overlooking Central Park. Stephenson, 56, had known his counterpart at Time Warner for years. Following its $48 billion takeover of DirecTV in 2015, AT&T had become one of the entertainment giant's biggest customers as a distributor of Time Warner channels like TBS and TNT. Two years earlier, Bewkes had spurned a $75 billion buyout bid from Murdoch's 21st Century Fox. Over bites of salmon, Bewkes and Stephenson discussed the changes reshaping their businesses and by the third hour of their meeting they realised their companies' futures were becoming intertwined. For the Oklahoma-born Stephenson, the deal makes him not only the leader of an enormous telecom company but also an overnight media mogul with power over some of the most prized assets in entertainment and news, including CNN. For Bewkes, the sale is a vindication of his decision to reject Murdoch's overtures. News of the imminent deal, first reported on Oct. 20 by Bloomberg News, quickly made national headlines and became a talking point in the presidential race, with Hillary Clinton urging regulators to scrutinize the combination and Donald Trump suggesting he'd reject it if elected. Walt Disney, which competes against Time Warner, said in a statement that "a transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny." For a little over two months, the deal was a closely held secret shared at first by just eight people. At Time Warner, that consisted of Bewkes, Chief Financial Officer Howard Averill, General Counsel Paul Cappuccio, and Priya Dogra, the company's head of mergers and acquisitions. On the AT&T side, it was Stephenson, CFO John Stephens, along with AT&T's head of deals and the general counsel. The companies went to great lengths to keep the talks secret. Executives met in Washington and Nashville to avoid getting noticed in New York. AT&T referred to the deal by the code name, "Lily," after an AT&T ad campaign with a sales rep named Lily. Time Warner's choice was "Rabbit," a nod to the iconic Warner Bros. character Bugs Bunny. Soon, bankers at Allen & Co. and Perella Weinberg Partners got involved and were joined by JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, though only a limited number of people at each firm knew of the talks, according to people with knowledge of the matter. At Time Warner, people were surprised AT&T would attempt such a big deal so soon after digesting DirecTV, according to one person. They had considered that AT&T might make a bid for Time Warner in a year or two. Move quickly Stephenson believed Bewkes would sell if AT&T could make a high enough offer, the person said. In 2014, Time Warner had rejected Fox's $85-a-share bid as too low, saying the company could grow faster on its own. So AT&T made an offer it hoped couldn't be refused. The phone and pay-TV company's executives wanted to move quickly because they worried Alphabet’s Google or Apple could make a competing offer, according to another person. The negotiations moved quickly, Stephenson said on a conference call Saturday night, adding it had "a gravity to it." "The more we talked about it, the more it fell into place, that there would be benefits that might be significant and might allow us to evolve the ecosystem faster," Bewkes said. With an agreement in hand, executives at Time Warner have begun briefing their employees and extolling the virtues of the deal. Bewkes delivered a video message to employees and divisional executives are reaching out as well, including Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara. "To reiterate what Jeff said, this deal is not about cost savings," Tsujihara said in a memo. "It is about growth opportunities and our expertise in creating world-class content. AT&T recognises that the value of our brands and businesses depends upon the expertise of our team, and they are very committed to retaining the talented people who have made our company the best in the industry." Bloomberg's Jeffrey McCracken and Scott Moritz contributed. WASHINGTON POST| BLOOMBERG Hungry for more business news? Sign up for our daily newsletter!

The 5-year-old son of Birdstone   set a track record Oct. 29 on the final afternoon of the 17-day fall meet at Keeneland, winning the $200,000 Hagyard Fayette Stakes (gr. II) by 5 3/4 lengths and running 1 1/8 miles in 1:47.75. Watch Video The crowd of 19,093 on the 80-degree closing day pushed the season's total attendance to a fall-meet record of 276,543. Noble Bird, who came off a victory in the Oct. 1 Lukas Classic Stakes at Churchill Downs, won two stakes back-to-back for the first time in his 19-race career. Heavily favored, he took command along the rail early and led through fractions of :23.53, :46.70, 1:10.53 and a mile in 1:35.12. Second choice Divining Rod, winner of Keeneland's 2015 Coolmore Lexington (gr. III), took aim on the leader as the field rounded the final turn, but to no avail as Noble Bird strongly pulled away in the stretch. "I just left him alone," said Julien Leparoux, who picked up his 11th Keeneland meet title as leading jockey. "He ran his race and in the stretch I tried to encourage him. I knew we were going fast and when I asked him, he came on nice at the end. It was a good race. I didn't know (he set a track record), but when this horse is on his 'A' game and everything is good for him, he's a very nice horse for sure." Noble Bird's win capped a stellar meet for trainer Mark Casse and his team, led in Kentucky by son and assistant Norman Casse, as Team Casse took the Keeneland fall training title with 13 wins. Oxley also enjoyed a strong meet with five winners, three of them at the graded stakes level. Claiborne Breeders' Futurity (gr. I) winner Classic Empire and JPMorgan Chase Jessamine (gr. IIIT) victress La Coronel also race under Oxley's silks for Casse. Those horses are pre-entered in the Breeders' Cup World Championships Nov. 4-5 at Santa Anita Park. As for Noble Bird, he returns to Casse's Churchill base with an eye on the Nov. 25 Clark Handicap (gr. I). The speedy bay won the 2015 Stephen Foster Handicap (gr. I) there to secure his lone grade I victory to date. "I think we are figuring him out a little bit," Norman Casse said. "He's a horse that if there is a lot of speed in the race, he is a little bit more compromised. We have to pick races where he can take things on his own and that is what we did today. We were actually just trying to get him a race today and really point to the Clark." Bred in Kentucky by Jack Swain out of the Tiznow mare Anyhow, Noble Bird pushed his earnings to $1,064,945 from seven wins and four seconds. He returned $4, $2.80, and $2.40 at even money. Divining Rod paid $4.20 and $3.20, while Hawaakom rallied from last to be third, another 53/4 lengths back, and paid $4.40.  Mr. Z was fourth and was followed by Prayer for Relief, Iron Fist, Chocopologie, and Kasaqui.
