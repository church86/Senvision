ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search This MLP ETF Just Surged To Fresh 52-Week Highs January 27, 2017 11:16am NYSE:AMJ ShareTweet Investors looking for ETFs with rising momentum should begin to consider the JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMJ). This product just hit a new 52-week high of $33.93 today, and is now up 66.16% from its 52-week low price of $20.42 per share. Will this ETF continue its string of recent wins? Let’s take a closer look at the fund, its recent gains, the category it resides in, and its ratings and outlook to get a sense of whether its momentum is sustainable or not. Inside AMJ’s Rise As mentioned earlier, AMJ has now gained 66.16% from its 52-week low, which was hit back on February 11, 2016. The fund has now returned 6.79% over the past month, 12.33% over the past three months, and 8.89% in the past six months. Those returns compare quite favorably to the benchmark S&P 500 index’s 2.05%, 8.37%, and 6.62% returns in the same periods, respectively. AMJ currently sits above its 10-day, 20-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages (MAs), which from a technical standpoint suggests a very strong possibility that the recent gains can continue. That’s because the shares have no short-term overhead resistance to bump up against, which is to be expected for a product that’s at its yearly highs. A Look Under The Hood JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN is a Equity-focused product issued by JP Morgan Chase. Its expense ratio of 0.85% makes it the #10 cheapest ETF among 22 total funds in the MLP ETFs category. AMJ currently boasts $3.80B in assets under management (AUM), placing it #2 of 22 ETFs in its category, and #119 of 1922 total ETFs in the U.S. exchange traded universe. The investment objective of the JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN is to provide investors a way to gain exposure to midstream energy MLPs. The ETNs pay a variable quarterly coupon linked to the cash distributions paid on the MLPs in the index, less accrued tracking fees. With MLPs surging over the past year or so amid rising energy prices, it shouldn’t be surprising that AMJ is hitting new highs. Donald Trump’s promise to get a couple of controversial pipeline projects completed is helping as well. It’s also worth nothing that AMJ has a 6.5% yield, making it it highly attractive to yield-seeking investors amid a low interest rate environment. AMJ SMART Grade: More Gains Ahead? AMJ currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #2 of 22 funds in the MLP ETFs category. A SMART Grade of A suggests very strong future price growth potential, so it’s reasonable to expect even more gains ahead. Given the rebound in the energy markets and still-low interest rates, AMJ receives our highest approval.

  Markets Stocks Indices Commodities Currencies Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds News SIGN IN BUSINESS INSIDER       PORTFOLIO SEARCH Markets Stocks Indices Commodities Currencies Mutual Funds ETFs Bonds News CANCEL One of the most powerful women in finance on protectionism, China, Dow 20k, and 'Brexit on steroids' Tina Wadhwa Jan. 27, 2017, 08:20 AM Bessemer Trust Business Insider recently caught up with Rebecca Patterson, the chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, to hear about her outlook for the global economy in 2017. Bessemer Trust, a privately owned wealth and investment management firm, oversees more than $100 billion in assets. Patterson was the former Chief Markets Strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management and former  Global Head of Foreign Exchange and Commodities for the JPMorgan Private Bank. She started her career in journalism as a reporter for Dow Jones in London. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York Federal Reserve's Investor Advisory Committee and the Economic Club of New York. American Banker named her one of "The 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance" in 2014, 2015, and 2016. In the interview, Patterson discusses protectionism, China and where she sees value.  This is part one of a series. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Tina Wadhwa: The Dow finally hit the "landmark" number of 20k on Wednesday. Is this overrated, is this relevant? Does it actually mean anything for the markets or is it just a psychological high? Rebecca Patterson: The Dow reaching 20,000 is more psychological in my view than anything. What’s more important is what’s happening behind the scenes. Economic data in the U.S. and overseas that is generally improving, better earnings news from US companies, and growing hopes that policy will translate into even faster economic activity. Of those, I worry mainly about the policy. So much is being discounted into valuations now that it will be increasingly important that Congress and the White House show action quickly to back up the rhetoric. If legislation gets watered down or significantly delayed, or if policy focus turns more towards global trade restrictions, we could quickly see at least a short-term pullback in stocks. Business InsiderWadhwa: So this week marked President Trump’s first full week in office and he has embarked on some pretty protectionist measures. He pulled the US out of the TPP, and in a meeting with business leaders said he was going to impose a "very major border tax" on US companies that move overseas and export back into the US. There’s also his likely renegotiation of NAFTA. What is the impact of this and how do you think a more inward looking US will affect the global economy? Patterson: We’ve been saying since well before the election that how the US economy and how the financial markets would fare under Trump would depend in part on which Trump we got - a President Trump focused on deregulation, tax reform and infrastructure or a trade focused Trump. Our view has been and continues to be that if Trump focuses relatively more on trade and getting more introspective as a country or inward looking as a country, we see a lot less upside for equities. In fact we could see quite a bit more downside risk. Some of this I feel like is going to be a bit of a tango, we’ll take two steps forward, one step back. We may have a day where he has meetings and announcements on tax reforms and we’ll see equities rise and then we’ll have a day where he decides to have some aggressive rhetoric on trade and markets will consolidate ot sell-off. That’s largely the pattern we’ve been seeing since November 9th. I think at the end of the day, as easy as it is to focus on the hour by hour, as there is so much news focus on this right now, you need to take a more medium to long-term view. So base case at the end of 2017, where do you think you’re going to be? We think, even though it’s not going to be happen in the first 100 days, by the end of this year we are going to get some kind of corporate tax reform. That is our base case. We think Congress is making it a priority because they know if they don’t deliver it, the mid-term elections are going to be a lot more tough for them. People expect it, and they’re going to be very disappointed if it doesn’t happen. So we do think you’re going to get some kind of tax reform, corporate, as individual is a lot more difficult. We do think we’re going to get some deregulation, they announced Keystone. One could argue that’s less regulation around energy policy. So that’s all positive and we think that is, at the margin, going to be stimulative for the economy especially towards the end of the year and into 2018. And that will help support business confidence and hopefully actual business activity. Business InsiderThat said, we also do expect we are going to get some trade hits - the question to me is how aggressive is it and what actually happens. Trump had campaigned that he was going to have China called a currency manipulator on day one. And guess what, it didn’t happen. And I’m delighted it didn’t happen. To me, if that had happened, that would have been a major negative catalyst for global equity markets because a trade war with the second biggest economy in the world doesn’t end well. For anybody, including the United States. So I’m happy that didn’t happen. Yes he announced he’s renegotiating NAFTA, but what does that look like? If it ends up being very modest changes, and it’s more of a marketing win rather than a huge economic change, then that negative for the markets isn’t that great. And Mexico probably wants this clarified as soon as possible so they can move forward. I could see them giving something to Trump so he can go back to his base and to the country and say "hey I got you a better deal, and it’s done." And if Mexico can keep 85% or 90% of NAFTA benefits, and they can put this behind them and the peso is no longer in free fall, they’re happy too and so I think he can strike a deal there and probably get it done quite quickly. If he can do things like that and avoid the border adjustment tax or a major trade war with China, I think that negative risk around Trump is at a minimum. So that’s my hope. The problem is you just don’t know. When you look at the people he’s appointed to key positions on trade, like Navarro,  Leithauser, etc. they historically have been pretty tough on China, especially Navarro. I think in terms of financial markets this year, policy direction is going to be very important. It’s something we all are going to have to keep following and understanding. How it evolves is going to be a major factor in how cyclical assets perform. If there is relatively more progress on tax reform and deregulation, it’s better for equities. If the trade stuff ends up being more marketing than real, I think that’s good news. What worries me is if you have a big trade effort like the border adjustment tax which ends up being stagflationary and/or a major trade issue with China. Those would be the risks I’m watching for. Wadhwa: Markets as a whole have been rallying since Trump got elected, and there seems to be a lot of optimism for the economy right now. Do you agree with this reaction, or have we failed to price in the uncertainty you spoke about? Patterson: I think the initial reaction to Trump was a repositioning. The consensus view going into the election, for good reason as that’s what all the polls were suggesting, was that Hillary was going to win and so people had gone in expecting an economy that was sort of the same - modest growth, equities chugging along slowly. When we got a different outcome, a lot of investors went to reposition their portfolios as quickly as possible. So we saw this huge rotation. And then once that positioning was largely done, everyone was kind of sitting on their hands waiting what to do next. Business InsiderI think there is quite a bit of good news discounted in the market. Valuations are already high. Our view on equities is that we’re constructive but not euphoric. We’re neutral equities for a typical client versus our benchmark. So we’re not overweight stocks because we think the valuations are high. If Trump succeeds with tax reforms etc., then we probably also have higher wages, more inflation and the Fed tightens a little bit faster, and so we’re probably still looking at a recession during his term. At this point in the cycle, I would rather be neutral than overweight. And then within our positioning, focus on areas that should benefit if we do get the tax reform, but also think about what would we want to own if some of those risks play out. We’re aggressively overweight US stocks. We have a tilt towards more domestically oriented names, more cyclical names, we’re quite overweight the dollar, but we haven’t abandoned the non-Trump trades, if you will. We still have a healthy amount of consumer staples in our portfolio. We still have some managed volatility strategies in our portfolio. We still have a modest degree of select non-US exposure in our portfolio, and what’s been fascinating to me is that the non-US and the non-Trump trades have outperformed. And that gets me back to the year being a tango. We’ll take a step forward and a step back. I think that’s going to be the story of the year. It’s just going to be a see-saw back and forth within the sectors. Wadhwa: When you say non-US, are you looking towards Europe, Asia, the emerging markets? Where do you see value? Patterson: We’re so overweight the US that mathematically we have to be underweight everything else. I’d say where we feel more strongly about the underweight is the UK. We think as the Brexit negotiations get going in earnest, you’re likely to see Sterling fall further, even from current levels. The Current Account Deficit there is enormous as a percent of GDP, and they’re going to have a hard time attracting the capital flows to offset that. We also think that as Brexit negotiations get going and people see how difficult those are, business confidence in the UK is probably going to worsen. Business InsiderWith Europe, we’re less nervous. I want to love Europe. It’s killing me, not to love Europe. Because you’ve got a Central Bank that’s still easing, in contrast to the US, and you have much better equity valuations compared with the US. For the first time in a while we’re actually seeing some good economic momentum. So if you look at the business confidence surveys, consumer confidence surveys, bank lending, all these things are saying, okay you’ve got some positive momentum that could help corporate earnings here, which is great. With all of that, I should be buying this and not the US, but then you get to the election calendar, and you’re stopped dead in your tracks. Because the French election in April and May, it’s Brexit on steroids. Le Pen is highly unlikely to win the election, but now we’ve seen time after time after time polls can be wrong. She’s campaigned on exiting the euro currency block, and that to us is a much bigger deal than Brexit because it would throw into question the credibility of the entire single currency for Europe. So it’s a big enough risk that despite a lot of positives for continental European equities, we’re going to stay underweight. We have some exposure, but pretty minimal, and then we’ll see how that election story plays out. We might be late into it, but if she doesn’t win and you get someone a bit more centrist in that seat in May, you could have a really nice second half of the year for Europe, all else equal. So that’s an area we’re keeping a close eye on. In Japan, the weakening yen with the strengthening dollar, all else equal, is good for Japanese stocks. Japan is very sensitive to US growth, so if the US is doing better, that tends to be good for Japan. Again we’re keeping a close eye on all of these trade talks, because if he doesn’t like weak currencies helping foreign economies - I see Japan in the crosshairs a little bit. So again underweight there but not as a strong a view as the UK. With emerging markets, we’re just looking for selective companies which we think are less sensitive to possible trade situations under the Trump administration. China is the one we care most about. Mexico needs America. 25% of their GDP comes from exports to America, so they don’t have a choice. If Trump wants to deal, they have to deal. China is not nearly as reliant on exports to America as Mexico is. So if we go after China, I don’t think they are just going to sit there and take it. They’re going to retaliate in some fashion. They could threaten to lighten the amount of US Treasuries they hold or they could devalue their currency to offset any tariffs we place on them. They could also retaliate in a more indirect way. It could be militarily in the South China Sea by taking a greater stand there for example. There’s lots of things they can do. I think it was fascinating to see President Xi at Davos talking about how China is open for business. He sees an opportunity for China to strengthen its global footprint and its leadership role in the world. We’ll see how successful he is, but certainly with the trade agreement they’re working, ARCEP, he could end up benefitting greatly from this opportunity. But do we buy Chinese stocks? If we wake up and there’s a tweet about a Chinese manipulator or a Chinese tariff, the short term reaction is going to be China equities lower and greater expectations for a weaker renminbi. Then you’ll see the spillover effects to any country that has trade relations with China. That will include Asia but also a lot of the commodity exporters like Chile. It will have a global impact. The risk is great enough that even though there’s some interesting things going on with Asia right now, we’re just keeping our exposure modest and the security selection very selective.   SHARE THIS POST Gainers & LosersMore Dow Jones S&P 500 NASDAQ 100 Microsoft Rg 65.78 2.35 % Caterpillar Rg 98.99 1.82 % Johnson & Johnso Rg 113.38 1.38 % Goldman Sachs Gr Rg 236.95 -1.10 % Wal-Mart Stores Rg 65.66 -1.60 % Chevron 113.79 -2.37 % your MARKET VIEW Your Personalized Market Center Find News GO Home / News / Stock News / One of the most powerful women in banking on protectionism, China, Dow 20k, and 'Brexit on steroids' Follow us Need help?

Photo Credit: John Cumming/Getty Images The best rewards credit cards boast attractive cash back percentages, travel rewards, appealing sign-up bonuses and simple redemption models. Rewards credit cards can be divided into two general categories: travel and cash back cards. Some rewards cards offer a combo of those and points instead of straight cash back. The card that's best for you depends on your lifestyle and personal financial goals. Travel rewards cards typically offer perks and bonuses for spending on items such as airline purchases, dining, restaurants and hotels. CARD SEARCH: Compare the top rewards credit cards. <!-- iframe --> Cash back cards generally offer a percentage back for daily spending, cash back on specific categories and bonus cash for spending a specific amount within a certain time frame. CreditCards.com recently rounded up some of the best credit cards from its partners, including the best rewards credit cards. Here are the some of the best rewards credit cards, according to CreditCards.com: The best rewards credit cards Credit Card Variable APR Category Chase Freedom Unlimited 15.49 percent to 24.24 percent variable Top all-around rewards card Citi® Double Cash Credit Card 13.49 percent to 23.49 percent variable Top no annual fee rewards card Blue Cash Preferred® Card 13.49 percent to 23.49 percent variable Top cash-back rewards card Chase Sapphire Reserve 16.49 percent to 23.49 percent variable Top travel and airline rewards card Chase Sapphire Preferred® 16.49 percent to 23.49 percent variable Top points rewards card 1. Top all-around rewards credit card: Chase Freedom Unlimited CreditCards.com rated the Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card as one of the best for all-around rewards. Highlights: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card pays 1.5 percent cash back on every purchase. Chase Freedom Unlimited cardholders earn a solid $150 bonus statement credit for spending $500 purchases within the first 3 months of opening an account. This card allows you to redeem rewards for cash in any amount at any time. Those cash back rewards don't expire as long as the account is open. Chase Ultimate Rewards® points, worth 1 cent, can be transferred to other Chase cards that earn Chase Ultimate Rewards® points. Points can be redeemed for gift cards and trips booked through Chase. Fees and APR: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card has no annual fee. This card offers a 0 percent intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers. After the initial introductory period, the Chase Freedom Unlimited card offers a variable APR of 15.49 percent to 24.24 percent. There's a balance transfer fee of 5 percent of the amount transferred with a $5 minimum on the Chase Freedom Unlimited Card. Who should get this card: The Chase Freedom Unlimited is ideal for the consumer who wants a straightforward card for everyday purchases. Anyone looking for a wide range of redemption options will enjoy this card's versatility. The Chase Freedom Unlimited is especially useful for those who already hold other high-end Chase cards – like the Chase Sapphire Preferred or the Ink Plus Business Card -- since Chase Ultimate Rewards® can be transferred to other Chase cards. Disadvantages: While the Chase Freedom Unlimited has its perks – like unlimited rewards points – it has its limitations as well. Its cash-back rewards are middle of the road. The Chase Freedom Unlimited card's rate on cash back is good, but it's not the highest flat-rate available. The Citi® Double Dash Card offers 1 percent cash back on every dollar spent plus an additional 1 percent on every dollar that's paid off. There are no bonus categories. Perhaps the biggest downside to the Chase Freedom Unlimited is that it doesn't offer bonus categories. Those who spend frequently in one area may find that a card with bonus categories offers more value. Bottom line: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card is a solid all around choice as a flat-rate card for rewards on everyday spending. It might be best utilized alongside another Chase card or bonus category card that offers higher percentages on spending in specific categories.   2. Top no annual fee rewards card: Citi® Double Cash Credit Card The Citi® Double Cash Credit Card recently took first place in CreditCard.com's cash back credit card competition for its industry-leading cash back on everyday purchases. But it also made the site's rewards card list as the top no annual fee credit card. It has a simple rewards structure with no categories to track, no caps on cash back and no annual fee. Highlights: The opportunity to earn generous rewards using the Citi® Double Cash credit card is what makes it stand out from the crowd. It offers 1 percent cash back on general purchases and an additional 1 percent when you pay your bill on time. There's no limit on what you can earn in cash back with this card. You can start redeeming for as little as $25. Redemption options include a statement credit, a gift card or a check. As a perk for some, the Citi® Double Cash credit card has no rotating categories requiring cardholders to remember to opt in and score rewards. The Citi® Double Cash card has no annual fee, making it cheaper than some competing cards, such as the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express. Not only does the Citi® Double Cash offer generous cash back rewards, it has perks including purchase protection and trip cancellation protection. Citi® Double Cash cardholders can benefit from the Citi Price Rewind program. The company will automatically search for lower prices on items registered online and refund the difference on better deals. Fees and APR: There's no annual fee with the Citi® Double Cash credit card. This card comes with a 0 percent APR on balance transfers for 18 months. That makes it a good option for those interested in consolidating and paying down debt. This card comes with a variable APR between 13.49 percent to 23.49 percent. Who should get this card: The Citi® Double Cash credit card is best for those who would like a flat-rate, everyday cash back card with no limits on rewards and an easy-to-use rewards structure. Those looking for simplicity in a card will also find this card ideal. There's no chasing bonus categories, no rotating categories and no annual fee. Disadvantages: The opportunity to earn cash back twice and the simplicity of this card make it a very attractive option, but there are some drawbacks. Carrying a balance can eat up rewards with this card. Interest charges can add up quick on this card's 13.49 percent to 23.49 percent variable APR. You have to pay on time. In order to earn cash back twice, the card requires you to pay your bill on time each month. If you typically carry a balance, or often fail to pay on time, this may not be the card for you. There's no sign-up bonus. Sign-up bonuses are something you'll find on many competing cards, but not on the Citi® Double Cash. There are no bonus categories. This card certainly has a high rewards rate, but there's no opportunity to earn more for spending in certain categories. If you frequently spend big on a particular category – like groceries – you may want to consider another card. Bottom line: The Citi® Double Cash credit card is a great option for straight cash back rewards. It doesn't offer bonus categories, but it's a great go-to card for earning rewards on daily purchases. Consider using this card alongside another card that offers more for where you spend the most.   Compare Rewards Credit Cards 3. Top cash back card: Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express tied for second place with the Chase Freedom Unlimited card in CreditCard.com's recent cash back card competition. Highlights: The Blue Cash Preferred® is a top-notch card for high rewards rates on categories. It offers 6 percent cash back at U.S. supermarkets up to $6,000 per year. It also offers 3 percent cash back at U.S. gas stations and select department stores. On general purchases, this card pays 1 percent. For the 1st 6 months, the Blue Cash Preferred® card offers 5 percent cash back on eligible travel purchases up to $200. The Blue Cash Preferred® offers a $150 statement credit after spending $1,000 within the 1st 3 months of opening an account. Other perks with the Blue Cash Preferred® include a cash back tracker, purchase protection, return protection and roadside assistance. Fees: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card has a variable APR between 13.49 percent and 23.49 percent, comparable to the other cards on this list. This card has a $95 annual fee, which is on the high side. But the generous rewards program, when used properly, can offset that fee. Who should get this card: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card is best for those who spend big on groceries, gas and department stores. Those who already have a card for everyday spending might find this card as a nice supplement. Pair this card with an everyday flat-rate card to get more for your money where you spend the most. The zero percent APR on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months make the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card a good option for anyone interested in financing a big purchase or consolidating and paying down debt. Disadvantages: The outstanding rewards on categories make the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card from American Express an attractive option, but it's not without its limitations. It has a spending cap. The $6,000 annual spending cap on groceries means the most you could earn is $360 at 6 percent before the relatively low 1 percent rate kicks in. It's not as widely accepted. American Express isn't as widely used as Visa, MasterCard and Discover. That might make it necessary to keep a backup card, or to use this card strategically with others. The $95 annual fee is higher than other cash-back cards. You'll need to make sure you spend often in this card's bonus categories to get the most value. Bottom line: The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express can be used as an everyday card, but it really shines as a bonus category card. It might best be used alongside a card like the Citi® Double Cash or Chase Freedom Unlimited.   CARD SEARCH: Compare the top rewards credit cards. 4. Top travel and airline credit card: Chase Sapphire Reserve The Chase Sapphire Reserve cards earns high ratings on CreditCards.com's best rewards card list for its travel and airline rewards. It offers generous bonus points, an annual travel credit and a top-notch rewards system. Highlights: The Chase Sapphire Reserve offers 3x Chase Ultimate Rewards® points per dollar spent on travel and dining at restaurants worldwide. It offers 1x points per dollar spent on other purchases. Chase Sapphire Reserve cardholders can receive up to $300 in statement credits annually as a reimbursement for travel purchases on things like airfare and hotels charged to the card. Points can be redeemed for 1.5 cents per point through Chase Ultimate Rewards®. This card offers access to more than 900 airport lounges worldwide with complimentary Priority Pass Select membership. Cardholders can get up to a $100 application fee credit for Global Entry or TSA Pre√®. As another perk, there are no blackout dates or travel restrictions with this card. If there's a seat on the flight, it can be booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards. Cardholders can transfer points to one of Chase's partner airline or hotel loyalty programs at a 1:1 rate. Fees: The Chase Sapphire Reserve card has an annual fee of $450, similar to other cards in its class like the Citi Prestige® Card. This card comes with a variable APR between 16.49% and 23.49%. Who should get this card: The Chase Sapphire Reserve card is best for the avid traveler who spends big on travel and dining and is fine with redeeming rewards through Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. Disadvantages: The Chase Sapphire Reserve offers big rewards to the frequent traveler, but it's not without its downsides. The card's hefty $450 annual fee can certainly eat into rewards if you're not spending heavily on travel and dining related expenses. You'll get the most benefit from this card by redeeming through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. If it's not a program you're fond of, it might be best to find another card. The bottom line Overall, the Chase Sapphire Reserve card is a solid choice for the frequent traveler. Its points program and bonus can more than make up for the somewhat hefty $450 annual fee. But you'll need to spend big in order to enjoy the benefits of this card.   5. Top points rewards credit card: Chase Sapphire Preferred® card Generous points, a stellar sign-up bonus and a low annual fee put the Chase Sapphire Preferred® card on the map as the best points rewards card. Highlights: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® offers cardholders two points per dollar on travel and restaurants worldwide. All other purchases on this card earn one point per dollar. Cardholders can earn 50,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 within the first 3 months of opening the account. Notably, that's $625 toward travel when redeemed through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. For adding an authorized user within the first 3 months of opening an account, this card offers $5,000 bonus points. Cardholders can transfer points to one of Chase's partner airline or hotel loyalty programs at a 1:1 rate. There are no blackout dates or travel restrictions with this card. If there's a seat on the flight, it can be booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards®. Fees: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® credit card has no introductory fee for the first year. After that, the fee is $95 per year, or $355 less than the Chase Sapphire Reserve card. This card has a variable APR from 16.49% to 23.49%. There are no foreign transaction fees with this card. Who should get this card: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® card is ideal for someone interested in an everyday, low-fee travel card with an outstanding sign-up bonus. Frequent travelers who are comfortable using the Chase Unlimited Rewards will find this card even more useful. When redeemed through the program, points are worth 25 percent more. Disadvantages: The generous points and sign-up bonus make the Chase Sapphire Preferred® a go-to for the frequent traveler, but it has a few disadvantages. Those who don't spend enough to earn the sign-up bonus or pay for the annual fee won't benefit much from this card. Travel options are somewhat limited with this card. You'll need to fly on one of Chase's travel partners – like United, Virgin Atlantic or Southwest – to get the most out of it. The bottom line: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® credit card is a great choice if you spend big on travel and dining at restaurants. It's also a good option if you typically use Chase's travel partners. But if you're not a big spender and need more flexible traveling options, it's wise to choose a different card.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon By Dan Freed Citigroup Inc (C.N) has quietly launched a website to make small business loans of up to $1 million, the latest effort by a big bank to make the process of smaller loans more technology-friendly. Citigroup's online toe in the water comes after similar moves by several other banks. For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) announced a partnership with online lender On Deck Capital Inc (ONDK.N) in December 2015 and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) launched a fast-decision online small business loan product some eight months ago. Banks have been cautious about entering the online lending space despite the proliferation of online non-bank lenders such as On Deck, LendingClub Corp (LC.N) Prosper Marketplace and other startups. Early optimism about prospects for such companies soured after LendingClub's CEO resigned over a loan-selling scandal. Citigroup's website is run by Biz2Credit, a New York-based startup. Borrowers visiting the Citigroup website are directed to a separate website run by Biz2Credit where they fill out an online worksheet before following up with a Citigroup small business banker. Biz2Credit CEO Rohit Arora said being online makes it easier for Citigroup to fulfill its obligations to small and underserved borrowers under the Community Reinvestment Act because it allows access for customers who live far from a branch. Citigroup and Biz2Credit chose not to publicize the effort because it is still in very early stages, Arora said. "If you make a premature announcement the expectations go very high and then you're in the public eye all the time," he said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment. Separately, a small business lending website backed by Citigroup and the U.S. Treasury Department and run by Biz2Credit will shut down. Launched in May 2015, DCSmallBizLoans.com was intended to bring online lending technology to small businesses in underserved Washington D.C. communities. The website matched up small businesses with four Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), government-backed lenders that serve low-income communities. Citigroup had agreed to fund the website for two years, after which it was expected to become self-sustaining, said Steve Glaude, president and chief executive officer of the Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development, a non-profit that organized the effort. Though it would only have cost each CDFI about $1,000 per month to keep the site operating, there was not enough interest to warrant even so small an investment, according to Glaude. "In some ways I think we were ahead of our time," he said.

Dimon was seen leaving the West Wing by reporters Friday afternoon. He told the press that he had been meeting with Gary Cohn, who had just become head of President Trump’s National Economic Council after leaving Goldman Sachs, where he had been the firm’s president. Dimon did not detail the topic of their conversation, but the two men have a history together at the top of Wall Street’s food chain. And both men are also expanding their Washington footprint in a significant way following Trump’s election. ADVERTISEMENT Dimon’s named had previously been floated as a possible Treasury secretary for Trump. However, that never moved past the speculation phase, as both sides eventually professed no interest in the arrangement. In December, Dimon was also named the head of the Business Roundtable, a Washington association that represents some of the biggest businesses in the country. For his part, Dimon has typically identified himself as a Democrat but has also been a fierce critic of the party on economic policy, particularly when it comes to regulations on the financial sector.   View the discussion thread.

According to market research firm Euromonitor International, Vita Coco holds a 26 percent share of the $2.5 billion global coconut water market. Sold in 30 countries, Vita Coco saw a 19 percent increase in sales last year. In response to an emailed inquiry from BevNET, Arthur Gallego, Vita Coco’s director of corporate communications, stated “the Reuters article is speculative, and Vita Coco has no further comment past that,” Both Vita Coco and JP Morgan declined Reuters’ request for comment on the possible sale. In 2007, private investment company Verlinvest acquired a stake in Vita Coco and in 2014, Vita Coco sold a 25 percent stake to the owner of Red Bull China. Verlinvest also has stakes in Le Blon cachaca and Oatly. It was an early Glaceau investor, which sold to Coca-Cola in 2007 for $4.1 billion. The news comes nearly five months after Reuters first reported on a possible sale of enhanced water brand Bai. Approximately five months after the report, Dr Pepper Snapple Group announced that it would acquire Bai for $1.7 billion. Bai’s early investors included Ken Sadowsky and Rohan Oza, both of whom hold stakes in Vita Coco.

JPMorgan Chase & Co., the world’s biggest investment bank by revenue, boosted its 2016 bonus pool for traders dealing in government bonds, swaps and other assets tied to interest rates by about 20 percent, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing compensation. At Morgan Stanley, the bonus pool for rates traders climbed more than 10 percent, and at Bank of America Corp. the average bonus for those employees increased more than 10 percent, other people said.

Rates trading in particular fueled the 15 percent increase in fixed-income revenue at the five biggest Wall Street banks. The boost came late in the year, when the U.S. election roiled expectations for interest rates and economic growth. Rates traders outperformed most of their peers in fixed income. For instance, at JPMorgan the bonus pool for credit traders rose by 10 percent, the people said. Employees were told of their compensation this month and receive the awards in February. Not all banks took part in the rates-trading party. UBS Group AG incurred losses in its macro business, which typically includes rates and currencies trading, after being caught wrong-foot following President Donald Trump’s surprise victory in November. The broader rebound in fixed-income revenue may continue in 2017. Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said this month that momentum from a strong fourth quarter is continuing at the start of the year as clients reposition portfolios and put cash to work.

Beauty & Style Weddings Fashion Hair & Makeup Shopping Auto VideoBytes In the Know Print Chase, Mint reach deal for faster, more secure data-sharing Posted: Wednesday, January 25, 2017 11:31 AM EST Updated: Wednesday, January 25, 2017 2:11 PM EST By KEN SWEET AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) - Bank customers who use Chase but also want to take advantage of financial tools like Mint or TurboTax will soon be able to send their data faster and more securely between the two companies. JPMorgan Chase reached an accord Wednesday to settle its longstanding dispute with Intuit, which owns Mint, in a blueprint that could allow other big banks to end their disagreements with financial data companies. The deal had no financial component. Chase and Intuit have agreed to develop software that will let Chase customers directly send their data to Mint for budgeting and financial tracking purposes, without Intuit having to hold onto that person's name and password through third-party software, which is how it had often been structured. Intuit also agreed to never to sell Chase customer data. Mint and other popular personal finance websites pull customers' financial data from all their various banks, brokerages and credit card companies to create a fuller picture of a person's financial life. That allows customers to more actively budget, or even create short-term and long-term financial goals. While convenient, the way these services worked had several flaws. The companies would store, either directly or through a third party, the bank customers' login information - which could expose crucial personal information to identity thieves or other criminals. The data also would be gathered by actively logging into a bank's online service, which put a strain on the bank's servers. The data the companies would gather would happen whether or not the customer was actively using the service, so a Mint account someone hadn't touched in months could still be actively gathering data on that Chase customer. JPMorgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon had been a particularly vocal critic of these services. In his annual shareholder letter, Dimon said he was "extremely concerned" about how much data they were gathering. "When we all readily click 'I agree' online or on our mobile devices ... it is fairly clear that most of us have no idea what we are agreeing to or how that information might be used by a third party," Dimon said. The Chase-Intuit agreement could set a standard for other banks to reach accords with Mint and other personal finance sites. Companies like Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo had expressed similar reservations about these services and concern that their customers' data might be at risk. An Intuit spokesman also said this announcement could act as a framework for other deals. A Chase spokeswoman said it plans to roll out the upgrade in the coming months. The upgrade will go first to existing Chase customers who are signing up for Mint for the first time, followed by existing Mint customers. _____ Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

Live updates Sort posts by Newest Oldest 5:04pm on 27 Jan 2017 That's all for this week - thanks for reading this blog and posting your comments. We'll be back Monday from around 9am. Have a good weekend. 4:42pm on 27 Jan 2017 Shares have ended the first week of the Trump administration higher, as investors looked past the new President's protectionist rhetoric to focus on pro-growth initiatives such as tax and regulation cuts as well as the approval of a controversial pipeline project. The business-friendly moves lit a fire under stocks on Wall Street, pushing the Dow Jones index above 20,000 points. The local ASX 200 was buoyed by the rally and ended 0.75 per cent higher for the day at 5714, up 1.05 per cent for the week. While the materials sector was the big winner of the week, rising 2.6 per cent as commodity prices continued to advance, on Friday mining stocks took a breather. BHP was the biggest drag on the index, falling 1.3 per cent, but gold miners were the real losers of the week as the precious metal retreated back below the $US1200 mark. Newcrest slid 2.7 per cent, Evolution Mining fell 2.7 per cent and Northern Star Resources dropped 5.1 per cent. It was the other way around for financials, which had an average week, nudging up just 0.1 per cent, but a strong Friday session, led by the big banks. Westpac gained 1.8 per cent, CBA was up 0.9 per cnt, NAB added 1.4 per cent and ANZ rose 1 per cent. Fairmont Equities managing director Michael Gable said some traders had feared the markets would end their bull run after Donald Trump's inauguration. "The fact that they've done the opposite and made new high s has given our market a short-term boost," he said.  "But I think that will start to evaporate over the next week as we start to concentrate on our local reporting season. As we saw with the Brambles profit warning a few days ago we need to be a little cautious holding stocks at elevated levels coming into reporting season. "The last couple of weeks on the market have mostly been built on all these external factors - Trump and the US market - but we will need to start focusing more domestically. Reporting season is often a minefield of disappointments and misses, and we're starting to see that already."  The week's biggest winners and losers.  4:02pm on 27 Jan 2017 Farewell the Monkey, hail the Rooster. Lunar New Year is tomorrow and that should bring us a good year for markets, at least if past performance is any indicator. Rooster years have historically been good for stocks, but volatile, says CMC which has crunched the numbers. "The long-term average returns for Rooster years have generally been very positive with stock markets around the world gaining well in excess of 10 per cent in Rooster years, way above their 8 per cent long-term average return," chief market strategist Colin Cieszynski says. That being said, a more in-depth analysis shows that Rooster years can really go either way, he adds. The local sharemarket had its best Rooster year in 1994, when it soared more than 50 per cent, while in 1982 it slumped 16.5 per cent. Overall, it adds up to a tidy 13.7 per cent average return, according to CMC. 3:53pm on 27 Jan 2017 High-flying Domino's Pizza Enterprises insists a recent fall in its share price is not connected to the introduction of a 10 per cent surcharge on orders placed on Sunday. Domino's is one of the ASX's most expensive stocks but it has dipped on concerns the surcharge, introduced on January 8, will slow demand among its price-sensitive customers. Domino's introduced the surcharge in early January to help pay for a 25 per cent loading for drivers and store staff working on Sundays. These workers had missed out on penalty rates thanks to an old deal with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA). The deal, struck in 2009 and but expiring in 2013, left staff with overall pay rates well below the current legal minimum. Domino's is now negotiating a new deal with the SDA, and is still waiting on a separate ruling from the industrial watchdog on weekend penalty rates. Domino's increased pay for workers in August, meaning adult drivers were paid $21.18 an hour plus $2.27 per delivery (with average deliveries of between three and five an hour), and an adult instore is paid $24.53 an hour. Domino's did not answer whether it would increase pay again this month, as flagged by its chief executive in September. The sharemarket darling attracted scrutiny in July when investment bank Deutsche Bank suggested Domino's workers were missing out on penalty rates worth at least $32 million.  "We believe penalty rates will need to be paid at some point, which could have a significant impact on [Domino's] profitability," retail analyst Michael Simotas said, tipping pay rises would slash the Domino's profit by nearly 25 per cent. "It pays a lower base than competitors and doesn't pay the weekend penalty rates stipulated in the award." Domino's told the market on Friday that it had seen "no evidence to support comments from unnamed analysts in the press in relation to a link between share price and the recent introduction of a Sunday surcharge." Shares are up 0.7 per cent at $61.04 today, but have dropped nearly 6 per cent over the week. Here's more Not whetting investor appetite this week. Photo: Glenn Hunt 3:27pm on 27 Jan 2017 Paladin Energy has surged nearly 40 per cent to 13.5 cents in heavy trading but the uranium miner says it's as baffled as anyone about the jump. The company said there is no pending announcement and it's not aware if any of its earlier announcements may have caused the trading uptick. It added that uranium market conditions continue to improve. The uranium spot price hovered around $US24 per pound, up about 7 per cent from last week's levels and 39 per cent higher than its recent low in mid-December.Back to top 3:01pm on 27 Jan 2017 Gold is stuck near two-week lows hit in the previous session as the US dollar regains ground, with selling ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays adding pressure and leaving the metal on track to record its first weekly loss since late December. Spot gold prices are down 0.4 per cent at $US1184 per ounce, their lowest since January 11. "A combination of things including a strong US dollar, thin volumes ahead of the Chinese New Year and weak longs is putting pressure on the market," said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. "Most of Asia is already off for the holidays, which is a good time for many to short the metal ... You can see the bids are very weak, which shows the demand right now," he said. The week-long holiday that many in Asia take for the Lunar New Year is likely to keep the markets quiet, traders said. The US dollar edged up on Friday, rebounding from a seven-week low on optimism over the US economic outlook and corporate earnings, although US President Donald Trump's protectionist policies raised uncertainties for global trade. "The government will publish its first estimate of fourth-quarter GDP on Friday, expected to come in around 2.2 per cent," said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir. "We suspect the number will likely be stronger, leading to a stronger dollar and exerting more pressure on gold before Trump possibly comes to the rescue with another market surprise." The slide in gold prices has put the stocks of local gold miners under pressure, with the All Ordinaries gold index down 4.4 per cent, its biggest slide in more than a month. Gold miners are under pressure today. Photo: Ryan Stuart 2:09pm on 27 Jan 2017 Here's a recap of today's session: banks are leading gains on the stock market, while miners have been dragged down by lower base metal and gold prices. With the market closed for Australia Day yesterday, investors are playing catch-up after the Dow Jones topped 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday, putting the ASX on track to rise 1 per cent for the week. "We are catching up with that respectable rally of Wall Street," said Paterson Securities economist Tony Farnham. The big four banks have given back some of their early strong gains but are still up by around 1 per cent, with NAB and Westpac leading the charge, up 1.6  and 1.7 per cent respectively. Local banks have rallied since Donald Trump's election victory, with investors betting fiscal stimulus and deregulation will trigger inflation and stoke a rise in interest rates. "Combination of local investors less nervous about the outlook for banks... and offshore interests from a currency perspective who have to find some way to invest those funds is pushing up local financials," Farnham said. Gold stocks lost as much as 6.0 per cent to hit their lowest since January 5, as a strengthening US dollar and improving appetite for risk assets dragged it to a two-week low. Newcrest Mining, Northern Star Resources and Evolution Mining are among the worst performers. Miners are also suffering from declines in most base metal prices, especially copper. BHP Billiton has shed 1.3 per cent, but Rio is up 1 per cent. "People are worried about what is happening with global trade, particularly with Mexico, and what could potentially happen to China," said Mathan Somasundaram, market portfolio strategist at Blue Ocean Equities. The White House on Thursday floated the idea of a border tax on goods from Mexico to pay for a wall on the US border, deepening tensions between the neighbours. 1:51pm on 27 Jan 2017 Today's export/import price data means Australia's terms of trade spiked 12.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, the largest quarterly rise since 2010 - but that's about as good as it will get, says JPMorgan. The pop higher in export prices (+12.4 per cent) was broadly expected and came on the back of the striking rally in iron ore and coal prices from mid-2016, economist Tom Kennedy said. "The surprise relative to our forecast was on the import side (+0.2%), where the strength in petroleum import prices was largely offset by broad-based weakness in the remaining sub-components." Kennedy expects Australia's terms of trade to move lower in coming quarters as prices for key export commodities normalise. Hard coking coal spot prices are already more than 40 per cent below last quarter's peak and will be a drag on aggregate price growth in the first quarter of 2017. JPMorgan commodity analysts expect iron ore spot prices to decline in coming months as more supply comes on line. On the other side of the ledger, Brent crude prices so far in January are tracking above the 4Q average, and will likely buoy import prices in 1Q. "Given these dynamics, our base case is for Australia's ToT to move lower from early 2017," Kennedy says. But before then it's worth adding that the terms of trade - through the commodities bonanza - is delivering the biggest boost to national income in 6-1/2 years. "If export prices are outpacing the price of imports, this indicates a broad-based lift to incomes in Australia. The lift in export prices – especially iron ore and coal – also serve to benefit the bottom line of the government accounts," says CommSec . 1:43pm on 27 Jan 2017 Get ready for an inflation surge, the AFR's Chris Joye writes: It is curious to think that we do not know with certainty the current state of economic affairs, let alone that which might materialise 12 or 24 months hence. The RBA was slashing rates last year because it was worried that Australia's weak inflation pulse would pull down consumer expectations for future price growth that could make achieving its official 2 per cent to 3 per cent inflation target hard. And yet the latest ANZ/Roy Morgan survey reports that consumer inflation expectations hit a five-year peak of 4.8 per cent in January, miles above the top of the RBA's target band. The Melbourne Institute's measure likewise jumped to 4.3 per cent in January, its loftiest level since 2012. Commsec's Savanth Sebastian says that "inflation expectations have now held above 4 per cent for the past six months", opining that "there is no doubt that inflationary pressures have bottomed out and are starting to lift". HSBC's Paul Bloxham and Goldman Sachs' Tim Toohey agree. Both argued that the December quarter inflation data published this week implied that price pressures had "troughed" with domestically produced, or "non-tradeables", inflation accelerating from 1.6 per cent over the year to June to 2.1 per cent in December. "The platform is now set for inflation to surprise RBA forecasts to the upside through 2017," Toohey surmised. Here's more 1:05pm on 27 Jan 2017 Some of hedge fund billionaire George Soros's short positions dating back to 2012 were published on the Dutch financial market regulator's website this week due to "human error", according to the regulator AFM. The short positions, bets on a stock declining, were "between 0.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent," of shares outstanding in the companies shorted, AFM spokesman Ward Snijders said. The Dutch regulator publishes shorts of 0.5 per cent or higher on its website on a daily basis. The smaller amounts were posted by mistake, he said. The Financial Times earlier reported that some of the positions, including bets against Dutch banks, including ING Groep, appeared briefly on the website on Tuesday evening. ING declined to comment on Thursday. Soros, whose fortune is estimated at $US25.2 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, is in the same league as Warren Buffett when it comes to investors copying their trades as they try to ride the coattails of the super successful. Short positions, which are typically closely guarded, in Deutsche Bank jumped when it was revealed in June that Soros had bet that the stock would fall after the UK voted to leave the European Union. The German bank fell 14 per cent on the first day after the ballot. The 86-year-old investor lost about $US1 billion by betting against the market after the election of US President Donald Trump, according to the Wall Street Journal this month. The hiring of a chief investment officer may reduce Soros's role, the paper reported. Luckily, Soros exited many of his bearish bets late last year, avoiding further losses. Photo: Simon Dawson Back to top 12:21pm on 27 Jan 2017 Google parent Alphabet has posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates, hurt by a higher tax rate, but analysts cheered the company's progress in diversifying its business beyond advertising. While advertising still accounts for the lion's share of Google's revenue, rising 17.4 per cent to $US22.4 billion in the quarter, Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is broadening its business - pointing to growth in hardware, app sales and the cloud business. The company's other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62 per cent to $3.4 billion. The results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares down 2.2 per cent to $US838 in extended trade after closing at $US856.98 on Nasdaq. Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 per cent, compared to 19 per cent for the year overall, contributing to the dent in profitability. "If you look above that, it's business as usual," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "There has been no margin compression in the actual business." Eventually, investors' worst fears about Google may come true. Just not yet, says Bloomberg's Shira Ovide: "Essentially the world's second-most valuable company is a one-trick pony - although it is perhaps the best pony ever created. And if the pony ever goes lame, so does Google. "The horror story about Google's end days plays out something like this: As more people surf smartphones and not computers, they won't need to search on Google for a new winter coat, a hotel room in Hawaii or the winner of the 1984 Super Bowl. They'll simply go directly to Amazon, Expedia or ask Siri for the answer. If the zeal to Google things slowly ebbs, that will allow Facebook and others to chip away at Google's commanding share of the $US200 billion global market for online advertisements. "Despite the earnings miss, it's tough to find evidence that the pony is anywhere close to be putting out to pasture." Google remains a one-trick pony, but one that's unlikely to be put out to pasture anytime soon. Photo: PAUL SAKUMA 11:48am on 27 Jan 2017 Former Billabong CEO Matthew Perrin has been sentenced to eight years' imprisonment after he was found guilty of faking his ex-wife's signature to get a $13.5 million loan. The 43-year-old was convicted of three counts of fraud and six of forgery after a week-long trial in Brisbane District Court in December last year. The jury had been unable to decide on three further forgery charges. Crown prosecutor Glenn Cash told the court approximately $4 million had been recovered to the Commonwealth Bank after it was defrauded of the $13.5 million.  Perrin was sentenced to eight years for three counts of fraud, six years for four counts of forgery and seven years for two further counts of forgery. Ex-Billabong chief Matthew Perrin was found guilty of forging his wife's signature on mortgage documents.  Photo: Glenn Hunt 11:41am on 27 Jan 2017 Some second-tier eco data out today:  Producer prices rose 0.5 per cent over the fourth quarter, picking up from a 0.3 per cent growth rate in the previous three months, and 0.7 per cent over the year, from 0.5 per cent. Similarly to consumer prices, which were published on Wednesday, it looks like PPI has bottomed, but there's also no price surge in sight. Export prices soared 12.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, their biggest jump in six years, profiting strongly from big rises in key commodities iron ore and coal. The jump will provide a massive boost to Australia's terms of trade as import prices edged up just 0.2 per cent. In the previous quarter export prices had gained 3.5 per cent, while import prices slipped 1 per cent. The Aussie dollar shrugged off the data and remains stuck at around US75.35¢. 11:18am on 27 Jan 2017 It's not only Australia where inflation remains weak. Consumer prices in Japan dropped for a 10th straight month, though the pace of decline eased, supporting expectations for a return to inflation later this year. A weaker yen and pickup in oil prices are likely to drive up inflation this year, though questions remain on whether the expected gains in CPI will be sustainable, given poor growth in wages and lackluster consumer spending. The central bank isn't expected to change policy when board members meet January 30-31, but there is some prospect it could upgrade its forecasts for economic growth, or even inflation. Even if consumer prices reach 1 per cent this year, BoJ, officials would rather be late than early when it comes to raising their 10-year bond yield target from zero per cent, according to people familiar with the central bank's discussions. "It's fair to say that Japan's inflation has bottomed out, thanks to a weak yen and oil prices," Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said. "But we're not where the BoJ can has its inflation target in sight, so the best it can do now is to keep policy unchanged to stimulate the economy." "Hitting the bottom is just a baby step compared with what the BOJ is trying to deliver," Yasuhide Yajima, chief economist at NLI Research Institute, said. "Achieving 2 per cent inflation remains unrealistic." 10:47am on 27 Jan 2017 In a bid to fill the empty air time that is the trading world in January, news outlets have trumpeted the closure of the Dow Jones at 20,000 points for the second day in a row. But very few fund managers or investors care much for the milestone, pointing out the Dow Jones is a collection of unsystematic companies, indexed by share price rather than market capitalisation and is far more random than the S&P 500, which is a 500-stock index based on share market value rather than share price. "Look, it does not matter what Dow Jones does at all," says Randal Jenneke, head of Australian equities at T. Rowe Price. "It's an ancient relic." 42 days to go from 19k to #Dow20k. Here is where that ranks all-time. https://t.co/dORcs3WkFT pic.twitter.com/Xqe3S6R16D— Ryan Detrick, CMT (@RyanDetrick) January 26, 2017 Established in 1896, before computers existed, the Dow Jones is not designed to calculate total returns, meaning it's impossible to compare the price gains or losses plus reinvested dividends with any of the other indices.  Instead, the Dow Jones industrial average is a 30-stock average based on stock prices and includes heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Walt Disney and McDonald's.  Goldman Sachs has largely been the driving force behind the Dow's crusade to 20,000 points, contributing 36.6 per cent to the Dow's post-election rally of 1600 points.  And while there are other American stocks that have performed much better than Goldman Sachs, because the stock itself is the most expensive in the Dow Jones pool it has the most influence on the price-weighted index. At around $US240 a share, Goldman Sachs is worth nearly eight times more than "cheap" Dow stocks like General Electric.  "The index itself is a product of history and its construction is highly unusual." says Tom King, portfolio manager at Nanuk Asset Manager. "As such the technical 20,000 level is kind of meaningless." But the risk-on sentiment that has swept through financial markets and sent them soaring higher is likely to continue giving Australian stocks a boost, say fund managers, pointing to Australia's proliferation of resource, financial and global cyclical stocks as beneficiaries. Back to top 10:33am on 27 Jan 2017 Shares have bounced in early trade as the local sharemarket plays catch-up following the Australia Day holiday, with gains in banks offsetting losses in miners. The ASX is nudging 5700 points, up 0.5 per cent, despite  a 1.3 per cent slide in the materials sub-index. The big four banks are all up more than 1 per cent, with NAB's 2 per cent gain leading the charge. Woolies and Wesfarmers are also in demand, rising 2.1 per cnt at 1.3 per cent respectively. On the other side, BHP has dropped 1.6 per cent, Rio is down 0.5 per cent and South32 has fallen 0.7 per cent. But the real carnage is among gold miners, which are all deep in the red after the precious metal's price slid back below $US1200 an ounce. Newcrest has plunged 5 per cent, Northern Star Resources is down 9.1 per cent and Evolution Mining has shed 6.6 per cent.   9:55am on 27 Jan 2017 SPONSORED POST The markets seem to have decided that 'Trumponomics' is back on and after a period of reflection, we can see that the reflation trade is back on, says IG's Chris Weston: There has been some hesitation to push markets higher in the overnight US session, though, with most of the moves taking place on Wednesday night. The US 10-year treasury is back at 2.50%, moving up from 2.30% on 12 January and eyeing a move into 2.63%. The S&P 500 has broken out of the recent consolidation pattern and even poked its head above 2300, and on the weekly chart is looking ominously poised to print a bullish outside week reversal (where price traded below last week's low and closes above last week's high). US banks are finding buyers, amid the move higher in bond yields (and the translation effect of higher net interest margins). Of course, the Dow breaking 20,000 has been widely noted and the deafening sounds of households staging a Dow 20k party were heard amid yesterday's Australia Day celebrations. Hardly…it is merely a round number, and market participants exposed to US equities are going to celebrate anything it would be the S&P 500 at all-time highs and the fact is the bulls are in control here. As mentioned before a market trading at all-time highs is undeniably bullish and must be traded as such. US earnings have been generally supportive and a nice tailwind to the optimism that perhaps Trump can generate higher nominal growth. Some 30% of S&amp;P 500 corporate having released numbers and we can see 75% have beaten on the earnings line and 52% on sales. The leads for Asian markets are clearly positive, with SPI futures 0.7% higher than the ASX 200 close on Wednesday. Our call then for the ASX 200 sits at 5700 (+29 points). One should expect support for the banks, but the open for mining stocks will be interesting with BHP down for the past two sessions in London and the ADR suggesting an open 2.4% weaker.

The proposal, which Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the President discussed privately with congressional Republicans before giving remarks at a party retreat in Philadelphia, would be a major new economic proposal that could have far-reaching implications for consumers, manufacturers and relations between the two governments. President Trump had previously criticised the proposal as too complicated. "When you look at the plan that's taking shape now, using comprehensive tax reform as a means to tax imports from countries that we have a trade deficit from, like Mexico, if you tax that $US50 billion at 20 per cent of imports," Spicer said, "by doing that we can do $US10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. " Spicer said the tax would easily pay for a border wall that is estimated to cost between $US8 billion and $US20 billion. The value of imported goods from Mexico in 2015 was $US296 billion. Spicer said taxing imports is something that 160 other countries already do. The new tax would be imposed on Mexico as part of a tax overhaul that Trump intends to pursue with the Republican Congress. Mr Spicer said the tax initially would apply only to Mexico, but that the President supports imposing a 20 per cent tax on all imports. Later, Spicer summoned reporters to his office and said the tax was only one idea to finance the wall, and that its economic impact would have to be examined. Trump would need new legislation to enact such a comprehensive tax on Mexican imports. The cross-border sparring prompted a drop in the Mexican peso, which fell 0.7 per cent to trade at 21.2149 per US dollar following Pena Nieto's announcement. Mexico's currency has plunged almost 14 per cent since Trump's election on concern that Trump will renegotiate or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement. After Pena Nieto said in an address Wednesday that his country would refuse to pay for a barrier on the US southern border, Trump blasted him with a tweet Thursday morning. "If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting," Trump wrote. Pena Nieto, who was to meet with Trump January 31, responded a few hours later with his own tweet: "This morning we've informed the White House that I won't attend the working meeting scheduled for next Tuesday with @Potus." Esta mañana hemos informado a la Casa Blanca que no asistiré a la reunión de trabajo programada para el próximo martes con el @POTUS.— Enrique Peña Nieto (@EPN) January 26, 2017 Mexico doesn't pay for the wall," said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "American consumers who shop at places that import, like Walmart and Target, pay for the wall, making it a regressive tax supporting a dumb, wasteful idea." 9:28am on 27 Jan 2017 US stocks were little changed overnight as investors paused following a two-day rally that pushed the Dow Jones above the 20,000 mark, while the latest wave of earnings rolled in. The post-election rally reignited this week following a solid start to earnings season and optimism over US President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives, giving the benchmark S&P 500 its best two-day performance in seven weeks and catapulting the Dow above 20,000 for the first time. Trump's business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday include signing executive orders to reduce regulatory burden on domestic manufacturers and clearing the way for the construction of two oil pipelines. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite edged higher at the open to hit record levels but finished the day little changed. Qualcomm weighed on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq as the chipmaker fell 5.0 per cent to $US54.05 after posting a lower-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue. Early fourth-quarter US corporate earnings have boosted sentiment and are expected to show growth of 7 per cent, their biggest increase in two years. "If all the economic data is good, if the earnings are good and the market doesn't really seem to think anything (Trump) says or does is negative, I don't see any downside," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 32.4 points, or 0.16 per cent, to end at 20,100.91, the S&P 500 lost 1.69 points, or 0.07 percent, to close at 2,296.68 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to finish at 5,655.18. European shares climbed to a one-year high supported by merger and acquisition-related optimism. Johnson & Johnson's $US30-billion deal to buy Actelion lifted shares in the Swiss biotech firm. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.21 per cent at 1,451.12. The US dollar rebounded from its slide in recent weeks, but gains were tempered by persistent uncertainty surrounding Trump's leanings toward protectionist trade policy. Still, investors believed the US dollar could make up some lost ground in the next few weeks, with the Federal Reserve holding its first policy meeting this year on February 1. "Although the Fed is not expected to raise rates further at that meeting, the central bank is likely to provide a clearer outlook for rate hikes in 2017, especially in view of the projected US inflation trajectory under Trump's proposed fiscal stimulus plans," said James Chen, head of research at Forex.com. The Mexican peso weakened 0.7 per cent after the White House said Trump wants a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico to pay for a wall on their shared border, deepening a crisis after a planned summit between the countries' leaders fell through. Wall Street has been smashing all-time highs in recent weeks.  Photo: AP Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

Retail IT VAR Of The Future Smart VAR Summit White Paper Chase Manhattan Mortgage Cuts Recognition Errors from 45% to 1% Chase Manhattan Mortgage has helped millions of Americans realize the dream of home ownership. The company is one of the largest mortgage originators and servicers and is a key component of JP Morgan Chase, the nation's third-largest bank. Chase Manhattan Mortgage manages thousands of paper documents each day. Charged with the task of updating the company's document management system, Rick Duff, Chase Manhattan Mortgage's manager of software development and imaging, put together a combination of hardware and software products to meet the company's growing content management requirements. Chase now scans over 2.5 million documents per month with Kofax hardware and software. The Challenge Chase Manhattan Mortgage developed Quest, its first document management system, internally in 1992. Their toolkit included C and Visual Basic application development software, the Informix database application and Plexus' Optical/Storage Management product for storing and retrieving multimedia data objects. In 1999 the company added ImageFIRST Office, Plexus' integrated software solution providing document image processing, Computer Output to Laser Disk (COLD), workflow, and document management. The system supported the company's loan default divisions and converted customer financial documents into images, enabling customer service representatives to access account information immediately. "This system used ICR [hand printing recognition] for automated indexing, but its lack of image cleanup features led to high error rates, which required a lot of costly manual intervention. Skewed documents were the biggest issue," Duff said. "Our bar codes were also obscuring important information. It was obvious that changes had to be made because we were scanning 100,000 new mortgage documents per day and growing fast." The Solution Chase Manhattan Mortgage chose Kofax Ascent Capture software and Adrenaline scanner controller boards for their second-generation system. Ascent Capture offers fast, accurate document deskew and a wide range of other image enhancement options. Its production-oriented architecture, user interface and stability made it well suited for Chase's large and rapidly growing operation. The Adrenaline scanner controllers provided reliable high-speed scanning operation, additional image enhancement features, plus fast, accurate bar code recognition. They worked so well that Duff changed his automated indexing method from hand printing recognition to Adrenaline bar code recognition. The enhancements dropped the manual correction rate from 45 percent to less than one percent. The Kofax products also gave Chase the flexibility to meet its future needs without forfeiting its initial investment. For example, Ascent Capture enables users to index, validate and release to back-end systems not only scanned paper, but also electronic documents, Web forms and other digital data streams, such as XML. Chase recently began taking advantage of Ascent Capture 5's electronic data capture capabilities. The company now captures mainframe print streams using Ascent's Import Controller, converts them to image (Group IV TIFF) files, and then extracts index values from the images with Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Ascent Capture 5 permits Chase to run the same workflow process used on scanned paper-based documents. No additional applications or programming were required. By applying consistent indexing and validation processes to all data as well as using a single user interface for all media, Ascent Capture minimizes capture errors and streamlines the capture process. Since Chase buys and services a high volume of mortgages from other financial institutions, this integrated process means Chase can quickly and easily assign loan numbers to mortgages from any source. Ascent Capture has not only integrated the validation process for multiple data types, it has also eliminated the need to program the lookup and validation of index data acquired from external databases. "Prior to the implementation of Ascent Capture 5, it was necessary for Chase to write a custom validation module which took a considerable amount of time and added to the overall processing of loan documents," Duff said. "Since the database validation module is now embedded in Ascent Capture, it took Chase only minutes to get the system up and running and we no longer require custom programming to maintain the validation process." Chase has also begun to take advantage of Ascent Capture 5's ability to integrate simultaneously with more than one document or content management system. Kofax offers free, fully tested and supported integration modules for dozens of the leading back-end systems. Each one sends images and index data in the native formats and to the appropriate fields of the chosen data repository. The Bottom Line "The cost improvements are significant. Chase has lowered the company's software and hardware costs and reduced scanning costs from 10 cents to 6 cents per page," Duff said. "The company also reduced its staffing requirements due to the system's ease of use. Chase Manhattan Mortgage staff can now prep documents for scanning quicker and spend less time on manual indexing. In addition, system errors are now less than one percent."

 The startup that was supposed to be the first tech IPO of 2017 pulled a shady move on some of its own bankers Portia Crowe Jan. 25, 2017, 4:03 PM 13,402 facebook linkedin twitter email print AppDynamics CEO David Wadhwani.Dan Frommer, Business Insider It looks like AppDynamics' last-minute deal to sell itself to Cisco — rather than go public as planned — was a surprise to more people than just investors. Some of the bankers working on the initial public offering, or IPO, were kept out of the loop until "moments before" the press release, according to Bloomberg's Alex Sherman and Alex Barinka. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan were the lead banks on the IPO, according to an SEC filing, with Barclays, UBS, Wells Fargo, William Blair, and JMP Securities also acting as underwriters. But AppDynamics hired the boutique bank Qatalyst to work on a sale behind the scenes, according to the the report. During the IPO roadshow they held late-night meetings in hotel rooms after underwriters and investors had left for the day, Bloomberg reported. Fortune's Erin Griffith reports that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs advised on the sale along with Qatalyst. While Cisco has been interested in a deal with AppDynamics for months, Fortune reports that it wasn't until late last week that the company decided to go after a merger "aggressively." Qatalyst founder Frank Quattrone is a long-time adviser to Cisco, which frequently acquires companies. It's worth noting Cisco has made this sort of play before. Back in 1999, the company paid about $7 billion to buy Cerent shortly before that company was to go public. Credit Suisse First Boston, whose head of technology at the time was Quattrone, advised on that sale.

 US STOCKS-Wall St little changed as earnings, GDP data disappoint Reuters Jan. 27, 2017, 1:01 PM 101 facebook linkedin twitter email print * Fourth-quarter GDP up 1.9 pct vs. est. 2.2 pct * Starbucks lower after cutting revenue forecast * Chevron down after profit falls short of estimates * All three major indexes on track to post weekly gains * Indexes down: Dow 0.04 pct, S&P 0.10 pct, Nasdaq 0.02 pct (Updates to early afternoon) By Tanya Agrawal Jan 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street was little changed on Friday as investors paused after a recent rally following underwhelming corporate earnings and gross domestic product data. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists and the 3.5 percent growth pace logged in the third quarter. Chevron fell 2.2 percent to $113.98 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. The Nasdaq was weighed down by Starbucks, whose shares dropped 3.6 percent to $56.34 after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. "Earnings have really just been fine," said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco. "They haven't been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think fine might not be enough in the near term and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay." However, the Dow stayed above 20,000 for the third straight day, after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday as the post-election rally reignited. All three major indexes were also on track to post weekly gains. Still, investors retreated to a wait-and-see mode as they sought more clarity on President Donald Trump's policies and the new administration's ability to clear legislature hurdles in its quest to reduce regulation and cut taxes. "There's definitely a gap between expectations and reality. I think the new administration has probably until the summer time to show some forward momentum and progress on getting policy changed and implemented through Congress." said Lyon. At 12:35 p.m. ET (1735 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 8.74 points, or 0.04 percent, at 20,092.17. The S&P 500 was down 2.47 points, or 0.10 percent, at 2,294.21 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.91 points, or 0.02 percent, at 5,654.27. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy index's 0.99 percent fall leading the decliners. Microsoft rose 2.3 percent to $65.72, while Intel gained 1.4 percent to $38.09 after the two companies reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. However, Google parent Alphabet was down 0.8 percent at $850.35 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. American Airlines fell 5 percent to $47.10 after the No. 1 U.S. airline by passenger traffic reported a fall in profit. Colgate-Palmolive fell 5.9 percent to $64.20 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,768 to 1,047. On the Nasdaq, 1,628 issues fell and 1,075 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 24 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 23 new lows.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, January 28, 2017 Updated: 5:50 AM, January 28, 2017 Citigroup Inc <C.N> has quietly launched a website to make small business loans of up to $1 million, the latest effort by a big bank to make the process of smaller loans more technology-friendly. Citigroup's online toe in the water comes after similar moves by several other banks. For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> announced a partnership with online lender On Deck Capital Inc <ONDK.N> in December 2015 and Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N> launched a fast-decision online small business loan product some eight months ago. Banks have been cautious about entering the online lending space despite the proliferation of online non-bank lenders such as On Deck, LendingClub Corp <LC.N> Prosper Marketplace and other startups. Early optimism about prospects for such companies soured after LendingClub's CEO resigned over a loan-selling scandal. Citigroup's website is run by Biz2Credit, a New York-based startup. Borrowers visiting the Citigroup website are directed to a separate website run by Biz2Credit where they fill out an online worksheet before following up with a Citigroup small business banker. Biz2Credit CEO Rohit Arora said being online makes it easier for Citigroup to fulfill its obligations to small and underserved borrowers under the Community Reinvestment Act because it allows access for customers who live far from a branch. Citigroup and Biz2Credit chose not to publicize the effort because it is still in very early stages, Arora said. "If you make a premature announcement the expectations go very high and then you're in the public eye all the time," he said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment. Separately, a small business lending website backed by Citigroup and the U.S. Treasury Department and run by Biz2Credit will shut down. Launched in May 2015, DCSmallBizLoans.com was intended to bring online lending technology to small businesses in underserved Washington D.C. communities. The website matched up small businesses with four Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), government-backed lenders that serve low-income communities. Citigroup had agreed to fund the website for two years, after which it was expected to become self-sustaining, said Steve Glaude, president and chief executive officer of the Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development, a non-profit that organized the effort. Though it would only have cost each CDFI about $1,000 per month to keep the site operating, there was not enough interest to warrant even so small an investment, according to Glaude. "In some ways I think we were ahead of our time," he said.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 Mail News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai Citigroup quietly launches small business lending website By Dan Freed ReutersJanuary 27, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Reflections are seen on the glass facade of a Citibank branch in Beijing, China, April 18, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonMore By Dan Freed (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc <C.N> has quietly launched a website to make small business loans of up to $1 million, the latest effort by a big bank to make the process of smaller loans more technology-friendly. Citigroup's online toe in the water comes after similar moves by several other banks. For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> announced a partnership with online lender On Deck Capital Inc <ONDK.N> in December 2015 and Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N> launched a fast-decision online small business loan product some eight months ago. Banks have been cautious about entering the online lending space despite the proliferation of online non-bank lenders such as On Deck, LendingClub Corp <LC.N> Prosper Marketplace and other startups. Early optimism about prospects for such companies soured after LendingClub's CEO resigned over a loan-selling scandal. Citigroup's website is run by Biz2Credit, a New York-based startup. Borrowers visiting the Citigroup website are directed to a separate website run by Biz2Credit where they fill out an online worksheet before following up with a Citigroup small business banker. Biz2Credit CEO Rohit Arora said being online makes it easier for Citigroup to fulfill its obligations to small and underserved borrowers under the Community Reinvestment Act because it allows access for customers who live far from a branch. Citigroup and Biz2Credit chose not to publicize the effort because it is still in very early stages, Arora said. "If you make a premature announcement the expectations go very high and then you're in the public eye all the time," he said. A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment. Separately, a small business lending website backed by Citigroup and the U.S. Treasury Department and run by Biz2Credit will shut down. Launched in May 2015, DCSmallBizLoans.com was intended to bring online lending technology to small businesses in underserved Washington D.C. communities. The website matched up small businesses with four Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), government-backed lenders that serve low-income communities. Citigroup had agreed to fund the website for two years, after which it was expected to become self-sustaining, said Steve Glaude, president and chief executive officer of the Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development, a non-profit that organized the effort. Though it would only have cost each CDFI about $1,000 per month to keep the site operating, there was not enough interest to warrant even so small an investment, according to Glaude. "In some ways I think we were ahead of our time," he said.

(AMZN) Stock Deserve More Credit? Here's why AMZN stock is still a winner By , Street Authority  |  Jan 25, 2017, 6:00 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Does Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Deserve More Credit? International Business Machines Corp. Is Back! (IBM) Recent Posts: International Business Machines Corp. Is Back! (IBM) Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation a Defense Contractor On the Move (BAH) Consider This All-In-One Biotech Fund With a 10% Yield (CHI) View All Posts Membership now has its privileges at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The e-commerce giant recently announced its new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature credit card, giving Prime shoppers more ways to buy and earn cash back in the process. Meanwhile, critics who continue to bet against AMZN stock — citing outdated valuation arguments — must prepare for more losses, while the longs ride these shares higher. Source: Shutterstock The new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card, in partnership with JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), gives Prime shoppers a whopping 5% cash back on all Amazon purchases. AMZN: Too Good to Be True or too Good to Pass Up? The card also rewards members with 2% cash back at restaurants, gas stations and drugstores, and 1% back on all other purchases. There is no cap on the amount of rewards cardholders can earn. The card has no annual fee and does not charge foreign transaction fees, and charges 14.74% to 22.74% annual percentage rate (APR) on unpaid balances versus the average credit card interest rate of 16.35%. Still undecided? According to Zach Honig, editor in chief of rewards site The Points Guy, Amazon’s new card is a good choice for someone looking for “a very simple option for getting the greatest return on Amazon purchases.” Honig said, “If you want something really straightforward, one card to use for all Amazon purchases, this is the way to go.” To reap these benefits, all Amazon wants you to do is become a Prime member, which itself costs $99 per year to join. And here’s the thing: When new cardholders sign up, they will receive a $70 Amazon gift card. In other words, the net cost to be a Prime Member is only $29. The announcement pushed AMZN stock above $800 per share for the first time since October. But this is only the beginning. Here’s why the shares will go higher. AMZN Is Betting On Itself Right away, the first thought that comes to mind is why would Amazon do this? To give 5% cash back, which is 3 percentage points above the previous card’s rate, means a narrower profit margin for the company. And lack of profits has been a popular criticism of AMZN stock. From my vantage point, however, it seems that Amazon is betting on itself. The company sees this card as another way to lock shoppers into its ecosystem. At the same time, the announcement of the new card should send chills down the spine of the brick-and-mortar competition. Why? At a time when the likes of Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) and J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE:JCP) are scaling back stores and cutting their workforce, Amazon is implying it has so much business and room for expansion that it can afford this type of expense. AMZN seems even more intent than ever to boost capital expenses to achieve its main objective: to disrupt every type of retail. And with the new card reportedly to be made out of metal, Amazon wants to take on the persona of, say, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) and provide the prestige that comes with membership. A Win-Win Situation for Amazon Stock Last week, AMZN announced it would create 100,000 jobs by the middle of next year. Bezos touted the addition of new jobs across multiple areas of the company’s operations — from fulfillment centers to logistics to machine learning and cloud services. Of course, the mainstream immediately called the job creation plan an attempt by Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, to win political favor with then-President-elect Donald Trump. I won’t presume to know Bezos’ motivation, but he didn’t become the world’s third-richest person without focusing on the bottom line.

The S&P 500 Index, along with related funds including the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEArca: SPY), iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEArca: IVV) and Vanguard 500 Index (NYSEArca: VOO), were 0.2% lower Thursday. The unimpressive corporate results gave little reason to investors to keep U.S. stocks pushing toward new heights after Chevron revealed quarterly profits falling short of expectations, reports Saqib Iqbal Ahmed for Reuters. “Earnings have really just been fine,” David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, told Reuters “They haven’t been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think ‘fine’ might not be enough in the near-term, and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay.” Additionally, stocks lost a step after the Commerce Department revealed gross domestic product rose at a 1.9% annualized rate last quarter, compared to the prior quarter’s 3.5% expansion, due to the biggest drag from trade in six years and moderate consumer spending, reports Sho Chandra for Bloomberg. Nevertheless, market sentiment remains supported by president Donald Trump’s potential plans on tax reform and fiscal stimulus, which will help maintain growth in 2017, despite his protectionist stance. Economists expect U.S. growth to range from 1.7% to 2.9%. “We’re still reasonably positive on the market,” Graeme Bencke, fund manager at PineBridge Investments, told the Wall Street Journal. “Short-term actions the administration can take should be relatively market-friendly,” Bencke added, pointing to policies such as reducing taxes and regulation.

Weakness in Europe weighed on the index and it found little support on Wall Street.Lackluster corporate results gave little reason to investors to push U.S. stocks higher.Chevron fell 2.5 percent to $113.67 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes."Earnings have really just been fine," said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco."They haven't been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think 'fine' might not be enough in the near-term, and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 18.91 points, or 0.09 percent, to 20,082, the S&P 500 lost 3.62 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,293.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.07 points, or 0 percent, to 5,655.24.European shares eased with UBS dragging bank stocks lower after posting a drop in full-year profit, while Britain's biggest supermarket, Tesco, surged after a 3.7 billion-pound takeover of a supplier.The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.4 percent at 366.04.The greenback, which has climbed for two straight days from a seven-week low against a basket of major currencies, was buoyed by hopes that U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-growth policies will further bolster the U.S. economy. Increasing expectations of tax reforms and fiscal stimulus, which support the dollar, are temporarily soothing concerns about Trump's stance on trade protectionism, said Karl Schamotta, director of global product & market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.The dollar retreated a little against a basket of currencies after data showed U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected to 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter but recouped losses to trade up 0.19 at 100.57.The greenback rose to a one-week high of 115.37 against the yen.The Mexican peso, which slumped on Thursday after the White House said Trump wants a 20-percent tax on imports from Mexico to pay for a wall on their shared border, strengthened more than 1 percent after the two countries agreed not to talk publicly for now about payment for the wall. In bond markets, U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors reached for U.S. government debt following the disappointing fourth-quarter GDP data.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was down 2 basis points at 2.486 percent.Oil prices extended losses after data suggested drilling is ramping up in the United States, easing the focus on efforts by OPEC and other producers to support prices by cutting supplies.Brent crude was down 1.64 percent at $55.32 a barrel, while U.S. crude was down 1.56 percent at $52.94.Gold was on track for its first weekly loss of the year as persistent dollar strength prompted some traders to cash in on this week's rally to two-month highs. On Friday, spot gold was little changed at $1,189.81.

Óscar Laínez and Jorge Herrera, executives of Compañía de Servicios Múltiples S. de R.L. (Cosem), allegedly used a Panamanian firm called CA Technologies to make transfers of more than $2.5 million to a JP Morgan Chase bank account in the United States belonging to a company called CM Motors, according to an investigation by the National Fiscal Support Unit (Unidad Nacional de Apoyo Fiscal). Mario Zelaya -- former director of the Honduran Social Security Institute (Instituto Hondureño de Seguridad Social - IHSS) who has been jailed and is facing charges in the IHSS case -- and his brother Carlos, are both partners of CM Motors.  According to La Prensa, the Cosem executives paid these bribes in 2010 in order to "expedite" a $19.7 million contract with the IHSS to digitalize their registration system. The bribes were paid to then-Director Mario Zelaya, then-Vice Minister of Health Javier Pastor, and then-Deputy Secretary of Jobs Carlos Montes.  Cosem executives Laínez and Herrera are both key witnesses in the money laundering and bribery case against Zelaya, Pastor and Montes.  Raul Pineda Alvarado, a lawyer and expert in criminal law who spoke to La Prensa, told the media outlet the United States could take legal action against Laínez or Herrera, or place sanctions on JP Morgan.  InSight Crime Analysis  The announcement of this investigation comes at an awkward time for Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who is readying his bid for re-election. In 2015, the Honduran Supreme Court controversially overturned a constitutional ban on re-election, allowing Hernández to run for another term as president. While Hernández was not in office when Mario Zelaya and several of his colleagues from the IHSS were arrested and charged, the case impacts his National Party and could impact his reelection bid. SEE ALSO: Honduras News and Profiles  Hernández admitted in 2015 that companies linked to corruption cases in the IHSS had contributed nearly $150,000 to his presidential campaign in 2013. As Honduran authorities investigated corruption within IHSS, they discovered "the creation of over 10 ghost companies that allegedly delivered checks and wired monthly installments to the National Party's central committee." As further revelations surface regarding corruption in the IHSS, details could emerge that may prove damaging to Hernández's re-election bid.   What are your thoughts?

SOME': Comments of the week Why banks should consider taking a page from Facebook on security keys Can AI make banks as good as Amazon at knowing customers? search goes here The data access debate is about to get a lot more interesting By Mary Wisniewski Published January 27 2017, 3:27pm EST More in Data security APIs PFM Dodd-Frank Bank technology Print Email Reprints Share Share on The long-running feud between banks and fintech companies over screen scraping is morphing into a more nuanced and important debate about how to exchange consumers' financial data securely and fairly. White papers are being written, lobbying groups are forming and interpretations of the law are being put forth. The questions are more complex than whether third-party data aggregators should be permitted to access consumers' accounts using their credentials. The new Matryoshka dolls include: Is the industry legally obligated to improve the way data is shared between banks and third-party apps like Mint or Digit? Will replacing screen scraping with something more secure and reliable also prevent third-party apps from capturing valuable data such as interest rates? Should the industry collaborate more on standards so smaller banks aren’t locked out of digital advancements? The stakes are nothing short of the ability to innovate with financial apps – including some bank apps – at a time when most Americans live paycheck to paycheck and could use new tools to plan, save and borrow. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also been taking an interest in the issue of data access, meaning that if the industry doesn't converge on a solution, one may eventually be foisted upon it. The answers may require banks to rethink their business models, which rely to a degree on consumer lock-in. "On the face of it, it looks like tech issue," said Kristin Moyer, a research vice president at Gartner’s banking and investment services practice. "But it forces you to think about what it means to be a bank." One wrinkle is that competing approaches to grabbing financial records are multiplying. Big banks have been landing application programming interface deals with fintech companies. This week, JPMorgan Chase and Intuit announced a partnership to make sharing financial data easier and safer through an API (specifically the OFX 2.2 API). Wells Fargo made a splash last year when it announced an API deal with an accounting software firm called Xero. Banks, large and small, have the Open Financial Exchange (OFX) and Durable Data API standards at their disposal at a time when screen scraping is still in wide use. “It will get worse before it gets better in terms of number of competing API-type solutions,” Moyer said. Essentially, individual partnerships may be good advertising for the benefits of data sharing, but they hinder the development of an ecosystem built on standards. Lack of standardization, some say, could stall innovation and ultimately harm consumers. “Imagine a small bank with limited resources,” said Beth Brockland, a managing director with the Center for Financial Services Innovation in Chicago. Such a bank will lack the time and resources to negotiate one-off agreements with aggregators. To address a challenge that ultimately affects consumers, the center is among those advocating for more collaboration. In a recent BankThink post, Brockland and her colleague, CFSI President and CEO Jennifer Tescher, wrote: But an end-state that involves innumerable one-off deals between banks and third parties would be a bad outcome for consumers and for the industry as a whole. We need a broader set of industry-wide standards and best practices if we are to arrive at solutions that support consumer choice and innovation. The center has been helping to shape the conversation by publishing a framework on data portability – a principles-based vision for how the industry can come together on data-sharing practices. Without getting into technical specifics, the CFSI sets a clear goal: Make sure the apps consumers depend on to manage their money are spitting out accurate insights. Among the firms that contributed to CFSI’s framework was the data aggregator Finicity, based in Murray, Utah. Nick Thomas, a co-founder and president of the company, said he ultimately wants the industry to unite on a single standard to address what he sees as a big challenge. His vision includes a unification of the DDA and decades-old OFX standards – the latter of which, Thomas readily admits, needs to evolve away from its XML data format. Some, however, say it’s unrealistic to ask most small banks to invest in a spec that promises no revenue right away. “From the bank’s perspective, there is a big lift with no immediate reward,” said William Hockey, a co-founder and chief technology officer of Plaid, a provider of financial technology infrastructure. “You're not always met with open arms. I don’t fault them. But it's a balance, because it's ultimately about what customers want.” The obstacles to coming to a consensus on something that introduces new forms of risk are many. “Standards are a very tough thing to achieve,” said Gartner’s Moyer. John Schulte, the chief information officer at Mercantile Bank of Michigan, is among the bankers in favor of one standard – developed in partnership between banks, the fintech community and other stakeholders. However, his bank offers customers aggregation capabilities; not all banks do. As Schulte sees it, smaller banks that don't offer aggregation and financial health tools are the most threatened and most likely to resist allowing aggregation of their data by outsiders. “The question we have to ask ourselves as community banks is whether we want to own the role of being our customers' partner in managing their financial health/goals, or let others (big banks, fintech, others) fill that gap,” Schulte said. Unlike in Europe, where regulators have directed banks to open up their data to APIs and third parties, the legal motivation for U.S. banks to move quickly on something that costs money is, for now, nebulous. The new Consumer Financial Data Rights lobbying group, for instance, is citing Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act as codifying consumers' right to access their financial data through third-party apps. Whether that’s what Congress intended with the section is a matter of debate. “They are taking what I consider to be an aggressive posture on 1033,” said Brian Knight, a senior research fellow for the financial markets working group at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. As Knight sees it, the language in Section 1033 seems to contemplate a direct relationship between a customer and bank rather than through a third-party app. Further complicating the issue are proposed cybersecurity rules that could put banks in a quandary if separate regulations mandated third-party access. (Currently, the CFPB is in the midst of a request for information on data portability.) “Banks feel torn,” Knight said. " 'One regulator will ding me if I make it too hard to get information. One regulator will ding me if it’s too easy. What do I do?’ " Mary Wisniewski Mary is the deputy editor of the BankThink blog.

After weeks of close calls, the Dow made history on Wednesday by blowing past that key level for the first time ever. The historic milestone leaves the Dow up a stunning 1,667 points since President Donald Trump’s victory in November. The achievement is evidence of how optimistic investors have become about the prospects for the U.S. economy. “The stock market has given him this extraordinary vote of approval. Happy days are here again,” said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Wall Street is clearly betting that Trump’s plans to slash taxes, ramp up infrastructure spending and cut regulation will make the American economy grow faster. If that happens, without any disruptions to global trade, it could propel corporate profits, the lifeblood of stock prices. But the jump in stocks is also a reflection of the solid economy Trump inherited from former President Obama. The U.S. has added jobs for a record 75 straight months and the unemployment rate is sitting near a 10-year low. The Dow 20,000 milestone also shows how much has changed in the U.S. economy over the past eight years. The index crashed to a low of 6,440 in March 2009 as Wall Street feared a complete collapse of the American financial system. The astounding 13,500-point rise since then has been fueled by a consistent, albeit imperfect, economic recovery combined with the U.S. central bank’s massive stimulus program and near-0% interest rates. While the economic rebound from the Great Recession has been slower than many hoped, the unemployment rate is now at the lowest level since 2007 and corporate profits have climbed to record highs. “The economy has come a long way in eight years. Overall, it’s a healthier economy and does justify a much higher stock market than eight years ago,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Few expected the Dow to rise so much, especially after a Trump victory. In fact, many feared a market crash if Trump upset Hillary Clinton. Instead, Wall Street embarked on a very impressive post-election rally that carried the Dow above both the 19,000 and 20,000 levels. But the Trump rally cooled off in recent months and Wall Street hit a bit of a psychological roadblock leading up to the 20,000 level. On January 6, the Dow got incredibly close, rising to 19,999.63 before backing off. Traders on Wall Street had fun with it, with some creating hats that said: Dow Almost 20,000. One reason for the pause: investors want more details on the timing and effectiveness of the stimulus plans rolled out by the new administration. “We’ve scaled this peak. We’re going to enjoy this view for a while and hit the pause button,” said Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust. Bank stocks have been among the biggest winners during the post-election party on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have soared more than 20%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) is up nearly 30%, as investors bet on higher interest rates and less regulation under Trump. But JPMorgan’s Kelly worries that “markets seem to be pricing in the positives, and not worrying too much about the negatives” such as a potential trade war or fiscal stimulus that overheats the economy. Quinlan agrees that trade remains a serious risk given Trump’s anti-trade rhetoric during the campaign. Already, Trump has scrapped the TPP trade deal and plans to swiftly start renegotiating NAFTA. “We need open borders, open trade and open flow of capital. If we start going down this deglobalization road, this market is going to lose its euphoric underpins pretty quickly,” Quinlan said. Yardeni said the verdict is still out on whether the enthusiasm on Wall Street is overdone. “Is the market irrationally exuberant or will Trump prevail in a way that’s bullish for the economy,” he said. “The bottom line on Trump is: love him or hate him, you don’t want to bet against him.” Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Posted 27 Jan 2017 20:15 Updated 28 Jan 2017 05:35 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as the Dow Jones Industrial Average passes the 20,000 mark shortly after the opening of the trading session in New York, U.S., January 25, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks edged lower for a second consecutive session on Friday as some underwhelming corporate earnings and gross domestic product data offset recent enthusiasm over policy actions by President Donald Trump. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists and the 3.5 percent growth pace logged in the third quarter. Chevron fell 2.4 percent to US$113.79 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. The S&P energy index , down 0.9 percent, was the worst performing of the 11 major S&P sectors. Starbucks curbed gains on the Nasdaq. Its shares dropped 4.0 percent to US$56.12 after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. "The market has rallied on expectations of good things to happen in the future but as we are getting the data that is factual of what is going on, it is not as good as people are hoping," said Andrew Slimmon, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in Chicago. "Which tells you, this earnings recovery that is expected in 2017, a good chunk of it is already baked into the market." Even with some disappointing corporate results, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to show growth of 6.8 percent, which would mark the biggest increase in two years and second straight quarter of growth, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow remained above 20,000 for the third straight day, after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday as the post-election rally reignited. For the week, the Dow rose 1.3 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.9 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.13 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,093.78, the S&P 500 lost 1.99 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,294.69 and the Nasdaq Composite added 5.61 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,660.78. Microsoft rose 2.3 percent to US$65.78, while Intel gained 1.1 percent to US$37.98 after both reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. However, Google parent Alphabet lost 1.4 percent to US$845.03 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. Colgate-Palmolive slumped 5.2 percent to US$64.68 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 116 new highs and 26 new lows. About 5.81 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.56 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan had sought up to 16 months in prison for Michael Murgio, a former Palm Beach County School Board member who pleaded guilty in October to obstructing an examination of a credit union linked to the bitcoin exchange. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan instead sentenced Murgio, 66, to one year of probation, a $12,000 fine and 200 hours of community service, saying he was "far less" culpable than his co-defendants and had shown remorse. "None of us are the worst thing we have done in life," Nathan said in court. Prosecutors said bitcoin exchange Coin.mx was operated by one of Murgio's sons, Anthony Murgio, and was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli accused of overseeing a hacking scheme that resulted in information being stolen for more than 100 million people. The companies that were hacked included JPMorgan, which in 2014 disclosed a breach involving records for more than 83 million accounts. The Murgios were not charged in the hacking case. But they and four other men were charged in connection with Coin.mx, which prosecutors said exchanged, with no license, millions of dollars into bitcoin and was run through a front called "Collectables Club." To evade scrutiny of Florida-based Coin.mx, Anthony Murgio, 33, and others in 2014 acquired control of now-defunct Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, by bribing its chairman, Pastor Trevon Gross, prosecutors said. After the National Credit Union Administration in 2014 deemed Anthony Murgio's board picks ineligible due to their residency, Michael Murgio drafted a letter falsely claiming Collectables Club was based in New Jersey, court papers said. "I wish there was a way to take it back, but there isn't," Michael Murgio said in court on Friday. Anthony Murgio, who cried during his father's sentencing, pleaded guilty on Jan. 9 to charges stemming from Coin.mx's operation. Gross and Yuri Lebedev, who prosecutors say worked on Coin.mx, are scheduled to face trial on Feb. 6. Shalon, who prosecutors said was also involved in stock manipulation schemes and online gambling businesses, has pleaded not guilty. The case is U.S. v. Murgio et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00769.

General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is a bit of a bore, and that’s putting it mildly. In fact, of the thousands of investments available, GE stock is the one I dread analyzing. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the sexy industry, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has the sexy CEO — or so I’ve been told — and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) basically owns sex. General Electric? It has a 3.23% dividend yield — I think you’re getting my drift. Source: Shutterstock That’s not to say that GE stock is irrelevant in the current markets. This week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 20,000 points for the first time in history. Not only is General Electric a component of the Dow 30, it was a strong contributor to the record. GE stock turned in a 1.23% performance against its prior session. The average gains for the Dow-listed companies on the record-breaking day was only 0.6%, which is surprisingly low. In fact, there were only six companies that posted better numbers than GE, and these were the usual suspects. In increasing order, they were International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and standout Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), which ringed up an impressive 4% move. Besides the obvious point that these companies are proudly red, white and blue, it’s easy to see why they performed so well over the others. President Donald Trump has promised fewer regulations stymieing business, more support for the military industrial complex and keeping jobs stateside. General Electric belongs among the titans of American industry; hence, yesterday’s robust gains. But is the recent surge of GE stock based on optimism for President Trump, or a reaction from pronounced volatility? The answer to that question is critical for investors. GE Stock Is Exciting, and That’s Bad! GE has shed its boring image, but for all the wrong reasons. Click to Enlarge While it’s very early into the new year, nevertheless, it’s worth pointing out that shares are down 4%. I should also mention that at this price point, GE stock is firmly below its 50-day moving average, and only a hair above its 200-DMA. I don’t think the volatility should be ignored as a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo. Just a few days ago, General Electric shares were down 6%. More worryingly, traders haven’t pushed the needle that far since GE faltered under the weight of an uninspiring and anemic fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings results. Rightfully, people are concerned. True, GE stock is a reliable investment, making steady gains through all sorts of economic cycles. At the same time, its stable nature can work against the investor if there’s a sharp downfall. It may take an inordinate amount of time for General Electric to gain 10%, but it could be gone in a flash. As an example, GE returned 6% last year — and we’ve basically burned through two-thirds of that profit. I don’t care how high the dividend yields are for General Electric. No one can afford to lose that much capital and justify the losses due to the passive income. Unless GE stock was offering double digits, it’s a bad deal. Of course, the question would then become, why are they offering double digits?

U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists and the 3.5 percent growth pace logged in the third quarter. Chevron fell 2.2 percent to $113.98 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. The Nasdaq was weighed down by Starbucks, whose shares dropped 3.6 percent to $56.34 after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. "Earnings have really just been fine," said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco. "They haven't been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think fine might not be enough in the near term and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay." However, the Dow stayed above 20,000 for the third straight day, after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday as the post-election rally reignited. All three major indexes were also on track to post weekly gains. Still, investors retreated to a wait-and-see mode as they sought more clarity on President Donald Trump's policies and the new administration's ability to clear legislature hurdles in its quest to reduce regulation and cut taxes. "There's definitely a gap between expectations and reality. I think the new administration has probably until the summer time to show some forward momentum and progress on getting policy changed and implemented through Congress." said Lyon. At 12:35 p.m. ET (1735 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 8.74 points, or 0.04 percent, at 20,092.17. The S&P 500 was down 2.47 points, or 0.10 percent, at 2,294.21 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.91 points, or 0.02 percent, at 5,654.27. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy index's 0.99 percent fall leading the decliners. Microsoft rose 2.3 percent to $65.72, while Intel gained 1.4 percent to $38.09 after the two companies reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. However, Google parent Alphabet was down 0.8 percent at $850.35 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. American Airlines fell 5 percent to $47.10 after the No. 1 U.S. airline by passenger traffic reported a fall in profit. Colgate-Palmolive fell 5.9 percent to $64.20 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,768 to 1,047. On the Nasdaq, 1,628 issues fell and 1,075 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 24 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 23 new lows.

Fourth-quarter revenue from foreign exchange, rates and credit trading dropped 12 percent to 341 million francs ($341 million), the bank said Friday. That missed the consensus estimate of 434 million francs, according to a note from JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Kian Abouhossein. The drop was offset by a 22 percent surge in equities revenue to 891 million Swiss francs, which topped estimates on a boost from derivatives trading, Abouhossein said.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter UBS suffered trading losses in its macro business in the volatility surrounding the U.S. election, according to a person with knowledge of the results, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn’t public. That contrasts with the five biggest U.S. investment banks, who said they benefited from market swings -- which included a rally in the dollar and a rise in interest rates -- on their way to posting a 43 percent increase in total debt trading revenue. “We weren’t as well positioned as we obviously ideally would have liked to have been to benefit from the trends in volatility following the U.S. election,” UBS Chief Financial Officer Kirt Gardner said on a call with analysts Friday. “We have very low inventory.” Ceding Share The losses exacerbated UBS’s headwinds from revenue declines in emerging market products and interest-rate options. The 12 percent drop excluded a one-time gain. The bank also said it had a less favorable business mix for activity in the quarter. UBS has pulled back from many bond-trading businesses in recent years to focus on wealth management amid harsher capital rules. Other European banks such as Credit Suisse Group AG and Barclays Plc have also ceded share in trading businesses to the big Wall Street lenders, which were faster to take losses and restructure after the financial crisis. “The steepening of curves and the narrowing of credit spreads benefited players that had strong presence in credit markets as well as rates, and in particular structured credit products,” Gardner said. “That benefited two asset classes that we don’t participate in in a very meaningful way. Our business is much more macro- and FX-focused.” To read more about trends in global securities trading, click here UBS’s jump in equities revenue outpaced all of the U.S. firms, which posted a collective 3 percent climb. The stock unit produced two-thirds of the bank’s trading revenue for 2016, whereas the U.S. firms get about two-thirds of their revenue from the bond side. While praising a “strong” equities result, Citigroup Inc. analyst Andrew Coombs highlighted fixed-income revenues were “far weaker than U.S. peers, which management attributed to a stronger fourth quarter 2015 comparison, and lower inventory levels.” As a result Coombs, who has a buy rating on the stock, gave the investment bank a "mixed" grade. Overall the securities unit, led by Andrea Orcel, reported pretax profit rose to 306 million francs from 80 million francs a year earlier, as it benefited from a one-time gain and lower restructuring costs. The unit’s cost-income ratio dropped to 85 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 93 percent a year earlier. For the full year, Orcel cut costs by 4 percent as headcount fell by more than 500 people to 4,734 at the end of December. UBS said Friday it’s on track to reach its cost savings target at the end of this year. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 27, 2017 11:37AM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 27, 2017 11:37AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index slipped on Friday as some heavyweight natural resource stocks weighed, while electronics manufacturer Celestica Inc jumped to a 12-year high. Celestica surged 11.2 per cent to $18.56 after its adjusted earnings beat expectations and it said it would exit the oversupplied solar panel manufacturing market. The energy group retreated 0.8 per cent as oil prices slipped on an increased focus on U.S. production increases that could lessen the impact of an OPEC agreement to reduce supply. TransCanada Corp fell 1.1 per cent to $62.83 as the country’s energy regulator said it would restart from the beginning a hearing into the company’s proposed Energy East pipeline. Fellow pipeline operator Enbridge Inc declined 2.4 per cent to $56.73 after announcing it would pay about $170-million to take private Midcoast Energy Partners LP. At 11:29 a.m. ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index fell 42.68 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 15,572.68. The index was heading for a 0.6-per-cent gain on the week and is within striking distance of an all-time high hit in 2014. Rogers Communications extended a rally to its highest level since August as investors cheered Thursday’s results that suggested its turnaround was on track. It advanced 1.6 per cent to $56.91. Restaurant Brands International Inc advanced 1.1 per cent to $65.35. The company said it would expand its coffee and doughnut chain, Tim Hortons, into Mexico. Industrials rose 0.1 percent, although plane and train maker Bombardier Inc fell 1.2 per cent to $2.54 as Brazil said Canada had signaled a willingness to negotiate to resolve a feud over government support that threatens to turn into an international trade dispute. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, gained 0.6 per cent. However, Potash Corp and Agrium Inc both fell 1.6 per cent. The companies, which plan to merge by mid-2017 to cut costs, are struggling with the deepest slump in a decade for the oversupplied potash fertilizer market. Five of the index’s 10 main groups were in negative territory. Wall Street was slightly lower on Friday, weighed down by underwhelming corporate earnings and gross domestic product data. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists. Chevron fell 2 per cent to $114.21 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts’ expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. Starbucks dropped 4 per cent to $56.12 after the world’s biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. The stock weighed the most on the Nasdaq. “Earnings have really just been fine,” said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco. “They haven’t been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think fine might not be enough in the near term and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay.” However, the Dow stayed above 20,000 for the third straight day after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday, helped by the reignition of the post-election rally earlier this week. All three major indexes were also on track to post weekly gains. Still, investors retreated to a wait-and-see mode as they sought more clarity on President Donald Trump’s policies and the new administration’s ability to clear legislature hurdles in its quest to reduce regulation and cut taxes. “There’s definitely a gap between expectations and reality. I think the new administration has probably until the summer time to show some forward momentum and progress on getting policy changed and implemented through Congress.” said Lyon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 18.56 points, or 0.09 per cent, at 20,082.35. The S&P 500 was down 3.39 points, or 0.14 per cent, at 2,293.29. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.63 points, or 0.03 per cent, at 5,653.55. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy index’s 0.77-per-cent fall leading the decliners. Microsoft rose 2.1 per cent to $65.59, while Intel gained 1.8 per cent to $38.24 after the two companies reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. However, Google parent Alphabet was down 0.4 per cent at $853.40 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts’ estimates. Colgate-Palmolive fell 6.8 per cent to $63.59 after the personal products maker’s fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates. Oil prices slipped on Friday, giving up gains from earlier in the day, as the market shifted its focus towards production increases in the United States and away from efforts by OPEC and other producers to support prices by cutting supplies. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading at $55.56 per barrel at 10:43 a.m. EST (1543 GMT), down 68 cents from their previous close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at 53.25 a barrel, down 53 cents. U.S. crude is poised to gain nearly 2 percent on the week. “We’re in a holding pattern at this point in time,” said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Private Client Group. “Supply is a big factor right now and you have the U.S. really filling that gap that OPEC has left open.” Prices had risen during Asian trading, though activity was thin due to the start of the Lunar New Year holiday in much of that region, including China and Singapore. During U.S. trading, the market pulled back as traders brace for another potential uptick in U.S. production when the Baker Hughes rig count data is released at 1 p.m. EST. Growing domestic production is expected to offset proposed global cuts. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 to relieve a two-year supply overhang. But U.S. oil production has been rising, with the International Energy Agency forecasting total U.S. output growth of 320,000 bpd in 2017 to an average of 12.8 million bpd. Analysts said investors who bet on rising prices were taking profit in advance of U.S. rig count data due later in the day from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, which could signal further increases in U.S. production. Oil research firm PetroMatrix said the rig count data, “will be a weekend risk as another surge will negatively impact the start of next week.” There were fundamental factors that impacted prices this week, such as gains in Iran’s monthly oil exports in February and resilient production in Libya. A glitch in North Sea Buzzard crude production provided support. But market participants warned of more volatility ahead as speculators react to even small developments in the physical markets. “Given that speculative net long positions in Brent and WTI are already at a record-high level, the correction potential is therefore growing all the time,” Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said in a note.

U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists. Chevron fell 2 percent to $114.21 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. Starbucks dropped 4 percent to $56.12 after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. The stock weighed the most on the Nasdaq. "Earnings have really just been fine," said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in San Francisco. "They haven't been too hot, nor have there been any concerns or cautionary flags raised. I think fine might not be enough in the near term and there is a growing concern that while the numbers have been good, the forward guidance have been just okay." However, the Dow stayed above 20,000 for the third straight day after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday, helped by the reignition of the post-election rally earlier this week. All three major indexes were also on track to post weekly gains. Still, investors retreated to a wait-and-see mode as they sought more clarity on President Donald Trump's policies and the new administration's ability to clear legislature hurdles in its quest to reduce regulation and cut taxes. "There's definitely a gap between expectations and reality. I think the new administration has probably until the summer time to show some forward momentum and progress on getting policy changed and implemented through Congress." said Lyon. At 10:55 a.m. ET (1555 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 18.56 points, or 0.09 percent, at 20,082.35. The S&P 500 was down 3.39 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,293.29. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.63 points, or 0.03 percent, at 5,653.55. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the energy index's 0.77 percent fall leading the decliners. Microsoft rose 2.1 percent to $65.59, while Intel gained 1.8 percent to $38.24 after the two companies reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. However, Google parent Alphabet was down 0.4 percent at $853.40 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. Colgate-Palmolive fell 6.8 percent to $63.59 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,691 to 1,062. On the Nasdaq, 1,476 issues fell and 1,090 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 18 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 73 new highs and 20 new lows.

By Arliss Coates @ Econsultancy 0 comments As we approach the early 2017 launch date of Zelle, an inter-bank peer-to-peer payment system a la Paypal and Venmo, online banking customers remain unaware of the coming feature. It could be that banking is about to take a major and disruptive step toward digital, but how are digital transactors supposed to catch on to Zelle without a prior marketing campaign? Though it was in August of 2016 that the Wall Street Journal first broke word of the banks' coming "Venmo-killer," spasmodic coverage by a few publications in August and October has slackened to total media silence in the time since. My own cursory quizzing of colleagues and tech-savvy friends on the existence of Zelle mostly confirms what one might expect: no one has heard of this thing. As advertising in American banking goes, Zelle's understated introduction to the world is a definite departure from the norm; JPMorganChase, promoting a payment feature much like Zelle, though exclusively for Chase customers, launched a sweepstakes to promote awareness, while Bank of America takes care to promote the updates to its mobile app with large red letters on the BoA homepage. As TechCrunch reported in October, the current list of banks enrolled in the Zelle program includes the United States' four largest - JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup - as well as Ally Bank, BB&T, BECU, Capital One, Fifth Third Bank, FirstBank, First Tech Federal Credit Union, Frost Bank, Morgan Stanley, PNC, USAA, and U.S. Bank. That's an impressive lineup! But more importantly, most Venmo users don't know why Venmo needs fixing. As it happens, the near ubiquitous app has two major security problems: Account theft Venmo is an app, and apps live on phones. Because users often leave themselves logged into Venmo, fortunate phone thieves sometimes find themselves in possession of more than just an expensive device. Worse still, Venmo users who connect their credit cards, debit cards and/or routing numbers to the app may find themselves robbed of larger sums than just their Venmo balances. Cases like that of Chris Grey, a New York web developer who discovered the theft of $2,850 from his routing number-linked Venmo account, should give pause to those looking for easier ways to transact from their mobile phones. The bogus check method As others have pointed out, Venmo is not instantaneous, though it would like you to believe that it is.   Its "so-and-so has paid you x for y" message leads many to believe that transactions performed through the app move money the moment a user presses the pay button. In fact, Venmo transactions take a couple of days to process, and are therefore more similar to checks than to QuickPay systems like the one Chase bank provides its customers for intra-bank use. Taking advantage of this common misunderstanding of Venmo's operating procedure, fraudsters cheat vendors the same way one would with a bogus check. The practice of "paying" for a service, receiving the service, and then cancelling payment before the transaction can be processed is the reason Venmo encourages users to limit their use of the app to transferring funds between friends, relatives, and trusted acquiantances. What Zelle's pitch should be By being a non third-party service, Zelle largely solves the former problem, and by being truly instantaneous in its transactions, completely solves the latter. It's hard to see how adopting Zelle wouldn't be a good idea. This makes the decision by Zelle's backers not to inform the public of Venmo's flaws through an information campaign an odd one. The PayPal-owned app already defends itself from a position of strength, enjoying a good amount of brand loyalty from its users, as Fortune points out. Furthermore, Venmo's customer base is millennial. Even without millennial antipathy to the banking sector, the 18-40 year old market is notoriously tough to win over. Digital marketers, take note - it will be an instruction to watch how this banking alliance tackles a tough set of marketing problems after a bad start.

SOME': Comments of the week Why the JPM-Intuit partnership is a big step for data sharing BankThink Uncertainty about CFPB shouldn’t hurt progress over data access search goes here BankThink One-off data-sharing deals aren't enough By Jennifer Tescher Beth Brockland Published January 27 2017, 9:30am EST More in APIs Data sharing Fintech Print Email Reprints Share Share on More than ever, people are using newer digital tools to help them manage their finances. Whether it’s using financial management apps like Mint or Albert to track their spending or relying on Digit to help them set aside savings, Americans have grown accustomed to real-time access to their financial information. Gone are the days of waiting 30 days for the next bank statement or keeping a shoebox full of receipts. The growing popularity of these digital tools has raised questions from both bankers and policymakers about the technology that powers them. In the fall of 2015, The Wall Street Journal reported that several major financial institutions temporarily shut off access to third-party data aggregators. The banks claimed the aggregators put customers’ bank accounts at risk and created unpredictable, and sometimes unmanageable, loads on banks’ servers. In response to these and similar reports, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, citing its authority under Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, issued a Request for Information in October to better understand how data aggregation technology works and what the benefits — and risks — are for consumers. Thus far, much of the focus in the debate has been on the risks of using consumers’ login credentials to collect their data from their bank accounts (a method often referred to as screen scraping). Most seem to agree that the industry needs to move toward more secure solutions. Increasingly, banks are developing application programming interfaces to make their customers’ data available to third parties, either on open platforms or through one-on-one relationships with data aggregators or specific apps. The latest example is the data-sharing agreement between JPMorgan Chase and Intuit – an agreement that enables users of Intuit products to authorize the bank to share their financial information without providing their bank login credentials. Last summer, a similar deal was announced by Wells Fargo and the accounting software provider Xero. Many more deals are likely in the works. This trend holds promise for consumers and for the data-sharing ecosystem. Direct data feeds via APIs can be more reliable and secure than other methods of data access, collection and transmission. But an end-state that involves innumerable one-off deals between banks and third parties would be a bad outcome for consumers and for the industry as a whole. We need a broader set of industrywide standards and best practices if we are to arrive at solutions that support consumer choice and innovation. Consumers benefit from having a choice of financial providers — and this includes both their banking relationships and the apps they use to manage their financial lives. Yet consumer choice is severely limited when smaller institutions, like community banks or credit unions, can’t connect with digital tools like Mint or Digit. Today, screen scraping is the only technology that enables all of the thousands of small financial institutions to participate in the data-sharing ecosystem. Most small institutions lack the resources to invest in developing APIs or negotiate individual deals with countless fintech apps. Industrywide collaboration is needed to develop solutions that are inclusive of smaller financial institutions and their customers. Without broader industry coordination around standards and best practices, consumer choice suffers in another way. Having to code to numerous banks’ API specifications and negotiate individually with each of the companies would be a nearly impossible task for a young startup. Of course, banks have a significant interest in ensuring that the third parties accessing their systems are legitimate actors that have the technical and operational capacity to keep customer data safe. There is likely a role for vetting and certification of trusted actors in the ecosystem. But there are clear benefits to innovation, and ultimately to consumer choice, when there are common standards and protocols available to anyone with a new product idea. These are thorny issues, but they are not insurmountable. The industry can come together to develop shared standards and protocols that will lead to greater transparency, trust and inclusiveness in the system. The Center for Financial Services Innovation has proposed a set of consumer-focused principles for data sharing that provides a starting point. Data aggregators likely have an important role to play as intermediaries between banks and third-party apps, particularly when it comes to vetting. With its authority under Section 1033, the CFPB can also play a constructive role through principles-based guidance that ensures consumers’ interests are at the center of any proposed solution. In today’s increasingly digital world, having access to all of one’s financial data in one place is no longer a nice-to-have. What’s more, consumers need to trust that their data is up-to-date, accurate and complete (not to mention that it’s secure) when making financial decisions based on an app’s recommendation. The industry needs to come together to ensure that this is the rule. Jennifer Tescher Jennifer Tescher is president and CEO of Center for Financial Services Innovation.

News Business Business News Nigeria seizes $1.2bn oil field and announces prosecution of Shell and Eni for alleged corruption Court says Anglo-Dutch company, along with Italy's Eni bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" Michelle Faul Friday 27 January 2017 17:06 BST Click to follow The Independent Online The Nigerian government says it only received $210m from the deal with the rest of the money appropriated by a corrupt official Reuters Nigeria is seizing back one of Africa's richest oil blocs and will prosecute petroleum giants Shell and Eni in a $1.2 billion corruption scandal that has drawn investigators from the United States, Italy, France, Switzerland and Holland, according to a Nigerian Federal High Court document. The court on Thursday ceded control of Oil Prospecting Licence 245 to the government while the West African country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission investigates and prosecutes suspects in the "Malabu Oil scam," according to a statement from the commission. The commission's petition to the court says Dutch-British corporation Shell and Italian Agip — now Eni — bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" and that the $1.2bn payment to former petroleum minister Dan Etete and his allies was a bribe. The state oil company got only $210m from the deal. Read more Nigeria's Borno region faces world's worst food crisis, Unicef warns The government is preparing further charges of "conspiracy, bribery, official corruption and money-laundering" against Shell and Eni, the petition says. Criminal charges already have been filed against both companies and several executives in an Italian court in Milan. Read more Shell pays out bumper £11.1bn dividends in 2016 thanks to Brexit Shell to tie executive bonuses to climate goals Shell says oil demand could peak in five years "This is historic. Generations of Nigerians have been robbed of life-saving services while oil men have grown rich at their expense," said Simon Taylor of the anti-corruption body Global Witness. "Companies and their investors must understand they can no longer do backdoor deals with corrupt officials without paying a hefty price." Eni has not received notification of the court order, spokesman Roberto Carlo Albini told The Associated Press. "Eni denies any wrongdoing," he said. Shell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Olugbenga Odugbesan said he had no comment. The oil companies paid the $1.2bn into a Nigerian government escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase, and former justice minister Mohammed Bello Adoke authorised its distribution. The commission last month filed charges of fraud and money laundering against Etete, Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar.

The Dow’s gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. “Earnings have come in strong, for sure,” said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don’t go up or down in a straight line.” The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. The Dow rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 lost 6.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,375.60. It’s been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration’s policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. On Thursday, the stock indexes wavered between small gains and losses for most of the day as investors sized up the latest company earnings news. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Traders welcomed an optimistic 2017 forecast and good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator’s stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 percent, to $95.64. New Commerce Department data indicating sales of new U.S. homes fell 10.4 percent in December didn’t weigh on PulteGroup. The homebuilder’s quarterly earnings and sales beat financial analysts’ estimates, lifting its shares 74 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $21.18. United Rentals led the gainers in the S&P 500. The equipment rentals company announced it would acquire construction company NES Rentals for $965 million. United Rentals vaulted $12.80, or 11.2 percent, to $127.06. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel’s latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 percent, to $25.99. Investors also were put off by McKesson’s fiscal third-quarter results, which were hurt by weaker-than-expected prices. McKesson lost $12.55, or 8.3 percent, to $138.55. Whirlpool tumbled 8.5 percent after the appliance maker said Britain’s impending departure from the European Union hurt its profits. The stock fell $16.26 to $173.94. Beyond the ongoing wave of company earnings reports, investors will be looking Friday to a key gauge of the U.S. economy’s health when the Commerce Department delivers its estimate of what the nation’s gross domestic product was in the final quarter of 2016. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Thursday. Germany’s DAX rose 0.4 percent, while the CAC-40 in France slipped 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was flat. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 surged 1.8 percent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.8 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 1.4 percent. Markets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea and other Asian countries are about to begin holidays of varying lengths to mark the lunar new year, curtailing trading across much of the region. Bond prices rose. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 2.50 percent from 2.52 percent late Wednesday. The dollar increased to 114.42 yen from 113.60 on Wednesday. The euro fell to $1.0692 from $1.0743. Energy prices moved broadly higher. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose $1.03, or 2 percent, to close at $53.78 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.16, or 2.1 percent, to close at $56.24 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.54 a gallon, while heating oil added 3 cents to $1.64 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $3.38 per 1,000 cubic feet. In other commodity trading, the price of gold fell $8, or 0.7 percent, to $1,189.80 an ounce. Silver slid 13 cents to $16.85 an ounce. Copper gave up 4 cents to $2.67 a pound.     Tags: percent, earnings, company, index, cents, stock, Other stories from today: Indexes drift down; Dow ekes out gain PayPal meets 4Q profit forecasts How did the Dow get to 20,000?

(TSLA) Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) (BK) Cut to Hold at Zacks Investment Research January 27th, 2017 - 0 comments - Filed Under - by Latisha Jones Filed Under: Analyst Articles - US - Finance Tweet Zacks Investment Research cut shares of Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) (NYSE:BK) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research note published on Tuesday. According to Zacks, “BNY Mellon's shares underperformed the Zacks categorized Major Regional Banks industry, over the last one year. However, strong fundamentals should help the stock perform better in the coming days. Moreover, the company’s fourth-quarter 2016 earnings improved year over year, driven by a rise in total revenue along with lower expenses. The company’s cost-saving initiatives along with improving revenues should further support profitability in the long run. Also, the gradual ease in margins is expected to support top-line in the quarters ahead. Nonetheless, BNY Mellon is largely dependent on fee income as a source of revenue. This is likely to create concentration risks, thereby affecting its financial position. Also, the adverse impact of various financial reform laws on profitability remains a key concern for the company.” BK has been the subject of several other research reports.

Homes to float on Dubai Water Canal Dubai brokers netted Dh1.5b commissions in 2016 Money Visas Analysis5 Sport Opinion Leisure Life&Style Culture Guides Multimedia Your Say In Focus Don’t be fooled by the VIX 2017 is shaping up as volatile year Published: 15:42 January 27, 2017 By Eric Lam and Will Davies, Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE The world’s most famous measure of volatility in financial markets is flashing a sign akin to boredom “- languishing around levels that prevailed before the global crisis. Problem is, the VIX is tied to the US S&P500 index. Take a step back to look at the global picture, and the early days of 2017 are showing elevated jumpiness similar to that seen in the past two years. Emerging-market currencies lead the pack, illustrating both the dangers and potential returns from investing in assets ranging from Egypt’s pound to China’s yuan. An investigation into price fluctuations across financial markets over the past two decades by Bloomberg shows how the beginnings of the past two years have had the biggest volatility since 2009, when the world was reeling from the Lehman shock and the money market breakdown it unleashed. Volatility is likely to trend higher through the course of the year as markets react to a range of unknowns, not least the impact of US. President Donald Trump’s agenda, observers say. Economic policy structures are being reshaped in ways unseen perhaps since before World War II, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists said in putting a premium on liquidity in new US stock portfolios. “I don’t think investors have really felt like volatility is falling relative to the last couple of years,” Stuart Rumble, investment director with the multi-asset team at Fidelity International, said in a phone interview from Hong Kong. “We’ve seen such a dominant trend over the last couple of months in markets, as investors have been positioning for economic growth and higher inflation following the US election.” Looking at 250 assets across market classes that include equities, sovereign bonds and commodities, eight currencies were volatility outliers based on their year-to-date price swings, or Z-scores, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Jan. 20. A Z-score is a normalised measure based on price standard deviation, which gauges a security’s moves compared with a longer-term average (1997 to 2017). For all the disruptions Trump has brought to long-standing US policies and practices “- from trade to regulation “- this month is still somewhat less volatile than the past two Januaries. Markets were roiled by confusion over China’s currency tactics and stock slide at the start of 2016 and by Switzerland’s surprise removal of a cap on the franc in early 2015. Three weeks into 2016, there were 19 outliers: 16 currencies and three benchmark equity indexes. At the same stage in 2015, there were 10. That followed a five-year period of relative calm preceded by an eye-popping 53 outliers at the start of 2009. The Egyptian pound shows up as the most volatile asset in the study’s universe so far this year. With a Z-score of 4.15, it has been more than twice as volatile as the digital currency bitcoin and six times more jumpy than the Bloomberg Dollar Index. To be classified as an outlier in this study, an asset needs an absolute Z-score of 2.575 or more, which means its movements have less than a 1 per cent chance of happening. The greater the score, the greater the volatility. Looking just at the commodity sphere, lean hog futures posted a Z-score of 1.86, making them the most volatile in that group. Hogs also led the commodity herd in early 2013 and 2015. While a global sell-off in bonds since Trump’s presidential election victory spurred some to call the end of a three-decade bull run in debt, sovereign securities don’t stand out as volatile based on their Z-score calculations. On the policy front, one danger for investors to be aware of is that, unlike in past years, central banks may not be the security blanket during times of volatility that they have been. “Investors can no longer anticipate that automatic response of additional monetary policy when economies or markets take a downturn,” Rumble said. “That’s really what’s different going forward over the next several years, and it means when we see those key risk events, we could see some shock and volatility.” More from Markets Wall Street slightly lower at open Yes Bank turns Rana Kapoor into billionaire Stock research moves past PDFs Bunds set for worst week since US election Gold posts longest slump of 2017 US stock indexes edge higher in early trading Qatar Investment Fund Q4 NAV falls Credit Suisse stays overweight on UAE indices tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNDonald Trump follow this tag on MGNSwitzerland follow this tag on MGNChina follow this tag on MGNEgypt follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsMarkets tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDonald Trump follow this tag on MGN+ MGNSwitzerland follow this tag on MGN+ MGNChina follow this tag on MGN+ MGNEgypt follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In MarketsWall Street slightly lower at open Business Gallery Highlights: SIHH luxury watch show Highlights: Detroit Auto Show Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Stock Look Up Search Latest share prices Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Gold hits 2-month high on Trump uncertainty 02UAE markets to remain closed on Sunday 03Trump trade talk fuels yen rally Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Inside Emirates airline's engineering hangar Sep 20, 2015 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 20Images Highlights: SIHH luxury watch show Jan 18, 2017 9Images Pictures: Mohammad Bin Zayed in Mumbai Feb 13, 2016 34Images Dubai Shopping Festival 2012 in pictures Jan 31, 2012 10Images LG unveils flagship V20 smartphone Sep 07, 2016 Markets International Commodity Prices Error - No Data As on 2017-01-28 11:30:28 Most Popular on Gulf News Mohammad concludes three-day India visit No visa-free facility for Indians here...

AP Photo/Mark Lennihan Hong Kong - The world's most famous measure of volatility in financial markets is flashing a sign akin to boredom — languishing around levels that prevailed before the global crisis. Problem is, the VIX is tied to the US S&P 500 index. Take a step back to look at the global picture, and the early days of 2017 are showing elevated jumpiness similar to that seen in the past two years.  Emerging-market currencies lead the pack, illustrating both the dangers and potential returns from investing in assets ranging from Egypt's pound to China's yuan. An investigation into price fluctuations across financial markets over the past two decades by Bloomberg shows how the beginnings of the past two years have had the biggest volatility since 2009, when the world was reeling from the Lehman shock and the money-market breakdown it unleashed. Volatility is likely to trend higher through the course of the year as markets react to a range of unknowns, not least the impact of US President Donald Trump's agenda, observers say. Economic policy structures are being reshaped in ways unseen perhaps since before World War II, JPMorgan Chase & Co strategists said in putting a premium on liquidity in new US stock portfolios. "I don't think investors have really felt like volatility is falling relative to the last couple of years," Stuart Rumble, investment director with the multi-asset team at Fidelity International, said in a phone interview from Hong Kong. "We've seen such a dominant trend over the last couple of months in markets, as investors have been positioning for economic growth and higher inflation following the US election."Looking at 250 assets across market classes that include equities, sovereign bonds and commodities, eight currencies were volatility outliers based on their year-to-date price swings, or Z-scores, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Jan. 20. A Z-score is a normalized measure based on price standard deviation, which gauges a security's moves compared with a longer-term average (1997 to 2017).  For all the disruptions Trump has brought to longstanding US policies and practices — from trade to regulation — this month is still somewhat less volatile than the past two Januaries. Markets were roiled by confusion over China's currency tactics and stock slide at the start of 2016 and by Switzerland's surprise removal of a cap on the franc in early 2015. Three weeks into 2016, there were 19 outliers: 16 currencies and three benchmark equity indexes. At the same stage in 2015, there were 10. That followed a five-year period of relative calm preceded by an eye-popping 53 outliers at the start of 2009.  The Egyptian pound shows up as the most volatile asset in the study's universe so far this year. With a Z-score of 4.15, it has been more than twice as volatile as the digital currency bitcoin and six times more jumpy than the Bloomberg Dollar Index. To be classified as an outlier in this study, an asset needs an absolute Z-score of 2.575 or more, which means its movements have less than a 1 percent chance of happening. The greater the score, the greater the volatility.  Looking just at the commodity sphere, lean hog futures posted a Z-score of 1.86, making them the most volatile in that group. Hogs also led the commodity herd in early 2013 and 2015. Argentina's Merval Index, which hit a record high this week, is the most volatile of equity indices for the second year in a row. It had a z-score of  1.84 this year and 3.62 in the first three weeks of 2016, shortly after new president Mauricio Macri let the peso float freely. While a global selloff in bonds since Trump's presidential election victory spurred some to call the end of a three-decade bull run in debt, sovereign securities don't stand out as volatile based on their Z-score calculations. On the policy front, one danger for investors to be aware of is that, unlike in past years, central banks may not be the security blanket during times of volatility that they have been. "Investors can no longer anticipate that automatic response of additional monetary policy when economies or markets take a downturn," Rumble said. "That's really what's different going forward over the next several years, and it means when we see those key risk events, we could see some shock and volatility."

Image: wk1003mike/Shutterstock As phishing attacks have risen, so too has the backing of email security start-ups. In 2006, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe introduced Data Protection Day to the calendar, marking out 28 January as a day to raise awareness of data protection and inform citizens of their rights and of good practices. While this kind of awareness campaigning can inform users on why and how their personal data is managed and processed by faceless software programmes, data awareness must also take into account the responsibility of the user in protecting information. This is most apparent in the case of phishing scams, which have been the undoing of many a massive corporation and political organisation in recent times. User awareness will help the cause of data protection, but human error will always pose a risk. And so, to counter the rampant scamming, we can turn to security software to help. This month, 10 email security start-ups were singled out by CB Insights as ‘ones to watch in 2017’. The shortlist was derived from CB Insights data and a predictive algorithm called Mosaic, which is funded by the US National Science Foundation. Mosaic uses machine learning and advanced language processing to determine a company’s health based on obvious signals such as financial strength and market viability, as well as non-traditional signals such as momentum. This spread of data offers a better measure of emerging companies with less historic data to go on. That said, the companies below range from early-stage start-ups to more established brands stepping up from funding round to funding round. All have raised at least $1m, and each and every one of them obtained funding in the last year – a testament to their current relevance. We wanted to know more about these need-to-know companies, and here’s what we found. Ionic Security Based in Atlanta, Georgia, Ionic Security is a data security start-up that has already attracted some significant investors. Founded by Adam Ghetti in 2011, the start-up helps employees of major companies protect their personal data, but also that of the company, using a specifically tailored dashboard. .@PwC_LLP is working with Ionic Security to control and protect data no matter where it goes and on any device.https://t.co/uWEeNzOBUt — Ionic Security (@IonicSecurity) October 25, 2016 In its five years, Ionic Security has accumulated $122m in funding, most recently with a $45m Series D investment in July 2016 led by funders including Amazon and Goldman Sachs. Previous investors include Google Ventures and other major VC firms like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, allowing the company to double in size to more than 200 employees. PhishMe In 2011, Rohyt Belani and Aaron Higbee came together to launch PhishMe, a Virginia start-up that saw the rapid rise in the number of phishing attempts made against both the general public and companies in particular. PhishMe clients are provided a set of tools to help employees spot malicious phishing emails, and also to help flag them immediately with a relevant cybersecurity team. The company had its largest funding round to date in July of 2016 when it raised $42.5m as part of an investment led by Paladin Capital Group, to help it expand its range of products and research. Agari Data Having raised almost $44m across four funding rounds to date, California-based Agari Data’s main product is its Agari Email Trust Platform.

KnowBe4 Founded in 2010 by Stu Sjouwerman, KnowBe4 offers security awareness training for employees as well as phishing tests to check the security of organisations.

Last summer, Votiro raised $4m in a Series A round led by Redfield Asset Management. GreatHorn Based in Belmont, Massachusetts, GreatHorn was founded in 2015 by Kevin O’Brien and Raymond Wallace. The company focuses on cybersecurity for cloud communications infrastructure. GreatHorn focuses on two converging trends: the rapid adoption of cloud infrastructure for core business services, like email, as well as the increase in data breaches through spear-phishing attacks. The company’s product can be integrated into platforms like Office 365.

Jones industrial average inched further into record territory Thursday, eking out a gain while the broader U.S. market indexes drifted lower. The Dow’s gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. “Earnings have come in strong, for sure,” said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don’t go up or down in a straight line.” The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. The Dow rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 lost 6.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,375.60. It’s been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration’s policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Traders welcomed good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator’s stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 percent, to $95.64. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel’s latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 percent, to $25.99.

 We asked pharma executives the one question they didn't want to hear about drug pricing Lydia Ramsey Jan. 23, 2017, 11:46 AM 3,580 facebook linkedin twitter email print Skye Gould/Business Insider It's shaping up to be another rough year for the drug industry. At his first press conference since being elected, on Jan. 11, President Donald Trump said drug companies are "getting away with murder," and suggested that the US government needs to negotiate drug prices.  Biotech and pharma stocks fell on the comments and haven't really recovered. Investors might fear that a tweet from the president attacking a company over a high drug price could hit at any moment. It's not just Trump, of course: the public's been upset about the rising cost of drugs for the past few years. The outrage started with "bad apples" that were taking extreme measures to jack up prices, but slowly expanded to hit companies where list-price increases are routine. Several politicians, both Democrat and Republican, have spoken out about this. To counter that pressure, a handful of companies have already committed to sticking to only single-digit price increases on their drugs, and only increasing those prices once a year.  So, during the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco this month, Business Insider spoke to drug company executives about how their jobs would be impacted if the price increases that the industry takes every year—  sometimes twice a year or even quarterly — stopped being standard practice. Some insisted it wouldn't change their jobs or their companies because their growth is driven by volume instead of price increases Others brought up the need to start pricing better right off the bat when a drug gets on the market Many pointed to the discrepancy between high-rising list prices and either declining or similar net prices thanks to other players in the supply chain Keeping investors interested Drug development is a risky business, and often hypotheses don't pan out and a drug fails in clinical trials. It means investors need other reasons to back companies, and routine price increases are a way to ensure that those investors will stay interested. Removing price hikes from the business model could mean that research and development budgets within major drugmakers could get hit, as well as investor interest in very early-stage projects that could be a decade or two away from reaching the market, some executives warned. "There's a wellspring of innovation that needs to be fed coming out of the academic community in order for us have the foundation to build up the therapies of tomorrow," Scott Brun, head of AbbVie Ventures, the drugmaker's venture arm, told Business Insider.  "You need people willing to invest in that, or they're going to invest in something else." To do that, he said, there are some questions that would need to be answered, including making sure those investors have enough certainty to stick around despite the risks associated with development. If investors do leave to fund more sure bets, he said, "I think we will all lose as a consequence there." List price increases don't always translate to growth Another common defense on the issue of drug prices is to point to all the other parts of the system of getting a drug to a patient. It's true, drugmakers are part of a complex system, filled with middlemen who all get a piece of a drug's sale, and they say that system means they don't actually profit off of price hikes. So, stagnant drug prices, without any other change to the system, would just erode their profits to the pharma companies. Drugmakers pay rebates out to pharmacy benefits managers and insurance companies, and those rebates are increasing in part just so the companies can ensure their drug is kept on the list of approved drugs for a certain treatment.   Enrique Conterno, the president of Lilly's diabetes unit, offered up an example. Lilly makes Humalog — an insulin that's seen it's price steadily increase. Conterno said that the net price for Humalog, or what the drugmaker actually collects, was down 24% in the third-quarter of 2016, from the third-quarter of 2015.  Right now, there isn't a great alternative to the middlemen though, both for the drugmakers and the employers and insurance companies who count on pharmacy benefits managers.  A Type 1 diabetes patient holds up bottles of insulin. Reuters/Lucy Nicholson "I was asked a question why doesn't the whole industry just price at a different level and not do all these rebates," Horizon Pharma CEO Tim Walbert said. "And I think everyone would give the same answer: If I could just make my medicine and get it to the consumer directly, we all would." Many executives Business Insider spoke to said their businesses are driven by the volume of prescriptions they make for patients, rather than price increases. So even if list prices were to stay the same after they were originally set, the growing payout to the middlemen would mean profit erosion at the drugmaker.  Setting an initial price so high that doesn't need to be increased In the debate over drug prices, there have been two kinds of drugs that have grabbed headlines: the new drugs start out with astoundingly high prices (think of the hepatitis C treatment that has a $84,000 list price), and old drugs that have seen their price climb — suddenly or steadily over the years — (like the EpiPen, or the prices of insulin).  One response to a hypothetical world without price increases would simply be to set an initial price that is so high that it'll just reflect any foregone hikes. There are some drugs that are already priced this way, but right now the prices for those are extraordinary — think hundreds of thousands — and Big Pharma's trade organization, called PhRMA, has a new ad campaign that launched Monday to try and explain where these come from. "It's really a question of what is the initial price," said Jan Lundberg, Lilly's executive vice president of science and technology and the president of Lilly Research labs. "Our aim is to have differentiated products that can motivate a very good starting price and that's what we clearly do." Sean McCarthy, CEO of CytomX, a biotech that's developing safer ways to administer cancer immunotherapies, echoed that the initial price setting is a key issue. "I think that we need to pay a lot more attention to where we initially set price." Secretary Health and Human Secretary nominee Tom Price Alex Wong/Getty Images Will we see legislative changes to the way drugs are priced? In this hypothetical situation, the conversation was more around self-policing and changes at the company level. But Trump has said he wants to have the US negotiate prices and importing drugs from Canada, which would mean that that the way drugs are priced drastically changes.  But negotiating drug prices for Medicare wasn't something Trump's HHS pick Tom Price would commit to in a hearing Wednesday despite being pushed on it by Democratic senators. Analysts have noted that it's not a part of the Republican's healthcare plan, but with drug pricing striking such a chord with Trump, it's only a matter of time before a tweet or another soundbite sends biotech stocks into even more uncertainty.  SEE ALSO: Donald Trump just took the joy out of the drug industry's biggest investor conference DON'T MISS: A Nevada woman died from a bug that resisted 26 antibiotics — here's why it's so hard to develop new ones NOW WATCH: Here's the massive gap in average income between the top 1% and the bottom 99% in every state Loading video...

Rudin Management and Boston Properties landed a $250 million loan for Dock 72, their tech-focused office building at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The developers secured financing for the $410 million project from J.P. Morgan Chase, M&T Bank Corp. and U.S. Bank, the Wall Street Journal reported. Rudin and Boston Properties broke ground on the 16-story building at 652 Kent Avenue last year. The 675,000-square-foot building will be anchored by WeWork, which agreed to lease 222,000 square feet. Asking rents in the 17-story building will be between $60 and $70 per square foot, Rudin Management vice president Michael Rudin previously said. The developers acquired a 99-year ground lease for the property in 2015. Dock 72 is part of the massive 4.5 million-square-foot redevelopment of the area. Dock 72 is set to be complete in early 2018.

Photograph: Matt Mawson/Getty Images Cities is supported by About this content Kate Connolly in Frankfurt Friday 27 January 2017 02.15 EST Last modified on Friday 27 January 2017 14.07 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close In the heart of the Frankfurt banking district of Westend, Luise Hoepfner serves a steady stream of office workers her lunchtime menu of organic salads, soups and spelt-flour savoury tarts. The 28-year-old worked in event management for several years before opening her restaurant Vif (old German for “chipper” or “lively”) on Mendelssohnstrasse in September. “I am convinced this is the right time to invest in Frankfurt,” Hoepfner says. “It’s cheaper than London – just – and it’s growing all the time. When Brexit happens, whatever form that takes, it will only increase the demand.” With a shabby-chic interior that would not look out of place in Greenwich Village or Brick Lane, Vif offers quite a contrast to the stereotypical view of Germany’s banking capital (and home of the European Central Bank) as a dull, boring, grey-suited metropolis. The age-old German afternoon tradition of kaffee und kuchen (coffee and cake) attracts customers in the afternoon, and a fridge is full of rieslings, craft beers and ciders for after-work gatherings. “I heard British bankers like their craft beers,” Hoepfner says. This city of more than 730,000 inhabitants is quietly gearing itself up for Brexit – even if, like everyone else, it doesn’t yet know what that might entail. While publicly at least, the Germans have been reluctant to appear to be “cashing in” on what London stands to lose if it can no longer serve as the financial hub for global firms looking to do business in the EU, there are growing indications that Frankfurt cannot fail to gain. Frankfurt is the cocaine capital of Germany, with an important electronic music scene Anonymous banker A recent research paper by Prof Dirk Schiereck of the Technical University in Darmstadt concluded that the merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse (which commissioned the paper) increases the probability of Frankfurt securing a large chunk of post-Brexit spoils. The report predicts the German city will become “the clear European centre for financial market regulation and … the European centre for supranational risk management”. Frankfurt’s politicians and marketing board have been busy with a charm offensive, sending roadshows to London as well as setting up a walk-in information centre in the city for would-be movers. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Frankfurt is home to the headquarters of the European Central Bank. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images Meanwhile, international banks and businesses currently based in London have been sending scouts to Frankfurt in large numbers to gather information on everything from the availability of villas and international schools, to the labour laws and how easy it is to find English-speaking workers. A recent survey of 360 London bankers by the Boston Consulting Group put Frankfurt in a prime position, ahead of rivals such as Paris, Amsterdam, Dublin or Luxembourg. Its advantages were its central location, sophisticated infrastructure and property prices considerably lower than in London or Paris. And while banks and businesses have kept their cards close to their chests regarding any planned moves, there is much anecdotal evidence that some will take place before, not after, Britain’s exit. The decision announced last month by Swiss bank UBS to set up a new entity called UBS Europe SE in Frankfurt is being widely interpreted as the first major Brexit-influenced move. UBS also plans for its continental European investment banking and wealth management operations to set up shop in the German city, according to reports. The move could mean the bank shifting 1,500 people – or a third of its London staff – from the UK. Sources within Citigroup have acknowledged the investment bank is contemplating moving some of its London-based traders to Frankfurt, though there has been no official confirmation. Executives from JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, have said they are sure to move staff from London in the case of the UK losing so-called “passporting rights”, but have refused to be drawn as to which city they favour. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The new bistro Vif in Westend. Photograph: Luise Hoepfner Frankfurt itself talks of between 8,000 and 20,000 jobs moving here from London, incrementally. Real estate agents are said to be feverishly fielding property enquiries from companies, with the main question being not so much an interest in prices – which are considerably lower than in London or Paris – but the availability of luxury housing. “A CEO’s main priorities are to find out whether there are enough qualified personnel in their particular field, what is the regulation like here, how close is the airport,” says Michaela Kahle of FrankfurtRheinMain GmbH, the regional marketing agency. “They will make decisions on cost grounds. But they also want to know how many international schools we have, and what the shopping facilities are like. “In many regards, Frankfurt cannot begin to compete with London – it’s considerably smaller and quieter. An investment banker with more money than he knows what to do with might rather choose Paris or Berlin,” says Kahle. “But for families with children there’s a lot to be said for the short distances; the fact that schools, houses and living facilities are nearby, and that you can cycle from one side of the city to the other in a short time. The atmosphere is arguably more relaxed, less hectic than in London.” Florian, a 41-year-old German working in the financial sector for a major German company – who, because of the sensitivity of his role in conjunction with Brexit, did not wish his surname to be used – remembers being very unimpressed with the city on his first visit. “It was the mid 90s and I came to visit a university friend who was doing an internship with a bank. I thought it was so dull. To coin a German phrase, was as if they’d folded up the pavements.” But 20 years on, and now settled here with his psychologist wife and their two children, he can hardly imagine wanting to live anywhere else. “It has changed immensely,” he says. “It’s a very lively, international city, and becoming more so all the time.” It does not boast the vibrancy of somewhere like Berlin, he admits, “but it’s a completely different type of city.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Frankfurt’s financial district could see thousands of jobs move from London. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images From his own experience, “it’s a great place in which to combine city living and family life”. His family lives in a 1930s rented house with a small garden, three minutes’ walk from a metro station and a short commute to work in the centre of the banking district. The weekends often involve a hike in the nearby Taunus mountains. “It’s easy to manage the public transport in this city with prams and small children, unlike London, where there are a lot of barriers,” he says. As to fears that an influx of London-based bankers to Frankfurt – estimates range between 8,000 and 10,000 – might have an adverse effect on the city, Florian says: “Maybe it’ll be the case that these play hard, work hard people will also start to enjoy the slower pace and the proximity of nature. Rather than them changing Frankfurt, maybe Frankfurt will change them.” Frankfurt is not under pressure to retain its cool image like Berlin is Phoebe Escott-Kenny One banker commenting anonymously told the Guardian that while the city might lack the “frisson” of London, Frankfurt had, as he saw it, much to offer. He called it the “cocaine capital of Germany, with an important electronic music scene”. But according to David Hughes, an HR manager in an international law firm who moved to the city six years ago, “there’s probably a lot less cocaine in Frankfurt than in London. If I were working in London it would likely take wild horses to get me to Frankfurt.” He was keen to add his remark had nothing to do with the availability of cocaine. The 33-year-old Dublin native lives in a 807 sq ft, maisonette flat (monthly rent €1,100 (£940) a month with his boyfriend, a Spanish architect. “In the mornings I just hop on my bike and roll down the hill for 10 minutes to get to work. I don’t waste six hours of my week in a dirty tube.” Neither did he believe that an invasion or a trickle of bankers arriving from London would manage to change the city. “It would have to be a really massive influx to tip the balance in the social ecosystem. You pass by so many languages when you walk down the street already,” he says. The downsides of life he speaks of could actually apply to all of Germany. “Poor customer service, Sunday closing, and the lack of rugby,” he says. “After six years here they remain the most frustrating factors”. Passport to Paris? City rolls out red carpets to arrivals from Brexit London Read more Phoebe Escott-Kenny, an Australian who moved to Frankfurt in 2011, offers corporate training to German and Russian business people as well as keeping up a travel blog. “People are constantly asking me: ‘you left Australia for Frankfurt?’” she says. “The trouble with Frankfurt is that it’s not obvious if you come here with no guidance as to what it’s got going for it, it reveals itself slowly,” she says. “Frankfurt is not under pressure to retain its cool image like Berlin is.” She and her boyfriend, Dominik Felsmann, a management consultant from Stuttgart, live in Bahhofsviertel, the neighbourhood around the railway station and in the centre of the city’s red light district, which they refer to as “mini Berlin”. “Every man and his dog wants to live here,” says the 28-year-old Escott-Kenny. “It’s the most buzzing part of town. Every week a new bar or speakeasy opens up, a restaurant or a coffee shop. Six years ago you couldn’t get a decent cup of coffee, now it’s burgeoning with good cafes. The only annoyances are the dog turds and drug users’ needles outside the front door.” Dominik, her boyfriend, says he travels a lot, “so I can compare Frankfurt to other places. And I can say it’s a typical anglo-Saxon/American city in many regards, more so than Munich or Berlin. You can get your €100 steak and live in a castle or live closer to gritty real life – it depends what you want.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive here More features Topics EU referendum and Brexit Germany Europe Frankfurt holidays Foreign policy More… European Union Banking Financial sector Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The Dow’s gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. “Earnings have come in strong, for sure,” said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don’t go up or down in a straight line.” It’s been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration’s policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. On Thursday, the stock indexes wavered between small gains and losses for most of the day as investors sized up the latest company earnings news. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Traders welcomed an optimistic 2017 forecast and good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator’s stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 percent, to $95.64. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel’s latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 percent, to $25.99.

Ogg January 25, 2017 1:55 pm EST Print Email Tweet CenturyLink Inc. (NYSE: CTL) remains a rather controversial stock, even after its acquisition of Level 3 Communications Inc. (NYSE: LVLT). This carrier comes with a massive $2.16 annualized dividend, which generates a current dividend yield of 8.4%. It turns out that several analysts have been making big calls here ahead of earnings. 24/7 Wall St. has followed some of these high-yield dividend payers for years. Many of these high-yield dividend structures are often very hard to follow. After all, they can come from EBIT measures and distributable cash flows rather than from a traditional earnings per share measurement that investors are used to. CenturyLink has scheduled its earnings report for Wednesday, February 8, 2017. That leaves a couple of weeks before many things will be stated by the company. When considering this merger with CenturyLink as the acquirer, it is important to keep in mind that Level 3 has a market cap of $21.3 billion, versus $14 billion for CenturyLink. One such consideration is obviously that CenturyLink is a heavily shorted stock. At the end of December, its short interest was a massive 71,133,000 shares (over 10% of its entire float). On January 25, 2017, Jefferies raised CenturyLink’s rating to Hold from Underperform. Other analyst calls have recently been made by Merrill Lynch, S&P, JPMorgan and Macquarie. When Jefferies upgraded CenturyLink, the firm also raised its official price target to $26 from $20. In effect, the analysts now see a price that is slightly higher than the current share price, rather than one with is about 20% under the current share price. The key takeaway from Jefferies: We are upgrading shares of CenturyLink from Underperform to Hold as NOLs and synergies from the pending acquisition of Level 3 reduce the near-term risk to the dividend. The implied 8.3% dividend yield provides support for the stock, in our view. Our prior outlook hinged on challenging fundamentals and an inconsistent dividend policy. CenturyLink faces on-going secular and competitive pressures; however, the combination should lead to meaningful financial benefits and accretion. Merrill Lynch said in its most recent telecom and data center research tome: We estimate ’17 revenue of $17.2b (consensus of $17.2 billion) and EBITDA of $6.36 billion (matches consensus) …. We estimate the deal, using a blended average 5% pre-tax cost of debt, could be 44% accretive to CenturyLink’s free cash flow per share in Year 1 (2018E) …. CenturyLink announced a deal to sell the majority of its data center business to a consortium. … We will look to the call for any insight CenturyLink can provide on the potential benefits from tax reform. Standard & Poor’s issued a refresh to its research on January 21. Its rating is Buy and it has a $28 price target. S&P said at the time: Our Buy opinion reflects the pending Level 3 Communications (LVLT 54 Buy) deal, CTL’s attractive dividend stream (over 8% yield) and our view of fundamentals. We remain cautious about ongoing legacy declines and higher cash taxes next year, but see higher growth in strategic revenues. We think the pending acquisition of Level 3 Communications will further leverage CTL s balance sheet but note benefits from cost synergies, free cash flow improvement and potential usage of LVLT s near $10 billion in net operating losses (NOLs). We also think the combination offers CTL a greater geographic footprint and scale (more than 2/3 of combined revenue in strategic growth areas). Right at the start of 2017, JPMorgan raised its rating to Overweight with a $28 price target. That was based on a 9.1% dividend yield and on revenue stability. JPMorgan’s investment thesis and valuation were noted in that report as follows: We now have more confidence in the value of CenturyLink due to the positive implications of the Level 3 deal. We believe the Level 3 deal is a significant positive for CenturyLink as it brings a higher enterprise mix (~75% of pro forma revenue), increased scale, revenue and EBITDA stability, and tax protection to help CenturyLink pay its dividend. Despite the benefits, CenturyLink’s dividend yield is at record levels vs the 10 year Treasury as well as T/VZ dividend yields. … We maintain our year-end 2017 price target of $28. We reached our price target by our DCF analysis, which assumes a 0% terminal growth rate and 7.0% discount rate. At the end of December, Macquarie called the CenturyLink and Level 3 merger a “Wild Cat Merger.” Its view was a mere Neutral rating at the time, but the price target was listed as $30, compared with a current share price of $24.06. The firm did note at the time that the company’s own S-4 filing projections were slightly above its own estimates and that it sees room for upside. CenturyLink shares were last seen up 0.6% at $25.72 on Wednesday, in a 52-week range of $22.86 to $33.45 and with a consensus analyst target price of $28.08. Level 3 shares were up 0.3% to $59.15. Its 52-week range is $41.73 to $59.31, and it has a consensus target price of $62.31. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

The former Tinseltown studio boss is starting an investment fund called WndrCo LLC, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Thursday. The 66-year-old entertainment-sector heavyweight has already raised nearly $600 million for the fund, which is expected to search for acquisitions in the digital media and tech industries. The Post first reported Katzenberg’s plans for a venture capital fund on July 23. Katzenberg’s new corporate digs are listed at 9355 Wilshire Boulevard. The filings suggest that two executives will be joining Katzenberg in his latest venture — Ann Daly, the former president at his former company, DreamWorks Animation, and Sujay Jaswa, who was a chief financial officer at Dropbox. Jaswa is also a former senior adviser to JPMorgan Chase and joined Katzenberg in August, according to his LinkedIn page. The filing suggests the fund won’t accept outside investments of less than $25 million. The filing also says the firm has already booked $591.5 million in the fund. Forbes said Katzenberg’s net worth was $900 million after he sold DreamWorks Animation — creator of the Shrek character — to Comcast for $3.8 billion in 2016. Katzenberg is believed to have pocketed $391 million in proceeds from the deal. While running DreamWorks Animation, Katzenberg launched a digital content company aimed at youngsters, called AwesomenessTV. Verizon paid $159 million for a 24.5 percent stake. Hearst holds a similar stake. That firm is now part of Comcast, though DreamWorks New Media counts Katzenberg as chairman. He collects 7 percent of AwesomenessTV’s profits in perpetuity. Katzenberg might be eager to put his digital media learnings to work in the market. He was a longtime director of gaming company Zynga. With all that money already raised, perhaps Katzenberg can buy a few vowels for his fund’s name.

The Dow's gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. "Earnings have come in strong, for sure," said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don't go up or down in a straight line." The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. The Dow rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 lost 6.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,375.60. It's been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration's policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. On Thursday, the stock indexes wavered between small gains and losses for most of the day as investors sized up the latest company earnings news. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Traders welcomed an optimistic 2017 forecast and good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator's stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 percent, to $95.64. New Commerce Department data indicating sales of new U.S. homes fell 10.4 percent in December didn't weigh on PulteGroup. The homebuilder's quarterly earnings and sales beat financial analysts' estimates, lifting its shares 74 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $21.18. United Rentals led the gainers in the S&P 500. The equipment rentals company announced it would acquire construction company NES Rentals for $965 million. United Rentals vaulted $12.80, or 11.2 percent, to $127.06. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel's latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 percent, to $25.99. Investors also were put off by McKesson's fiscal third-quarter results, which were hurt by weaker-than-expected prices. McKesson lost $12.55, or 8.3 percent, to $138.55. Whirlpool tumbled 8.5 percent after the appliance maker said Britain's impending departure from the European Union hurt its profits. The stock fell $16.26 to $173.94. Beyond the ongoing wave of company earnings reports, investors will be looking Friday to a key gauge of the U.S. economy's health when the Commerce Department delivers its estimate of what the nation's gross domestic product was in the final quarter of 2016. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Thursday. Germany's DAX rose 0.4 percent, while the CAC-40 in France slipped 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was flat. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 surged 1.8 percent and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.8 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.4 percent. Markets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea and other Asian countries are about to begin holidays of varying lengths to mark the lunar new year, curtailing trading. Bond prices rose. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 2.50 percent from 2.52 percent late Wednesday. The dollar increased to 114.42 yen from 113.60 on Wednesday. The euro fell to $1.0692 from $1.0743. Energy prices moved broadly higher.

A sharper focus on the more profitable mass market is paying off for casino operators, while VIP punters are starting to return after their wings were clipped by Chinese President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on corruption. Betting in Macau rose 10 per cent last quarter to 60.4 billion patacas (US$7.6 billion). The signs of recovery are scaring away the bears. Rattled by the recent slowdown, casinos and resorts in Macau looked to middle-class tourists to revive sales. Wynn Macau’s new casino on the Cotai strip and Sands China’s Parisian -- a hotel complex with a half-size replica of the Eiffel Tower -- are attracting crowds, while restrictions on cash machine withdrawals weren’t as harsh as some had feared. Macau is set for a further boost over the week-long Lunar New Year holiday marking the start of the Year of the Rooster, which this year starts on Jan. 27. This is usually peak season for visitors. DS Kim, a Hong Kong-based analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said booking trends for junkets and hotels are upbeat and might be on track to surpass the Golden Week holiday in October last year. “We stay bullish on the sector for genuine upturns in demand, profits and cash flows in 2017 and onward,” he said. Las Vegas Sands offered a note of caution when it kicked off casino earnings season in the U.S. on Wednesday. Results missed forecasts largely because of the success of punters at the newly launched Parisian in Macau, it said. In the earnings call, the company’s president Rob Goldstein singled out one gambler in particular. “She wins every day and she is doing very well. And, she affected the numbers,” he said. Over the past 12 months, returns on a Bloomberg gauge of casino stocks were almost three times higher than those of the Hang Seng Index. In January 2016, Wynn Macau’s shares touched a record low and Sands China was trading at the lowest level since 2012. They’re up 84 per cent and 52 per cent from this time last year. Galaxy Entertainment Group, another industry leader, has jumped 72 per cent. Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam said in a recent note that Macau’s mass gaming revenue growth will peak at 15 per cent in 2019, as the Chinese travelling population grows and the opening of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and light rail transit alleviate capacity constraints and help increase visitors. Growth will taper to high single digits through 2025, Tam said. While valuations have come off November highs, when the Bloomberg Intelligence Macau Gaming index had a price-earnings multiple of 29, the highest since April 2010, the gauge is still trading at 25 times estimated earnings. “It all comes down to valuation,’’ said Angelamaria Hanlee, an analyst at China Merchants Securities (Hong Kong) Co. ”Although the long term growth looks pretty good, it’s more like the market already knows about it so I don’t think there is much room to improve.’’ Risks to the recovery include a wider smoking ban in VIP gaming areas later this year and potential for Chinese government policies restricting capital outflows. “Capital flight controls from the continued depreciation of the yuan could limit VIP growth and junket operators’ financing capabilities,” said CICC Research, which is “cautiously optimistic” on the Macau gaming sector.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Founder of Biel Crystal pays HK$2.8 billion for The Peak mansion 2 Hard times ahead for China’s economy, says Alibaba’s Jack Ma 3 Are New Zealand’s air farmers selling hope or hot air to China? 4 Trump taps ex-Hong Kong businessman for US Navy secretary 5 China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs Shared 1 Founder of Biel Crystal pays HK$2.8 billion for The Peak mansion 2 Are New Zealand’s air farmers selling hope or hot air to China? 3 Hard times ahead for China’s economy, says Alibaba’s Jack Ma 4 China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 5 Nothing to love about McDonald’s China private equity deal Commented 1 China ‘steps up preparedness for possible military conflict with US’ 2 Government slammed over HK$40m office for chief executive-elect 3 Victim loses HK$12m in city’s biggest phone scam in a year 4 Patten questions UK’s ‘sense of honour’ over city’s future 5 Beijing’s trust in me not an issue, Tsang says, as he criticises Lam Promotions Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like Hong Kong Joshua Wong hopes Netflix airing of film will raise awareness 26 Jan 2017 - 12:23am 55 Smart-home kits keep pet owners connected In partnership with: HKT PREMIER China Millions on the move in China’s Lunar New Year rush 25 Jan 2017 - 3:04pm 3 Opening hearts and minds in Cambodia Sponsored by: The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hong Kong Hong Kong denies Beijing role in seizure of Singaporean troop carriers 26 Jan 2017 - 4:13pm 70 China invests billions in the US ... who gets the most? 25 Jan 2017 - 1:36pm 2 Geopolitics Hong Kong to return seized armoured vehicles to Singapore 25 Jan 2017 - 12:24pm 87 China How does China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ match up against the TPP? 24 Jan 2017 - 11:17pm 3 China China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 23 Jan 2017 - 11:26pm 26 Lifestyle Lunar New Year feng shui: how to decorate your home Jan 25th 2017, 5:42pm Insight & Opinion Hong Kong must understand the limits of its autonomy 23 Jan 2017 - 8:49pm 17 Hong Kong CIA files reveal anxiety over Hong Kong’s future under Chinese rule 21 Jan 2017 - 11:18pm 43 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

It's been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Screens for the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq-100 are displayed at Nasdaq, Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017, in New York. It's been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) The Dow Jones industrial average inched further into record territory Thursday, eking out a gain while the broader U.S. market indexes drifted lower. The Dow's gain came a day after closing above 20,000 for the first time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index and Nasdaq composite posted small losses, snapping two days of consecutive record highs. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Financial stocks led the gainers, while health care companies lagged the most. With about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 index serving up earnings this week, the quarterly report cards continued to be a focus for investors Thursday. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "Earnings have come in strong, for sure," said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist, J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "The market continues to digest some of the earnings news, and obviously markets don't go up or down in a straight line." The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. The Dow rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 lost 6.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,375.60. It's been a record-making week on Wall Street. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, added its own milestone Wednesday after it breached the 20,000 mark for the first time. The market is getting a boost from strong company earnings and investor optimism that the Trump administration's policies on taxes, regulation and trade will be good for business. On Thursday, the stock indexes wavered between small gains and losses for most of the day as investors sized up the latest company earnings news. Several companies got a boost after they reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, including Sherwin-Williams. The paint and coatings company also said it expects to complete its $11.3 billion purchase of Valspar within 90 days after making a relatively small divestiture. The stock gained $21.58, or 7.6 percent, to $305. Traders welcomed an optimistic 2017 forecast and good bookings from Royal Caribbean Cruises. The cruise operator's stock jumped $7.97, or 9.1 percent, to $95.64. New Commerce Department data indicating sales of new U.S. homes fell 10.4 percent in December didn't weigh on PulteGroup. The homebuilder's quarterly earnings and sales beat financial analysts' estimates, lifting its shares 74 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $21.18. United Rentals led the gainers in the S&P 500. The equipment rentals company announced it would acquire construction company NES Rentals for $965 million. United Rentals vaulted $12.80, or 11.2 percent, to $127.06. A slump in toy sales over the holidays dampened Mattel's latest results. The toymaker was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.57, or 17.7 percent, to $25.99. Investors also were put off by McKesson's fiscal third-quarter results, which were hurt by weaker-than-expected prices. McKesson lost $12.55, or 8.3 percent, to $138.55. Whirlpool tumbled 8.5 percent after the appliance maker said Britain's impending departure from the European Union hurt its profits. The stock fell $16.26 to $173.94. Beyond the ongoing wave of company earnings reports, investors will be looking Friday to a key gauge of the U.S. economy's health when the Commerce Department delivers its estimate of what the nation's gross domestic product was in the final quarter of 2016. » Next page...

Nigeria seizes $1.2 bn oil bloc, says will prosecute Shell, Eni - Irish Sun Issue 028/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Nigeria seizes $1.2 bn oil bloc, says will prosecute Shell, Eni PanArmenian.Net Saturday 28th January, 2017 PanARMENIAN.Net - Nigeria is seizing back one of Africa's richest oil blocs and will prosecute petroleum giants Shell and Eni in a $1.2 billion corruption scandal that has drawn investigators from the United States, Italy, France, Switzerland and Holland, The Associated Press reports citing a Nigerian Federal High Court document. The court on Thursday, January 26 ceded control of Oil Prospecting License 245 to the government while the West African country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission investigates and prosecutes suspects in the "Malabu Oil scam," according to a statement from the commission. The commission's petition to the court says Dutch-British corporation Shell and Italian Agip - now Eni - bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" and that the $1.2 billion payment to former petroleum minister Dan Etete and his allies was a bribe. The state oil company got only $210 million from the deal. The government is preparing further charges of "conspiracy, bribery, official corruption and money-laundering" against Shell and Eni, the petition says. Criminal charges already have been filed against both companies and several executives in an Italian court in Milan. "This is historic. Generations of Nigerians have been robbed of life-saving services while oil men have grown rich at their expense," said Simon Taylor of the anti-corruption body Global Witness. "Companies and their investors must understand they can no longer do backdoor deals with corrupt officials without paying a hefty price." Eni has not received notification of the court order, spokesman Roberto Carlo Albini told The Associated Press. "Eni denies any wrongdoing," he said. Shell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Olugbenga Odugbesan said he had no comment. The oil companies paid the $1.2 billion into a Nigerian government escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase, and former justice minister Mohammed Bello Adoke authorized its distribution. The commission last month filed charges of fraud and money laundering against Etete, Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar. The petition says Nigeria's former military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and Etete used front men to form Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. and illegally awarded themselves OPL 245. After Abacha's mysterious death in 1998, the company directors and shareholding was fraudulently altered to divest Abacha's son, Mohammed, it says. The Malabu bloc was seized by the government once before, by the civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo in 2001. Malabu Oil sued and an out of court agreement returned the bloc to the company.

Featured Story Brexit dampens predictions of Irish growth DUBLIN, Ireland - The Central Bank has cut down the growth forecast for this year despite the country showing resilience to Brexit. This is due to the fact that risks lie ahead as hard Brexit deal looms large.  Moreover, Irish-owned manufacturing industries had witnessed a slackening of demand even before the sharp slump in the Sterling. According to the Central Bank, it has received 100 inquiries from U.K.-based banks and investment funds that were considering relocation to somewhere else in the EU. It has been revealed that Barclays Bank had decided that Dublin will be its main hub inside the EU after Brexit.  The bank also plans on adding about 150 staff to its operations here, in case U.K.-based finance companies lose easy access to the EU market.  This however, could lead to a rise in house prices, as foreign employees seek homes in Ireland. Chief economist at the Central Bank has noted that an influx of foreign bank personnel could affect house prices because there is a shortage of supply.  Ireland would need more than 25,000 new homes a year to meet demand. The Chief Economist said that the outlook for the Irish economy was a “mixed bag” as more jobs and wage increases would raise domestic demands, despite risks from a hard Brexit deal. The bank cut its GDP forecast to 3.3 percent from 3.6 percent because of the effect of slower global growth on Irish exports.  The bank further predicts growth to slow to 3 percent in 2018. The chief economist noted that it was “implausible” for the Irish economy to fare worse than U.K. under a hard Brexit.  Meanwhile, Barclays is making its contingency plans so it can continue serving EU clients in the case that Theresa May fails to strike a deal preserving London’s access to EU’s markets. Barclays has hired staff for positions of senior managers, derivatives specialists, currency traders, compliance and human resources staff in Dublin. Additionally, Merrion Capital reported that it is more cautious of stocks overall because of the huge rally by stock markets after the election of Donald Trump.  According to the company, U.S. tax cuts could lead to a rise in earnings of U.S. companies, however, Trump’s ‘America First’ policy may lead to higher tariffs.

The industrial average has now risen 9 percent since Election Day. Stronger U.S. economic data and optimism about Trump's business policy, among other factors, have pushed not only the Dow, but also the other major averages and small-cap stocks, higher in that time. President-elect Donald Trump speaks at the Wisconsin State Fair Exposition Center in 2016. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters But risk factors like rising valuations, a potentially strengthening dollar, and climbing interest rates could knock markets back down in the short term, experts said. Stocks have endured a sluggish period since mid-December after the initial post-election rally wore off. Rising — and Sustained — Confidence Experts said Trump's proposals, including corporate tax cuts, repatriation of cash overseas, deregulation and infrastructure spending, give investors enough hope for rising corporate earnings that the Trump enthusiasm may continue well into his administration. "The market is perceiving this as a business-friendly administration that is coming into office for the next four years. It wouldn't take much to give earnings a real boost. I think that's where the market is coming from and I think it will continue," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. While the Dow components are considerably less industrial than they used to be, most of the companies have a lot to gain from Trump's plans. He wants to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and has touted that plan in meetings with business executives since he took office. Trump will try to give companies incentives to bring cash back to the United States. Apple, for example, has $216 billion parked abroad. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase would benefit from looser financial regulations, while Exxon Mobil and Chevron could get boosts from easier energy production rules. Trump has already signaled he will be friendly to the oil and gas industry, as on Tuesday he signed executive orders to advance the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Consumer Spending Caterpillar and Boeing may see big benefits from infrastructure spending. Income tax cuts could push more consumer money to companies such as Walt Disney, Nike, and McDonald's. Those are just some examples of how Trump's proposals could help Dow component companies at a time when U.S. economic data has shown improvement. "I think that all of this together has encouraged investors, given them some semblance of hope," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at Boston Private Wealth. Still, market watchers said Trump administration policies could get derailed in ways that may quash market optimism. Some plans may not get "enacted with the same order of magnitude as expected" or not get passed "soon enough" to sustain the excitement, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. For instance, some congressional conservatives have expressed misgivings about the spending binge that Trump has proposed. He has also brought infrastructure up only sparingly since he took office. Related: What Does a Dow 20,000 Mean for Me? While key Republicans in Congress have supported Trump's corporate and personal tax cuts, it remains to be seen if they can pass his desired 15 percent business rate. Even if Trump achieves all of his desired policies, the market could see a pullback before it starts climbing again, strategists added. Major averages fell last month after the Federal Reserve hiked the federal funds rate by a quarter point. The Dow also retreated more than once recently after approaching the 20K mark. Still, strategists said that if the expectations for Trump's pro-business White House become reality, earnings could get enough of a boost to keep pushing stocks higher.

The ABA has run a formal bidding process to secure a marketplace lending partner, spokesman John Hall confirmed on Friday. He could not say which companies were under consideration because the information was confidential. Marketplace lenders like LendingClub Corp , Prosper Funding and Funding Circle connect borrowers and lenders through their platform and charge an origination fee. They are part of a broader trend of financial-technology companies upending traditional methods of banking, where customers visit brick-and-mortar branches to apply for mortgages, open investment accounts or get small business loans. To stay competitive, big banks have launched their own digital offerings or sealed individual partnerships with startups. For instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co partnered with marketplace lender On Deck Capital Inc in 2015, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc launched its own online consumer lending service this year. But smaller banks have instead relied on ABA to source vendors for technology and other services. The association mostly represents banks with less than US$250 million in assets. Such partnerships give startups access to a large network of customers, while allowing banks to improve digital offerings overnight without having to bear the development costs.

The new fund, the private-equity firm’s third, is almost double its previous pool in 2012, when it collected $8.25 billion, Adebayo Ogunlesi, GIP’s chairman, said in an interview. “The next phase is to make the case for much greater private involvement,” Ogunlesi said. “There’s a tremendous wall of capital that wants to invest in infrastructure.” GIP added 94 new investors to the fund for a total of 191. "More and more institutions are accepting that this is a distinct asset class," he said. In December, Ogunlesi was named to Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a panel of business people that includes Blackstone Group LP Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman, JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock Inc. CEO Laurence Fink. Trump, as well as Democrats, have said they have plans to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure. Both Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton campaigned on increased infrastructure spending, and Ogunlesi said that’s raised the profile of such investments to the general public. GIP’s investments have combined annual revenues of over $32 billion and employ more than 48,000 people. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

By MICHELLE FAUL Associated Press JOHANNESBURG — Nigeria is seizing back one of Africa’s richest oil blocs and will prosecute petroleum giants Shell and Eni in a $1.2 billion corruption scandal that has drawn investigators from the United States, Italy, France, Switzerland and Holland, according to a Nigerian Federal High Court document. The court on Thursday ceded control of Oil Prospecting License 245 to the government while the West African country’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission investigates and prosecutes suspects in the “Malabu Oil scam,” according to a statement from the commission. The commission’s petition to the court says Dutch-British corporation Shell and Italian Agip — now Eni — bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was “fraught with fraud” and that the $1.2 billion payment to former petroleum minister Dan Etete and his allies was a bribe. The state oil company got only $210 million from the deal. The government is preparing further charges of “conspiracy, bribery, official corruption and money-laundering” against Shell and Eni, the petition says. Criminal charges already have been filed against both companies and several executives in an Italian court in Milan. “This is historic. Generations of Nigerians have been robbed of life-saving services while oil men have grown rich at their expense,” said Simon Taylor of the anti-corruption body Global Witness. “Companies and their investors must understand they can no longer do backdoor deals with corrupt officials without paying a hefty price.” Eni has not received notification of the court order, spokesman Roberto Carlo Albini told The Associated Press. “Eni denies any wrongdoing,” he said. Shell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Olugbenga Odugbesan said he had no comment. The oil companies paid the $1.2 billion into a Nigerian government escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase, and former justice minister Mohammed Bello Adoke authorized its distribution. The commission last month filed charges of fraud and money laundering against Etete, Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar. The petition says Nigeria’s former military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and Etete used front men to form Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. and illegally awarded themselves OPL 245. After Abacha’s mysterious death in 1998, the company directors and shareholding was fraudulently altered to divest Abacha’s son, Mohammed, it says. The Malabu bloc was seized by the government once before, by the civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo in 2001. Malabu Oil sued and an out of court agreement returned the bloc to the company.

US stock indexes have been soaring since the November 8 election of Donald Trump, with the Dow rising 9 percent in just 11 weeks. The blue chip index gained 155 points to close at 20,068 on Wednesday. The Standard & Poor’s 500 and Nasdaq indexes also recorded strong gains and ended the day in record territory. Trump hailed the record-breaking close with a tweet: “Great!#Dow20K.” His senior economic adviser, the former hedge fund boss Anthony Scaramucci, congratulated Trump for the market surge, tweeting, “Stock market performance in 6 weeks following President Trump’s victory is best among all elections since 1900#ThankYouTrump.” The record close came one day after Trump issued orders aimed at removing all obstacles to the completion of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines, demonstrating his contempt for environmental concerns and the sentiments of Native American tribes and their supporters, who have been protesting for months against the Dakota project’s threat to the Standing Rock Reservation’s water supply and traditional lands. This boon to the energy and materials corporations and their Wall Street backers coincided with meetings between Trump and corporate CEOS on Monday and Tuesday at which the billionaire real estate mogul-turned president reiterated his pledge to gut health and safety and environmental regulations and slash corporate taxes. In remarks just prior to meeting Tuesday with the CEOs of the US-based auto companies, Trump promised to shift the business climate “from truly inhospitable to extremely hospitable.” He called current business regulations “out of control.” Administration officials broadly hinted that Trump would meet one of the auto bosses’ key demands by rolling back fuel efficiency standards. On Monday, Trump told a meeting of a dozen CEOs that his advisers thought “we can cut regulations 75 percent, maybe more.” Other actions Trump has taken in the five days since his inauguration include a freeze on all pending regulations and a hiring freeze for all federal agencies. While there have been certain improvements in the economic situation in the US and internationally in recent months, including signs of stronger growth in Europe and an upsurge in fourth quarter US corporate profits, these changes do not explain the extraordinarily rapid rise in the American markets. The surge began the day after Trump’s November 8 election victory, as the markets, initially shaken by the unexpected defeat of their favored candidate, Democrat Hillary Clinton, turned sharply upward, buoyed by Trump’s promises of massive tax cuts for corporations and the rich, the wholesale lifting of business regulations, a massive expansion of military spending, and the prospect of a full-scale attack on social programs. As Trump began to name one billionaire or multi-millionaire after another to his cabinet, along with ex-generals and far-right opponents of public education, Medicare and Social Security, housing assistance, environmental protections, the minimum wage and occupational health and safety, the upward spiral on Wall Street accelerated. It is barely two months since the Dow first hit 19,000. The rise stalled for several weeks while the financial elite waited to see if Trump really intended to carry out the social counterrevolution to which he had alluded during the campaign. The markets soared once again after Trump’s installation and initial pro-corporate moves. Trump is the embodiment of the American financial aristocracy, in all its brutish and violent backwardness and criminality. What the markets are celebrating is a government that in an unprecedented manner openly functions as the instrument of this oligarchy. On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal if anything understated the greed-driven euphoria in corporate and financial circles in an article headlined “CEOs Savor New Washington Status.” “For CEOs,” the Journal wrote, “the moves have sent a message that their stock is rising in Washington, with some betting that they will have a bigger say in running the country… “Along with [former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex] Tillerson at State, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross [Commerce], former Windquest Group chairwoman Betsy DeVos [Education], Andy Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurant Holdings [Labor] and former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon [Small Business Administration] have been tapped to play big roles in his administration.” The Journal could have added, among others, longtime Goldman Sachs lawyer Jay Clayton the head the main Wall Street regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The presence of three former Goldman Sachs executives in top positions in the Trump administration, in addition to Clayton, helps explain the frenzied runup in the share prices of major banks. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase together account for some 20 percent of the rise in the Dow since November 22. Trump’s plan to “make America great again” is a drive to wipe out every social gain won by the working class in the course of more than a century of struggle and return to a supposed “golden age” when the corporations could plunder and pollute the country to their heart’s content. The fraud of Trump’s “concern” for the American worker is exposed by the reality of the forces that are actually benefitting from his policies. One of the Goldman alumni chosen by Trump for top posts in his administration is Gary Cohn, the bank’s former president and chief operating officer. In return for his leaving the bank and assuming the post of director of Trump’s National Economic Council, Goldman is handing Cohn more than $285 million in bonuses, stock holdings and other investments, according to Bloomberg News. The Wall Street Journal, in an article published Tuesday titled “Bankers Cash In on Post-Election Stock Rally,” reported that executives of major Wall Street banks have sold almost $100 million worth of stock since the election, more than in that same period in any year for the past decade. In addition to the share sales, bank officials have sold another $350 million worth of stock to cover the cost of exercising stock options. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, according to the newspaper, sold 200,000 Morgan Stanley shares three days after the election, and has since sold another 385,000 shares, altogether realizing a profit of at least $8.4 million. Six Goldman Sachs executives, as well as board member and ex-finance chief David Vinar, exercised 983,000 options, representing $200 million worth of shares. The advent of Trump has already boosted the fortunes of Wall Street bankers by millions of dollars, and this is only a small preview of the colossal plundering of the American and world economy that is to come. All the more politically criminal are the efforts of the Democrats, including supposed “left” figures such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, to lend credibility to Trump’s claims to be fighting for American workers by backing the new president’s xenophobic “America First” policies of economic nationalism and trade war.

The court on Thursday ceded control of Oil Prospecting License 245 to the government while the West African country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission investigates and prosecutes suspects in the "Malabu Oil scam," according to a statement from the commission. The commission's petition to the court says Dutch-British corporation Shell and Italian Agip — now Eni — bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" and that the $1.2 billion payment to former petroleum minister Dan Etete and his allies was a bribe. The state oil company got only $210 million from the deal. The government is preparing further charges of "conspiracy, bribery, official corruption and money-laundering" against Shell and Eni, the petition says. Criminal charges already have been filed against both companies and several executives in an Italian court in Milan. "This is historic. Generations of Nigerians have been robbed of life-saving services while oil men have grown rich at their expense," said Simon Taylor of the anti-corruption body Global Witness. "Companies and their investors must understand they can no longer do backdoor deals with corrupt officials without paying a hefty price." Also read: Farmers, fishermen sue Shell in UK over pollution Eni has not received notification of the court order, spokesman Roberto Carlo Albini told The Associated Press. "Eni denies any wrongdoing," he said. Shell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Olugbenga Odugbesan said he had no comment. The oil companies paid the $1.2 billion into a Nigerian government escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase, and former justice minister Mohammed Bello Adoke authorized its distribution. The commission last month filed charges of fraud and money laundering against Etete, Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar. The petition says Nigeria's former military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and Etete used front men to form Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. and illegally awarded themselves OPL 245. After Abacha's mysterious death in 1998, the company directors and shareholding was fraudulently altered to divest Abacha's son, Mohammed, it says. The Malabu bloc was seized by the government once before, by the civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo in 2001. Malabu Oil sued and an out of court agreement returned the bloc to the company.For the latest on national news, politics, sport, entertainment and more follow us on Twitter and like our Facebook page. - AP Tags shell eni agip nigeria fraud corruption national NEXT ON NEWS24 NIGERIAX 'Justice Yunusa admits taking N1.5m from Ricky Tarfa' 27 January 2017, 15:01 share: &nbps; Read more from our Users Submitted by Isaac Asabor263 Separating kitchen politics from ...

There are two things happening in the U.S. stock market now that haven’t occurred since 1900. Before I break down what they are, let’s first build the background by looking at an annotated chart. Please click here for the annotated chart. The chart is of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, -0.16% which mirrors the popular benchmark index of the largest publicly traded U.S. companies. (I didn’t use the chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average because I have forgone the purity of backward-looking analysis in favor of making the forward-looking analysis more useful. The reason is that the Dow is a price-weighted index and is disproportionately affected by high-priced stocks.) Anyway, what you see is a candle-stick chart using the Heikin-Ashi technique, which helps isolate trends and predict future prices. In the present context, a red candle is formed when the closing price is below the opening price. Please note the following from the chart: • The magnitude of the rally is large in such a short span. • There are no volume spikes on red candles. • The highest number of consecutive red candles is three. • The largest pullback is very shallow. • There is an extended period of very low volatility followed by a shallow pullback, and then another extended period of very low volatility followed by a technical breakout. This, by itself, is a bullish pattern. What does it all mean? In plain English, buyers are lined up to buy stocks on any dip in prices. The historical context is even more powerful. It tells us two things that have not happened since 1900. The first thing The first thing is less important but easy to understand: a rally of this magnitude in the six weeks after a presidential election. The second thing The second thing is more important as it foretells what may come next: the combination of items listed above during the six-week period following a presidential election. (I had to improvise some data, but it does not change the conclusion.) That is, the strength of bids in the market lined up to buy on dips. The most reliable indicator The VUD indicator is the most reliable technical gauge I have found. It gets very complicated, and I don’t have data going far back, but the VUD indicator confirms the underlying strength. To see how the VUD indicator is used, please see “Five reasons stocks are being bought and gold sold despite terror news” and “This buying panic may last until Dow 20,000.” What to do now Amid all this bullishness, it’s important to remember that the market is technically very overbought. Overbought markets are vulnerable to adverse news. Adverse news can come at any time, such as when a company reports poor earnings or President Trump makes a threat to another sovereign nation. It’s important to note that, on a fundamental basis, the stock market is expensive and, thus, vulnerable. Here’s the best strategy: Raise cash by selling risky stocks and ETFs into the strength, and then wait patiently for pullbacks and buy the right stocks and ETFs on weakness. Examples of the right ETFs to buy are large-bank ETF SPDR KBW Bank KBE, -0.83%  regional-bank ETF SPDR S&P Regional Banking KRE, -1.04% and broker-dealer ETF iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges IAI, -0.33% Examples of the right stocks to buy include Bank of America BAC, -0.34% J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.21% Citigroup C, -0.44% Charles Schwab SCHW, -0.33% Goldman Sachs GS, -1.10% Morgan Stanley MS, -0.39% TD Ameritrade AMTD, +0.09% and E*Trade ETFC, +2.30% Please see “Bank stocks have a good shot at beating the broader market in 2017.” Consider selling sectors and stocks that carry too much risk, such as pharmaceuticals. Company examples include Pfizer PFE, +0.45% Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.38% Merck MRK, +0.90% Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY, +1.96% and Eli Lilly LLY, +1.07% Please see “What pharma investors ought to do after Donald Trump fires a salvo.” Consider avoiding export-dependent stocks such as Apple AAPL, +0.01% Nvidia NVDA, +1.93% and Skyworks Solutions SWKS, +1.10% Please see “10 popular stocks at risk from Trump’s ‘America first’ inauguration speech.” Disclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.

Keep me logged in I forgot my password No Thanks Briefing highlights The loonie's inexplicable bump Keystone shouldn't mean much: economists Global markets on the rise DJIA cracks 20,000 TSX plays with record of its own Inexplicable By all rights, Stephen Poloz should not be a happy man today. The Bank of Canada governor has been counting on a lower currency to help boost exports and give the economy a lift, and, indeed, bemoaned its stronger level last week. He also managed to knock the loonie down when he told reporters that an interest rate cut is still on the table depending on how things play out. But the loonie has staged a remarkable - and inexplicable, at this point - recovery since then. It’s now above the 76-cent (U.S.) mark, with the greenback under pressure at this point, but more importantly is how well it has fared against other currencies since Donald Trump won the presidency. As Bank of Nova Scotia currency strategists Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret noted, the Canadian dollar had had the best showing among G10 country currencies since the U.S. election. That is, until Mr. Poloz and his Bank of Canada colleagues held their benchmark rate steady and released their monetary policy report last week. Coupled with Mr. Poloz’s comments, it all “left the distinct impression that the central bank was somewhat concerned about the impact of the broad rise in the CAD through the latter part of 2016,” said Mr. Osborne and Mr. Theoret, referring to the loonie by its symbol. “Those comments served to check - significantly - the CAD’s rise but the respite has been brief,” they added in a report. “The CAD is once again outperforming and is currently the top-performing G10 currency since Friday.” Not only is this surprising, there’s “no good reason from my point of view,” Mr. Osborne, Scotiabank’s chief currency strategist, said later, adding he has heard a few reasons for the move. The effective exchange rate of both the U.S. and Canadian dollars, or that against a basket of currencies, tend to move in opposite directions, but “there has been a distinct alignment in the trends of both in recent weeks which dates precisely to the U.S. presidential election,” he and Mr. Theoret said. Mexico’s peso has been hammered because of Trump-related concerns, but not the loonie. “With the benefit of hindsight, one can argue that the new administration is less concerned about relations with its northern NAFTA counterpart than its southern one,” said Mr. Osborne and Mr. Theoret. That certainly appears to be the case, based on the comments and actions of Mr. Trump and administration officials. “But that has only become apparent in the very recent past,” they added. “And it is arguably still too early to determine how the chips will fall if a broader revision of Canada’s trading relationships occurs. It was certainly not immediately obvious that a pro-growth but inward-looking U.S. president would be good news for the Canadian economy. [Yesterday’s] news on Keystone XL is positive but, again, the immediate benefits for Canada are scant.” Mr. Osborne and Mr. Theoret said they “are struggling to rationalize” the loonie’s gains, adding that Mr. Poloz’s comments “perhaps reflected an exasperation with recent [foreign exchange] moves.” Adam Cole, Royal Bank of Canada’s head of G10 foreign exchange strategy in London, agreed where Mr. Trump’s decision to revive TransCanada Corp.’s Keystone XL pipeline project is concerned. “We do not believe that President Trump’s decision to move forward with Keystone XL is as bullish CAD as the initial market response would suggest,” he said. “The near-term economic impact will be minimal, as most of the construction and related jobs would be in the U.S.,” he added. “It will take another three to four years of oil sands development in order to reach the production capacity that the pipeline requires, and oil prices are not elevated enough to prompt a surge in domestic capital expenditure.” Daniel Hui of JPMorgan Chase also agreed that the “fundamental impact” of Keystone on the loonie is limited. More important are the signs of a more “co-operative approach” from Mr. Trump’s team to the relationship with Canada. “In recent weeks CAD has come under more scrutiny, particularly because of its involvement in NAFTA and the new administration’s proactive stance towards renegotiating the trilateral treaty,” Mr. Hui said. “But in the past week, there have been various ancillary indications that the administration was intending to differentiate Canada from Mexico in NAFTA renegotiations and that the overall approach would be more co-operative than confrontational.” Don’t take all of this to mean that the loonie may still not be headed for a fall against the U.S. dollar, as analysts have projected, calling for the currency to dip to between 70 and 72 cents. “Our bearish case for CAD did not assume Canada would be in the crosshairs of Trump’s confrontational trade policy,” Mr. Hui said. “We had long recognized that Canada was not part of Trump’s trade rhetoric,” he added. “Instead the risks were that for a country for whom 77 per cent of exports go to the U.S., even a marginal shift in the North American trading regime carried significant disruption risks, particularly if it more materially altered the trading relationship with Mexico.” More on this topic David Parkinson: What Trump presidency will do to U.S. dollar and currency market Adrian Morrow, Shawn McCarthy: Trudeau welcomes Keystone revival Shawn McCarthy: Conditions for Keystone pose challenges Kelly Cryderman: Oil patch cheers Keystone revival Jeffrey Jones: Oil may be spared from any U.S.-Canada trade spat Adrian Morrow: Trump withdraws from TPP, but offers Canada hope Bill Curry: No reason for Canada to be worried: Trump adviser Barrie McKenna: The pros and cons of leaving NAFTA behind Stocks rise Stocks are scaling fresh heights, with the Dow Jones industrial average cracking the 20,000 mark. Tokyo’s Nikkei climbed 1.4 per cent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng 0.4 per cent, and the Shanghai composite 0.2 per cent. In Europe, London’s FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and the Paris CAC 40 were up by between 0.3 and 1.9 per cent. The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P/TSX composite were also up, the latter playing with a record of its own. “It may seem counterintuitive but however polarizing Donald Trump is, and is likely to continue to be, financial markets take a rather more cold-hearted view as basic resource and infrastructure plays push higher on the back of yesterday’s executive order with respect to the Keystone oil pipeline and his tweet yesterday that he will look at starting to implement his policy on building a wall on the Mexican border,” said CMC Markets chief analyst Michael Hewson. .

The court yesterday ceded control of Oil Prospecting License 245 to the government while the West African country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission investigates and prosecutes suspects in the "Malabu Oil scam," according to a statement from the commission. The commission's petition to the court says Dutch-British corporation Shell and Italian Agip, now Eni, bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" and that the USD 1.2 billion payment to former petroleum minister Dan Etete and his allies was a bribe. The state oil company got only USD 210 million from the deal. The government is preparing further charges of "conspiracy, bribery, official corruption and money- laundering" against Shell and Eni, the petition says. Criminal charges already have been filed against both companies and several executives in an Italian court in Milan. "This is historic. Generations of Nigerians have been robbed of life-saving services while oil men have grown rich at their expense," said Simon Taylor of the anti-corruption body Global Witness. "Companies and their investors must understand they can no longer do backdoor deals with corrupt officials without paying a hefty price." Eni has not received notification of the court order, spokesman Roberto Carlo Albini told The Associated Press. "Eni denies any wrongdoing," he said. Shell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Olugbenga Odugbesan said he had no comment. The oil companies paid the USD 1.2 billion into a Nigerian government escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase, and former justice minister Mohammed Bello Adoke authorized its distribution. The commission last month filed charges of fraud and money laundering against Etete, Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar. The petition says Nigeria's former military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and Etete used front men to form Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. And illegally awarded themselves OPL 245. After Abacha's mysterious death in 1998, the company directors and shareholding was fraudulently altered to divest Abacha's son, Mohammed, it says.

AP Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Nigeria seizes USD 1.2 billion oil bloc in Shell, Eni scandal Nigeria is seizing back one of Africa's richest oil blocs and will prosecute petroleum giants Shell and Eni in a USD 1.2 billion corruption scandal that has drawn investigators from the United States, Italy, France, Switzerland and Holland, according to a Nigerian Federal High Court document. The court yesterday ceded control of Oil Prospecting License 245 to the government while the West African country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission investigates and prosecutes suspects in the "Malabu Oil scam," according to a statement from the commission. The commission's petition to the court says Dutch-British corporation Shell and Italian Agip, now Eni, bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" and that the USD 1.2 billion payment to former petroleum minister Dan Etete and his allies was a bribe. The state oil company got only USD 210 million from the deal. The government is preparing further charges of "conspiracy, bribery, official corruption and money- laundering" against Shell and Eni, the petition says. Criminal charges already have been filed against both companies and several executives in an Italian court in Milan. "This is historic. Generations of Nigerians have been robbed of life-saving services while oil men have grown rich at their expense," said Simon Taylor of the anti-corruption body Global Witness. "Companies and their investors must understand they can no longer do backdoor deals with corrupt officials without paying a hefty price." Eni has not received notification of the court order, spokesman Roberto Carlo Albini told The Associated Press. "Eni denies any wrongdoing," he said. Shell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Olugbenga Odugbesan said he had no comment. The oil companies paid the USD 1.2 billion into a Nigerian government escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase, and former justice minister Mohammed Bello Adoke authorized its distribution. The commission last month filed charges of fraud and money laundering against Etete, Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar. The petition says Nigeria's former military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and Etete used front men to form Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. And illegally awarded themselves OPL 245. After Abacha's mysterious death in 1998, the company directors and shareholding was fraudulently altered to divest Abacha's son, Mohammed, it says.

REUTERS/Christian Hartmann By Atul Prakash and Vikram Subhedar | LONDON LONDON The mood among analysts on the outlook for European earnings is the brightest in 6 years, although a combination of higher valuations and optimistic projections leaves the bar for disappointment in the imminent results season fairly low. Lofty expectations at the start of the calendar year are not new. In every year since 2010, forecasts have called for double-digit earnings growth in Europe only for actual annual results to significantly underwhelm. Meanwhile, a global rally in stock markets, stoked by hopes of better economic growth, the return of inflation in Western countries and seemingly unperturbed by a swathe of political risks in Europe and the United States, has lifted valuations back to or above long-term averages. European shares are up nearly 11 percent since their early November lows following Donald Trump's win in the U.S. presidential election with the banks, commodity-related sectors and industrials leading the charge as investors switched out of defensive, dividend-paying sectors and into stocks closely geared to the economic cycle. Earnings are forecast to grow roughly 14 percent in Europe this year and companies are seeing more analyst upgrades than downgrades for the first time since 2010, according to Thomson Reuters data. While fundamental factors such as improving global growth forecasts, higher commodity prices and steeper bond yield curves have underpinned improving earnings, concerns are creeping in on whether the better economic backdrop is already baked into higher stock prices. Valuations for European shares are back to roughly 15 times forward earnings, bang in line with long-term averages. "Investors should be cautious about these headline earnings numbers for 2017," said Alex Dryden, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. "Analyst forecasts typically start the year at an overly optimistic level before falling sharply over the course of the year," said Dryden. A strong run-up in share prices ahead of earnings makes it that much harder for relatively good results to spur further buying. UBS results on Friday were a case in point. The Swiss bank reported better-than-expected results though shares fell more than 3 percent. They had risen more than 20 percent in the three months prior. In terms of growth, European banks remain the sector seeing the strongest forecasts. Earnings for the sector are seen growing more than 20 percent over the next 12 months, followed by the technology sector at 15 percent. Insurers and utilities are seeing the softest earnings growth of just under 4 percent. A healthy earnings season in the United States, where fourth quarter earnings are on track for their biggest increase in two years, has also bolstered the outlook for Europe Inc. Some factors such as higher commodity prices and a steeper yield curve which have benefited U.S. firms are likely to spill over into Europe too. Commodities and financials have a higher weighting in European indexes relative to the U.S., suggesting their impact is even more pronounced, JP Morgan Asset Management's Dryden said. One worry among investors, however, is that much of the improvement in outlook hinges on Donald Trump's sweeping agenda of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and a healthcare revamp. “Worldwide, a lot of Trump optimism is discounted in stocks. This makes them vulnerable to growth disappointments," said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis in Brussels.

Fed to stop mortgage reinvestments in 2018: Morgan Stanley NEW YORK The U.S. Federal Reserve will stop reinvestments of its mortgage-backed securities holdings in April 2018 in an attempt to shrink its $4.2 trillion balance sheet that had ballooned from bond purchases to combat the last recession, Morgan Stanley analysts said on Friday. Wall Street slips after soft GDP data, earnings NEW YORK U.S. stocks edged lower for a second consecutive session on Friday as some underwhelming corporate earnings and gross domestic product data offset recent enthusiasm over policy actions by President Donald Trump.

He previously worked at Reuters and Forbes. Follow @LionelRALaurent Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Jan 27, 2017 5:49 AM EST (Updated Jan 27, 2017 6:10 AM EST ) CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG-REG -0.57 At Closing, Jan 27th 15.28 CHF UBS GROUP AG-REG -0.77 At Closing, Jan 27th 16.25 CHF After a bumper fourth quarter for U.S. investment banks, UBS Group AG kicked off earnings season in Europe with a whimper. Optimists had hoped for a Trump-fueled bounce across the board. Instead, the Swiss bank largely missed out on the trading gains that benefited U.S. peers, while the firm's wealthy clients pulled money. Pessimists might now call into question the bank's decision to scale back in fixed income and focus on serving rich clients now that interest rates are rising and President Donald Trump is preparing to slash red tape for Wall Street. UBS shares are down slightly over the past year -- trailing gains of 12 percent at Deutsche Bank AG and 26 percent at Barclays Plc. Bad News Wealth-management worries hit UBS' share price on Friday, dragging down rival Credit Suisse Intraday times are displayed in ET. CEO Sergio Ermotti deserves a bit more charity. The bank has a business model that makes sense, pays a dividend, has above-average capital ratios as well as a proven track record of cost cuts. He has time to cut expenses further or invest in other businesses. Let's start with the bad news: As end-of-year party drinks go, the fourth quarter was more concentrated orange juice than Prosecco. The prized wealth management business derived scant benefit from the stock market's recent bounce and expectations of interest rate rises. Low Flow Net new money at UBS's wealth-management unit had its worst quarterly performance in years Source: Company filings The unit reported 4.1 billion Swiss francs ($4.1 billion) of net outflows in the quarter, which UBS blamed on subdued sentiment and tax rules. Margins were also squeezed as low-cost passive products and regulation put fees under pressure across the industry. The gross margin fell to the lowest on record, according to Citigroup analysts. UBS also missed out on the juiciest parts of the fixed-income trading rally, largely as a result of its post-crisis strategy. Management admitted the bank wasn't as well positioned as it had hoped: FICC revenue rose just 5 percent at UBS, according to Bernstein analysts, trailing the jumps of 31 to 36 percent at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. High Bar UBS' year-on-year trading revenue growth in Q4 was weaker than most U.S. rivals, according to Bernstein Source: Bernstein There was some good news, though. UBS's balance-sheet remains strong, with the leverage ratio above the minimum 3.53 percent required. Wealth management in the U.S. enjoyed an increase in gross margin, and revenue grew more than expected to $2.1 billion. That appeared to justify Ermotti's recent upbeat talk of U.S. momentum -- even if he was forced to admit that clients were waiting for concrete action from the Trump administration before shifting into buy mode. Wait-and-see, though, isn't much comfort for shareholders, and Ermotti's biggest problem for now is justifying UBS's premium valuation. The bank trades at 1.1 times book value, compared with 0.4 at Deutsche Bank or 0.7 at Barclays. UBS is still a long way from achieving its long-term target of a 15 percent return on tangible equity. The measure stood at 7.2 percent in the quarter. As other European banks raise capital, plan mergers or sell assets to increase profitability, UBS may come under pressure to take more strategic action to capture growth.

Accelerating consumer prices have triggered a fit of murmuring, particularly in Germany, about the need to discuss tightening monetary policy soon. Draghi could choose to skirt those conversations until inflation shows the “durable” shift he’s looking for, or start the ball rolling toward a consensus on what an exit will look like, whenever it happens. It “makes a lot of sense to discuss the exit strategy in the early stages,” said Frederik Ducrozet, senior economist at Banque Pictet & Cie SA in Geneva. “There’s a lot of noise with inflation approaching 2 percent in Germany, which is understandable for a central bank whose mandate is indeed defined on the basis of headline inflation including energy and food prices.” In the euro area’s current political atmosphere, with anti-integration parties gaining ground in a year of multiple elections, a single central bank whose policies are invariably out of whack for any individual country is an irresistible target for vote-hunters. That makes the path forward for the ECB as much diplomatic as technocratic. Not There Draghi is due to speak publicly twice next week, in Frankfurt and Ljubljana, though neither event is specifically focused on monetary policy. At his last press conference on Jan. 19, the ECB president rebuffed questions on how and when the ECB would wind down its 2.28 trillion-euro ($2.4 trillion) quantitative-easing program. The plan to reduce monthly purchases to 60 billion euros from 80 billion euros from April does not, he said, imply a ‘taper’ toward zero. “We will have to have a very deep and very careful discussion and analysis of the situation,” he said. “But we are not there.” Economists’ views reflect the absence of much in the way of guidance. Anatoli Annenkov at Societe Generale SA in London thinks QE could be further slowed this year and stopped completely in early 2018. Others, like David Mackie at JPMorgan Chase & Co., see tapering starting only after that point. Inside the ECB’s Governing Council, the tradition of setting policy by consensus appears to be going through one of its difficult phases. Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger and Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, both German and both openly skeptical of QE, signaled this week that the time to discuss winding down the program is near. No More Tail They’re not alone. Dutch central-bank governor Klaas Knot said “the tail risk of a deflationary spiral is no longer imminent, removing one important rationale for large-scale asset purchases.” German consumer prices rose an annual 1.7 percent in December and the Bundesbank says the January figure -- due on Monday -- could top 2 percent. Figures on Friday showed import prices climbed last month at the fastest pace in almost five years. The euro area’s inflation rate is also picking up rapidly but, as in Germany, it’s driven largely by higher energy costs. And at just 1.1 percent, it’s still well below the goal of just under 2 percent. That matters. Most of the Governing Council still lean toward avoiding any suggestion of removing stimulus, given that parts of the region still have as much as a fifth of the workforce standing idle. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy made that point this week. “There are some things that worry me, such as Brexit, what could happen in the U.S., the oil price, and what the ECB could do,” he said in an interview with Onda Cero radio on Thursday. “So far it is acting correctly.” Draghi identified four features on Jan. 19 that give clues to what he thinks would justify withdrawing stimulus. Inflation has to be viewed over the medium term; it must be durable; it has to be defined for the euro area as a whole; and it has to survive the end of QE and negative rates. Those are hard to measure though. In the meantime, the fissures on the Governing Council -- alluded to by the French central-bank governor -- may keep widening. “Some seem to fear a resurgence of inflation; this is very exaggerated,” Francois Villeroy de Galhau said in Munich. “Contrary to what some critics suggest, our monetary policy is not some sort of Latin fantasy.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The country's economic and financial crimes commission said a federal high court has ceded control of Oil Prospecting Licence 245 to the federal government while it investigates and prosecutes suspects in the so-called "Malabu Oil scam". Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments The inquiry has drawn investigators from the United States, Italy, France, Switzerland and Holland. The commission's petition said Dutch-British Shell and Italian Agip - now Eni - bought the bloc, knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" and that the 1.2 billion dollar (£950 million) payment to former petroleum minister Dan Etete and his cronies was a bribe. The state oil company received only 210 million dollars (£166 million) from the deal. The government is preparing further charges of "conspiracy, bribery, official corruption and money-laundering" against Shell and Eni, the petition says. Criminal charges have already been filed against both companies and several executives in an Italian court in Milan. Simon Taylor, of the anti-corruption body Global Witness, said: "This is historic. Generations of Nigerians have been robbed of life-saving services while oil men have grown rich at their expense. "Companies and their investors must understand they can no longer do back-door deals with corrupt officials without paying a hefty price." Eni has not received notification of the court order, spokesman Roberto Carlo Albini said. He added: "Eni denies any wrongdoing." Shell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Olugbenga Odugbesan made no comment. The oil companies paid the 1.2 billion dollars into a Nigerian government escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase, with former justice minister Mohammed Bello Adoke authorising its distribution. The commission has filed charges of fraud and money laundering against Etete, Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar. The petition says Nigeria's former military dictator General Sani Abacha and Etete used front men to form Malabu Oil and Gas, and illegally awarded themselves OPL 245. After Gen Abacha's mysterious death in 1998, the company directors and shareholding was fraudulently altered to divest Abacha's son, Mohammed, it says. The Malabu bloc has been seized by the government once before, by the civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo in 2001. Malabu Oil sued and an out of court agreement returned the bloc to the company.

The court on Thursday, January 26 ceded control of Oil Prospecting License 245 to the government while the West African country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission investigates and prosecutes suspects in the "Malabu Oil scam," according to a statement from the commission. The commission's petition to the court says Dutch-British corporation Shell and Italian Agip — now Eni — bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" and that the $1.2 billion payment to former petroleum minister Dan Etete and his allies was a bribe.

The court on Thursday ceded control of Oil Prospecting License 245 to the government while the West African country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission investigates and prosecutes suspects in the "Malabu Oil scam," according to a statement from the commission. The commission's petition to the court says Dutch-British corporation Shell and Italian Agip - now Eni - bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" and that the $1.2 billion payment to former petroleum minister Dan Etete and his allies was a bribe. The state oil company got only $210 million from the deal. The government is preparing further charges of "conspiracy, bribery, official corruption and money-laundering" against Shell and Eni, the petition says. Criminal charges already have been filed against both companies and several executives in an Italian court in Milan. "This is historic. Generations of Nigerians have been robbed of life-saving services while oil men have grown rich at their expense," said Simon Taylor of the anti-corruption body Global Witness. "Companies and their investors must understand they can no longer do backdoor deals with corrupt officials without paying a hefty price." Eni has not received notification of the court order, spokesman Roberto Carlo Albini told The Associated Press. "Eni denies any wrongdoing," he said. Shell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Olugbenga Odugbesan said he had no comment. The oil companies paid the $1.2 billion into a Nigerian government escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase, and former justice minister Mohammed Bello Adoke authorized its distribution. The commission last month filed charges of fraud and money laundering against Etete, Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar. The petition says Nigeria's former military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and Etete used front men to form Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. and illegally awarded themselves OPL 245. After Abacha's mysterious death in 1998, the company directors and shareholding was fraudulently altered to divest Abacha's son, Mohammed, it says. The Malabu bloc was seized by the government once before, by the civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo in 2001. Malabu Oil sued and an out of court agreement returned the bloc to the company.

The court on Thursday ceded control of Oil Prospecting License 245 to the government while the West African country's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission investigates and prosecutes suspects in the "Malabu Oil scam," according to a statement from the commission. The commission's petition to the court says Dutch-British corporation Shell and Italian Agip - now Eni - bought the bloc in 2011 knowing the transaction was "fraught with fraud" and that the $1.2 billion payment to former petroleum minister Dan Etete and his allies was a bribe. The state oil company got only $210 million from the deal. The government is preparing further charges of "conspiracy, bribery, official corruption and money-laundering" against Shell and Eni, the petition says. Criminal charges already have been filed against both companies and several executives in an Italian court in Milan. "This is historic. Generations of Nigerians have been robbed of life-saving services while oil men have grown rich at their expense," said Simon Taylor of the anti-corruption body Global Witness. "Companies and their investors must understand they can no longer do backdoor deals with corrupt officials without paying a hefty price." Eni has not received notification of the court order, spokesman Roberto Carlo Albini told The Associated Press. "Eni denies any wrongdoing," he said. Shell Nigeria spokesman Bamidele Olugbenga Odugbesan said he had no comment. The oil companies paid the $1.2 billion into a Nigerian government escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase, and former justice minister Mohammed Bello Adoke authorized its distribution. The commission last month filed charges of fraud and money laundering against Etete, Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar. The petition says Nigeria's former military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha and Etete used front men to form Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd. and illegally awarded themselves OPL 245. After Abacha's mysterious death in 1998, the company directors and shareholding was fraudulently altered to divest Abacha's son, Mohammed, it says. The Malabu bloc was seized by the government once before, by the civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo in 2001. Malabu Oil sued and an out of court agreement returned the bloc to the company.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Funds News | Fri Jan 27, 2017 | 7:00am EST RPT-Stock research moves past PDFs as customers demand more for their money (Repeats story with no change to text) By Anna Irrera and Olivia Oran Jan 27 With investment firms cutting costs and portfolio managers combating a barrage of information, financial research shops around the globe are looking for new ways to keep their product relevant. A raft of startups have launched to support that effort, offering tools that can use Google search data to get an edge on retail sales, deploy drones to examine oil supplies or allow investors to rank analysts and bid on their reports, like a Netflix or eBay of research. Whether these innovations will lead to smarter investments, or be used widely enough to prop up research budgets, is yet to be seen. But the startups are forming alliances with banks, brokerages and investors by the dozen. People who use and sell the tools say the trend is changing how research is financed, distributed and consumed for the first time in decades. "We are coming up on a very different age for equity research," said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research. Investors now see research as a product that must stand on its own rather than a freebie offered as part of a broader relationship with an investment bank, Sokolin said. Technology can improve the quality and distribution of research, he said. A few factors are driving the changes. Asset managers are under enormous pressure to cut fees due to weak returns and competition from low-cost options like index funds. The fee squeeze is making firms more selective about how they spend research dollars. At the same time, the long-running practice of paying for research through trading commissions is being upended by new regulations in Europe, known as the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID II. Part of the sprawling overhaul will force investors in the European Union to pay for research directly. Global asset managers are expected to "unbundle" payments in other regions as well. Perhaps most importantly, investors say they are sick of their inboxes piling up with run-of-the-mill reports each day. At a time when people share snippets of information through WhatsApp and Slack and a tweet can move a stock in seconds, sharing loads of PDF files through email is not only passé, but makes it hard to know what is worth reading, industry sources said. "There are 40 analysts just covering Apple: how do you find the insight?" said Alap Shah, chief executive of Sentieo, a San Francisco-based startup that aggregates information about publicly traded companies. Before launching Sentieo in late 2011, Shah was an analyst at Citadel LLC, where he received hundreds of research reports a day. It was difficult to search through documents for important information, collate those details into one place and access them when he was not in front of his office computer, he said. Those frustrations led Shah to set up Sentieo, which allows users to search reports by a stock ticker or hashtagged phrase like #revenuegrowth. They can also highlight key passages and access information remotely. Shah says 200 firms are now using Sentieo, including Longhorn Asset Management LLC and JNK Securities Corp. DRONES AND DATA SCIENTISTS Other startups are going beyond aggregation. Customers of London-based StockViews can rate analysts with stars the way they might rate a show on Netflix, and request custom-made research "on demand." Edinburgh-based Electronic Research Interchange (ERIC) allows fund managers to bid on analyst reports the way shoppers do on eBay. Another company, Orbital Insight, uses satellites and drones to collect data that can affect a variety of stocks, like how much oil is stored in tanks. In a recent report, JPMorgan Chase & Co telecommunications analyst Rod Hall drew on Orbital Insight research to tell investors there were fewer cars parked at large electronics stores following the U.S. presidential election, which might lead to lower smartphone sales. Wall Street banks say they are also using their own techniques to modernize research. In interviews, executives highlighted data-crunching as a particular focus to win more business from funds that rely on algorithms to make investment decisions. Morgan Stanley's research team employs 30 data scientists in a unit called AlphaWise to support research from traditional stock analysts. Last year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc analysts used data from Google Trends and social media monitoring firm Crimson Hexagon to conclude that Nintendo Co Ltd's Pokemon Go was so popular it would affect future games it releases. "Ten years ago, we would have interviewed consumers in a mall to figure out what the hottest fashion trends are," said Simon Bound, head of research at Morgan Stanley. "Now we will also use big data techniques and machine learning."
