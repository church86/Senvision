READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Business Insider (feedback@businessinsider.com) Sep 24th 2016 11:04AM Wall Street dealmakers used to be sent to Hong Kong or London to win new business. Now they're being sent to Seattle, Atlanta, and Denver. Bank of America, JPMorgan, and Citigroup have been taking steps to do more business with midsize companies in regional centers in the US, outside the traditional hubs like New York, Houston, and San Francisco. They have moved and hired dealmakers there, and they have them focused on so-called middle-market companies. The potential rewards are significant: Middle-market companies in the US and Canada paid $8.2 billion in deal fees in 2015, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch presentation. That's more than the fees netted in most of Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America combined. "This is a key focus for us as we have developed the other areas of our investment bank," Christian Meissner, the head of global corporate and investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Business Insider. "Relatively speaking, this represents a greater opportunity than some traditional avenues of growth." Local expertise Each bank cuts it slightly differently, but broadly speaking the largest multinational corporations are serviced by the corporate banking divisions within big global banks. These companies — think Apple, GE, Ford, and the like — have bankers crawling over them, trying to win every last piece of business they have to offer. Facebook/Visit Seattle The commercial banking divisions typically serve tens of thousands of smaller (but by no means small) companies, and it is the commercial banking clients that the banks are hoping to do more business with. "The premise behind regional investment banking starts from extending relationships from the commercial bank," James Roddy, who oversees the regional investment banking and M&A business at JPMorgan, told Business Insider. JPMorgan drew up plans in 2012 to focus on middle-market banking and now has about 50 people in the investment bank dedicated to this group of clients, having hired local, senior, experienced bankers in a handful of regional centers over the past three or four years. Each location — including Atlanta, Dallas, and Washington, DC — will typically have a managing director, an executive director, a vice president, and an associate on the ground. "This isn't about doing smaller deals," Roddy said. "It is working with people where we're already providing treasury services or commercial banking, and we have an opportunity to provide a full service that includes investment banking." The effort is paying off. Doug Petno, the chief executive of JPMorgan's commercial bank, cited growing investment-banking revenue from commercial banking clients at the bank's investor day in February. Revenue from this client segment hit $2.2 billion in 2015, and the bank has a long-term target of $3 billion. Facebook/Visit Seattle It's a similar story at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Many of the bank's clients told the bank they felt that it wasn't local enough and that they would get only occasional coverage from investment bankers who would fly in from New York or another major city. To remedy that, the bank has assigned about two dozen bankers over the past couple of years to focus on this segment of clients. "These are almost always existing clients of the firm," Meissner told Business Insider. "We have the commercial bank, the midmarket lending business, where we have something like 30,000 clients across the US. What's new is whereas previously they would have gotten episodic investment-banking attention, now they have a dedicated investment banker in addition to their existing relationship banker from commercial banking." Citigroup, meanwhile, is reviewing plans to put a banker in Denver as part of its energy coverage team, in addition to its existing presence in New York, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. An opportunity that was always there The opportunity to win business in these regional cities isn't new — it's just that banks had been more focused chasing opportunities elsewhere. The renewed interest in less glamorous clients and locations comes at a time when many of these more exotic growth markets are slowing. Facebook/Visit Seattle The $8.2 billion fee pool for US and Canadian middle-market companies is comparable with the fees paid by companies in Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific excluding Japan put together. "This isn't a new idea; it's a different approach," Meissner said. Given the challenging market conditions, any area showing growth is sure to become competitive. And sure enough, the middle-market investment-banking business is now more keenly fought over than in the past, Roddy said. "It is happening right now," he said. "People are waking up to it. We've been doing it for a while, so it is nice to be ahead of the curve."

Combined fees from advising on deals and from equity and debt underwriting have dropped a 18.5 per cent this year at JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Thomson Reuters data shows. Despite an uptick in IPOs since June, activity remains below 2015 levels, largely due to low US interest rates that have made it easy for companies to borrow cheaply and made it more attractive for them to raise funds through debt offerings. Fees for debt issues are typically lower than those on equity offerings. The US Federal Reserve had been expected to raise interest rates four times this year, but the central bank hasn't budged. Eight companies made their market debut this week, raising a total of US$1.22 billion (RM5.03 billion). Five listed one or more of the six big banks as a lead manager, according to Renaissance Capital, a manager of IPO-focused ETFs. Just 70 companies have gone public this year through yesterday, down from 122 in the same period last year ― the lowest since 2009. The amount raised totaled about US$11.8 billion, a drop of 52 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Equity offerings in the United States fell 36 per cent to US$122.7 billion through the week of September 16. Debt offerings were little changed at US$1.7 trillion. Tough year “The first half of this year has been a uniquely difficult environment for underwriting revenue on the equity side,” Jeffery Harte, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill told Reuters. Jay Ritter, an IPO expert and a professor at the University of Florida, said 2016 would be a moderate year for IPOs. “Investment banking underwriting revenue will almost certainly decline this year,” he said. “Equity underwriting is the most profitable part of the business, but IPO volume is down and the trend for follow-on offerings to be done with bought deals rather than fully marketed bookbuilt deals is also lowering the average revenue per deal.” The Fed's target rate for overnight lending between banks is 0.25 per cent to 0.50 per cent, where it has been since December last year when it was raised for the first time in nearly a decade. Apart from low interest rates, US investment banks have been hit by weak oil prices, Britain's vote to leave the European Union and concerns about global economic growth. Globally, investment banks suffered their worst first-half performance since the 2008 financial crisis, with revenue for the top 12 players falling 15 per cent from a year earlier, according to industry analytics firm Coalition. Even so, US banks took the top five spots in global investment banking revenue during the period. JPMorgan, the biggest US bank by assets, retained its spot at the top of the global investment bank rankings despite a drop of 11.7 per cent in fees from investment banking. The bank was an underwriter for the IPO of Japanese messaging app operator Line Corp, the biggest US IPO so far this year. Line's shares soared as much as 36 per cent in their debut, valuing the company at US$9.34 billion. ― Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Fintech association anticipates regional investments European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Prospect of US interest rates hike weighs on ringgit With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) A Tribe Called Quest spit fire in ‘We the People’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles JPMorgan to pay US$264m to resolve China hiring probe Ahead of Trump presidency, global investors sell bonds and grab stocks Dollar hits 11-month peak alongside US yields, bank stocks up Oil rebounds from three-month lows on renewed hopes for OPEC cut Wall Street ends flat as financials’ rise offsets tech drop Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

(UK) / Alamy Stock Photo  Peter Foster, Europe Editor 24 September 2016 • 2:49pm The bosses of several of America’s biggest banks and corporations have warned Theresa May they will pre-emptively shift operations into Europe unless she can provide early clarity on the future shape of EU-UK relations, The Telegraph has learned. The ultimatum was delivered at a round-table meeting with Mrs May in New York this week attended by a host of key US investors, including major City investors such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock. According to an account of the meeting obtained by The Telegraph, Mrs May declined to provide information about how the British government would approach the Brexit negotiations, other than pursuing a deal that was “in the national interest”. Jean-Claude Juncker answers awkward question about Brexit Play! 01:24 There followed “frank exchanges” in which bosses warned they could not wait to discover the final outcome of the two-year Article 50 negotiations before making major investment decisions that could see thousands of UK jobs shift to Europe. “The message was clear from at least some of those present: if Theresa May cannot provide some early clarity about where the negotiations will end up, the only way to avoid that uncertainty would be a move towards Europe – there will not be time to wait,” said the City source with knowledge of the meeting. Before the June 23 vote to leave the EU, the heads of several major foreign banks including JPMorgan and UBS warned that “significant” numbers of jobs could be shipped to Europe when the impacts of Brexit became clear. Estimates of possible City job losses from a “hard Brexit” have ranged widely from 40,000 to 80,000 over the next decade, with JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley saying they could shift over 1,000 employees. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have also warned of jobs losses to the Continent. What is Article 50? (EU, Brexit) The move piles pressure on Mrs May whose determination to “take back control” of Britain’s borders after Brexit, it is now widely assumed, will make it impossible to retain the City’s current “passporting” rights that enable UK-based financial services companies to trade freely in Europe. A separate source in Whitehall said that Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, has walked back his initially optimistic predictions for the City post-Brexit, cautioning banks that the retention of “passporting” is highly unlikely given Mrs May’s stance on ending EU free movement. Downing Street’s uncompromising line on curbing EU migration has caused friction between Mr Hammond and Mrs May’s political team which is dominated by former Home Office officials who “understand the politics of migration rather better than the economy”, the source said. Martin Schulz: Don't take too long triggering Article 50 Play! 01:38 Financial services generate more than £60bn pounds a year in tax, a quarter of which comes from foreign-owned banks, revenues that the Treasury fears will now be put in jeopardy. According to the account of the New York meeting, banks now accept the likely loss of EU pass-porting but warned Mrs May there must be guaranteed transitional arrangements to give firms the time and certainty they need to adapt to the new regime. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, delivered a similar call for transitional arrangements when giving evidence to a House of Lords committee earlier this month, warning of the risks of a “cliff-edge” Brexit. FAQ | Brexit and the City of London UK Treasury officials are now heavily pre-occupied with how to put in place transitional arrangements that – they readily concede – will only be possible with the political good will of the other 27 EU member states. “A final deal could take years to negotiate, the real question everyone is focussing on now is what you do in between times that provides confidence and certainty to all business,” said an official with knowledge of the UK preparations. The difficulties will be both practical and political, however, as European capitals continue to harden their stance ahead of future negotiations, ruling out any “cherry-picking” by the British side when it comes to accessing the single market. Professor Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory, has suggested that continuing existing arrangements for three years after Brexit could give space for a deal to be nailed down – but concedes this would require continuing to accept EU free movement during that transitional period. Theresa May: I wouldn't invoke Article 50 until the UK has secured better deals Play! 00:42 The Telegraph understands that Mr Hammond has already cautioned bank bosses that delaying taking back control of borders for three years would be politically impossible, a position that would leave British negotiators ultimately reliant on EU goodwill. “Financial services is very complicated and asking the EU to concede transitional arrangements is fixing one key piece of the negotiation before it has even started,” Prof Winters said, “We’d be asking them to give away one of their biggest pieces of leverage.” In Brussels the current mood is defiant. Asked by The Telegraph recently about possible transitional controls, a senior EU official shrugged and smiled, adding: “Why would we? What’s in it for us?” British negotiators hope, however, that common sense and mutual interest will prevail, citing the importance of the City to for EU capital markets and the continued creakiness of Italian and Portuguese banks as reasons why the EU will also want a smooth transition.

The rules proposed Friday will be another boon for merchant houses including Trafigura Group Pte and Vitol SA, which already are luring employees away with the promise of better pay and less red tape, said Ross Gregory, managing consultant at Commodity Search Partners, a London-based employment company. “It’s going to be another sign for these guys who think, ‘It’s just more rope around our necks,’ which is already pushing more of them to go work at trading houses," Gregory said in a telephone interview from New York, where he’s based. The Fed proposal would require banks to put up more capital to support investments in physical commodities, limit the amount of trading and restrict ownership of power plants and copper. The central bank estimated the plan would require about $4 billion in additional capital from firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. The goal is to reduce the financial risks posed by such trading, Fed officials said. Paring Back Lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG have been paring back their commodity units in recent years, as regulators tightened restrictions following the financial crisis. The merchant trading houses have stepped into their place. US-based Castleton Commodities International LLC bought Morgan Stanley’s physical oil trading arm last year, while JPMorgan sold its physical trading business to Swiss-based Mercuria Energy Group Ltd in 2014.  Meanwhile, former commodities executives have left Wall Street to establish their own firms. David Silbert, who built the commodities business at Deutsche Bank, founded TrailStone Group in 2013 with financing from private equity. Ben Freeman, a former Goldman Sachs oil derivatives trader, created HudsonField LLC with the support of AllianceBernstein Holding LP, with the aim of catering to middle-market oil firms no longer served by the banks. Don’t Touch “This is going to redound to the benefit of the merchant traders," said Craig Pirrong, a professor at the University of Houston’s Bauer College of Business. “It’s very clear that the Fed does not want banks touching physical commodities, no way, no how." The Fed proposal should come as little surprise to most players after years of debate over the banks’ influence on commodity markets, Pirrong said in a telephone interview. If there’s a downside for trading houses, it’s that it may get harder for them to tap banks to finance long-term trades and asset purchases, he said. Gregory, the employment specialist, estimated about 10 to 20 percent of the banks’ teams are leaving each year to join trading houses. Salaries offered by trading houses and banks are roughly comparable, at about $250,000 for a “strong" senior trader, Gregory said. But trading houses give a bigger cut of profits on top of salary. Merchant houses typically pay traders about 12 percent of the annual profits they generate, while banks offer closer to 5 percent, he said. “Some people are locked into the banks with golden handcuffs because their deferred bonuses are large, but they would take an option to get out if they can find it," he said. In addition to individual workers, whole trading businesses may be on the move as well, according to Gregory. “It wouldn’t surprise me if some of these trading houses see an opportunity to say to the banks, ‘Hey, do you guys want me to take this off your hands?’" Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

State-owned Sberbank is cooperating with the Federal Security Service while the lender crafts a nationwide cybershield for use by other financial bodies that it says are woefully unprepared to fight off hackers. “As a rule, what usually happens is this: they beg us to come, help, and clean it up,” Stanislav Kuznetsov, Sberbank’s deputy chief executive in charge of cybersecurity, said of other financial institutions in an interview. “We come and clean it up, but there are times when the very next day they’re infected again.” While the U.S. accuses state-backed Russian hackers of stealing computer data to influence the presidential elections, officials in Russia say banks are the targets for increasingly sophisticated online crime. Police made their biggest breakthrough against hackers in June when they arrested 50 members of an alleged cybergang that stole more than $45 million from Russian banks. Malware used by Russian and eastern European cybergangs was also implicated in a string of bank heists this year that culminated in the theft of $81 million from the Bangladeshi central bank. Social Unrest Growing numbers of hacking attacks on Russian banks risk provoking social unrest by undermining trust in the electronic payments system, Oksana Dokuchaeva, a cybersecurity specialist at the FSB, said at a tech forum in Moscow on Wednesday. Banks should be required by law to report incidents to the central bank’s cybercenter, and should work more closely with each other and with law enforcement, she said. Sberbank, which holds nearly half of retail deposits in Russia, spends about 1.5 billion rubles ($23.4 million) annually on cyberdefense. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase & Co. spends $600 million annually. The Moscow center’s head, Dmitry Blokhin, said Sberbank’s investment was vindicated during a recent visit to Silicon Valley in the U.S., when meetings with International Business Machines Corp. and Stanford University confirmed that it meets best practice in information security. Cyber-Umbrella Kuznetsov said the bank doesn’t yet charge for helping other institutions. That may change if discussions on a joint anti-fraud monitoring system are successful. Sberbank’s platform for other banks will be a commercial product working in line with the central bank’s proposed methodology, an official with knowledge of the situation said, asking not to be identified as he isn’t authorized to speak to the media. Financial institutions have to agree on a “unified interface that will be comfortable for everyone,” said Sberbank’s head of cybersecurity methodology, Alexey Volkov. Officials at the lender said a new subsidiary, Bizon, is a key element of its expansion strategy, and will be the vehicle for a nationwide anti-fraud system that may develop into a competitor to Kaspersky Lab, Russia’s only globally known cybersecurity company. The bank isn’t disclosing how exactly it plans to deal with other lenders under a single cybersecurity umbrella. Data Sharing While some smaller banks may be interested in the offer, “big banks already have defenses set up and don’t want to outsource it,” Dmitry Volkov, an executive at cyber-investigations company Group-IB, said by phone in Moscow. “It’s not a given that Sberbank will find outside clients who want to give them access to their networks.” Banks will worry that the need to share decoded data may lead to clients being lured away, said Alexander Lyamin, head of Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Qrator Labs, which specializes in preventing so-called DDOS attacks. “Common interests are served only when the cyber-umbrella doesn’t belong to any of the banks,” he said. Collaboration is needed because cyber-attacks on all banks are increasing, though “it will be easier to organize if a third party takes the reins to avoid the impression of a conflict of interests,” Konstantin Chigirev, global head of security at Bank Otkritie, Russia’s largest private bank, said by phone. “I think the regulator is the most appropriate middleman.” Fraud Attempts Cyber-crime rates in Russia are up four-fold compared to 2015 and have caused more than 6 billion rubles in losses so far this year, Interfax news agency reported Monday, citing Alexander Kurennoi, a spokesman for the Prosecutor General’s office. In the U.S., major banks are considering forming a group to share information about cyber threats and how to respond to attacks, the Wall Street Journal reported in August, citing unidentified people familiar with the situation. Sberbank’s protection system will be completed by 2018 and will rely on big data technologies and machine learning, Kuznetsov said. It currently has cybersecurity centers in five cities, where nearly a thousand specialists deal with about 1 million registered incidents daily and helped avert losses of 8 billion rubles in the first half of this year, he said. The bank averts 99 percent of fraud attempts and sees the greatest risks coming from three big cybercriminal groups, according to Kuznetsov, who declined to name them. As it strives to become a major cybersecurity player, Sberbank is actively lobbying for new laws against computer crime. Russia’s newly elected parliament will vote on two legislative initiatives this fall that introduce penalties for theft from electronic accounts and manipulating people to share confidential data, Kuznetsov said.

But plenty of folks are still writing out checks, placing them in courtesy envelopes and then dropping their payments in the mail. Those old-school customers might be surprised to learn, however, that their payments may not be going to their cable provider, trash collector or credit card company. Instead, thousands per day are routed to a nondescript building in the back of the White Clay Corporate Center off Ogletown Road in Ogletown. It’s there that about 200 employees with the multinational payment processing company First Data handle, sort and record each payment in a high-tech, industrial-scale mail room shared by hundreds of corporate clients. “When things are really humming, we have the capacity to handle 12,000 items per hour,” said Paul Army, director of the site. “In fact, we get so much, we literally have our own ZIP code.” STORY: Linde to spend $100M upgrading Claymont plant STORY: Therapy dough? The Grommet bets on Lewes maker's product Technically listed as Philadelphia, the ZIP code 19170 has a population of zero and only one business address within its borders: Remitco, the First Data division that handles remittance, a fancy word for receiving payments. Yet remittance might be the least sexy service that First Data offers. Founded in 1971, First Data is the largest payment technology company in the world with 23,000 employees serving 6 million merchants in 118 countries. “There is no client too large or too small for us,” said Hally Sheldon, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based company. “Altogether, we handle about 28 percent of global e-commerce, processing 2,500 transactions each second.” That includes the point-of-sale technology used by merchants around the globe, the behind-the-scenes networks that make those electronic transactions possible and even the online bill payments favored by millennials. The STAR Network Solutions sign on top of most ATMs? That’s First Data. The security behind Apple Pay? First Data. Those high-tech Clover cash registers that look like an iPad on a kick stand? You guessed it. A company with a convoluted history that includes previous ownership by American Express and a private equity firm, First Data has gone public, been taken private and gone public again. The company’s initial public offering last October was the largest of 2015, raising $2.6 billion. Today, First Data has a market cap of $12 billion. Under the direction of Chief Executive Officer Frank Bisignano, the former co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase, the once struggling colossus has become profitable, raking in $323 million in the second quarter of 2016. In Delaware, First Data may be the largest company you’ve never noticed – partially by design. More than 300 people work out of First Data's office building off Carr Road, northeast of Wilmington.  (Photo: SUBMITTED) About 320 employees handle back-office functions in two office buildings tucked far down a wooded road just north of Bellvue State Park. But it’s the Ogletown site that has the most interaction with the public – even if they don’t know it. “There are no signs outside because if people knew we were here, they might try to drop off their payments at the last minute,” Army said. “That’s not how we operate.” One of eight Remitco operation centers around the country, the 25,000-square-foot Ogletown site handles both high-volume, low-dollar payments from consumers, along with the bigger-ticket payments from one company to another. Every day of the year – including holidays – bonded couriers drop off mail from the U.S. Post Office less than a mile away at a rate that ranges from one delivery every other hour to once every 30 minutes. Once inside, a large machine sorts the mail by corporate client, each identifiable by the precise weight of their incoming payments. The same machine extracts the customers’ check and bill stub, photographs each, reads and records the payment and then archives the digital file. A team of employees with disabilities from the Chimes program rechecks each envelope to be sure it is empty, while other workers manually process the least legible checks and any envelope containing more than a standard paper payment. Buy Photo Jim Crawford, a processing assistant at First Data, watches an OPEX 150 mail extractor machine that sorts and scans payments at the company's Ogletown facility.  (Photo: Damian Giletto/The News Journal) “A lot of times people will call a company and talk to ‘Betty’ so they think ‘Betty’ is the one opening their envelopes,” Army said.  “We get a lot of thank-you letters for ‘Betty,’ especially around the holidays.” Other customers will write a check for the dollar amount, but pay the remainder in change or fold up their checks into tiny squares stapled to the corner of the envelope – all of which has to be processed by hand. “Paper payments are actually declining at a much slower rate than you might expect, I think because it makes people feel more secure,” said Army, a 52-year-old Wilmington resident who recently became director of operations for all of Remitco’s processing centers. “At the same time, more companies are turning to First Data to process those paper payments,” he said. “That’s because we can do it cheaper, faster and more efficiently than they ever could on their own, so our volumes keep increasing.” Buy Photo Paul Army, vice president of operations for First Data's Remitco division, stands in front of an OPEX 150 mail extractor machine at the company's Ogletown facility.  (Photo: Damian Giletto/The News Journal) The newly public company holds its client list and growth plans close to the vest, but Army said First Data has a hold on an adjacent 25,000-squre-foot office space in the White Clay Corporate Center for future expansion. First Data just filled 20 new positions at the site – all of which pay above minimum wage and include stock options. And Army said he expects the company to continue growing at the same rate for years to come. “Delaware makes a lot of sense to us from a geographic standpoint,” he said. “We’re close to some of the banks and insurance companies that make up our largest customers. And while we get mail from all 50 states, we’re centrally located to millions of people who send us their bill payments each and every day.” Contact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel. 342 CONNECTTWEET 447 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://delonline.us/2dtVBV7 TOP VIDEOS Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 Why it's time to change your holiday shopping plans 0:35 Cuban coffee available in U.S. for first time in over 50 years 0:40 Girl Scout cookie cereal is a real thing and happening soon 1:10 Pennies worth $1k hidden across U.S. 0:39 What college students really buy with student loans 0:36 Major retailers buck trend of starting Black Friday on Thanksgiving 1:09 Toyota recalls Prius cars over faulty brakes 0:30 America's biggest mall makes bold Thanksgiving move 0:23 Elizabeth Warren rips into Wells Fargo CEO 0:52

By Karen Hube Biography March 26, 2016 Click here to see top wealth management firms’ asset allocation Since the markets started convulsing, many high-net-worth investors have been primed and ready to do, well, something. But the nation’s leading wealth managers are urging restraint. Forget about any sweeping tactical moves, they say. While the tendency is to want to match big disruptions in the market with big changes in asset allocation, the best response is to pare back big bets on the broad asset classes and return closer to longer-term neutral positions. Check out the model-portfolio calls for 2016 by 40 leading wealth managers, laid out in our table. There are no major moves to match the market drama. Total average stock allocations are pretty much flat at 50.7%, while U.S. stockholdings have dropped marginally to 31.5% from 32.5%. Bond allocations, meanwhile, have increased to an average 28.7% from 27.1% last year. U.S. bond allocations have now risen to 26.6%, returning to their 2012 level, thanks to a building up of investment-grade corporate and municipal bonds to create ballast. Image: ra3rn/shutterstock It’s all rather ho-hum, suggesting neither great enthusiasm nor grave concern. “If you don’t see exceptional opportunities in any one asset class, you stick to your core discipline,” says Jeff Korzenik, Fifth Third Bank’s chief investment strategist. “We are hugging our benchmarks.” But dig below the surface of these relatively modest allocation shifts and the nuances start to show up. “After the financial crises, the key decision to make was whether or not to be in the stock market, and choosing stocks wasn’t that important,” says Seth Masters, chief investment officer at Bernstein Global Wealth Management. “Now, picking the right ones and avoiding the wrong ones is where the juice will be.” Which is why many firms are making sector allocations rather than betting on the broad equity market. Wilmington Trust recently split its U.S. large-cap portfolio; half is parked with active managers, and half with exchange-traded funds tracking specific sectors. The firm noticed how close correlations were last year between stocks with different market capitalizations, and between value and growth stocks. Sectors, however, moved out of step with one another, presenting the chance to win big, says Cam Albright, Wilmington’s head of investment strategy. In the first half of last year, returns on indexes representing value, growth, and differing market caps ranged tightly from minus 0.6% for the Russell 1000 Value Index to 4.8% for the Russell 2000 Index. But by sector, returns spanned minus 11% (utilities) to 10.7% (health care). Wilmington Trust, UBS, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan are favoring technology, consumer discretionary, health care, and financials. “The thesis for financials is that they are cheap—price-to-book values have been higher 70% of the time going back to the 1990s,” says Brett Nelson, head of tactical asset allocation at Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management. “As the Federal Reserve hikes rates, all the loans that banks price off of prime and short lending rates go up immediately, and banks benefit.” Energy provokes mixed emotions. While most investors have pulled out of the sector, UBS Chief Investment Strategist Mike Ryan thinks energy stocks might see a recovery “as people realize it’s still a vibrant sector with attractive dividend yields of about 5%.” But perhaps the biggest play of the year is the systematic building back of international developed exposure, which at 14.9% is at its highest level in six years. Valuations are attractive in Europe and Japan; watch for turmoil-triggered buying opportunities as they arise. Rising U.S. rates might shift growth toward these developed markets, still in earlier stages of expansion. Enlarge Image Close BMO Private Bank cut its U.S. exposure to 30% from 45%, and raised developed foreign to 21% from 14%. Goldman Sachs’ Nelson says he favors Spain and Italy, “which have relatively high dividend yields of 5% or 6%, in addition to very attractive valuations and an uptick in structural reforms.” Others argue that Japan is even more attractive than Europe. “Some people say Japan is moving too slowly,” says Jason Pride, head of Glenmede’s investment strategy. “But Japan is the standout geographic region for earnings momentum.” Emerging markets remain the underdog; blame still-swooning commodity prices. Average allocations, at 4.4%, are the lowest in six years, and most of the money is going into Asian economies driven by consumer growth, not those reliant on commodities. For contrarians, some short-term emerging market opportunities may arise. The strong dollar has “negatively impacted emerging market equities, but post–Fed rate hikes, there tends to be a softening in the dollar, so we might see a little snapback in emerging markets,” says Shannon Saccocia, heading the asset-allocation committee at Boston Private Wealth. Fixed income is another story. Many firms are looking for opportunities in high-yield corporate and municipal bonds, some of the most fractious asset classes around. Assets fled high-yield on the back of the cratering energy sector, which now accounts for about 10% of the high-yield market. Unease persists: Firms recommend 4% in high-yield versus 5% last year. But those averages don’t reflect the underlying enthusiasm. Janney Montgomery, Northern Trust, and Fidelity Investments have all raised their allocations. Larry Adam, Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management’s chief investment strategist, points out that high-yield’s higher coupon can reduce interest-rate sensitivity. High-yield issues generally outperform investment-grade bonds in rising-rate environments, because rate increases reflect an improving economy, and that, in turn, leads to a reduced default probability. Others are dividing their high-yield allocations between corporate and municipal bonds. The municipal high-yield market is now robust and liquid enough to handle the firm’s investments, says Glenmede’s Pride, and returns are sweet. The current after-tax yield on high-yield municipal bonds is 5.6%, compared with 4% for their high-yield corporate equivalents. But most firms are opting for high-yield bonds just below investment grade. “We aren’t digging too deep into the ditches of distress,” says Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management. It’s invested in a high-yield fund yielding 6.5%: “It’s not superaggressive, but it’s significantly in excess of what you get in the corporate market, which is under 3%.” Other plays are nonagency mortgage-backed securities—extending credit to folks who can’t get a conventional mortgage—and unconstrained bond funds, which allow a bond manager to roam, looking for opportunities. Alternative investments dropped to 17.6% from 19.1%, but moved deeper into long-short equity hedge funds and relative-value strategies. “Long-short will work well in Europe and Asia,” says Robert Teeter, head of the investment policy and strategy group at Silvercrest Asset Management. “In China, it’s similar to what happened in the U.S. in the aftermath of the tech bubble.” Opportunities emerge in meltdowns. Nothing will come easy this year. Returns will be tepid, yields low, and volatility will continue as diverging global economic and monetary policies crash into markets. “We have the Federal Reserve bumping up interest rates, Europe’s monetary policy of quantitative easing getting extended, Japan in its third attempt at reflationary tactics, and China moving toward a new consumer-spending-driven culture,” says U.S. Trust Chief Investment Officer Chris Hyzy. “It’s like The Twilight Zone.” Still, wealth managers believe that further interest-rate hikes this year won’t necessarily translate into a stock market rout. In the past 25 years, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index posted a 1.26% average monthly return during five modest rising-rate periods, better than the 0.73% average monthly return earned during declining-rate periods. While the Fed has stated it will raise rates four times for a total of one percentage point this year, many strategists predict that declining inflationary pressures and global angst will result in just two quarter-point rate hikes, if the level of global upheaval stays roughly as is. That’s fairly benign stuff. David Donabedian, chief investment officer at Atlantic Trust, says that while U.S. equities still aren’t cheap, the economy is in good shape and the bull market should continue. A recovery in corporate earnings is expected to drive returns of about 5% to 6%, according to surveyed wealth managers. We found the same sort of logic guiding fixed-income decisions. Interest-rate progressions will be so gradual and shallow that bonds are more likely to do good than harm, by providing ballast. “In this high-volatility world in which all risk assets sell off in unison, your only port when the storm hits is going to be high-quality fixed income,” says Northern Trust’s Nixon. Any small losses due to rising rates should be reasonably well offset by a small bump in yield. But it’s often an unanticipated risk that wallops the market. In January, unexpected China woes triggered a 6% decline in the S&P 500, the worst opening week on record. Be prepared for a wild ride—but remain composed and calm when making actual allocations.

Not so in Detroit. Dustin Walsh Staff Blog: Manufacturing, auto suppliers, economics and business of law Comments Email Print Detroit Automotive Economic Development R&D Technology Transportation Workforce City of Detroit Detroit 2.0 Information technology Innovation Mobility Expat news Homecoming coverage Detroit put the world on wheels, and now the region is the epicenter of the next generation of mobility. But Detroit is not mobile. More than a quarter of Detroit households don't own an automobile, ranking eighth among the 30 largest cities in the U.S. behind only cities with robust mass transit systems, such as Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C., according to a 2014 study by the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. As the automotive industry rapidly transforms from traditional cars and trucks to connected and autonomous "living rooms on wheels," the city of Detroit is presented with a great challenge. But what better place to test a technology that will change the world? Imagine automakers and suppliers creating low-cost, or even free, services for low-income Detroiters while proving theories. Engineers behind the wheel and people with a real need to reach a destination as passengers. The industry gets validation of its technology and the public gets a service. These services could allow the industry to do good while doing good work — particularly when the image of automotive is at an all-time low in the wake of recall scandals and record profits. Let's start with the problem. The city's mass transit options are terrible, even if it's gaining a new rail line and potentially a new rapid transit bus line. For many major metropolitan areas, this may not be the biggest issue, as jobs are more available within the city limits for its city residents. Not so in Detroit. Of the 258,807 jobs existing in the city, 71 percent are held by employees commuting from the suburbs, according to a 2015 report by the Corporation for a Skilled Workforce and funded by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. That's only 0.37 jobs for every resident — abysmal compared with other cities. For instance, Atlanta has 818,462 jobs in its city and a population of 447,848, or 1.83 jobs for every resident. Cleveland has a population of 394,335 and 466,305 jobs, or 1.2 jobs for every resident. These cities must attract workers from the suburbs to fill jobs. In Detroit, 108,000, or 61 percent of employed Detroit residents, travel outside the city for their jobs, according to the Corporation for a Skilled Workforce study. Roughly 46 percent of those travel more than 10 miles from home, the study said. Unreliable transportation options for the city's residents precludes many from finding those jobs in the suburbs. The harsh reality is that the city needs to put 49,000 of its residents to work just to match the state average of labor force participation. The automotive industry holds the solution. Over the past few years, and especially in the past 12 months, the local automotive industry has ramped up efforts to make car-sharing, electrification and self-driving vehicles a reality. But these technologies are, depending on who is talking, a number of years from mass market commercialization or profitability. But the testing is ongoing, and research and development is cropping up all over Southeast Michigan. The state is closing on the sale of 300 acres at Willow Run in Ypsilanti to create an $80 million testing hub for connected and driverless cars called the American Center for Mobility, which is expected to open in 2018. UM opened its MCity early testing facility for the same technologies last summer. General Motors Co. acquired driverless car tech firm Cruise Automation for $1 billion, invested $500 million into San Francisco ride-sharing service Lyft, launched its own car-sharing service Maven, all earlier this year. Maven offers customers a fleet of new vehicles on demand, for use in exchange for an hourly fee. It has more than 5,000 registered members. "We found, with the actions we've taken over the last year, the role we're going to play (in the auto business) is going to change remarkably," GM President Dan Ammann said at Detroit Homecoming earlier this month. "It is our intention to define mobility. We're taking that deadly seriously, and we're going to win." Maven recently launched one-way car-sharing service in Southeast Michigan with rates as low as $3.50 per half hour. A user could get from downtown Detroit to Detroit Metropolitan Airport for as little as $5, compared with more than $40 for a taxi. Ford Motor Co. created a mobility subsidiary, Ford Mobility LLC, and began testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh with Uber last week. Uber then announced it was opening an office in Detroit to partner with local automakers. Glenn Stevens: Connected car projects important. Google is opening an automotive testing facility in Novi, and Apple already has a small office in Birmingham. More than 125 miles of highway and streets, including some in the city of Detroit, are equipped with Lear Corp. sensors to connect vehicles to the infrastructure, such as stoplights. "It's incredible what's happened in the last year," said Glenn Stevens, executive director of automotive economic development group MichAuto. "Michigan has 49 connected car projects. This is where the conversation about mobility is happening." We have thousands of people with a need to be mobile, to get to work, and dozens of companies looking to test the parameters and capabilities of its new mobility solutions. The city's best chance came, and went, with the $50 million Smart Cities Challenge, the U.S. Department of Transportation contest to help a city transition to a "smart" transportation system. Columbus, Ohio, won. Detroit wasn't even a finalist. Giving the city residents mobility "would be easily within our expertise," said John Maddox, president and CEO of the state's American Center for Mobility project. "The critical piece is leadership," he said. "The Smart Cities proposal still has a nicely defined need and technology approach framework we could do in Detroit, but the city needs to be the leader." Detroit's Smart Cities proposal called for the connected, driverless and electric vehicle fleets along with car- and bike-sharing programs. They key initiative was to create a "Mobility Passport" to provide a statewide single point system to request and pay for a ride, parking and other mobility access. Partners in the proposal were Ford, GM, the Michigan Department of Transportation, UM, Bosch, Denso, DTE Energy, the city of Detroit and dozens of others. John Maddox: "The critical piece is leadership." These groups came together to make the proposal and it shouldn't end with the failed bid. These groups must continue the conversation. It's too important to the continued revitalization of a great American city. Maddox said the city is interested in mobility projects, but the demands of running a city take precedence. "This is a hard thing to accomplish when the immediate needs of fixing bridges, fixing roads, fixing infrastructure is an all-consuming activity," Maddox said. "It's doable, but it's going to be a heavy lift." MichAuto's Stevens said early talks are happening about how to use the region's mobility transformation to benefit the city, but he declined to go into detail. "We have identified a group of organizations that are working toward the common goal of enabling Detroiters to get to work," Stevens said. "Detroit is a great test bed for public and private partnerships to come to a common goal." The importance of this moment in our region's history mustn't be overlooked. There is a need and a solution. Let's come together to create a new Detroit — still on wheels, but for everyone.

Friday, 18 November 2016 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Interview US Bank Bosses ‘Warn Theresa May They Will Leave UK’ News ID: 1195380 Service: Other Media September, 25, 2016 - 14:59 TEHRAN (Tasnim) - The bosses of several of America’s biggest banks and corporations have warned British Prime Minister Theresa May they will preemptively shift operations into Europe unless she can provide early clarity on the future shape of EU-UK relations, The Telegraph has learned. The ultimatum was delivered at a round-table meeting with Mrs. May in New York this week attended by a host of key US investors, including major City investors such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock. According to an account of the meeting obtained by The Telegraph, Mrs. May declined to provide information about how the British government would approach the Brexit negotiations, other than pursuing a deal that was “in the national interest”. There followed “frank exchanges” in which bosses warned they could not wait to discover the final outcome of the two-year Article 50 negotiations before making major investment decisions that could see thousands of UK jobs shift to Europe. “The message was clear from at least some of those present: if Theresa May cannot provide some early clarity about where the negotiations will end up, the only way to avoid that uncertainty would be a move towards Europe – there will not be time to wait,” said the City source with knowledge of the meeting. Before the June 23 vote to leave the EU, the heads of several major foreign banks including JPMorgan and UBS warned that “significant” numbers of jobs could be shipped to Europe when the impacts of Brexit became clear. Estimates of possible City job losses from a “hard Brexit” have ranged widely from 40,000 to 80,000 over the next decade, with JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley saying they could shift over 1,000 employees. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have also warned of jobs losses to the Continent. The move piles pressure on Mrs. May whose determination to “take back control” of Britain’s borders after Brexit, it is now widely assumed, will make it impossible to retain the City’s current “passporting” rights that enable UK-based financial services companies to trade freely in Europe. A separate source in Whitehall said that Philip Hammond, the British Chancellor, has walked back his initially optimistic predictions for the City post-Brexit, cautioning banks that the retention of “passporting” is highly unlikely given Mrs. May’s stance on ending EU free movement. Downing Street’s uncompromising line on curbing EU migration has caused friction between Mr. Hammond and Mrs. May’s political team which is dominated by former Home Office officials who “understand the politics of migration rather better than the economy”, the source said. According to the account of the New York meeting, banks now accept the likely loss of EU pass-porting but warned Mrs. May there must be guaranteed transitional arrangements to give firms the time and certainty they need to adapt to the new regime. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, delivered a similar call for transitional arrangements when giving evidence to a House of Lords committee earlier this month, warning of the risks of a “cliff-edge” Brexit.

(NYPL/New York Public Library)  Walk down the canyon of Wall Street and you'll come across several of Lower Manhattan's 38 historical markers, most of them celebrating achievements in fields like finance and skyscraper-building. But soon a new marker will raise a more ominous subject: how, for centuries, New York City was built on the backs of slaves. It will be the city's first acknowledgement on a sign designed for public reading that in the 1700s New York had an official location for buying, selling, and renting human beings. City officials say the marker is in the final stages of preparation. It will likely be unveiled on Juneteenth (June 19), also known as Freedom Day, which dates to the emancipation of African-American slaves in Texas and throughout the Confederate South. The marker will be freestanding and located in a pocket park on the northeast corner of Wall and Water Streets, a block from the historic location of the slave market. An official city slave market existed at the corner of Wall and Pearl Streets from 1711 to 1762. (Brad Horrigan/WNYC) "The slaves of that time and place helped build City Hall," said City Councilman Jumaane Williams, a sponsor of the legislation that led to the creation of the marker. "Their lives should be celebrated and their deaths should be mourned." Williams said the project will cost about $5,000. "In the $70 billion city budget, that's like losing a quarter," he said. "And the significance of it is priceless." Not a Feel-Good Story The city's slave market stood at the corner of Wall and Pearl Streets and operated from 1711 to 1762. Today, the spot lies several blocks inland. But it was once on the East River waterfront, where oceangoing ships unloaded their goods. The market was a wooden structure with a roof and open sides, although walls may have been added over the years. Renderings show that it could hold perhaps 50 men. Over the course of those 51 years it operated, the market trafficked in thousands of slaves: men and women, shiploads of children, even captured Indians. "It's not a feel-good story," said Thomas J. Davis, a professor at Arizona State University who writes about slavery in the north. "It's not a story that people have wanted to hear." Davis and other historians say Americans in the north tend to think of slavery as a fever that gripped the south — a fever cured by the Civil War. But New York and other northern cities accrued vast wealth from slave labor and profited for centuries from dealings in the slave trade. Africans who passed through the Wall Street slave market contributed to the prosperity of some very famous companies, some of which are still around: Aetna, New York Life and JPMorgan Chase, to name a few. Various units of these and other financial companies bankrolled southern plantations, insured slaves as property, and used slaves as collateral for loans. 'Fessing Up WNYC has obtained a draft of the historical marker's text. It includes the phrase, "Slavery was introduced to Manhattan in 1626." The date is important because it's less than two years after Dutch settlers first arrived at the tip of what is today known as Manhattan. That means white Europeans and enslaved Africans arrived in New York — then called New Amsterdam — at essentially the same time. Professor Davis believes that fact should be better known. “Folks need to 'fess up and understand the long, black roots that New York has," he said. By the year 1700, New York had 5,000 people. At least 750 of them were slaves — a number that increased by several thousand over the next 50 years. Many slaves were sold and taken elsewhere. But some stayed and did the heavy work of constructing Lower Manhattan: clearing land, building the port, widening Native American trails and creating roads like Broadway — even constructing the wall that Wall Street would be named after. Women slaves worked as domestics and white colonial families bought black children to help with household chores. How The Market Got Started Christopher Paul Moore, a senior researcher at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, said it was also common practice at the time to send slaves into the street to hire themselves out. "Slave owners made additional profits by short-term and even long-term rental of their enslaved property,” he said. But the city fathers started hearing complaints from their fellow white colonials about the African laborers walking around and mingling with each other, which some feared could lead to a slave rebellion. Moore said it was then that the Common Council, an early version of our City Council, stepped in to bring order to the business. "In 1711, a wooden pier was set up at the corner of Wall Street and the East River and that became the acknowledged New York City market," he said. Moore said enslaved Africans would disembark from the boat that had just carried them from Africa or, more likely, the Caribbean, and be marched through "the cacophony of an early trade town" to be sold at the Wall Street market. Slaves were considered merchandise so buyers could simply inspect them. "Some of the male slaves were asked to flex in various ways to show how sturdy they were," Moore said. "And the females were touched in private places. It was an ugly experience." Harper's Magazine illustration of the New York City slave market in 1643. (Harper's/Wikipedia Commons) Many Ways To Make Money from Slavery Chris Cobb, an independent scholar who contributed research to the historical marker, testified at a City Council hearing last year about the legacy of slavery in New York. Cobb pointed out that the city directly benefited from the business. "It was a city-run slave market because they wanted to collect tax revenue on every person who was bought and sold there," he said. "And the city hired slaves to do work like building roads." Professor Alan Singer of Hofstra University said New York City businesses profited from the slave trade for centuries in ways beyond direct labor. "It’s not just that Africans built the infrastructure of the city, New York City was a major stop on the transport of sugar and cotton," he said. "So New York bankers and New York merchants were making money on the transport and the sale of slave-produced commodities." By the 1800s, New York City was as important as Charleston, South Carolina, to the Triangular Trade, which sent slaves and the goods they produced in a constant flow around the Atlantic Ocean from England to Africa to North America. Singer noted that the Domino Sugar Factory in Brooklyn refined sugar cane and the molasses produced by enslaved Africans in the Caribbean. The owner of the plant, William Havemeyer, became the mayor of New York City in the years before the Civil War. He was followed in office by Fernando Wood, who believed emancipation would be bad for business, which prompted Wood and his allies to lobby hard for avoiding war with the South. "They wanted Lincoln to compromise because New York City bankers and merchants are so tied in with slavery, cotton and sugar," he said. Once the war started, Wood proposed that New York City secede from the Union. The city's deep ties to the slave trade only ended when slavery was abolished after the Civil War. By then, the Wall Street slave market was long gone — removed for the same reason that a lot of stuff gets torn down in New York: it was blocking a nice view of the river and bringing down real estate values. An official slave market existed at the corner of Wall and Pearl Streets from 1711 to 1762. (Brad Horrigan/WNYC) Alana Harper contributed reporting to this story.     Also Seen In...

Currency swings are expected to increase later this year as investors weigh the potential outcome of the US presidential election and the likelihood of a US Federal Reserve year-end interest-rate increase. The predicted volatility resurgence follows a period of calm that started in July, after traders absorbed the initial shock of the UK’s Brexit vote. A JPMorgan Chase & Co gauge of currency volatility fell to a two-week low this week. “Once it gets closer to the election and the call gets closer on who will be the next president, volatility should rise from currently rather low levels,” said Constantin Bolz, a foreign-exchange strategist at UBS’s wealth management unit in Zurich. It has been a year of ups and downs for the US dollar on mixed signals from policymakers amid prospects for Fed monetary tightening. The US central bank scaled back its outlook for interest-rate increases this week, further dimming the outlook for the greenback, which has declined almost 4 percent this year. And with the US presidential election only about six weeks away, investors are speculating about what the outcome would mean for the currency market. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 major peers, dropped 0.6 percent this week as traders digested the Fed announcement and the Bank of Japan’s move to a more flexible approach to expanding stimulus. The greenback fell 1.2 percent to ￥101.02, and weakened 0.6 percent to US$1.1226 per euro. The JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index, a gauge of expected swings in the currency market, climbed to 9.9 percent on Friday, while remaining below its 10.7 percent average this year. It has stabilized in recent months after it reaching a four-month high just before the UK decision in June to leave the EU. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton and US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are to hold their first televised debate on Monday as part of the run up to the Nov. 8 election. “We have a strong view that volatility is going to pick up toward year-end,” said Douglas Borthwick, the New York-based head of currencies at Chapdelaine & Co. TAIPEI In Taipei, the New Taiwan dollar rose against the greenback on Friday, gaining NT$0.07 to close at NT$31.330 after moving in a quiet session without fresh indications for traders, dealers said. The US dollar on Friday traded in a narrow range against the Taiwan dollar, but saw some selling toward the end of the session as traders took cues from foreign institutional buying in local equities, the dealers said. The greenback opened at NT$31.400 and moved between NT$31.310 and NT$31.437 before the close. Turnover totaled US$526 million during the session. The flat opening continued within a small trading range, as many currency traders stayed on the sidelines for more clues on how to map out their investment strategies, the dealers said. After a plunge earlier this week, the US dollar became more stable on Friday, as traders settled down following the Fed’s decision, they said. Even before the decision, foreign investors had started to move funds into the region to boost the NT dollar and other regional currencies, the dealers said.

"What you've seen investors doing is starting to chase other asset classes in a search for yield so they've been piling into things that they perceive as safe havens," explained JPMorgan's Stephen Parker on CNBC's "Futures Now" this week. The bank's head of thematic equity solutions highlighted the recent popularity of minimum volatility exchange traded funds (ETFs). These instruments offer nervous investors the opportunity to invest in so-called safe haven stocks, such as utilities and consumer staples. However, while these sectors currently offer attractive yields in a zero interest rate world, valuations are trading well above the market. For instance, consumer staples trade at 22 times forward earnings and utilities, which historically trade at a 20 percent discount to the market, are trading at a premium. "When you think about safety, it is a reflection not just of the fundamentals, but also of the price you're paying," noted Parker. "We're telling clients to be cautious about chasing yields at this point." 'Look at the divergence' Parker went on to say that he sees signs of froth in high quality bonds and gold. Moreover, while he envisions equities and Treasuries continuing to move in tandem in the near-term, Parker eventually sees the two diverging— in spite of low rates and accommodative central banks. "You need to look for a little bit of a divergence going forward," said Parker. "If this market is going to see more meaningful upside from here you need to start to see better growth, better earnings and higher inflation," he said. "That probably means rates move higher, and that's a positive environment for stocks." Parker highlighted that, despite the gains for defensive sectors like telecom and utilities on a year-to-date basis, many investors are beginning to rotate towards more cyclical parts of the market like technology, banks and materials. "That is a vote of confidence for the fact that growth is going to continue to be modest, but positive," concluded Parker.

With the rating cut, Turkey faces difficulties in attracting the foreign capital needed to cover its current-account deficit. Published: 15:58 September 24, 2016 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Istanbul: Turkey’s sovereign credit rating was cut to junk by Moody’s Investor Service, which concluded a review initiated after an unsuccessful coup attempt on July 15. Moody’s cited rising risks related to Turkey’s external financing needs and a weakening in credit fundamentals as economic growth slows. The rating was cut to Ba1 from Baa3, leaving Fitch Ratings as the only major ratings company to keep Turkey at investment grade. Erdogan Doesn’t Care at All If Turkey Gets Downgraded to Junk “The risk of a sudden, disruptive reversal in foreign capital flows, a more rapid fall in reserves and, in a worst-case scenario, a balance of payments crisis has increased,” Moody’s said in an emailed statement announcing the decision late Friday. “This slow deterioration in Turkey’s credit profile will continue over the next two to three years and the balance of risks are better captured at a Ba1 rating level.” With the rating cut, the difficulties Turkey faces in attracting the foreign capital needed to cover its current-account deficit, the fourth largest in the G20 group of major economies, are likely to be compounded. The downgrade could drive forced selling of as much as $8.7 billion in Turkish bonds, JPMorgan Chase & Co said in August. Many of the world’s biggest funds require investment-grade ratings from two of the three major ratings companies — Fitch, Moody’s and S&P Global — to consider an asset for investment. Erdogan’s View The lira had weakened 0.9 per cent to 2.9689 by the close of trading at midnight in Istanbul. The currency has lost about 40 per cent of its value against the dollar since 2013, when the US. Federal Reserve announced it was phasing out its extraordinary monetary stimulus program, raising the prospect of reduced investment flows to emerging markets such as Turkey. The Moody’s cut came a day after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised rating companies in an interview with Bloomberg in New York. “I don’t care at all” if they downgrade, he said, accusing the ratings companies of making decisions based on politics rather than economic fundamentals. “I’m inviting them to be honest,” he told Bloomberg. “Whether you’re honest or not, Turkey’s economy is strong in any case, it’s standing upright and it will continue to stand upright.” ‘Shock’ Risk Moody’s placed the rating on review for downgrade three days after a faction of Turkey’s military tried to overthrow Erdogan on July 15. The president blamed members of the Fethullah Gulen religious movement, and responded by declaring a three-month state of emergency that allows him to rule by decree. Thousands were arrested, and tens of thousands of suspected Gulenist sympathisers have lost their jobs. Credit markets were already treating Turkey’s debt as speculative. The cost to insure its 5-year bonds against default was 248 basis points on Friday, more than double countries that were rated the same including Slovenia and Romania, and about 40 basis points higher than junk-rated Russia. “The risk of a shock arising as a result of the country’s weak external position has become more pronounced, given the combination of persistently high political risks and volatile investor sentiment,” Moody’s said. It set the outlook as “stable,” citing Turkey’s “large and flexible economy which continues to register positive growth and the government’s strong fiscal track record.” More from Economy India wary as Beijing seeks Asia-wide trade pact 06:54 pm Eurozone economy to hum at modest pace 06:54 pm ‘Recovery still reliant on ECB policy support’ 06:54 pm Red Sea ‘megacity’ model for Saudi reforms: CEO 04:57 pm Egyptian firms to resume sugar imports 04:57 pm Yellen: Fed could raise rates ‘relatively soon’ Commodities set for rebound in 2017 US consumer prices post largest gain in 6 months tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNRecep Tayyip Erdogan follow this tag on MGNG20 follow this tag on MGNRussia follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessEconomy tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNRecep Tayyip Erdogan follow this tag on MGN+ MGNG20 follow this tag on MGN+ MGNRussia follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In EconomyIndia wary as Beijing seeks Asia-wide trade pact Business Gallery Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Pakistan, China launch new trade route Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosGalleries 01Job worries bog down UAE consumers: survey 02Saudi Arabia currency depeg is 'last resort' 03Shaikh Mohammad issues law on free zones Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirates Group announces record profits May 10, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 1Image In pictures: Evolution of Emirates airline Oct 25, 2015 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 8Images Where to live in Downtown Dubai Mar 15, 2011 11Images Highlights: Japan Aerospace 2016 air show Oct 13, 2016 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Retail Gold Rate Sponsored by Most Popular on Gulf News UAE announces public, private sector holidays Jailed, abused, and homeless Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes Data of 34 million Keralites leaked Your guide to tonight’s Supermoon Indian embassy to take up expats’ rupee concerns Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Gold posts biggest price drop in months Close Recommended For You Saudi rights advocate firm in adversityPUBLISHED ON Nov 19, 2016 The Gulf states’ enduring immigrant legaciesPUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Woman weds boyfriend in husband’s presencePUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

It will be left with slightly more than 200 bankers across Asia. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Goldman Sachs is cutting almost 30 percent of its 300 investment banking jobs in Asia outside Japan in response to a slowdown in activity in the region, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The Wall Street bank is reducing the number of bankers working on mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and equity and debt capital markets deals, the sources said. It will be left with slightly more than 200 bankers across Asia. Most of the jobs cuts are likely to take place in Hong Kong, Singapore and China, where Goldman's main Asian offices are located, according to the sources, who said the process was underway. A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment. The company, whose investment banking revenue fell 11 percent to USD1.79 billion in the second quarter, has been hit by a lacklustre environment for deals across Asia. The total value of M&A deals across the Asia-Pacific region has dropped to USD572.9 billion so far this year, from USD745.7 billion in the same period of 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. Goldman said in July it had embarked on a cost-cutting plan that would save USD700 million a year in response to a "challenging backdrop" for revenue. It still tops the Asia-Pacific M&A league tables but in the first half of the year it came third after JPMorgan and Citi as the biggest bank by revenue in Asia, according to data published on Friday by industry analytics firm Coalition. One of the sources said no managing directors in Asia were in the running to be made partners this year while three existing partners in the region had been stripped of their titles. RETRENCHMENT Goldman and other big investment banks are grappling with a harsh environment after the region's economies and markets failed to deliver sustained growth after the 2008 financial crisis. The banks' business has also been eroded by local competitors. In 2015 Goldman reduced the number of its investment bankers in Singapore - a hub for Southeast Asia - to about 35 from 50, several sources said. There have been further departures this year, including its Southeast Asia chairman Tim Leissner. Many of Goldman's European rivals have announced plans to scale down their operations in Asia. Barclays said in January that it would cut about 1,000 staff in its investment bank operations worldwide, with the bulk happening in Asia, while Societe Generale decided to close its equities research desk in India. Other European banks including BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank are expected to scale back operations in non-core Asian markets while last year Asia-focused Standard Chartered shut down its equities franchise. Goldman employs just over 100 bankers in China, where it was one of the first foreign investment banks to start operations. But like other banks it has been hit by a drop in Chinese trading volumes and competition from local banks.
