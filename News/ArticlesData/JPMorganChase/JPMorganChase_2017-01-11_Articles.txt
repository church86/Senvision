Slowing inflation and a recovery in trade are among the reasons why Indonesian stocks are a preferred investment for Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, which oversees $420 billion. Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group, is buying Jakarta-listed firms that sell to Indonesia’s swelling middle class, as well as mining and plantation companies benefiting from a rally in commodities. For Mobius, this month’s research crackdown is just another reminder to do his own sums. Indonesia’s finance ministry ended commercial ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co. starting Jan. 1 after the firm downgraded the country’s equity market to underweight from overweight, and is introducing new rules that penalize primary government bond dealers if they don’t uphold the nation’s interest. “We have seen this kind of development in other countries and thus we always need to make our own decisions based on our own analysis of the facts,” Mobius said. Foreign investors have added about $300 million to aggregate investments in the nation’s stocks and bonds this year, suggesting Mobius and Aberdeen’s Bharat Joshi aren’t alone in their sanguine stance. The rupiah was the year’s best-performing Asian currency as of Jan. 11, while yield on government debt has drop 23 basis points and the Jakarta Composite Index is little changed. The Jakarta Composite Index rose as much as 0.3 percent in Jakarta on Friday, ending a four-day losing streak. The rupiah fell 0.1 percent, paring its gain this week to 0.5 percent. Cyclical sectors like banking, retail and cement -- the “dogs in the past two years” -- have valuations that are “most appealing” to Aberdeen, said Joshi, who oversees the firm’s investments in the Southeast Asian nation. The consumer discretionary sub-index in the MSCI Indonesia benchmark dropped to an average 17 times of projected earnings, compared with 20 times in August. Indonesian banks traded at an average 2.1 times of book value, compared with 2.9 times in the past decade. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

JPMorgan’s decision to downgrade Indonesian stocks by two notches was unusual and was the main flash point with Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, according to Norico Gaman, head of research at BNI Securities in Jakarta. For some investors, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump looms as the largest risk. His election win triggered dollar gains and emerging-market outflows. Similar to any emerging countries, Indonesia would undoubtedly “feel the brunt” of a possible rise in U.S. interest rates, Joshi said. “Trump is still a relative unknown and one would expect some volatility until his policies become clearer,” he said. Still, faster growth in the U.S. will lead to more investment money available for emerging markets, including Indonesia, according to Mobius. Federico Parenti, a Milan-based fund manager at Sempione Sim Spa, said he has been increasing his holdings on some Indonesian stocks in recent months and the disagreement between the government and JPMorgan has not caused any concerns for him. “This news did not change my positive point of view on Indonesia. Money can go in and go out very, very fast from almost any asset classes,” Parenti said. “The Indonesian government should treat such matters carefully so they don’t scare investors.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The agreement follows on the heels of two separate Justice Department settlements last year of financial crisis-era fraud with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup.  Of BoA’s total tab, about $10 billion will go to settle federal and state civil claims and $7 billion to consumer relief, including principal reduction on underwater loans, new loans to creditworthy but struggling borrowers, community assistance, and affordable rental housing. In addition, the bank will accept an independent monitor to oversee compliance with the agreement. BoA had engaged in a drawn-out battle with the Justice Department over the settlement, balking at taking a big hit for Countrywide Financial Corporation and Merrill Lynch’s pre-2008 activities prior to BoA’s acquisition of the two. For many weeks, BoA held its offer below Justice Department demands until a July 30 ruling from Manhattan U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff precipitated a breakthrough, according to press reports. Later the same day as Rakoff’s negative ruling against Countrywide in a separate mortgage-related fraud case, Attorney General Eric Holder called BoA CEO Brian Moynihan, threatening to file suit against BoA the next day if the bank did not raise its settlement offer, press reports noted. BoA relented and then entered into the final stretch of negotiations with the government. In its settlement, BoA acknowledges that it, Countrywide and Merrill Lynch sold residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) to investors without disclosing the deteriorating quality of the underlying loans in the securitized packages, leading eventually to huge investor losses. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) were among those misled by BoA’s failure to disclose accurate information.  “… the part [of the BoA settlement] that is consumer relief will not cost nearly as much as the headline number would suggest.” –Krista Schwarz Too Big to Jail For Holder, the record settlement could help quell some of the criticism lobbed at him for not going after big banks at the center of the 2008 credit crisis more aggressively. Last year, Holder said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that some banks are too big for prosecutors to pursue without considering the impact on the economic system — a phenomenon mocked as “too big to jail” by critics. To date, the Justice Department has pursued few civil or criminal cases against individuals responsible for mortgage-related fraud in the financial crisis.  For his part, BoA CEO Moynihan says settlement of the Justice Department case, which he has spent his four and a half years at the helm fighting, puts the bank’s crisis-era problems behind it. The U.S. Federal Reserve this year accepted the bank’s new capital plan, allowing it to pay dividends again, and Moynihan is ready to chart BoA’s future. As for Wall Street, “though this is a larger dollar value than the J.P. Morgan Chase deal, these settlements are generally well received by financial markets,” says Wharton finance professor Krista Schwarz. “Financial markets just want to get the uncertainty behind them.” Missing the Target Sponsored Content: At a record $16.65 billion, is the BoA settlement as fierce as it sounds? Wharton and University of Pennsylvania Law School experts say that in many ways, the settlement misses the mark. For one, says Schwarz, “the part that is consumer relief will not cost nearly as much as the headline number would suggest. For example, it includes principal write-downs on mortgages that Bank of America holds, but that is generally going to be writing off money that Bank of America could never have collected anyway.” What’s more, the settlement doesn’t directly compensate those hurt and punish those accountable, say experts.“In this settlement, the core is defrauding the investors in securitization transactions,” notes David Skeel, a University of Pennsylvania Law School corporate law professor. “I understand the desire to help homeowners, but litigation based on other wrongs seems to be a really indirect way to them. It’s very political and a bit arbitrary.” Kent Smetters, a Wharton professor of business economics and public policy, points out that those punished by the big-dollar settlement — BoA’s current shareholders — aren’t necessarily the ones who violated the law. “Probably my biggest concern is the conflict of interest faced by both parties negotiating. The government has the incentive to collect a lot of fine revenue, and bank executives have the incentive to write large checks, especially if there is an implicit understanding that the government won’t really pursue additional civil or criminal charges. But I am concerned that the bank’s shareholders are not being properly represented.” In addition, consumers who suffered from by BoA’s relaxed crisis-era practices on mortgage underwriting standards are likely out of luck, while a different set of consumers altogether could benefit. “The people who held subprime mortgages that they could not sustain and who lost their homes in connection to the pre-2008 mortgage market are lost from the picture” by now, says William Bratton, deputy dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School and co-director of the Institute for Law and Economics, a joint research center of the law school, Wharton and the University of Pennsylvania’s economics department. “The bum debt papers were generated by large institutions on a mechanized basis. The CEOs were far away from the operations. They made bad business decisions, but they are not criminal.” –William Bratton Still others who were hurt are also left without compensation, adds Catherine M. Schrand, a Wharton accounting professor. “To the extent that Bank of America’s activities contributed to the [overall economic] crisis, many more people were indirectly harmed, and the settlement cannot help them.”   To achieve more perfect payback, many, including prominent Justice Department critic U.S. District Court Judge Rakoff, say the agency should pursue individuals at banks responsible for dubious underwriting and disclosure practices. That may sound right in theory, but the cases are often difficult to bring, say University of Pennsylvania law experts. “These cases [against individuals] are the big missing piece of the aftermath of the financial crisis,” acknowledges Skeel. But “often, the most visible executives at the banks weren’t directly involved in any of the misbehavior. In the normal mortgage securitization process, it’s not obvious that someone like Jamie Dimon committed a crime.”  Bratton agrees: “The bum debt papers were generated by large institutions on a mechanized basis. The CEOs were far away from the operations. They made bad business decisions, but they are not criminal.” Turning Bad to Good  Still, is it possible that big-dollar settlements could provide some deterrent to future bad behavior? It’s unlikely, as it’s difficult to change human behavior, but possible in some ways, says Schrand. Her research shows that “many frauds occur because managers slide down a slippery slope.” Even though Bank of America managers likely realized that the mortgage pool risk was increasing, “they sold the pools anyway, thinking that the increased risk wasn’t that significant, so they were able to justify it in their minds,” she notes. “Then the risk grew but by then, BoA was in too deep. They [had to] continue not disclosing.” Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania law school professor and co-director of the Institute for Law and Economics, agrees: “Given the pervasiveness of practices, it’s hard to imagine that people at the time would have been swayed by the prospect of financial liability. There are hundreds of thousands of individual mortgage bankers and traders, and [other] people who had a huge role, that this settlement does not in any way directly come to terms with.” Yet, large settlements like BoA’s could encourage banks to increase monitoring of employee behavior, says Schrand. “While individuals may still have a natural tendency to behave badly, the firm has internal controls that can detect or prevent such behavior.”  Notes Bratton: “After passage of the Dodd Frank Act, it’s very important to take aggressive government enforcement action if any of this regulation is to be taken seriously. As the magnitude of settlements continues to increase and become more serious, there will be an effect, though no prevention.” Onward and Upward Whether through law enforcement or other means, a transformation in banking culture is sorely needed, say experts. “The impact of enforcement action in the mortgage arena [and in other financial areas] is a profound loss of confidence in the integrity of financial system,” says Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, a bank consulting firm in Washington, D.C. “The challenge is to establish cultures in financial services firms that protect the customer, but it’s very difficult to mandate good behavior. It’s going to take a long time to come up with a renewed balance built into the marrow of the financial system, which is controlled through the trading side of the business, which is focused on the short-term.” “We actually don’t want too much confidence in the banking sector. Rather, we want the right amount based on market fundamentals.” –Kent Smetters Smetters says that a lack of public confidence in the banks may help financial institutions find their way: “We actually don’t want too much confidence in the banking sector. Rather, we want the right amount based on market fundamentals. Twitter  The market believes that the government will bail out the bigger banks that are deemed to be Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI’s). Instead, the efficient solution is for the market to do its own due diligence, precisely because they don’t have the confidence that the government will bail out the SIFI’s.” Despite the shortcomings of the Bank of America settlement in mismatching compensation to victims and punishments to wrongdoers, the government action may still help incentivize better behavior in the banking sector. “The harm done by lending and securitization practices before the crisis was so broad that there is no practical way of precisely identifying who was harmed, by whom, and by how much,” says Schwarz. “So, maybe a settlement of this sort is the closest thing to justice that is feasible in the real world.” Twitter  Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "What the BoA Settlement Means for the Bank – and for Banking."

Traders are also digesting reports on weekly jobless claims and import and export prices. Nonetheless, traders may continue to look ahead to tomorrow's more closely watched reports on producer prices and retail sales. Financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also due to report their quarterly results before the start of trading on Friday. Stocks saw considerable volatility over the course of the trading session on Wednesday before managing the end the day modestly higher. The major averages moved to the upside going into the close, with the S&P 500 reaching a new high for the session. The Dow climbed 98.75 points or 0.5 percent to 19,954.28, the Nasdaq edged up 11.83 points or 0.2 percent to 5,563.65 and the S&P 500 rose 6.42 points or 0.3 percent to 2,275.32. The volatility seen on Wall Street was partly in reaction to President-elect Donald Trump's comments during his first press conference in several months. In his opening remarks, Trump called for new bidding procedures for the drug industry in order to lower prices, claiming the industry is "getting away with murder." The comments led to a sell-off by drug stocks, which initially contributed to a sharp pullback by the major averages. During the press conference, Trump also indicated he would hand over control of his companies to his sons Eric and Donald Jr. but not divest from his wide business holdings. Ahead of the press conference, the World Bank said Trump's proposed tax cuts and spending plans could boost U.S. and global growth but noted uncertainty about his trade policies adds to risks. The focus on the comments from Trump came amid another quiet day on the U.S. economic front, with traders looking ahead to closely watched reports on producer prices and retail sales on Friday. Financial giants Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also scheduled to release their quarterly results later this week. Steel stocks showed a strong move to the upside as the day progressed, resulting in a 1.9 percent jump by the NYSE Arca Steel Index. Considerable strength was also visible among energy stocks, which rebounded along with the price of crude oil. While software and railroad stocks also saw notable strength, biotechnology stocks posted steep losses following the comments by Trump. The NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index plunged by 3.5 percent, pulling back off its best closing level in well over a month. Significant weakness also emerged among pharmaceutical stocks, as reflected by the 1.7 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are climbing $0.86 to $53.11 a barrel after surging up $1.43 to $52.25 a barrel on Wednesday. An ounce of gold is trading at $1,202, up $5.40 from the previous session's close of $1,196.60. On Wednesday, gold jumped $11.10. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 114.50 yen compared to the 115.41 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0646 compared to yesterday's $1.0582. Asia Asian stocks gave up early gains to close mostly lower on Thursday, with investor sentiment dampened by a strengthening yen, oil price volatility and a lack of clarity from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on his proposed fiscal spending plans. While energy shares gained ground following an overnight rebound in oil prices, healthcare stocks suffered heavy losses after Trump said he is going to negotiate drug pricing. Chinese stocks fell for a third day as investors moved to the sidelines ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays starting on January 27th. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 17.46 points or 0.56 percent to 3,119.29, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 106.33 points or 0.46 percent to 22,829.02. Japanese shares tumbled as a stronger yen weighed on exporters' shares and drug makers also came under heavy selling pressure following Trump's comments on drug pricing. The Nikkei 225 Index slumped 229.97 points or 1.19 percent to 19,134.70, while the broader Topix index closed 0.97 percent lower at 1,535.41. Automakers Mazda, Nissan and Toyota fell around 1 percent each as the yen strengthened versus the dollar for the fourth day. Takeda Pharmaceutical lost 2.6 percent and rival Astellas slumped 4.2 percent. Toshiba plunged 5.4 percent on a report that it is facing heavier losses at its U.S. nuclear unit. Australian shares closed marginally lower even as rising stocks outnumbered the decliners. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index erased early gains to end 4.60 points or 0.08 percent lower at 5,766.90 as losses in the healthcare and consumer staple sectors offset gains by mining and energy stocks. The broader All Ordinaries Index closed 2.10 points or 0.04 percent lower at 5,821.60. Bellamy's Australia shares slumped nearly 18 percent to extend Wednesday's decline after the infant formula maker cut its 2017 revenue forecast and replaced its chief executive. Europe The major European markets have turned mixed on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.1 percent and the German DAX Index is down by 0.6 percent. As risk appetite wanes, investors largely ignored positive data releases. While the German economy expanded at the fastest pace in five years in 2016, Eurozone industrial production grew much more than expected in November, separate reports showed today. Sodexo shares have fallen after the French food services and facilities management company reported a drop in first-quarter consolidated revenues, reflecting weakness in its energy and resources unit. Barratt Developments has also tumbled in London. The homebuilder reported that it completed 367 homes in London during the six months ended in December, down 56 percent from the same period last year. Associated British Food also came under pressure after reporting a drop in like-for-like sales over the Christmas trading period at discount fashion store Primark in Germany and the Netherlands. Meanwhile, Compagnie Financiere Richemont shares have soared after the Swiss luxury goods group posted 6 percent growth in third-quarter sales. German sugar producer Südzucker rallied after lifting its full-year operating result outlook. Shares of JD Sports Fashion have also jumped. The British sportswear firm expects full-year headline pre-tax profit to be ahead of market expectations by up to 15 percent. Department store Debenhams has also moved notably higher as it beat forecasts with a five percent rise in like-for-like sales during the seven-week Christmas period. U.S. Economic Reports The Labor Department released a report showing a modest rebound in initial jobless claims in the week ended January 7th. The report said initial jobless claims rose to 247,000, an increase of 10,000 from the previous week's revised level of 237,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to climb to 255,000. A separate Labor Department report showed a smaller than expected rebound in import prices in the month of December. The Labor Department said import prices climbed by 0.4 percent in December after edging down by a revised 0.2 percent in November. Economists had expected import prices to increase by 0.7 percent. The report also said export prices rose by 0.3 percent in December after slipping by 0.1 percent in November. Export prices had been expected to inch up by 0.2 percent. At 12:30 pm ET, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart is due to repeat a January 9th speech at the Naples Chamber of Commerce, with audience Q&A. The Treasury Department is also scheduled to announce the results of its auction of $12 billion worth of thirty-year bonds at 1 pm ET. Shortly afterward, St. Louis Fed President Bullard is due to present about the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy at the Forecasters Club of New York, with audience and media Q&A. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is also scheduled to host a town hall meeting with educators in Washington, D.C. and nationwide via webcast at 7 pm ET. Stocks in Focus Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings that came in line with analyst estimates on revenues that exceeded expectations. The airline also said it expects margins to expand beginning in the second half of the year. QVC (QVC) reported third quarter U.S. sales that fell 6 percent year-over-year, reflecting the first drop in sales by the home shopping channel in seven years. Homebuilder KB Home (KBH) reported fourth quarter earnings that declined year-over-year but came in slightly above analyst estimates. The company also reported better than expected revenues. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?

"At Bank of America, as a federal regulated financial institution, we abide by federal law and do not bank marijuana-related businesses," the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank said in December 2015. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase have all made similar comments to the press in recent years. These blanket denials have helped the megabanks keep a low profile on a sensitive issue: the cannabis industry's touch-and-go relationship with the U.S. banking system. But the reality inside of big banks is murkier than their public statements suggest. Newly examined records show that numerous marijuana-related entities have had accounts at the four biggest U.S. banks in recent years. The records, which are publicly available from the state of Massachusetts, were analyzed for American Banker by MRB Monitor, a Chicago-based firm that helps financial institutions identify the risks associated with the marijuana industry. The analysis found that out of 84 applicants to operate medical marijuana dispensaries in Massachusetts, 29 reported having access to funds in at least one account at Bank of America, Citi, Wells or JPMorgan, or at one of their subsidiaries. Of the 29 applicants that had access to funds at one of the four big banks, 17 had a connection to B of A. The analysis covered applications filed between June 2015 and September 2016. For 19 of the 29 applicants, these bank accounts were in the names of individuals who were involved in efforts to open pot dispensaries, whose connection to the cannabis industry may not have been obvious to bankers. But in other instances, the accounts were in the names of well-known cannabis firms that were operating in other states. The findings raise questions about the extent to which the big banks are screening customers to determine whether they are part of the cannabis industry. The Obama administration has not made the enforcement of federal marijuana law a top priority, which has reduced pressure on banks. But that could change under the incoming Trump administration, whose attorney general nominee has expressed hostility to pot. The Massachusetts records also complicate two frequently told narratives about the U.S. pot industry. One is that marijuana businesses cannot get bank accounts, and are forced to operate as cash-only businesses. The other is that to the extent that marijuana businesses can get bank accounts, only small financial institutions will work with them. "A commonly held belief seems to be that small institutions are more likely than large institutions to have marijuana-related accounts, knowingly or otherwise," said Steven Kemmerling, the CEO of MRB Monitor. "The data seems to challenge those assumptions and raises the question of whether any financial institution is adequately prepared to identify and manage this particular risk." In 2015, a firm called Mass Organic Therapy applied to the state of Massachusetts to sell medical marijuana. One of the documents that the company submitted to the state asked prospective business owners to show that they had at least $500,000 available and in their control. Mass Organic Therapy listed funds in the name of a company called PalliaTech Inc., which had committed 62% of the initial capital for the venture. The filing includes a letter from a Citibank banker in Sea Cliff, N.Y. The letter was addressed to PalliaTech, and stated that PalliaTech had a Citi account with a balance of just over $1 million as of Oct. 14, 2015. The address listed on the PalliaTech account is right across the street from Citi's branch in Sea Cliff, a village in the town of Oyster Bay on Long Island. "Please let me know if you need any additional information and thank you as always for being a fantastic client," the Citi banker's letter stated. "We appreciate it!" At the time, Long Island-based PalliaTech had signed a lease to operate a medical pot dispensary in Brooklyn; had identified locations for dispensaries in Utica, Rochester and Newburgh, N.Y.; and had leased a production facility in Plattsburgh, N.Y. By late 2015, PalliaTech had also opened a lab in Colorado, had a license for a dispensary in Illinois, and was approved to open a dispensary in New Jersey through an affiliated company. PalliaTech did not respond to requests for comment for this article. Citi terminated the PalliaTech account after a review in early 2016, according to a source familiar with the matter. The New York-based bank said in a statement: "Citi abides by federal law and does not provide financial services to customers that engage in activities prohibited by federal law." A second applicant was a firm called Mission Massachusetts Inc., which recently received preliminary approval to open a medical pot dispensary in Worcester. The company's CEO and two of its directors were shareholders in 4Front Ventures, a cannabis firm in Phoenix. On a document submitted to the state, Mission Massachusetts listed funds in the name of 4Front Ventures. As of May 2015, 4Front Ventures had $1.8 million in a Bank of America business checking account, according to the document. By 2015, 4Front had been operating in the medical marijuana industry in Arizona, Illinois, Nevada and California, according to a document filed in Massachusetts. And the company does not appear to have tried to hide its involvement in the industry from the general public. "Defeat prohibition through sensible regulation," 4Front's website read in 2015. A spokesman for 4Front Ventures did not respond to requests for comment. A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment on specific customers, but did say: "We're a nationally chartered financial institution that complies with federal law." It is not clear whether bankers at either Citi or Bank of America knew that the accounts discussed in this article were connected to the marijuana industry. Given the scrutiny that cannabis firms generally face from financial institutions, they may have an incentive to obscure their business plans. "If they tell the truth, they will either have to pay high fees and endure enhanced due diligence or they'll likely lose an account," Kemmerling said. "But if they are opaque, they may be able to fly under the radar for a period of time, if not indefinitely." At the same time, banks have long-standing obligations to conduct customer due diligence. For customers that are classified as higher risk, banks are expected to take additional steps, such as asking about the purpose of the account both when it is opened and throughout the relationship. Spokesmen for Citi and Bank of America declined to comment on steps those banks take to ensure that marijuana businesses cannot open or maintain accounts. JPMorgan Chase uses a combination of risk-based methods to comply with regulations related to knowing its customers and combating money laundering, according to a spokeswoman, who declined to provide more specific information. Wells Fargo's policy is not to discuss internal practices and procedures that are confidential and proprietary, a spokeswoman said. The Federal Reserve Board and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. declined to comment on the record for this article. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which in 2014 issued guidance designed to encourage more banks to serve the pot industry, also declined to comment. Federal data last year showed that 301 U.S. financial institutions had relationships with marijuana-related businesses, up from 51 around the time the guidance was released. Bryan Hubbard, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said that the agency expects the banks it regulates to follow applicable guidance, including the 2014 document from Fincen, which mentions red flags that banks can consider. One pot industry source said that he knows of certain marijuana businesses that are banking with large financial institutions, in some cases because they have a relationship with a branch manager who is allowing the account to remain open. "A lot of these larger national banks are actually doing it," said Lance Ott, a principal at Guardian Data Systems, a firm that helps marijuana dispensaries with their financial management. Most of the financial institutions that have publicly acknowledged their willingness to serve the cannabis industry are small banks and credit unions. Sundie Seefried is the CEO of one of those institutions, Partners Colorado Credit Union. She is also the author of a 2016 book titled Navigating Safe Harbor: Cannabis Banking in a Time of Uncertainty. Seefried said that her credit union has developed an extensive process for vetting potential clients in the pot business, which includes a three-phase interview process prior to due diligence work. She speculated that big banks may be taking on certain marijuana clients in an effort to better understand the industry. "It's probably a smart move on their part to learn the business, and learn from somebody who's a trusted customer." Massachusetts represents only a small fraction of the U.S. pot industry, but there is reason to believe that marijuana businesses elsewhere generally have access to the banking system. Rick Riccobono, the former director of banks at the Department of Financial Institutions in Washington state, said last year that the idea that pot businesses are forced to rely on physical cash is largely a myth. He noted that approximately 90% of the fees and taxes paid by the industry come into state coffers electronically. "People say it's a total cash business in Colorado and Washington," Riccobono told a reporter. "Quite the opposite. We've actually gotten this thing pretty far along." (Riccobono left the agency late last year). Still, the pot industry's access to the banking system often comes at a steep financial cost — industry sources said in 2015 that marijuana businesses were routinely paying as much as $3,000 a month for basic checking accounts — which may help to explain why industry officials continue to agitate for a change in federal law that would normalize the pot sector. Today there are fears that the incoming Trump administration will move in the opposite direction and crack down on violations of federal law. At a Senate hearing Tuesday, Sen. Jeff Sessions, the president-elect's nominee for attorney general, noted that Congress has made the possession and distribution of marijuana illegal in every state. "If that's something that's not desired any longer, Congress should pass a law," Sessions, R-Ala., said. "It's not so much the attorney general's job to decide what laws to enforce."

(Mark Blinch/Reuters) January 11 BANKS Biggest fourth-quarter trading haul expected Wall Street firms are expected to post the biggest fourth-quarter trading haul since the financial crisis as the U.S. election triggered a frenzy of global markets activity. Fixed-income and stock-trading revenue at the five biggest U.S. investment banks rose 20 percent from a year earlier to $17.3 billion, fueled by a 32 percent surge in bond trading, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The rebound probably will be strongest at Morgan Stanley, the group’s smallest bond shop, with revenue projected to climb 82 percent to $1 billion. The question analysts have for bank executives is whether the fourth quarter heralds a return for bond trading — traditionally the biggest driver of Wall Street profits — or a false dawn created by President-elect Donald Trump’s surprise victory in November. The election upended expectations for interest rates, economic growth and financial regulation, factors that support higher trading volumes if Trump realizes his economic goals. Investors will need reason to believe further gains are possible, given that the KBW Bank Index climbed 23 percent since the Nov. 8 election. “We need to hear from management” on how much potential upside there is for profits in trading and other areas, including lending, said Fred Cannon, head of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, especially on “the sustainability of trading increases.” (Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) Driven by higher trading results, particularly on rates and currencies desks, banks’ total fourth-quarter profit is expected to rise 17 percent to $20.7 billion. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase are scheduled to post results on Friday. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs will report next week. The election boosted stock-trading volumes as institutional investors snatched up shares of financial firms and smaller companies. Banks are expected to post $6.39 billion in equities-trading revenue, 4 percent more than the previous year, driven by gains at JPMorgan and Citigroup. The coming year could be the first since 2012 that both trading and dealmaking revenue increases, Barclays analysts, led by Jason Goldberg, wrote in a note this month. Fixed-income trading will expand as companies reprice debt and big U.S. banks gain market share from European firms. Investment banks’ fee-generating businesses will be boosted as mega-mergers are completed and stock sales pick up following a lull, the analysts predicted. One note of caution is coming from the banks themselves. Morgan Stanley President Colm Kelleher said he’s seen “over-exuberance” about how well trading desks were doing. While the first quarter is typically the strongest for traders, in 2016 it was unusually weak as uncertainty over global growth roiled markets. “If you look at underlying flows, yes, they’ve picked up, particularly since the election, but the overall fee pool that relates to fixed income and equities is only marginally up on the year,” Kelleher said in a Bloomberg Television interview last month. — Bloomberg AUTO industry Carmakers see no end to boom in sales 2017 has been tabbed in Detroit as the year that will mark the end to a nearly decade-long boom in U.S. auto sales. And maybe it will. But there’s little sign of that right now. One after another this week, the world’s biggest carmakers signaled that they don’t see an end to their prosperity anytime soon. General Motors on Tuesday projected another year of profit growth and heaped a $5 billion share buyback plan on top of the $9 billion it started repurchasing in 2015. Hours later, Ford Motor added $200 million cash to its regular first-quarter dividend. Japanese and German carmakers also joined the hometown players at this week’s Detroit auto show in expressing optimism. Nissan Motor — just two months after calling a U.S. market peak — now sees an even better 2017 after the election of Trump and the rise in consumer confidence that’s followed. BMW AG pointed to the good times rolling on Wall Street as one reason luxury vehicle sales will be sustained. The optimism is translating into returns for shareholders. U.S. automakers and suppliers have outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since the beginning of the year, with gains of 7.2 percent at GM and 5.9 percent at Ford. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, benefiting from a bet on shifting its lineup almost exclusively to light trucks, has surged 19 percent in part on speculation that it’s more likely to get a pass from a loosening of environmental regulations under Trump. — Bloomberg Also in Business ● United Airlines plans to fly its last Boeing 747 jumbo jet late this year, retiring its largest airplanes a year ahead of schedule as the iconic aircraft glides into the sunset.

This money comes from a grant, funded by JP Morgan Chase & Co. The U.S. economy is projected to produce millions of high-skill, well-paying jobs over the next decade, but more and more kids are graduating from high school unprepared for college or a career. So JP Morgan Chase is pumping $20 million dollars in to ten states to change that. Oklahoma is one of those states. State Superintendent Joy Hofmeister says Oklahoma will use this money to implement individualized academic plans for kids, and increase the number of high school students concurrently earning college credit or career certifications. "This will enable families to engage early with their own student’s academic strengths, needs and aspirations for the careers and jobs of the future and will equip schools to support that work." As a recipient of the grant, the state Department of Education is tasked with bringing business and government leaders together to achieve these goals. More details on the grant can be found here.

That depends on how you measure value. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 11, 2017 at 2:03PM Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. If you're a current or prospective investor in JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), one of the questions you should be wrestling with right now is whether its shares are cheap or expensive. The answer to that question, in my opinion, is: It depends. JPMorgan Chase vs. other bank stocks Let's start by comparing JPMorgan Chase's valuation to other big bank stocks. This will give us a sense for whether the nation's biggest bank by assets is an outlier in its own industry. It's not. JPMorgan's stock trades for a 68% premium to the bank's tangible book value per share, the preferred valuation metric used by analysts and commentators. The average big bank stock, by contrast, trades for a 102% premium to tangible book value, according to YCharts.com. Based on this, it looks like JPMorgan's stock is reasonably priced, if not cheap. Data source: JPMorgan Chase, YCharts.com. Chart by author. You can make a similar argument about JPMorgan Chase's valuation on an absolute level. In normal times, bank stocks tend to trade for between one and two times tangible book value. When the economy is struggling, they'll go for even less, oftentimes for a discount to tangible book value. When the economy is soaring, alternatively, shares of good banks will often trade for more than twice their tangible book value. Right now, the economy is doing neither. The unemployment rate is low, at 4.6%, but that's in large part because discouraged workers have stopped looking for jobs, which excludes them from factoring into the unemployment rate. GDP growth is decent but far from extraordinary -- 3.5% in the third quarter of last year, though only 1.4% in the second quarter. And while the economy seems to have escaped the deflationary fears from 2015, inflation remains meaningfully below the Federal Reserve's 2% target rate. Given this, it seems safe to say that JPMorgan Chase's stock is, once again, neither overtly cheap or expensive. A 68% premium to tangible book value certainly isn't low, but it's also not as high as it might otherwise be given how well-run JPMorgan Chase is.  JPMorgan Chase vs. other large-cap stocks Looking at this another way, though, could change your perspective. If you look at JPMorgan's price-to-earnings ratio, which is the standard valuation metric used for most stocks, banks being the main exception, then it comes across as materially discounted. Based on its projected earnings over the next 12 months, JPMorgan's stock trades for 15 times earnings. That's a quarter less than the average stock on the S&P 500, which trades for 19 times forward earnings, according to The Wall Street Journal. Data source: YCharts.com, The Wall Street Journal. Chart by author. Consequently, any reasonable answer to the question of whether JPMorgan's stock is cheap or expensive is: It depends on how you're measuring value. If you measure it as a multiple to tangible book value, then its shares seem reasonably priced. But if you measure it as a multiple to earnings, then its shares seem cheap. The fundamentals Either way, it's important to keep in mind that this is a comfortably profitable bank -- and consistently so, which wan't easy over the past decade. Today, even though it's the biggest bank in America, and thereby subject to the toughest capital requirements of any bank, it's still able to generate a 13% return on tangible common equity. That's well above its cost of capital, which means it's creating value for shareholders. On top of this, it's got the second-best banker alive today at the helm -- the best being M&T Bank's Robert Wilmers. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is truly an extraordinary banker. Totally befitting of the venerable JPMorgan brand. He reminds me of the two bankers that led the bank after the Morgan's relinquished control, both of whom were extraordinary bankers themselves. Warren Buffett praises Dimon frequently, most recently calling a 2015 interview of Dimon "off the charts." In light of these two points, it's clear that JPMorgan Chase deserves a premium to its tangible book value. Its current premium of 68% over tangible book isn't cheap by any means, being well above tangible book value, but it's also not expensive, being comfortably below two times tangible book value. To me, it thus seems reasonably priced for a long-term investor -- though, I would personally wait to buy shares until the next market correction.

And it probably should come as no surprise that many of the top firms we cover here at 24/7 Wall St. are already tweaking their high conviction stock lists for 2017. They are trying to take into account macro changes that could make a difference this year, such as higher inflation, a stronger dollar and rising interest rates. They are also trying to factor in positives like lower nominal tax rates and less of the ever burdensome regulations that some feel have stifled business. So JPMorgan has made changes to its U.S. Analyst Focus List for January, and some of the additions have solid upside potential. Each month, the firm asks its equity analysts for one to three of their best stock picks targeted to five different investment strategies: near term, growth, income, value and short ideas. Some 16 companies are added this month, while 14 are removed. Here we focused on five that look to have outstanding upside potential. All are rated Overweight at JPMorgan. Alexion Pharmaceuticals Rumors have flown for some time that this may be a potential acquisition target. Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) develops and commercializes life-transforming therapeutic products. It offers Soliris (eculizumab), a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a genetic blood disorder, and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, a genetic disease. It also provides Strensiq (asfotase alfa), a targeted enzyme replacement therapy for patients with hypophosphatasia, and Kanuma (sebelipase alfa) for the treatment of patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. The company conducts Phase 4 clinical trials on Soliris for the treatment of PNH registry; Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of myasthenia gravis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and delayed kidney transplant graft function; and Phase 2 clinical trials for antibody mediated rejection in presensitized renal transplant patients. The JPMorgan price target for the stock is $170. The Wall Street consensus target is $169.41. Shares closed on Tuesday at $143.67. Eli Lilly This stock also has substantial upside potential. Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) is a global health care company with numerous core products in a number of primary-care pharmaceutical markets. The company generates revenues from its pharmaceutical product and animal health segments. The product portfolio includes Zyprexa (for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), Gemzar (pancreatic cancer), Evista (osteoporosis), Cymbalta (depression), Cialis (erectile dysfunction), Strattera (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), Erbitux (cancer) and Alimta (chemotherapy). Eli Lilly also has a strong presence in the diabetes market. The company posted third-quarter sales and earnings well below Wall Street’s expectations, prompting shares to plummet to a four-month low before rebounding. The stock is down almost 10% on the year and offering investors an outstanding entry point. Top analysts on Wall Street are still very focused on the company’s outstanding late-stage product pipeline, which they and others on Wall Street view as very undervalued. Recently the company announced a disappointing Phase 3 trial for its Alzheimer’s drug solanezumab, which missed the primary and secondary endpoints. While the analysts are forced to remove potential earnings from their model due to the failure, most remain positive on the stock based on “Underappreciated growth, driven by the diabetes base business, baricitinib and abemaciclib.” Shareholders receive a 2.75% dividend. JPMorgan has an $85 price objective, and the consensus target is $84.80. Shares closed Tuesday at $76.27.

(NYSE: JPM) shares are trading higher by $0.10 at $86.53 in Wednesday's session. Ahead of its Q4 earnings report, UBS has initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a $98.00 price target. Following its post-election rally, from its November 8 close to its closing high for the move on January 3 at $87.23, the issue has been in a trading range. Since December 20, the trading range has been defined by its December 29 low ($85.04) and its high for move on January 3 (S87.76). It should be noted the issue has made multiple highs in the $87 handle, but hasn't closed above $87.00 since posting its high close for the move. After a flat open, it had a brief decline which found support just ahead of Tuesday's low ($85.72), only reaching $85.91. So far, the ensuing rally has come up shy of Tuesday's high ($85.90), as $85.75 stands as the current high. Posted-In: Technicals Intraday Update Movers Trading Ideas © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Developed as part of JPMorgan Chase’s $75 million global New Skills for Youth initiative, each winning state will work with government, business and education leaders to strengthen career education and create pathways to economic success. Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Wisconsin will each receive $2 million over three years to expand and improve career pathways for all high school students. An independent advisory committee recommended the states to receive grants from the New Skills for Youth initiative after a rigorous review process. These 10 states demonstrated the strongest plans to work across sectors to transform how they design and develop career preparedness education programs and provide young people with the skills they need to compete for high-skill, well-paying jobs. They have also committed to bring together education leaders, business partners and community partners to set ambitious benchmarks for achieving these goals. “The number of young people who graduate from high school without the necessary skills to compete is one of the greatest moral and economic inequities of our time,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “These investments will help states build career education programs that align with the needs of growing industries and give young people a chance to succeed.” “These states are leading the way to improve career pathways for all kids through partnerships with communities, higher education and leaders in industry,” said CCSSO Executive Director Chris Minnich. “I applaud their efforts and look forward to working with these grantees and other states across the country as they continue to strengthen career preparation for kids.” “Providing opportunities for all students to participate in high-quality career readiness programs is critical to their future success and the future of our country,” said Advance CTE Executive Director Kimberly Green. “I am thrilled at the progress made by these states and excited at the prospects this initiative offers for all learners and all states.” Too many students leave high school without being prepared for college or a career. Nationwide, the unemployment rate for young people ages 16-24 is 9.3 percent, with many more working only part-time or in low-wage jobs with little opportunity to advance. At the same time, the U.S. economy is projected to produce millions of well-paying jobs over the next decade, about two-thirds of which will require some post-secondary education but not necessarily a four-year college degree. For all states, this is an opportunity to work across sectors and pull together stakeholders in business, industry, higher education and within communities to research what has worked and what career pathways are most needed for kids in their state. These state grants are one part of the $75 million, five-year New Skills for Youth initiative developed by JPMorgan Chase, in collaboration with CCSSO, Advance CTE and Education Strategy Group, aimed at strengthening career-focused education starting in high school and ending with postsecondary degrees or credentials aligned with high-skill jobs. In recent years, more than 40 states have committed to transforming career education for all students. In March 2016, JPMorgan Chase and CCSSO awarded $100,000 grants to 24 states and the District of Columbia for planning and early implementation of long-term career readiness education programs that align with the needs of area employers. These states received targeted coaching and support to begin implementing these programs over the past year. The grants awarded today represent the second phase of the New Skills for Youth initiative. All of today’s recipients were selected from the original 24 state grantees. These states will now leverage this additional grant funding to execute the career readiness-plans they developed during phase one of the initiative. Delaware Governor Jack Markell: “In Delaware this year, nearly 6,000 students in 38 of 44 public high schools are enrolled in state-model pathway programs aligned to areas of high demand in Delaware’s economy. This grant will support initiatives like this that are critical to preparing all students for success after high school. In the process, we will come closer to achieving our Delaware Promise, which is that by 2025 the percentage of Delawareans with a college degree or professional certificate will match the percentage of our jobs that will require one – 65 percent.” Delaware Secretary of Education Steven Godowsky: “By earning industry-recognized credentials and college credits while in high school, our students graduate prepared for success. This grant supports the alignment of our education and workforce systems through the Delaware Pathways initiative.” Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin: “If we are to achieve our goal of making Kentucky the hub of excellence in engineering and manufacturing in America, we must work diligently to be more economically competitive. Ensuring we have the most highly skilled and well trained workforce is critical to this effort. The current shortage of skilled workers, makes it difficult for Kentucky employers to create and expand their businesses. This grant will ensure career and technical education is better aligned with the needs of employers and business leaders. This, in turn, will bring about increased economic prosperity for both current and future generations of Kentuckians.” Kentucky Commissioner of Education Stephen Pruitt: “We are excited to expand educational and economic opportunities for young people across Kentucky. The initial New Skills for Youth grant allowed us to really take stock of the career pathways we were offering to ensure students receive the skills, knowledge and credentials they need to compete for the hot jobs of the future. This second phase grant will allow us to dramatically increase opportunities for Kentucky students to complete rigorous and relevant Career and Technical Education programs and earn industry-recognized credentials that will prepare them for postsecondary success and high-skill, high-demand jobs in our state.” Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards: “This New Skills for Youth grant will provide tremendous support for our state’s high school teachers and students in accessing high-quality workforce training, particularly in rural school districts and in support of our students with disabilities. I’m confident that Louisiana’s team of state and local education, economic development and workforce partners will make excellent use of these funds to dramatically improve the number of our young citizens prepared for college, career and life success. This grant funding will advance our state’s efforts to create a seamless system of career and technical education from secondary through post-secondary education, focusing on those industry sectors essential to Louisiana’s prosperity.” Louisiana Superintendent of Education John White: “The Louisiana Department of Education looks forward to utilizing the New Skills for Youth grant to expand Jump Start, the state’s premier career and technical education program. These additional funds will allow the state to build upon that program’s strong foundation by further increasing the opportunities and resources that enable our students to earn the credentials needed to attain employment in Louisiana’s most promising industries.” Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker: “Our administration has focused on aligning our K-12 schools and higher education system with the needs of our workforce so that our students, employers, and communities will share a stronger future. Lieutenant Governor Polito and I are honored that Massachusetts and the potential of our students will be recognized through this grant.” Massachusetts Elementary and Secondary Education CommissionerMitchell Chester: “I am thrilled that Massachusetts students will be among the beneficiaries of this generous grant. I look forward to continuing our collaboration with educators and industry to set students on a clear path toward their own career goals.” Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval: “Nevada was hit harder than any state in the nation by the Great Recession. That’s why my strategic priorities when I took office were to build a vibrant and sustainable economy in addition to ensuring we have an educated and healthy citizenry. The New Skills for Youth grant is another wonderful resource that will help Nevada refocus and transform its economy.” Nevada Superintendent of Public Instruction Steve Canavero: “The New Skills for Youth grant will provide additional support to Nevada and ensure our students gain the skills necessary to compete for jobs in the emerging new Nevada economy. It ensures that our education system and other agencies across the state are aligned with the demands of industry and by working together there will be an increase in the number of students completing relevant and effective career pathways in high demand and high skill areas.” Ohio Governor John Kasich: “Getting kids excited about job opportunities can begin to capture their imagination. By connecting employers with qualified workers, we’re changing the lives of our students and strengthening Ohio’s economy.” Ohio Superintendent of Public Instruction Paolo DeMaria: “In Ohio, we want every student to see a connection between what they are learning and future career options. Ohio’s Governor John Kasich observed that, ‘Getting kids excited about what the job opportunities are, when presented in an exciting way, can begin to capture their imagination.’ The New Skills for Youth grant will drive a comprehensive and strategic approach to excite and inspire every student about career opportunities and students’ future success. Ohio’s strong business and education partnership will have a tremendous new opportunity to expand the rich array of career-focused assets resulting in a deep impact on individual lives and the prosperity of our state.” Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin: “A postsecondary degree, credential or certificate is the new minimum for success in the workforce. The New Skills for Youth Grant builds on my Oklahoma Works Initiative to align education to the needs of the workforce. Through increased cooperation between business and education stakeholders, the grant will put students on a pathway to provide Oklahoma’s employers with a future-ready workforce.” Oklahoma Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hofmeister: “As Oklahoma continues to recover from a recession, the $2 million in funding over three years will help us fast-track college- and career-readiness initiatives including redefining the senior year, securing braided funding and creating a career advising toolkit for Oklahoma students. We are grateful to be partnering with the Governor’s Council for Workforce and Economic Development, the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, the business community and school districts around the state on this work that is so critical to our students’ success and future economic development in our state.” Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo: “Rhode Island’s New Skills for Youth grant is intended to turn our bold vision for improving career readiness in K-12 education into a reality. We are honored to have been recognized for our vision to prepare Rhode Island students for good-paying jobs in our state’s leading industries. By creating pathways between our existing K-12, higher education and workforce development systems, we will meet the needs of our existing employers while also providing jobs that pay for Rhode Islanders.” Rhode Island Education Commissioner Ken Wagner: “We’re committed to offering students opportunities that will strengthen their educational foundation, including early college offerings, career-and-technical education programs aligned to industry standards, and hands-on learning experiences that will prepare them for success in the workforce of tomorrow. This grant affords a wonderful opportunity for us to accelerate our work and link high-quality programs to students that will have lasting benefits for our region and state.” Tennessee Education Commissioner Candice McQueen: “Our work in K-12 education is to prepare students for success beyond our classrooms, and Tennessee is fully committed to strengthening postsecondary and workforce readiness for all students. Funding from this grant will allow us to expand opportunities for students to access early postsecondary opportunities that can equip them for jobs and open doors for them as they graduate from high school, particularly in rural or economically distressed areas and in expanding industries. The grant will also better equip our state to invest more in research and analysis to ensure we are learning from what works and using evidence-based practices to drive students’ success.” Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker: “As we move forward, one of things we want to focus on is ensuring the next generation of Wisconsin workers possess the practical skills and knowledge they need to thrive in their careers. The New Skills for Youth grant helps jump start this process by helping students think about, plan for, and implement a strategy to reach their career goals at an early age. Thanks to the Council of Chief State School Officers and JPMorgan Chase & Co for this opportunity.” Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers: “One of my biggest priorities for Wisconsin schools is connecting educational experiences to the workplace. This grant gives us a chance to bring our education partners together with private businesses to build a structure that will benefit kids in whatever profession they choose. I want to thank JPMorgan Chase and our Wisconsin partners for their work to make this a reality.” Through several targeted philanthropic initiatives, JPMorgan Chase is investing over $325 million in skills development around the world. In addition to the New Skills for Youth initiative, these investments include a separate five-year, $250 million global initiative called New Skills at Work to help fill the skills gap for employers and simultaneously provide adult workers with a real and tangible pathway to economic opportunity, as well as a $5.8 million effort to support summer youth employment programs for youth around the country. New Skills for Youth also builds on CCSSO’s Career Readiness Initiative, which is guided by the recommendations made in Opportunities and Options, a report of CCSSO’s Career Readiness Task Force. The goal is to ensure that all students are not only college-ready, but also graduate from high school prepared for careers in high-skill, high-demand fields.

Home World news Trump rally makes stock options great again for some CEOs Trump rally makes stock options great again for some CEOs Trump's proposed policies for lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energized the U.S. stock market since the real estate magnate's Nov. 8 victory. By: Reuters | Boston | Published: January 11, 2017 2:19 PM Donald Trump. (Reuters) Donald Trump once described Jamie Dimon as “the worst banker in the United States,” but the president-elect has helped make the boss of JPMorgan Chase & Co $50 million richer. Dimon is the top beneficiary among the 30 chief executives who run companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index from a stock rally inspired by Trump’s election, according to a Reuters analysis of their option grants. Trump’s proposed policies for lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energized the U.S. stock market since the real estate magnate’s Nov. 8 victory. The post-election rally even resurrected the value of an option award held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein that was worthless on the eve of the election. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has seen his stock options surge in value by more than $50 million to $146 million since the Republican candidate’s White House win.Trump criticized Dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. Nevertheless, he appointed Dimon to the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of high-profile business leaders he set up last month to advise him on economic growth and job creation. Dimon declined to comment on Trump’s criticism or the rise in value of his holdings. You may also like to watch this video: JACKPOT Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trump’s election win. The figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015. Options that expired or vested in 2016 were excluded from the analysis. In a few cases, CEOs exercised some of those options during 2016, U.S. regulatory filings show. Visa Inc CEO Charles Scharf did not need a Trump-led stock rally to hit the jackpot. About two weeks before the election, he exercised nearly 800,000 options for gross proceeds of almost $33 million, U.S. regulatory filings show. He resigned from Visa effective Dec. 1. For a look at how the post-election rally has affected Dow 30 stock options, click here (http://tmsnrt.rs/2iCbvvT) Trump campaigned on the slogan “Make America Great Again,” vowing to bolster the prospects of the American working class by preventing jobs from moving abroad, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade pacts. In 2015, Trump called high salaries paid to CEOs a “joke” and a “disgrace” and said these were often approved by company boards stacked with CEOs’ friends. PRO-BUSINESS AGENDA To be sure, Trump’s election has helped investors big and small. Hopes of a pro-business agenda have driven the Dow 30 close to 20,000 – a level it has never breached – in a boon for workers’ retirement plans.”With the recent Trump/Republican win, it appears that investors are getting more excited about potential growth and animal spirits are on the rise,” top investment strategists at Morgan Stanley said this month in a wealth management report. “This is likely to lead to the final euphoric stage of this cyclical bull market which could be quite powerful in 2017’s first half.” Big stock option gains for Goldman Sachs head Blankfein, American Express Co CEO Kenneth Chenault and JP Morgan’s Dimon may be a surprise, given that their companies have reduced or even eliminated option grants in recent years in favor of stock awards tied to hitting financial targets. Blankfein’s 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. That was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Blankfein declined to comment. Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York, said the big gains for the leaders of American Express, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reflect how stock option compensation can magnify gains in a company’s share price.”When the stock goes up, with options, you get more leverage,” he said. MEDIOCRE PERFORMANCE Critics of stock options say the grants can produce large amounts of wealth for CEOs even with mediocre performance. One reason is that grants often are not linked to any financial performance metric, such as return on equity. And so as the United States nears the eighth year of a bull market, options can increase in value even if the CEOs are running companies whose share price has lagged broad benchmarks during their tenure. For example, shares of Caterpillar Inc rose 54 percent during Douglas Oberhelman’s tenure as CEO of the big equipment maker from mid-2010 to the end of 2016, while the Dow 30 more than doubled during that span. But the value of Oberhelman’s options rallied during his last year as CEO, climbing to $20.3 million after being under water by nearly $9 million at the start of 2016. The options’ value got a $10.6 million booster shot after Trump’s victory. Caterpillar shares rose 36 percent in 2016, making it one of the best performing stocks on the Dow. Trump has said he would use Caterpillar tractors to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Caterpillar and Oberhelman declined to comment. Not all CEOs have been winners, however. Coca-Cola Co CEO Muhtar Kent, who contributed $2,700 to Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival for president, saw the value of his options decline by $11.3 million to $143 million. Coca-Cola shares are off 3 percent since Trump was elected amid lingering concerns about consumers cutting their consumption of sugary drinks. A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.

The regulation is likely to add to analysts' concern about moves to strike back over unfavourable investment commentary after Indonesia punished the U.S. bank for its downgrade of the country's stocks in November. Primary dealers "have the duty to safeguard the partnership with the Indonesian government based on professionalism, integrity, the avoidance of conflict of interest, and looking at the interests of the Republic of Indonesia," according to documents uploaded to the ministry's website on Wednesday. The documents, dated Dec. 30, said the finance minister can revoke the appointment of a primary dealer if it does not fulfill the stated conditions. The finance minister also has the authority to accept or reject an application to be a primary dealer by taking into consideration the track record of the bank or securities firm, including its working experience with the ministry. A primary dealer is a bank or a securities firm appointed by the finance minister that can buy government bonds in auctions and resell them in the secondary market. Indonesia had 19 such dealers as of Nov. 25. Foreigners hold more than 37 percent of Indonesia's government bonds. The local capital market lacks depth and liquidity, making the perception of foreign investors particularly important for Southeast Asia's biggest economy. The Finance Ministry dropped the JPMorgan's services as a primary dealer for domestic sovereign bonds and as an underwriter for bonds sold to the global market. The bank also no longer receives certain transfers of state revenue. Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry's fiscal policy office, on Jan. 4 defended the penalising of JPMorgan, saying its research was "not credible and not objective".

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Asian stock markets were mixed on Friday as disappointing Chinese trade data dented already bleak investor sentiment following U.S. President-elect's Donald Trump's news conference. The U.S. dollar rebounded. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.7 percent to 19,275.44 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.5 percent to 22,936.98. China's Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent to 3,122.87. But South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent to 2,076.08 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 1 percent to 5,711.30. Stocks in Singapore were higher but in Indonesia and the Philippines, markets were lower. ANALYST'S TAKE: "A correction may have been due following the exuberance of the market reaction to the election of Trump," said Alex Furber, a sales trader at CMC Markets. "Uncertainty lies ahead and market participants will want to see how the new administration takes shape." CHINA TRADE: Customs data showed that Chinese exports sank 6.1 percent in December from a year earlier. In November, China's exports eked out a 0.1 percent expansion after shrinking for nine straight months. Imports rose 3.1 percent from a year earlier. WALL STREET: U.S. stock markets finished moderately lower. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 63.28 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,891. The average had briefly been down more than 183 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 4.88 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,270.44. The Nasdaq composite fell 16.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,547.49. OIL: Benchmark crude oil rose 10 cents at $53.11 per barrel in New York. The contract gained 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $53.01 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, gained 8 cents to $56.09 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar strengthened to 115.07 yen from 114.86 yen while the euro declined to $1.0608 from $1.0611. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Fixed-income and stock-trading revenue at the 5 biggest U.S investment banks rose 20% from a year earlier to $17.3-B, driven by a 32% rise in bond-trading, according to analysts’ estimates. The rebound probably will be strongest at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), the group’s smallest bond shop, with revenue projected to climb 82% to $1-B. The question analysts have for bank executives is whether Q-4 heralds a return for bond trading, traditionally the biggest driver of Wall Street profits, or a false dawn created by Donald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential election. Donald Trump’s election upended expectations for interest rates, economic growth and financial regulation, factors that support higher trading volumes if he realizes his economic goals. Investors will need reason to believe further gains are possible, given that the KBW Bank Index climbed 23% since the November 8th election. Driven by higher trading results, particularly on rates and currencies desks, banks’ total Q-4 profit is expected to rise 17% to $20.7-B. Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are scheduled to post results on Friday. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will report next week. The election boosted stock-trading volumes as institutional investors snatched up shares of financial firms and smaller companies. Banks are expected to post $6.39-B in equities-trading revenue, 4% more than the previous year, driven by gains at JPMorgan and Citigroup. The coming year could be the 1st since Y 2012 that both trading and dealmaking revenue increases. Fixed-income trading will expand as companies reprice debt and big US banks gain market share from European firms. Investment banks’ fee-generating businesses will be boosted as mega-mergers are completed and stock sales pick up following a lull, analysts predict. One note of caution is coming from the banks themselves. Morgan Stanley President Colm Kelleher said he’s seen “over-exuberance” about how well trading desks were doing. While the first quarter is typically the strongest for traders, in 2016 it was unusually weak as uncertainty over global growth roiled markets. “If you look at underlying flows, yes they’ve picked up, particularly since the election, but the overall fee pool that relates to fixed income and equities is only marginally up on the year,” Mr. Kelleher said in a TV interview last month.

Donald Trump “hired a lot of professional people, people that are experienced, successful, smart and patriotic,” he said. Mr. Dimon’s comments came amid this week’s of Senate confirmation hearings. All of President Elect Trump’s picks are expected to win confirmation, barring any unexpected revelations. Mr. Dimon praised Steve Mnuchin, Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary, saying the former CEO of OneWest Bank Group LLC is “very qualified” and “wants to do the right thing.” Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee for Secretary of State, is “respected by everyone he deals with around the world,” Mr. Dimon said. Mr. Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp.(NYSE:XOM) was pressed on US-Russia relations during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, responding that Moscow has acted against US interests and urged an “open and frank dialogue” on areas of mutual concern. “Rex Tillerson is a class act — he’s smart, he’s patriotic,” Mr. Dimon said. “Almost every big company has dealings in Russia; that doesn’t mean he’s not a patriot.” Stay tuned…   Cabinet, confirmation, Dimon, Donald, JPM, optimistic, people, Trump, XOM Jamie Dimon Optimistic, Praises Donald Trump’s Cabinet Picks added by Paul Ebeling on January 12, 2017 View all posts by Paul Ebeling → The following two tabs change content below.

Play Video MoneyWatch Who is U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin? Donald Trump's pick to lead the Treasury Department is, like the president-elect, a political outsider. We look at Steven Mnuchin's career trajec... One of those “professionals” among Mr. Trump’s Cabinet picks is Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary nominee and a former Goldman Sachs partner, who Dimon said will make a “formidable” team with Mr. Trump. “I think he’s quite qualified, he’s very smart, he wants to do the right thing,” Dimon said, after revealing that he himself had never been offered the job. As for Rex Tillerson, who was grilled Wednesday in a confirmation hearing for secretary of state, Dimon also voiced his support, calling the former ExxonMobil CEO a “class act.” “He’s smart and he’s patriotic. I listen to the press about -- that he had dealings in Russia -- well, almost every big company is dealing with Russia. That doesn’t mean he’s not a patriot. I wouldn’t question his patriotism. The other thing people talk about, that they’re successful. Think of the counterfactual. Do you want to have unsuccessful people in these jobs? … Successful, experienced, respected by everybody in deals around the world. I think that’s a pretty good trait.” In his first press conference since winning the race, Mr. Trump reminded people about a promise he had made. Play Video CBSN Full Trump Press Conference In Donald Trump's first press conference as president-elect, he spoke about his ties to Russia, the upcoming inauguration, and bringing jobs to t... “I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created. And I mean that,” Mr. Trump said. Dimon said he hopes Mr. Trump is right.   “For any president, it is important that we have a healthy, vibrant economy,” Dimon said. “It’s important for jobs, it’s important for businesses, important for middle-class wages, important for low-scale wages, and I’m hoping a lot of the policies they’re talking about – because they’re talking about trade tax reforms, we desperately need. And that’s probably the most important thing.”  The president-elect also said there would be a “very large border tax” for companies that choose to take U.S. jobs abroad. But Dimon wasn’t worried. “I’m looking past the one-liners and thinking about what’s important for America. So a lot of us do business all around the world. Part of America’s competitiveness is because we have Microsoft, because we have Boeing, because we have JPMorgan Chase, and we have to educate the world on the importance of that,” Dimon said. “But there are downsides. So in this election, I guess around the world, you’ve seen people recognizing there are downsides to trade. There are people who have been hurt.” To address that, Dimon said the country needs to do a better job with trade adjustment assistance, where the government helps workers who lost their jobs due to foreign trade. “I think we have to do all of these various things to make sure it works for everybody in America,” Dimon said. Dimon is heading to Davos, Switzerland, for the next week’s World Economic Forum, where Chinese President Xi Jinping will be in attendance for the first time to promote globalization. With Donald Trump emphasizing an “America First” trade stance and the European Union grappling with a looming Brexi, some have suggested China is now the leader of economic globalization. But Dimon begged to differ. “[China] is so far behind the United States, it’s not even funny. I say that respectfully,” Dimon said. “They have 500 million people living in poverty. Not enough food, water, energy. They don’t have our wide, deep capital markets, they don’t have our education system, they don’t have our rule of law, they don’t have most of what we have, our innovation capabilities.” However, he said he understands that “China wants to rise up among the world and take its rightful place.” “But my personal opinion, it’s very important that America maintain its superior economic position which, by the way, is the root, the foundation of a superior military position. They go hand in hand,” Dimon said. “America has been so important for the growth of the world, the consistency of the world, the economic freedom of the world, the spray of democracy that we shouldn’t lose that.”  JPMorgan Chase is also awarding 10 states a total of $20 million in grants to provide students who graduate from high school with “the skills they need to compete for high-skill, well-paying jobs.” “There is economic and moral imperative in this country that we get jobs for kids. And we have too many kids, particularly in inner city schools who don’t graduate or if they do graduate, they’re not qualified for a job. So this is all the things they need, from social skills to specific skills to get kids jobs,” Dimon said.  They would be preparing for “middle class jobs,” Dimon added, which will pay between $40,000 to $60,000 a year.  © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Dina Lohan is on the brink of losing the family's two-story home in Merrick, on Long Island, NY, to foreclosure, according to Page Six. She bought it for $650,000 in 2004 but then took out a $1.3 million loan on the property where Lindsay, 30, and her siblings Michael Jr., 28, Ali, 22, and Dakota, 19, lived as children. Under threat: Dina Lohan is on the brink of losing the family's two-story home in Merrick, on Long Island, NY, to foreclosure Court records from New York’s Nassau County show that JPMorgan Chase Bank sued the 54-year-old three years ago for allegedly defaulting on the mortgage payments. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next What a gentleman! Lindsay Lohan keeps warm in chilly... From Italy, with love! Lindsay Lohan blows kisses at posh... Share this article Share The lawsuit claimed Dina 'failed to comply with the conditions of the mortgage … by failing to pay portions of principal, interest or taxes, assessments, water rates, insurance premiums, escrow and/or other charges.' It appears that Lindsay’s mom may have worked out a payment arrangement with the bank at that time, because the case went dormant. New owner?: A New York court has given JPMorgan Chase Bank permission to foreclose and sell the 4,119-square-foot, Colonial-style house and pool after the 54-year-old failed to keep up payments on her $1.3 million mortgage But last February JPMorgan Chase Bank went back to court, demanding foreclosure and sale of the 4,119-square-foot, Colonial-style house and pool. Dina did not turn up in court to defend herself and on December 1, the judge granted the bank’s motion for summary judgment, giving it the right to foreclose and hold an auction to sell the home. The next step will be for the bank to file its plan for a foreclosure sale, according to Page Six. United front: Dina stood by her daughter in this shot of she and Lindsay leaving a Los Angeles court in 2013, but the star may not be able to bail her mother out of her debt It estimated that the house is now worth just under $893,00, some $400,000 less than Dina borrowed on it. Back in 2012, Lindsay stepped up and gave her mother $40,000 to help prevent foreclosure, according to Radar. Dina, who made a name for herself as a reality star in Living Lohan, Lindsay and, most recently, Family Therapy With Doctor Jenn, has yet to file any opposition to the current court order.   Read more: Dina Lohan may lose Long Island home to foreclosure | Page Six Lohan Money Troubles: Lindsay's Mom Facing Foreclosure Again! | Radar Online Share or comment on this article e-mail 76 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow She's falling for him?

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 12, 2017 2:16pm   Comments Share: Big banks kick off earnings season Friday, and many analysts expect robust results after a post-election stock-trading frenzy that may have provided stronger revenue. Lined up for tomorrow are Bank of America Corp(NYSE: BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC), and there’s plenty of enthusiasm going into the results. The financial sector overall appears to have been a big benefactor of what traders are calling the “Trump rally,” a market surge that began almost immediately after the November presidential elections. BAC shares have swelled some 35% since Nov. 8 to reach an eight-year high, while JPM shares are higher by nearly 29% after reaching record peaks. WFC is up by 20% after tapping an 18-month high. Analysts expect these banks (as well as Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS), and Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C), which are expected to report next week) to turn in robust results thanks to stronger trading revenues and higher yields on Treasury notes. They could also be bolstered by a handful of products like credit cards, and student and consumer loans. Trading revenue, particularly in fixed income, currency and commodities, had been a sore spot for banks up until about Q2. That started to stabilize last year and apparently was buttressed further with the post-election trading extravaganza. But a note here about the seasonality of banking revenues: Though analysts expect Q4 to be relatively strong because of the unexpected end-of-year trading rush, the last quarter traditionally tends to be among the weakest for financials, analysts say. That’s typically because many traders and institutional investors tend to wrap up their portfolios and books ahead of the holidays, when they take time off. Beyond results, many market participants are expected to pay close attention to what bank executives say on their earnings calls about the economic outlook for 2017. A new presidential administration has promised deregulation and tax changes, and the Federal Reserve has said it might step up interest rates three more times this year after December’s nudge. Investors may want to listen to what bank CEOS have to say about all these changes and what they mean not only for the sector but the economy as a whole.  BAC’s Profit Forecast Jumps BAC has undergone drastic cost cutting in recent quarters after it closed some 400 banks and stepped up investments in financial technology, including card-less ATMs and new mobile banking features. Analysts expect those moves to help lift profits, which they see jumping some 40%. At an industry conference in November, BAC Chief Financial Officer Tom Montag said the higher trading volumes are expected to juice double-digit growth in trading revenue. Analysts reporting to Thomson Reuters Corp (NYSE: TRI) forecast revenues that may come in 7% higher than a year ago at $20.96 billion, while earnings are projected at $0.38 a share. Short-term options traders have priced in a potential share price move of 2.5% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: AMTD). Call option activity has been strong at the weekly 23-strike and 23.5-strike lines, while put activity is heaviest at the 22 and 22.5 strikes. The implied volatility sits in the lower half at the 16th percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.) Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.  JPM’s Trading Business Gains Analysts are also looking for JPM to turn in another solid quarter, especially after Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said at an industry conference in December that he expected his trading business to see a 15% quarterly gain from the year-ago period. He also noted then that JPM had picked up a “little bit” of market share in the interest-rates business after the exit of European banks, according to the media reports. It’s likely, too, that analysts may be listening for some insight on whether JPM will continue to buy back its shares, considering the stock has hit new-time highs. Dimon said in December that he wouldn’t likely share that information until February or April. At Thomson Reuters, analysts are projecting revenues to edge up to $23.95 billion and per-share profits to advance better than 8% to $1.43. Short-term options traders have priced in a potential share price move just over 2% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator. On the call side, volume is heaviest at the weekly 87 strike while put activity is busy at the 86 strike. The implied volatility also sits in the lower half at the 20th percentile.  WFC on the Comeback Trail WFC appears to still be struggling to come back from last year’s revelation that some employees opened upwards of 2.1 million fake accounts, leading to a $185 million fine tied to the scandal and the ouster of its chief executive. In November, WFC said it may face litigation costs that could reach an estimated $1.7 billion, and confirmed ongoing investigations from other regulatory agencies. Last month, WFC reported that its new checking-account and credit-card openings have both dropped deeper than 40% in November from the same period a year before. This week the bank announced that it was restructuring employee compensation packages that focused on rewarding customer satisfaction and didn’t include sales goals. Thomson Reuters’ analysts are expecting revenues to climb 4% to $22.47 billion while earnings could slip to $1.00 from last year’s profit of $1.03. Short-term options traders have priced in a potential share price move of just over 2% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator.

Hong) Many companies don’t keep enough cash By: The Associated Press January 12, 2017 2:17 pm 0 NEW YORK — When Rafael Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. “Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it’s not really your money till you pay your taxes,” says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. “At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped.” Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous’ cash reserves. “Cash is king” is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn’t coming in, and owners can’t get loans or investors, there’s no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they’d have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It’s especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. “They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy,” Solomon says. Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50 percent drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. “The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks,” JPMorgan Chase said. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he’s willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company’s more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took a $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company’s busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20 percent of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company’s cash position. “If everything went south, we’d probably have enough cash for two or three months,” he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They’ve given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They’ve also gotten better terms from lenders. Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that’s a sign of trouble to Basilo — they’re not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. “That’s how they think when they start their business. They’re very unprepared,” he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores’ down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor’s ability to negotiate better prices. While they do have savings, they don’t want to tap them for cash flow. “We pretend that the savings doesn’t exist,” Dan Robinson says.

Markets are weak Thursday going into earnings season for very good reasons. Until this week, stocks, the dollar, and 10-year yields have mostly moved sideways since mid-December. But this week the 10-year yield has slid to the lowest level since the end of November, and the dollar has slid back to its early December levels. I have called the market a "coiled spring" several times in the past week because markets are priced for perfection: stocks are at highs, investor sentiment is at highs, and consumer sentiment is at highs. On top of that, there are high — VERY high — expectations that earnings will expand in 2017. Some are anticipating the S&P 500 could put up a 20 percent increase in overall earnings. That is a LOT to ask. Throw in the now well-known "Trump tweet risk" and the difficulty of knowing the final impact of the Trump campaign promises of lower taxes/less/regulation/fiscal stimulus, and you've got plenty of reason for the markets to take a pause. Not surprisingly, some big names have seen downgrades this week, including Disney and Boeing today, joining Coca-Cola, Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble. It's worth noting expectations for bank earnings, since JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and PNC report tomorrow. While most industries are not seeing any increase in earnings expectations for 2017 since the election, earnings for big banks have seen modest increases. JPMorgan, for example, has seen 2017 earnings estimates go from $6.25 prior to the election to $6.50 today, according to Factset. That's a rise of about 4 percent. Other banks have also seen a rise in 2017 estimates since the election: Banks: 2017 earnings revisions (since Nov. 1) JPMorgan: up 4% Bank of America: up 7.6% PNCBank: up 3.1% WellsFargo: up 2.2% Source: Factset This is good news, but the problem is prices have run up big. The Bank ETF (KBE) is about 20 percent since the elections. Here's an additional problem: it's highly unlikely we are going to get 2017 earnings guidance from JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo or PNC. None of them gave 2016 guidance at this time last year. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon will certainly comment on the economy (I expect him to be upbeat) but he is notoriously dismissive of guidance. In a 2015 Bloomberg interview, Dimon took a dim view of predicting the future: "Don't make earnings forecasts. You don't know what's going to happen every quarter. I don't even care about quarterly earnings." Finally, I've been asked repeatedly how to play the bank earnings season. Unfortunately, precedent is not a lot of help. Our partners at Kensho note that JPMorgan has beaten estimates 22 times since 2010—that's about 75 percent of the time. On week later, JPMorgan is down an average of 0.3 percent, while the KBE is down an average of 0.2 percent. In other words, banks typically do not rally after earnings season. Where's all this going? I am bullish on earnings for the year, I believe they will see a nice boost. I'm not sure about 20 percent, but 10 percent is certainly doable. But the period we are going into now will be characterized by a dearth of clear information, and the markets need to take a breath and believe the data will be forthcoming. If it's tax cuts you are looking for, there are some positive signs already: the efforts to remove the Obamacare tax — already underway — will take capital gains taxes from 23.8 percent to 20 percent. That can happen very quickly!

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said he’s optimistic about President-elect Donald Trump’s administration because of the group of people he’s assembled to fill his cabinet. “If you want to win the game, put Tom Brady on the field,” Dimon, 60, said in an interview Thursday on CBS This Morning. Trump’s “hired a lot of professional people, people that are experienced, successful, smart and patriotic,” he said. Dimon’s comments came amid this week’s marathon of Senate confirmation hearings. All of Trump’s picks are expected to win confirmation, barring unexpected revelations or major gaffes. Dimon praised Steve Mnuchin, Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary, saying the former CEO of OneWest Bank Group LLC is “very qualified” and “wants to do the right thing.” Despite rumors last year that he was under consideration for the Treasury job, Dimon said Thursday he wasn’t offered the position, adding that he hasn’t finished his work at JPMorgan and at the Business Roundtable, an association of U.S. CEOs. Rex Tillerson, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, is “respected by everyone he deals with around the world,” Dimon said. Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., has faced criticism for his dealings in Russia in the run-up to his confirmation. He was pressed on U.S.-Russia relations during his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, responding that Moscow has acted against U.S. interests and urged an “open and frank dialogue” on areas of mutual concern. “Rex Tillerson is a class act -- he’s smart, he’s patriotic,” Dimon said. “Almost every big company has dealings in Russia; that doesn’t mean he’s not a patriot.”   © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

In 1988 it was one of the ten original members of the most popular emerging-market equity index, introduced by MSCI. In the late 1990s it was also the biggest member of the benchmark-bond indices compiled by JPMorgan Chase. But once it defaulted at the end of 2001, Argentina was exiled from global debt markets. And after it subsequently imposed capital controls on “hot money”, its shares suffered a similar banishment, ejected from MSCI’s index in 2009. It became a remote “frontier market”, like countries such as Bangladesh. Since Mauricio Macri succeeded Cristina Fernández de Kirchner as president at the end of 2015, Argentina has been finding its way back from the financial periphery. It has floated its currency and lifted capital controls, recently abolishing a remaining requirement that foreign investors keep their money in the country for at least 120 days. In April the government sold $16.5bn of dollar bonds to international investors in a single day (a record for an emerging market). Later this year, MSCI will decide whether to welcome Argentina’s shares back into its emerging-market index, starting with companies with an overseas listing, such as Adecoagro, which farms sugar and soyabeans, among other things. And on January 5th, JPMorgan Chase said it would admit Argentina’s peso bonds into its widely tracked benchmark indices, probably from February. The emerging-market asset class has not lacked drama in Argentina’s absence. The introduction of quantitative easing (QE) after the financial crisis inspired a rush into higher-yielding emerging-market bonds. Talk of “tapering” QE in 2013 prompted a partial reversal. As a borrowing currency, the dollar has waned in significance relative to local currencies such as the rupiah or real. Dollar-denominated bonds have been a better buy for investors in recent years, but less popular among government issuers. The share of hard-currency debt declined from roughly half on average in 2000 to about a quarter in 2014, according to Moody’s, a rating agency. Much of this evolution has passed Argentina by. Until 2016 its government had to sell most of its bonds to fellow Argentines, including the country’s banks and its public-pension reserve fund. But although it was mostly sold to locals, the debt was chiefly denominated in dollars. Over 70% of the government’s debt is still denominated in foreign currencies, according to the ministry of finance. The high inflation and capricious currency policies of the post-default years meant Argentines did not trust the peso to hold its value. So for all of the nationalist fire of Ms Kirchner and her husband, her predecessor as president, their policies left them heavily reliant on the greenback to attract creditors. Argentina’s expulsion from global debt markets came within days of China’s entry into the World Trade Organisation. Asia now accounts for about 70% of emerging-market GDP and a similar share of MSCI’s emerging-market equity benchmark (see chart). The bond indices, in contrast, remain far more evenly balanced between the regions. JPMorgan Chase’s most popular local-currency version still excludes China’s vast market altogether. That may not last. In the past year China, too, has eased the capital controls that fenced off its debt markets. China may thus follow Argentina into the benchmark indices in due course.

Looking for another fresh start, the troubled actress wiped her Instagram account and hit her first red carpet event in months. Her mother, Dina Lohan, may also be welcoming change in the new year. Dina’s in a tussle with the State of New York’s Supreme Court, which is on the brink of foreclosing on Lilo’s childhood home. According to court records from New York’s Nassau County, JPMorgan Chase Bank sued Dina three years ago for allegedly defaulting on the mortgage payments for the family’s two-story home in Merrick, NY, where Lindsay and her three siblings were raised. The bank filed for foreclosure. Dina purchased the home for $650,000 in 2004. The lawsuit claimed Dina took out a $1.3 million loan and “failed to comply with the conditions of the mortgage … by failing to pay portions of principal, interest or taxes, assessments, water rates, insurance premiums, escrow and/or other charges.” It appears that Lindsay’s mom may have worked out a payment arrangement with the bank at the time, because the case went dormant until February 2016, when JPMorgan Chase Bank went back to court, demanding foreclosure and sale of the 4,119-square-foot, Colonial-style house with a pool out back. Dina did not respond to the allegations that she’d defaulted on her mortgage, nor did she appear in court to defend herself. On Dec. 1, the judge granted the bank’s motion for summary judgment, giving it the right to foreclose and hold an auction to sell the home. The next step will be for the bank to file its plan for a foreclosure sale. The house is currently estimated to be worth about $892,782—considerably less than what Lindsay’s mom borrowed on it. Since Dina has yet to file any opposition, it’s possible she’s moved on and out already. If not, she’d better get packing—unless she wants to mount a last-ditch effort to save the home. Although her parenting style is different, Dina has proved to be resourceful in the past. She’s parlayed her real-life role as Lindsay’s mom and sometimes manager into a reality TV career. She’s appeared as herself in reality series including “Living Lohan,” “Lindsay,” and, most recently, “Family Therapy With Doctor Jenn.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on Realtor.com.

 Amazon and Chase introduce Prime credit card BI Intelligence Jan. 12, 2017, 11:15 AM 5,387 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Amazon quietly purchased a cybersecurity firm — here's 3 ways Amazon could use the technology Amazon integrates Alexa with meal delivery service THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY EXPLAINED: The Trends Creating New Winners And Losers In The Card-Processing Ecosystem This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Amazon and JPMorgan Chase have partnered to introduce a new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card, which will be the first card to target members of Amazon Prime, the e-commerce company's prized loyalty program. It will do so primarily with a lucrative 5% cashback offer on all Amazon.com purchases, but also includes restaurant, gas station, and drugstore rewards, boasts no foreign transaction fees, and offers a 24/7 concierge service. By partnering with an e-commerce giant, Chase will likely boost adoption of its credit cards.  Amazon Prime's large user base and strong engagement could boost Chase.  Amazon Prime has a massive user base. Amazon Prime had 49.5 million members in the US alone as of Q3 2016, according to Cowen & Co. estimates. This is roughly a 23% increase year-over-year (YoY). That's a large addressable base for Chase to target, especially because it's likely to continue to rise as Amazon pushes more offerings through Prime.  And these users spend more often than nonmembers. Amazon Prime members accounted for 57% of all Amazon purchases in October 2016, compared with 49% last year. Moreover, 83% of Prime members made a purchase in that period, compared with just 49% of non-Prime members. That strong engagement could make the card popular among these consumers, as frequent spending would allow customers to rack up rewards quickly. And that benefits Chase — if adoption and spend on the card is high, it has the potential to capitalize on the resulting interchange fees.  The announcement comes on the heels of Chase reducing the sign-on reward on its extremely popular Sapphire Reserve card. The bank's partnership with Amazon will afford reward-seeking consumers a new credit card option that is unlikely to lead to astronomical costs for Chase — the firm's Sapphire Reserve credit card could end up reducing the bank’s profit by $200 million to $300 million in Q4 2016, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, with the popularity of the Sapphire Reserve card likely to decline — this card was in part responsible for the 35% increase in new Chase card accounts in Q3 2016 — Chase is probably looking for a way to replicate its early success. Amazon Prime's audience size, spend, and engagement could be the perfect audience to help do that. Time will tell how this card will affect the broader payments ecosystem, if at all.  John Heggestuen, director of research at BI Intelligence, Business Insider’s premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the payments ecosystem that drills into the industry to explain how a broad range of transactions are processed, including prepaid and store cards, as well as revealing which types of companies are in the best and worst position to capitalize on the latest industry trends. Here are some key takeaways from the report: 2016 will be a watershed year for the payments industry. Payments companies are improving security, expanding their mobile offerings, and building commerce capabilities that will give consumers a more compelling reason to make purchases using digital devices. Payments is an extremely complex industry. To understand the next big digital opportunity lies, it's critical to understand how the traditional credit- and debit-processing chain works and what roles acquirers, processors, issuing banks, card networks, independent sales organizations, gateways, and software and hardware providers play. Alternative technologies could disrupt the processing ecosystem. Devices ranging from refrigerators to smartwatches now feature payment capabilities, which will spur changes in consumer payment behaviors. Likewise, blockchain technology, the protocol that underlies Bitcoin, could one day change how consumer card payments are verified. In full, the report: Uncovers the key themes and trends affecting the payments industry in 2016 and beyond. Gives a detailed description of the stakeholders involved in a payment transaction, along with hardware and software providers. Offers diagrams and infographics explaining how card transactions are processed and which players are involved in each step. Provides charts on our latest forecasts, key company growth, survey results, and more. Analyzes the alternative technologies, including blockchain, which could further disrupt the ecosystem.

She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. She is a qualified chartered accountant. Follow @GillianTan Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Jan 12, 2017 7:30 AM EST BANK OF AMERICA CORP +0.09 At Closing, Jan 13th 23.01 USD Friday marks a big day for bank investors, with three of the largest U.S. lenders -- Bank of America Corp., JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. -- each set to report fourth-quarter earnings. A continued recovery in fixed-income trading is widely expected, as is a potential uplift in investment-banking revenue. And thanks to the prospect of a rising interest-rate environment (supported by December's rate hike), net interest margins should show their first signs of expansion -- the anticipation of which has already helped drive a more than 20 percent rally in the KBW Bank Index since Nov. 8.  Turnaround Ahead? A rising-rate environment bodes well for banks whose net interest margins have been under pressure Source: Bloomberg Intelligence One area that may not attract as much attention is mortgage banking, a business that banks have retreated from in recent years due to pricing pressure stemming from the Federal Reserve's rate policies and the influx of competitors. Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods expect mortgage originations at Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo to have fallen by a combined 24 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier to $89.7 billion, while the trio's mortgage banking revenue may have slipped 14 percent to $2.5 billion.  Yet there's an opportunity here. Higher interest rates should encourage banks to more aggressively pursue mortgage lending because it will be more lucrative. Yes, there is a flip side in that demand for loans tends decline when rates are on the rise (and many borrowers have already locked in long-term mortgages or refinanced in recent years). But even so, at least interest margins should start going the right way. Ready to Rumble? After peaking at a quarterly figure of nearly $9 billion in 2009 (and getting close in 2012), U.S. banks have been earning less from mortgages as low interest rates squeezed margins Source: Bloomberg Intelligence This should give big banks incentive to refocus here and try to claw back share from non-bank lenders such as Quicken Loans Inc., which made its mark during the refinancing wave that occurred in 2012 and 2013. The Detroit-based company founded by billionaire Dan Gilbert originated some $27 billion in mortgages during the third quarter of 2016 -- the same figure as JPMorgan and more than Bank of America, and did so by leaning on marketing and technology rather than the traditional method of bank branches.  Step It Up The largest lenders have ceded mortgage originations market share to non-bank lenders including Quicken Loans Source: Bloomberg Intelligence *Data shown includes the first three quarters of 2016 Apart from Quicken, the biggest banks are competing against upstarts such as Loandepot.com LLC, as well as mortgage specialists including PennyMac Financial Services Inc. and Freedom Mortgage Corp. -- not to mention longtime rivals like Citigroup Inc. and US Bancorp (which both report their own fourth-quarter results next week). Making Headway Non-banks have been successfully nibbling away at the mortgage originations business once dominated by large lenders Source: Bloomberg Intelligence In the wake of the financial crisis, banks have hopefully learned that any concerted push to recapture a bigger slice of the mortgage market should come with discipline, so as to avoid credit losses or falling afoul of regulators. But that still leaves a lot of ground to recapture.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

A greater supply of Islamic bonds from the GCC in 2017, as investors seek to tap new pools of cash, probably won’t be enough to compensate for smaller sovereign transactions, he said. The biggest U.S. bank, which displaced HSBC Holdings Plc as the top Gulf debt arranger in 2016 after the British bank spent nine years at the peak, also expects more issues from government-related companies than last year. Gulf Bond League Table for 2016 GCC bond sales climbed to $72 billion in 2016 as governments tapped debt markets to bridge budget deficits caused by lower oil prices. Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, raised $17.5 billion in October in the biggest sale of debt securities from an emerging market, Qatar issued $9 billion in May, and Abu Dhabi another $5 billion in April. Saudi Arabia will probably issue $10 billion to $15 billion of bonds in international markets this year, Economy Minister Mohammad Tuwaijri said in December. Kuwait is talking to banks to raise the equivalent of 3 billion dinars ($9.8 billion) of securities this year, while Oman has asked banks to submit proposals to arrange an international bond sale, people familiar with the planned issue said earlier this month. More Deals Some banks disagrees with JPMorgan’s forecast that issuance may decline. Andy Cairns, the head of debt origination and distribution at National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC, said last month that overall bond issuance from the GCC may top last year’s levels, driven again by government sales. The governments of Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah and Kuwait, which didn’t issue last year will do so this year, and sales from corporates and financial institutions will also be higher than last year, he said. While HSBC was displaced by JPMorgan at the top of the Gulf bond-league table, a list that ranks banks according to the amount of money they helped clients raise, it still managed to arrange more transactions, clinching 47 versus JPMorgan’s 34, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. "We’re not league-table driven," JPMorgan’s Deaibes said. The lender focuses on some key, core customers in the Gulf and "we had a year where we saw significant issuance by these clients, which worked well for us."

Qatar is forecast to post a fiscal gap of 28.2 billion riyals ($7.7 billion) and Oman, 3 billion rials ($7.8 billion). While Brent crude has doubled over the past year to more than $50 a barrel after plunging to a 12-year low last January, prices are still almost half of what they were in June 2014. JPMorgan benefited last year from a greater preference of regional issuers to tap the so-called 144A market of U.S. institutional investors in its home market. It helped arrange issues from the governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain and Oman last year, all of which had significant participation from U.S. investors. "The improvement in oil prices will give us a more stable backdrop from which to access the market and sell" the Gulf story, Deaibes said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 12 January 2017 Value of stock options boosted by Trump rally US stock market energised since tycoon’s Nov 8 victory BOSTON: Donald Trump once described Jamie Dimon as “the worst banker in the United States,” but the president-elect has helped make the boss of JPMorgan Chase & Co US$50mil richer. Dimon is the top beneficiary among the 30 chief executives who run companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index from a stock rally inspired by Trump’s election, according to a Reuters analysis of their option grants. Trump’s proposed policies for lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energised the US stock market since the real estate magnate’s Nov 8 victory. The post-election rally even resurrected the value of an option award held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein that was worthless on the eve of the election. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has seen his stock options surge in value by more than US$50mil to US$146mil since the Republican candidate’s White House win. Trump criticised Dimon in 2013 for reaching a US$13bil settlement with the US government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. Nevertheless, he appointed Dimon to the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of high-profile business leaders he set up last month to advise him on economic growth and job creation. Dimon declined to comment on Trump’s criticism or the rise in value of his holdings. Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23% to about US$1bil in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trump’s election win. The figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015. Options that expired or vested in 2016 were excluded from the analysis. In a few cases, CEOs exercised some of those options during 2016, US regulatory filings show. Visa Inc CEO Charles Scharf did not need a Trump-led stock rally to hit the jackpot. About two weeks before the election, he exercised nearly 800,000 options for gross proceeds of almost US$33mil, US regulatory filings show. He resigned from Visa effective Dec 1. Trump campaigned on the slogan “Make America Great Again,” vowing to bolster the prospects of the American working class by preventing jobs from moving abroad, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade pacts. In 2015, Trump called high salaries paid to CEOs a “joke” and a “disgrace” and said these were often approved by company boards stacked with CEOs’ friends. To be sure, Trump’s election has helped investors big and small. Hopes of a pro-business agenda have driven the Dow 30 close to 20,000 - a level it has never breached - in a boon for workers’ retirement plans. “With the recent Trump/Republican win, it appears that investors are getting more excited about potential growth and animal spirits are on the rise,” top investment strategists at Morgan Stanley said this month in a wealth management report. “This is likely to lead to the final euphoric stage of this cyclical bull market which could be quite powerful in 2017’s first half.” Big stock option gains for Goldman Sachs head Blankfein, American Express Co CEO Kenneth Chenault and JP Morgan’s Dimon may be a surprise, given that their companies have reduced or even eliminated option grants in recent years in favor of stock awards tied to hitting financial targets. Blankfein’s 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a US$204.16 strike price, were under water by US$7.3mil on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to US$11.4mil. That was an US$18.7mil swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the US Federal Reserve’s decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Blankfein declined to comment. Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York, said the big gains for the leaders of American Express, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reflect how stock option compensation can magnify gains in a company’s share price. “When the stock goes up, with options, you get more leverage,” he said. Critics of stock options say the grants can produce large amounts of wealth for CEOs even with mediocre performance. One reason is that grants often are not linked to any financial performance metric, such as return on equity. And so as the United States nears the eighth year of a bull market, options can increase in value even if the CEOs are running companies whose share price has lagged broad benchmarks during their tenure. For example, shares of Caterpillar Inc rose 54% during Douglas Oberhelman’s tenure as CEO of the big equipment maker from mid-2010 to the end of 2016, while the Dow 30 more than doubled during that span. But the value of Oberhelman’s options rallied during his last year as CEO, climbing to US$20.3mil after being under water by nearly US$9mil at the start of 2016. The options’ value got a US$10.6mil booster shot after Trump’s victory. Caterpillar shares rose 36% in 2016, making it one of the best performing stocks on the Dow. Trump has said he would use Caterpillar tractors to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Caterpillar and Oberhelman declined to comment. Not all CEOs have been winners, however. Coca-Cola Co CEO Muhtar Kent, who contributed US$2,700 to Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival for president, saw the value of his options decline by US$11.3 mil to US$143 mil. Coca-Cola shares are off 3% since Trump was elected amid lingering concerns about consumers cutting their consumption of sugary drinks. A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.— Reuters Tags / Keywords: Trump , stock option Related Stories Beijing warns Trump on ‘One China’ policy Nothing will end Trump’s conflicts of interest Trump turns down US$2bil deal Trump’s Indonesia man to boost ties with theme park Ma meets Trump, promises to bring one million jobs to US You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Lucky start to the new year CIA director warns Trump to watch what he says, be careful on Russia Do we really need to fear China money?

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 12 January 2017 US charges three traders in forex rigging probe NEW YORK: The US Justice Department brought charges against three former traders at JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Barclays Plc arising from a global probe into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates at major banks. Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Christopher Ashton, formerly of Barclays, were charged with conspiring to restrain trade in an indictment filed at a federal court in Manhattan. The case came after JPMorgan, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Citigroup unit pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currency rates, agreeing at that time to pay more than US$2.5bil in criminal fines. Those plea deals contributed to the more than US$10bil that some of the world’s biggest banks have agreed to pay to resolve US and European probes into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates. The indictment said that from 2007 to 2013, Usher, Ramchandani and Ashton schemed with other euro-dollar traders belonging to an electronic chat group called “The Cartel” to suppress competition in the currency spot market. Usher, JPMorgan’s former head of G10 spot trading, and Ramchandani, Citigroup’s ex-head of European spot foreign exchange trading, left both banks in 2014. Ashton, Barclays’ ex-global head of spot trading, was at the British bank until 2015. All three traders were based in the United Kingdom, according to court papers and their lawyers. All three remain out of custody, the Justice Department said. In addition to the criminal case, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined Usher and Ramchandani US$5mil each, and the banking regulator banned them from working in the US banking industry. The US charges came after the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in March said it had closed its own investigation without any individuals being charged, saying there was “insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.” Lawyers for Ramchandani and Usher in statements criticised the Justice Department’s decision to bring charges after the SFO had decided not to do so. Stephen Pollard, a lawyer for Ramchandani, said his client had been investigated for over 18 months in the UK and was not prosecuted. “It is unacceptable for the American DoJ to by-pass the SFO decision and seek to prosecute conduct undertaken on British soil by British citizens where the British regulators have confirmed there was no criminal offence,” Pollard said in a statement. A lawyer for Ashton declined to comment. – Reuters Tags / Keywords: Forex , currency , rates Related Stories Banks told to cover tracks of China's forex regulator Adviser: Fall in China’s foreign reserves ‘good news’ Will China's forex reserves fall below US$3 trillion?

(NASDAQ: AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced a new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card that awards Prime members a 5% point payback on all purchases at Amazon.com along with point rewards at other merchants. Amazon automatically will upgrade existing Prime members who have an Amazon Rewards Visa to the new card. The Amazon Rewards card pays a 3% point reward for purchases made at Amazon.com and does not require Prime membership. Both cards offer 2% in points rewards at restaurants, gas stations and drugstores, and 1% on all other card purchases. At a 5% reward rate ($5 per $100 in purchases), a Prime membership would be free if a consumer spent $2,000 a year at Amazon. In 2015 the average U.S. household spent about $2,000 on gasoline, so the 2% rewards deal is worth $400 and the 1% reward on all other spending would further reduce the out-of-pocket amount a customer would have to pay to recoup the Prime membership fee. Points may be redeemed at any time, and every 100 points cuts your purchase price by $1.00. The Amazon Prime rewards card carries an interest rate of 14.74% to 22.74%, depending on a customer’s creditworthiness. There is no annual fee for the card, and late payment fees range from $15 to a maximum of $37. There is no foreign transaction fee. Note that this is not a cashback card; it is a rewards point card and the points may only be used at Amazon.com. Another major retail that put a massive credit card rewards scheme into play recently is Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST). The company ended its long-standing exclusive deal with American Express and did an exclusive deal with Citi and Visa. The Costco Anywhere Visa card offers Costco members 4% cash back on gasoline purchases at any service station nationwide, 3% cash back on restaurants and eligible travel purchases, 2% cash back on all purchases at Costco stores and the Costco website, and 1% cashback on all other purchases. Costco does not charge an annual fee for the card and offers a 0% introductory rate for seven months, according to NerdWallet. The APR on the card varies and begins at 15.74%. The penalty rate can rise as high as 29.99%. Costco also charges a 3% foreign transaction fee. Costco pays earned rewards once a year on a customer’s February statement, and customers can only redeem their annual rewards payments in person at Costco stores. Prime members who shop a lot at Amazon’s website are the company’s target with this card. Because points can only be spent at Amazon, the company’s top line benefits from the points customers build up at gas stations and every other retail store or website where they shop before spending at Amazon. Sure it’s a discount to Amazon’s selling price, but selling for a tiny margin has never bothered Amazon before and almost surely doesn’t this time.

BankThink Flashback: When banks tried to end screen scraping … in 2004 BankThink Financial data gathering needs a common standard BankThink OCC's new charter — only serious fintechs need apply Reimagine the joint bank account search goes here Do banks belong on Snapchat? By Mary Wisniewski Published January 11 2017, 4:56pm EST More in Social media Mobile technology Millennials Digital banking Print Email Reprints Share Share on Snapchat, once dismissed as just a sexting app, has become banks' latest playground for connecting with millennials over playful filters, emojis and videos. In July, Bank of America paid for a sponsored lens that turned willing users into llamas to promote its mobile app. To woo young talent, JPMorgan Chase has advertised on the app. Citigroup is using the company's trendy sunglasses to make short videos that illustrate the bank's culture. Community banks are fiddling with the filters, too. CenterState Banks in Davenport, Fla., has been testing how different content ideas could potentially resonate with the app's users. CenterState's conclusion so far on banks having Snapchat accounts, however, is grim: it is likely a waste of time, said Chris Nichols, the chief strategy officer for the bank. CenterState is still exploring if it can create useful content on the app, but Nichols said he is skeptical. "It is a great medium, but it is just not conducive for most banks," he said. "If you had a bank that specialized in banking professional athletes or celebrities, or if a bank had a CEO with a really big personality, it might be a different story." "We explore any new social media that we believe is getting major traction," says Chris Nichols, the chief strategy officer of CenterState Banks. A feature that superimposes dog ears and a muzzle on users is among the most popular things on Snapchat. That's a path some are exploring. For instance, the Bank of Ireland is hiring celebrity Snapchat personalities to share money savings tips with students. Still, Nichols said the effort has not been in vain — banks have to be constantly thinking of new ways of connecting with people. "My job is to look at different tech and channels and see what works," he said. "For instance, Pokémon Go. We were one of the first banks to use it for marketing. Snapchat is no different." With more than 150 million people — particularly 18 to 24-year olds — using it every day to send or watch messages, it is important for banks to understand the platform as they seek to reach potential customers, too. "You can't ignore it," said Terry Golesworthy, president of The Customer Respect Group, a research and consultancy firm. "It's the channel to the audience you are struggling to reach. Also, there are lessons in communication that bankers can learn from Snapchat, similar to learning to get a point across in 140 characters for Twitter. The trend toward short videos and transparent social messages on Snapchat — or whatever popular app comes next — is only getting stronger, said Stessa Cohen, a research director at Gartner. "Banks need to understand how these things work," said Cohen. It is also a great playground because the stakes are low. The content is temporary and, unlike so many other social media platforms, the number of followers a user has is not published. "You are not going to be embarrassed if you don't get traction," Nichols said. Snapchat, like any newer platform, requires some fresh thinking of bankers. Snapchat messages are intended to disappear. That raises compliance questions for banks that have to record communications. Also, visuals take center stage on the app — for an industry that sells intangible products and services, and historically, has relied on corporate-looking stock imagery, that's not a strong suit. "There are only so many pictures of money you can show," Nichols said. Using the app as a recruitment tool is an easy initial use case for a bank, Golesworthy said. Banks can use Snapchat as a modern — and visual — "About Us" section to woo young talent "Recruitment is the easy place to play now," he said. Already Citi, has been using Spectacles — sunglasses sold by Snap to record things — to offer a glimpse of what life is like at the bank. Citi equipped a handful of employees with the sunglasses to record short videos of their days. The big idea, of course, is to show off the culture in a different manner than reading about it or hearing about it from someone else. After all, banks are struggling to recruit younger talent. "It allows for the end-person to watch a quick, bird's eye view of what's going on at the firm," said Courtney Storz, head of global campus recruitment and program management at Citi. Citi does not have a Snapchat account, but the institution shares the videos on other social platforms like Twitter and Facebook. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, have advertised on Snapchat for a similar end goal: to woo recent college graduates. Early Lessons — the Dutch Bank Example As banks in the U.S. explore using products from Snapchat, ABN Amro in the Netherlands is getting feedback in using the app as a customer support tool. In 12 months on Snapchat, the bank said it has gained about 2,000 followers, and typically receives one question per day. If the Dutch bank posts a story, it may get a handful of questions in response, said spokeswoman Brigitte Seegers. Most questions are about interest rates, online banking and opening hours. Among the learnings so far? Adjust the brand to Snapchat. "Don't be too serious (unless people ask serious questions), use photos, videos, emojis and filters instead of screen shots, seek for interaction and ask questions," Seegers said in an email. That echoes CenterState's experience. Nichols said his team has posted behind-the-scenes footage at the bank, including playing pranks on one another and that has garnered some interest. But until the bank cracks the nut of producing compelling content on a regular basis, Nichols said the bank won't formally launch a Snapchat account. Either way, it isn't costing the bank anything additional to explore the platform. "While we have an R&D budget, we spent nothing on exploring Snapchat," Nichols said. "The bank does have money for social media that is measured in thousands — fairly immaterial given the bang for our buck. We explore any new social media that we believe is getting major traction."

Morgan Securities LLC To Pay $900,000 For Supervision Failures - Firm’s Supervisory Failures Over Exchange And Clearing Fee Processing Led To Customer Overcharges At Times Press Events News RSS Videos Newsletters About Mondo Visione Vendors Polls Glossary Acronyms FT Trading Room Elsevier and Mondo Visione Media Contacts NYSE Exchanges Blog White Papers Newsletter Subscription Form Newsletter Enter your email address to receive regular updates CFTC Orders J.P. Morgan Securities LLC To Pay $900,000 For Supervision Failures - Firm’s Supervisory Failures Over Exchange And Clearing Fee Processing Led To Customer Overcharges At Times Date 11/01/2017 The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling charges against J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS), a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York City, for failing to diligently supervise its officers’, employees’, and agents’ processing of exchange and clearing fees it charged customers for trading and clearing Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (CME) products and products from certain other exchanges during 2010 to 2014. JPMS is registered with the CFTC as a Futures Commission Merchant and a swap dealer. The CFTC Order requires JPMS to pay a $900,000 civil monetary penalty and cease and desist from violating the CFTC regulation governing diligent supervision. The CFTC Order explains that customer transactions executed on exchanges are subject to payment of exchange and clearing fees that are applied to each transaction in the normal course of business. Clearing firms such as JPMS receive invoices for these fees from the exchange clearinghouses, which the firms pass on to their customers, the CFTC Order states. Here, the CFTC Order finds that JPMS failed to implement and maintain adequate systems for reconciling invoices from exchange clearinghouses with the amounts of fees actually charged to its customers. JPMS’ fee reconciliation process was largely manual and carried out by only one employee at the end of the month using three different JPMS systems. In addition to insufficient staff to complete the fee reconciliation process accurately, JPMS did not have adequate written policies and procedures in place regarding its clearing and exchange fee reconciliations. According to the CFTC Order, this led to instances in which JPMS overcharged some customers in an aggregate amount of approximately $7.8 million. The CFTC Order finds that JPMS discovered the problem in 2014, self-reported it to the CFTC, and thereafter took remedial steps, including refunding adversely affected customers. The Order recognizes JPMS’ significant cooperation with the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement during the investigation of this matter. Third Such Action Brought by the CFTC This is the third action that the CFTC has brought over a clearing firm’s supervisory failures over fee processing: • In August 2016, the CFTC ordered Barclays Capital, Inc. to pay an $800,000 penalty relating to its processing of futures exchange and clearing fees charged to customers (see CFTC Order and Press Release 7419-16, August 4, 2016); and, • In August 2014, the CFTC ordered Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to pay a $1.2 million penalty relating to is processing of futures exchange and clearing fees charged to customers (see CFTC Order and Press Release 6984-14, August 26, 2014). The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Susan Gradman, Joseph Patrick, Elizabeth Pendleton, Brigitte Weyls, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

Morgan Securities to pay $900,000 for supervision failures: CFTC WASHINGTON The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Wednesday it ordered J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to pay $900,000 to settle charges it had failed to properly supervise employees over fees charged to customers trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The CFTC said in a statement the company, a unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), had failed to implement and maintain adequate systems for reconciling invoices from exchange clearinghouses with the amounts of fees actually charged to its customers from 2010 to 2014. J.P. Morgan Securities overcharged customers by about $7.8 million, the statement said. The company discovered the problem in 2014 and reported it to the CFTC, the commission said. "We have refunded nearly all affected customers and implemented new systems and pricing arrangements to improve the accuracy of the firm’s exchange fee procedures and process," JPMorgan Chase spokesman Brian Marchiony said in a statement.

Perron and the United States Bankruptcy Trustee for the Southern District of Indiana on behalf of Christine M. Jackson v. J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A. 15-2206 U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Indianapolis Division. Judge Tanya Walton Pratt. Civil. Affirms summary judgment for Chase Bank in ex-couple Perron and Jackson’s lawsuit claiming the bank’s response to a misapplied insurance payment, seeking more than $300,000 in damages, caused their divorce. To the extent that any requested information was missing, Perron and Jackson suffered no actual damages and thus have no viable claim, nor did the bank breach the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Indiana Court of Appeals Dominique Castillo v. State of Indiana 31A01-1604-CR-742 Criminal. Affirms the revocation of Dominique Castillo’s probation and order that he serve the whole of his suspended sentence, which was four years in the Indiana Department of Correction with 2 ½ years suspended. Finds given Castillo’s blatant disregard for the terms of his probation, the Harrison Superior Court was well within its discretion to sanction him by ordering him to serve his previously suspended sentence. Also finds the trial court did not consider inappropriate testimony and, thus, did not abuse its discretion. Fernando J. Alvarez, Jr. v. State of Indiana (mem. dec.) 02A04-1608-CR-1766 Criminal. Affirms Fernando Alvarez Jr.’s sentence to 2 ½ years for invasion of privacy as a Level 6 felony. Finds Alvarez has not met his burden of establishing that his sentence is inappropriate in light of the nature of the offenses and his character. Alisha M. King v. State of Indiana (mem. dec.) 02A03-1606-CR-1387 Criminal. Affirms Alisha King’s aggregate four-year sentence for Level 6 felony possession of a synthetic drug or lookalike substance and Level 6 felony possession of paraphernalia. Finds King’s sentence is not inappropriate and that she has waived her argument with respect to the probation revocation sentence under cause number F6-79. Billy T. Reames v. State of Indiana (mem. dec.) 20A03-1606-CR-1332 Criminal. Affirms Billy Reames’ conviction for Level 3 felony robbery while armed with a deadly weapon, the finding that he is an habitual offender and his sentence to 12 years, with one year suspended, and enhanced by 10 years for the habitual-offender finding. Finds there is sufficient evidence to sustain Reames’ conviction and that his sentence is not inappropriate. Zachary Poteet v. State of Indiana (mem. dec.) 49A02-1606-CR-1196 Criminal. Affirms Zachary Poteet’s conviction of public intoxication as a Class B misdemeanor. Finds there is sufficient evidence from which the Marion Superior Court could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Poteet harassed, annoyed or alarmed the officers. John Webb v. State of Indiana (mem. dec.) 49A02-1603-CR-632 Criminal. Affirms John Webb’s conviction of murder and sentence to 62 years.

Those running court systems, have most substance abuse issues. Probably self medicating to cover conscience issues arising out of acts furthering govt corruption I whole-heartedly agree with Doug Church's comment, above. Indiana lawyers were especially fortunate to benefit from Tom Pyrz' leadership and foresight at a time when there has been unprecedented change in the legal profession. Consider how dramatically computer technology and its role in the practice of law have changed over the last 25 years. The impact of the great recession of 2008 dramatically changed the composition and structure of law firms across the country. Economic pressures altered what had long been a routine, robust annual recruitment process for law students and recent law school graduates. That has, in turn, impacted law school enrollment across the country, placing upward pressure on law school tuition. The internet continues to drive significant changes in the provision of legal services in both public and private sectors. The ISBA has worked to make quality legal representation accessible and affordable for all who need it and to raise general public understanding of Indiana laws and procedures. How difficult it would have been to tackle each of these issues without Tom's leadership. Tom has set the tone for positive change at the ISBA to meet the evolving practice needs of lawyers of all backgrounds and ages. He has led the organization with vision, patience, flexibility, commitment, thoughtfulness & even humor. He will, indeed, be a tough act to follow. Thank you, Tom, for all you've done and all the energy you've invested in making the ISBA an excellent, progressive, highly responsive, all-inclusive, respectful & respected professional association during his tenure there. The is putting restrictions on vaping just because big tobacco companies are losing money. http://vapingisthefuture.com Oh, and I should add ... the stigma JLAP attaches lasts forever. As my documents show, I had good reason to reject the many conflicted diagnoses for not thinking like the state wanted me to. BUT when I resisted and raised constitutional and even ADA "regarded as" arguments I was then denied licensed in Indiana for LIFE. As in until death does us part.

JPMorgan said it will appeal the finding, which awarded Johnny Burris $64,400 in back wages and $100,000 for reputational damage, pain and suffering. The finding by an investigator for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was released on Tuesday. OSHA, which is part of the Labor Department, said there was “reasonable cause” to conclude that JPMorgan’s decision to terminate Burris resulted in part from employee behavior protected under the anti-retaliation provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. An appeal would be considered by an administrative law judge. “Mr. Burris previously raised these same claims to a Finra panel, with the same basic evidence, and the claims were denied,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said in an emailed statement. She was referring to a 2014 ruling by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s industry-funded brokerage regulator, that he wasn’t wrongfully dismissed. “We look forward to presenting our case in the next step of this process and putting this to rest.” Burris disputes the validity of the Finra ruling. The arbitrators made their decision based on a client complaint that OSHA later found to have been written by a JPMorgan manager, Burris said. Under the OSHA finding, JPMorgan would have to clear that complaint and expunge his industry employment record, known as a U5. It would also have to pay him reasonable attorneys’ fees. Burris expressed dissatisfaction with the OSHA decision. “They ruled in my favor but tried to limit the damages to the bank,” he said. OSHA’s San Francisco office, which handled the case, didn’t respond to a request seeking comment on the finding. Burris isn’t the only former JPMorgan adviser to complain of retaliation. A trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 23 in Manhattan federal court to reconsider the case of Jennifer Sharkey, a former JPMorgan wealth manager who alleges that the bank fired her in violation of Sarbanes-Oxley whistle-blower protections after she recommended that it investigate whether a wealthy client was involved in illegal activity. Last September, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed an earlier dismissal of the case and sent it back to the lower court. Last June, a Finra arbitration panel found that JPMorgan had defamed three former New Jersey wealth managers by falsely amending their employment records. The bank was ordered by the arbitrators to expunge the advisers’ records. Burris began working as a Chase Private Client adviser in Sun City West, Arizona, in June 2010. Shortly afterward, he started voicing complaints internally about being pressured by managers to sell more of the bank’s products to his elderly clientele, even if there were better investment options for them. Burris also provided information about his concerns to the New York Times, which featured him in a July 2012 article. In the ensuing months, Burris’ managers frequently discussed how he was selling a low percentage of JPMorgan-managed products, according to OSHA’s written finding. Burris was fired by the bank in November 2012. A JPMorgan manager went outside firm procedure, turned an oral customer complaint into a written one and required Burris to list it on his employment record, “likely blacklisting him and causing him reputational harm,” according to the OSHA finding.

Speaking as a guest on CNBC, the analyst doesn't believe bank stocks have moved ahead of themselves in the recent stock market surge. Mayo justified his bullish stance by highlighting President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies, which will support jobs and GDP growth. He added that a vital component of accelerating jobs and GDP growth is counting banks as a key partner. Mayo said Trump's administration is expected to help banks in the regulatory environment, not necessarily be removing regulations by stop piling on new ones. "The most important point - even if you don't get a 'Trump-bump' to the banks, and we think a 'Trump-bump' can add 20 percent to bank earnings, even without that we still think that banks create value for the first time in a decade," Mayo said. "Banks in the U.S. earn their cost of capital and that is what the market is collectively missing." Here are Mayo's stock ratings and price targets: Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) - Outperform rating, $27 price target. Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC) - Outperform rating, $64 price target. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) - Outperform rating, $275 price target. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) - Buy rating, $54 price target. Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) - Buy rating, $80 price target.

(March 11, 2015) PROVIDENCE – Over the next three years, Rhode Island will receive $2 million to improve career readiness and postsecondary attainment for all Rhode Island youth through a program called “PrepareRI.” The Ocean State is one of 10 states nationally, including Massachusetts, to receive a Phase Two New Skills for Youth grant, part of the $75 million New Skills for Youth initiative developed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. in collaboration with the nonprofit Council of Chief State School Officers and Advance CTE, a Silver Spring, Md.-based nonprofit representing state leaders responsible for secondary, postsecondary and adult career technical education. Rhode Island received $100,000 through the program’s first phase last March for planning and implementation. “Rhode Island’s New Skills for Youth grant is intended to turn our bold vision for improving career readiness in K-12 education into a reality,” Gov. Gina M. Raimondo said in a statement Wednesday. “We are honored to have been recognized for our vision to prepare Rhode Island students for good-paying jobs in our state’s leading industries. By creating pathways between our existing K-12, higher education and workforce development systems, we will meet the needs of our existing employers while also providing jobs that pay for Rhode Islanders.” <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> According to information from the R.I. Department of Education, currently, less than 45 percent of Rhode Islanders have a post-secondary degree or industry-recognized certificate, and 70 percent of jobs in the coming years will require them. The grant’s purpose is to bridge the skills gap so all Rhode Island young people have the opportunity to attain life-sustaining jobs, the agency said. The grant was awarded after an examination of the state’s plan to transform how it designs and develops career preparedness education programs. PrepareRI, a three-year action plan, expands the Prepare RI Dual Enrollment Fund that allows high school students to receive both high school and college credits at no cost to them or their families. The goal of the program is that by 2020, all Rhode Island youth will have access to work-based learning and advanced coursework opportunities in every Rhode Island high school. To that end, the state will partner with the employer community to create job shadowing opportunities, internships and apprenticeships. PrepareRI is committed to four specific goals: K-12, higher education and business alignment Demand-driven programs and investments targeted towards Rhode Island’s growing industry clusters Student-centered and personalized learning opportunities that help young people develop interests and talents, consider options for the future, and allow for evolving interests A commitment to performance management, accountability and continuous improvement to achieve these goals “Preparing our youth for high-quality and in-demand careers is critical to the future strength of our communities,” said Rick MacDonald, head of Commercial Banking in New England for JPMorgan Chase.

Morgan earnings: Expect a strong trading quarter and improved credit markets By Ciara Linnane Published: Jan 13, 2017 7:26 a.m. ET Share Bank has enjoyed a stock rally on expectations the president-elect will scale back post-crisis regulations Getty Images for Fortune J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon By CiaraLinnane Corporate news editor J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings before the bell on Friday, and investors are expecting another strong quarter for trading. See also: Bank ETFs still favored as investors see growth and Trump bump ahead Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in December he expects trading revenue to rise about 15% from the year-earlier period, as activity in fixed-income trading picked up after the November presidential election, while equity indexes surged to record levels, The Wall Street Journal reported. The surprise victory of Donald Trump is expected to lead to a major rollback of regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, creating growth opportunities for banks. Dimon said his bank JPM, +0.53%  has benefited in fixed-income trading from the exit from that business by many European banks that are dealing with their own issues. Fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading rebounded in 2016 after a long period of weakness that led many banks to cut staff on trading desks. Jamie Dimon on 'The Door to Diversity'(2:59) JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon says that embracing diversity means running a company "where people are respected and trusted and treated equally and everyone can speak up in the room." If you don’t have that, he says, the women won’t have a chance. Meanwhile, the prospect of higher interest rates is expected to boost margins on lending. “Corporate tax reform is another potentially positive for the space as is the expectation of an elevated growth trajectory for the U.S. economy,” said Zacks Research Director, Sheraz Mian. “All in all, the industry’s operating and regulatory outlook has never been this favorable in a long time. “This has started showing up in bank stock EPS estimates as well, though the impact is most pronounced in expectations for the outer periods.” See also: End of a stock-market era: Alcoa breaks tradition of being first to report earnings Here’s what to expect from J.P. Morgan’s quarter: Earnings: Analysts polled by FactSet are expecting the bank to post per-share earnings of $1.42, up from $1.32 in the same period a year ago. Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from buy-side and sell-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, academics and others, is expecting a higher number of $1.47 a share. Revenue: Revenue is expected to total $23.912 billion, up from $23.747 billion a year ago. Estimize is expecting revenue of $23.641 billion. Stock price action: Like many of its peers, J.P. Morgan stock has rallied since the presidential election, tacking on about 23% amid expectations for deregulation. The KBW Nasdaq Bank exchange-traded fund BKX, +0.87%  has gained about 23% since the election, while the S&P SPX, +0.18%  has added 6.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.03%  has gained 8.5% in the same period. Read: Why Goldman sees only 90 good days for U.S. stocks in 2017 J.P. Morgan stock has gained 46% in the last 12 months, after setting a fresh record of $87.23 on Jan. 3, the first trading day of the new year. FactSet analysts have an average rating of overweight on the stock with an average stock price target of $88.52. Other issues: TD Securities analysts are expecting overall U.S. bank earnings to reflect improving credit trends, meaning lower net charge-offs, nonperforming loans and delinquency trends. At the same time, they expect banks to report a stabilization in the credit quality of their oil and gas exposures, following the recent recovery in oil prices. “JPM specifically commented that the capital markets are open to oil-and-gas companies, and that they do not expect further significant energy-related builds in Q4/16 provided the market environment does not deteriorate from its current state,” TD analysts wrote in a note. UBS said it expects J.P. Morgan’s corporate and investment banking business to benefit from what is a potentially more benign regulatory environment that could spur capital markets velocity and increase risk appetite. Analysts initiated coverage on the stock Wednesday with a buy rating and raised their stock price target to $98 from $91. UBS is expecting J.P. Morgan’s return on tangible common equity to move closer to a midteen range by 2019 from about 12% currently. “Continued good operating momentum, higher interest rates, moderately improved efficiency, a lesser drag from the cards business, and elevated capital returns (70-75% of earnings) should help,” they wrote.

Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Christopher Ashton, formerly of Barclays, were charged with conspiring to restrain trade in an indictment filed at a federal court in Manhattan. The three were members of the "Cartel" chatroom in which they are alleged to have shared sensitive client order information to manipulate exchange rates. Below is a timeline on the scandal that consumed the largely unregulated $5.3 trillion-a-day market. 2017 Jan. 10: U.S. Department of Justice indicts three London-based former traders and members of "The Cartel" chatroom, Rohan Ramchandani, Richard Usher and Chris Ashton. Jan. 4: Former Barclays trader Jason Katz becomes the first person to admit criminal wrongdoing in the FX probe, pleading guilty to U.S. charges to participating in a price-fixing conspiracy. 2016 March: Britain's SFO closes its FX investigation without having brought any charges, saying "the alleged conduct, even if proven and taken at its highest, would not meet the evidential test required to mount a prosecution for an offence contrary to English law." 2015 Nov.: Ex-Citi trader Perry Stimpson wins his unfair dismissal hearing at an employment tribunal in London. May: The U.S. DOJ fines six banks (Citi, JP Morgan, HSBC, RBS, Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch) a total of $6 billion. The first five pleaded guilty to felony charges, while BAML was fined for compliance failures. 2014 Dec.: Former RBS trader Paul Nash is the first individual to be arrested. Nov.: British and U.S. authorities fine six of the world's biggest banks - Citi, JP Morgan, HSBC, RBS, UBS and Bank of America Merrill Lynch - a total of $4.3 billion for failing to prevent their traders sharing clients' order information and attempting to manipulate the market. Nov.: The Bank of England fires chief dealer Martin Mallett, and announces it has scrapped the regular chief dealers meetings for good. July: Britain's Serious Fraud Office formally opens investigation into FX rigging. March: The Bank of England suspends Martin Mallett, and appoints Lord Anthony Grabiner to lead an independent investigation into what the Bank knew of alleged currency market collusion and manipulation. Feb.: The Financial Stability Board, the world's top financial regulator which coordinates policy for the G20, says it will review FX fixings. Feb.: New York's banking regulator opens its investigation. Jan.: Citi fires chief dealer Rohan Ramchandani, a member of the BoE-chaired chief dealers group and the first trader in the unfolding scandal to be sacked. 2013 Dec.: Several banks, including JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank ban traders from multi-dealer electronic chatrooms. Oct.: The investigation goes global. The DOJ, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England, and Switzerland's market regulator all open probes. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority says it is cooperating. Sept.: Swiss bank UBS provides the U.S. Department of Justice with information on FX allegations in the hope of gaining antitrust immunity if charged with wrongdoing. July: A scheduled chief dealers meeting for July 4 never takes place. June: Bloomberg News reports dealers used electronic chatrooms to share client order information to manipulate benchmark exchange rates at the 4:00 p.m. London "fixing". These chatrooms had names such as "The 3 Musketeers" and "The Cartel". Feb.: The chief dealers group meets for what will be the last time. 2012 April: As the Libor scandal reaches its zenith, the regular FX chief dealers meeting included a "brief discussion on extra levels of compliance that many bank trading desks were subject to when managing client risks around the main set piece benchmark fixings," BoE minutes say. 2008 July: A meeting of the BoE's FX Joint Standing Committee's chief dealers sub-group discusses the suggestion "that using a snapshot of the market may be problematic, as it could be subject to manipulation," BoE minutes say. May: Minutes of a meeting of the FX chief dealers say there was "considerable discussion" on the benchmark "fixings" again. Spring: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York makes enquiries into concerns surrounding benchmark Libor interest rates, sharing its analysis and suggestions for reforms with "the relevant authorities in the UK." 2006 July: Minutes of a chief dealers meeting say the group discussed "evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix. It was noted that 'fixing business' generally was becoming increasingly fraught due to this behaviour." 2005 July: The first meeting of the Bank of England's FX Joint Standing Committee's chief dealers sub-group. These get-togethers between top London-based FX traders and senior BoE officials will become known as the chief dealers meetings. They will be held regularly every year up to 2013, where the traders and Bank officials will discuss market trends and issues. Every meeting will be chaired by BoE chief dealer Martin Mallett.

That worked well until the company's income taxes had to be paid. "Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it's not really your money till you pay your taxes," says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. "At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped." Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous' cash reserves. "Cash is king" is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn't coming in, and owners can't get loans or investors, there's no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they'd have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It's especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers " particularly if the customer is a government. "They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy," Solomon says. Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50 percent drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. "The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks," JPMorgan Chase said. Continued below.

If business slows, he's willing to take on smaller projects " ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company's more typical jobs " to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company's busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20 percent of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company's cash position. "If everything went south, we'd probably have enough cash for two or three months," he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They've given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They've also gotten better terms from lenders. Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that's a sign of trouble to Basilo " they're not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. "That's how they think when they start their business. They're very unprepared," he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores' down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor's ability to negotiate better prices. While they do have savings, they don't want to tap them for cash flow. "We pretend that the savings doesn't exist," Dan Robinson says. _____ Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrongfully fired a financial adviser in retaliation for publicly complaining that managers pressured him to sell the bank’s own investment products, a federal investigator found. JPMorgan said it will appeal the finding awarding Johnny Burris $64,400 in back wages and $100,000 for reputational damage, pain and suffering. The finding by an investigator for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration was released Tuesday. OSHA, which is part of the Labor Department, determined that JPMorgan’s decision to terminate Burris resulted in part from employee behavior protected under the anti-retaliation provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. An appeal would be considered by an administrative law judge. “Mr. Burris previously raised these same claims to a FINRA panel, with the same basic evidence, and the claims were denied,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said in an e-mailed statement. “We look forward to presenting our case in the next step of this process and putting this to rest.” Under the OSHA finding, JPMorgan would have to clear an industry complaint it wrongfully listed against him and expunge his industry employment record, known as a U5. It would also have to pay him reasonable attorneys fees. Limited Damages Burris expressed dissatisfaction with the decision. “They ruled in my favor but tried to limit the damages to the bank," he said. The arbitration decision by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority was based on a complaint faulted by the OSHA investigator, Burris said. OSHA’s San Francisco office, which handled the case, didn’t respond to a request seeking comment on the finding. Burris began working as a Chase Private Client adviser in Sun City West, Arizona, in June 2010. Shortly afterward, he started voicing complaints internally about being pressured by managers to sell more of the bank’s products to his elderly clientele, even if there were better investment options for them. Burris also provided information about his concerns to the New York Times, which featured him in a July 2012 article.

Asian shares mixed after Trump offers scant policy details Associated Press | KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Asian shares were mixed Thursday following President-elect Donald Trump's press conference. Trump offered scant details on policies, disappointing investors hoping for a clearer sense of his plans for trade and economic stimulus. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.9 percent to 19,192.76. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.1 percent to 22,916.85, and the Shanghai Composite was also down 0.1 percent at 3,133.80. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,784.40 and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent at 2,080.39. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. WALL STREET: The Nasdaq hit a fifth record-high close in a row, gaining 11.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,563.65. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,954.28. The S&P 500 index added 6.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,275.32. TRUMP NEWS: Trump's first news conference in nearly six months was an anti-climax, with scant details on his plans for infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Trump attacked U.S. intelligence services and big pharmaceutical companies, instead of outlining his platform. His comment that the government should change bidding procedures for the pharmaceutical industry "because they're getting away with murder," drove health care stocks lower THE QUOTE: "It is what he didn't mention - fiscal stimulus — that worries market participants. The U.S. dollar rally was based on the assumption that Trump's administration will push through a massive infrastructure building and fiscal stimulus package, which will lead to higher inflation in the future," said Margaret Yang Yan, market analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. "The slump in the U.S. dollar index last night indicated that assumption is now unwinding because the president-elect never even mentioned that key word 'stimulus'." ENERGY: Benchmark crude oil dipped 8 cents to $52.17 a barrel. It rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to close at $52.25 a barrel in New York on Wednesday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, fell 2 cents to $55.08. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 114.74 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0603 from $1.0576. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

That worked well until the company's income taxes had to be paid. "Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it's not really your money till you pay your taxes," says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. "At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped." Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous' cash reserves.

Hong) "Cash is king" is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn't coming in, and owners can't get loans or investors, there's no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they'd have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It's especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. "They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy," Solomon says. Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50 percent drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. "The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks," JPMorgan Chase said. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he's willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company's more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company's busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20 percent of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company's cash position. "If everything went south, we'd probably have enough cash for two or three months," he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They've given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They've also gotten better terms from lenders. Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that's a sign of trouble to Basilo — they're not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. "That's how they think when they start their business. They're very unprepared," he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores' down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor's ability to negotiate better prices. While they do have savings, they don't want to tap them for cash flow. "We pretend that the savings doesn't exist," Dan Robinson says. _____ Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

JPMorgan said it will appeal the finding awarding Johnny Burris $64 400 in back wages and $100 000 for reputational damage, pain and suffering. The finding by an investigator for the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration was released Tuesday. OSHA, which is part of the Labour Department, determined that JPMorgan’s decision to terminate Burris resulted in part from employee behaviour protected under the anti-retaliation provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. An appeal would be considered by an administrative law judge. “Burris previously raised these same claims to a FINRA panel, with the same basic evidence, and the claims were denied,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said in an e-mailed statement. “We look forward to presenting our case in the next step of this process and putting this to rest.” Read also: Latter joins JP Morgan Under the OSHA finding, JPMorgan would have to clear an industry complaint it wrongfully listed against him and expunge his industry employment record, known as a U5. It would also have to pay him reasonable attorney’s fees. Limited damages Burris expressed dissatisfaction with the decision. “They ruled in my favour but tried to limit the damages to the bank," he said. The arbitration decision by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority was based on a complaint faulted by the OSHA investigator, Burris said. OSHA’s San Francisco office, which handled the case, didn’t respond to a request seeking comment on the finding. Burris began working as a Chase Private Client adviser in Sun City West, Arizona, in June 2010. Shortly afterward, he started voicing complaints internally about being pressured by managers to sell more of the bank’s products to his elderly clientele, even if there were better investment options for them. Burris also provided information about his concerns to the New York Times, which featured him in a July 2012 article. In the following months, Burris’s managers frequently discussed how he was selling a low percentage of JPMorgan-managed products, according to OSHA’s written finding. Burris was fired by the bank in November 2012. A JPMorgan manager went outside firm procedure, turned an oral customer complaint into a written one and required Burris to list it on his employment record, “likely blacklisting him and causing him reputational harm,” according to the OSHA finding.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Donald Trump once described Jamie Dimon as "the worst banker in the United States," but the president-elect has helped make the boss of JPMorgan Chase & Co $50 million richer. Dimon is the top beneficiary among the 30 chief executives who run companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index from a stock rally inspired by Trump's election, according to a Reuters analysis of their option grants. Trump's proposed policies for lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energized the U.S. stock market since the real estate magnate's Nov. 8 victory. The post-election rally even resurrected the value of an option award held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein that was worthless on the eve of the election. Trump criticized Dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. Nevertheless, he appointed Dimon to the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of high-profile business leaders he set up last month to advise him on economic growth and job creation. Dimon declined to comment on Trump's criticism or the rise in value of his holdings.   JACKPOT Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trump's election win. The figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015. Options that expired or vested in 2016 were excluded from the analysis. In a few cases, CEOs exercised some of those options during 2016, U.S. regulatory filings show. Visa Inc CEO Charles Scharf did not need a Trump-led stock rally to hit the jackpot. About two weeks before the election, he exercised nearly 800,000 options for gross proceeds of almost $33 million, U.S. regulatory filings show. He resigned from Visa effective Dec. 1. For a look at how the post-election rally has affected Dow 30 stock options, click here Trump campaigned on the slogan "Make America Great Again," vowing to bolster the prospects of the American working class by preventing jobs from moving abroad, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade pacts. In 2015, Trump called high salaries paid to CEOs a "joke" and a "disgrace" and said these were often approved by company boards stacked with CEOs' friends.   PRO-BUSINESS AGENDA To be sure, Trump's election has helped investors big and small. Hopes of a pro-business agenda have driven the Dow 30 close to 20,000 - a level it has never breached - in a boon for workers' retirement plans. "With the recent Trump/Republican win, it appears that investors are getting more excited about potential growth and animal spirits are on the rise," top investment strategists at Morgan Stanley said this month in a wealth management report. "This is likely to lead to the final euphoric stage of this cyclical bull market which could be quite powerful in 2017's first half." Big stock option gains for Goldman Sachs head Blankfein, American Express Co CEO Kenneth Chenault and JP Morgan's Dimon may be a surprise, given that their companies have reduced or even eliminated option grants in recent years in favor of stock awards tied to hitting financial targets. Blankfein's 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. That was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Blankfein declined to comment. Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York, said the big gains for the leaders of American Express, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reflect how stock option compensation can magnify gains in a company's share price. "When the stock goes up, with options, you get more leverage," he said.   MEDIOCRE PERFORMANCE Critics of stock options say the grants can produce large amounts of wealth for CEOs even with mediocre performance. One reason is that grants often are not linked to any financial performance metric, such as return on equity. And so as the United States nears the eighth year of a bull market, options can increase in value even if the CEOs are running companies whose share price has lagged broad benchmarks during their tenure. For example, shares of Caterpillar Inc rose 54 percent during Douglas Oberhelman's tenure as CEO of the big equipment maker from mid-2010 to the end of 2016, while the Dow 30 more than doubled during that span. But the value of Oberhelman's options rallied during his last year as CEO, climbing to $20.3 million after being under water by nearly $9 million at the start of 2016. The options' value got a $10.6 million booster shot after Trump's victory. Caterpillar shares rose 36 percent in 2016, making it one of the best performing stocks on the Dow. Trump has said he would use Caterpillar tractors to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Caterpillar and Oberhelman declined to comment. Not all CEOs have been winners, however. Coca-Cola Co CEO Muhtar Kent, who contributed $2,700 to Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival for president, saw the value of his options decline by $11.3 million to $143 million. Coca-Cola shares are off 3 percent since Trump was elected amid lingering concerns about consumers cutting their consumption of sugary drinks. A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.   © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close  More ways to share...

The post-election rally even resurrected the value of an option award held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein that was worthless on the eve of the election. Trump criticized Dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. Nevertheless, he appointed Dimon to the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of high-profile business leaders he set up last month to advise him on economic growth and job creation. Dimon declined to comment on Trump's criticism or the rise in value of his holdings. JACKPOT Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trump's election win. The figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015. Options that expired or vested in 2016 were excluded from the analysis. In a few cases, CEOs exercised some of those options during 2016, U.S. regulatory filings show. Visa Inc CEO Charles Scharf did not need a Trump-led stock rally to hit the jackpot. About two weeks before the election, he exercised nearly 800,000 options for gross proceeds of almost $33 million, U.S. regulatory filings show. He resigned from Visa effective Dec. 1. For a look at how the post-election rally has affected Dow 30 stock options, click here (http://tmsnrt.rs/2iCbvvT) Trump campaigned on the slogan "Make America Great Again," vowing to bolster the prospects of the American working class by preventing jobs from moving abroad, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade pacts. In 2015, Trump called high salaries paid to CEOs a "joke" and a "disgrace" and said these were often approved by company boards stacked with CEOs' friends. PRO-BUSINESS AGENDA To be sure, Trump's election has helped investors big and small. Hopes of a pro-business agenda have driven the Dow 30 close to 20,000 - a level it has never breached - in a boon for workers' retirement plans. "With the recent Trump/Republican win, it appears that investors are getting more excited about potential growth and animal spirits are on the rise," top investment strategists at Morgan Stanley said this month in a wealth management report. "This is likely to lead to the final euphoric stage of this cyclical bull market which could be quite powerful in 2017's first half." Big stock option gains for Goldman Sachs head Blankfein, American Express Co CEO Kenneth Chenault and JP Morgan's Dimon may be a surprise, given that their companies have reduced or even eliminated option grants in recent years in favor of stock awards tied to hitting financial targets. Blankfein's 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. That was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Blankfein declined to comment. Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York, said the big gains for the leaders of American Express, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reflect how stock option compensation can magnify gains in a company's share price. "When the stock goes up, with options, you get more leverage," he said. MEDIOCRE PERFORMANCE Critics of stock options say the grants can produce large amounts of wealth for CEOs even with mediocre performance. One reason is that grants often are not linked to any financial performance metric, such as return on equity. And so as the United States nears the eighth year of a bull market, options can increase in value even if the CEOs are running companies whose share price has lagged broad benchmarks during their tenure. For example, shares of Caterpillar Inc rose 54 percent during Douglas Oberhelman's tenure as CEO of the big equipment maker from mid-2010 to the end of 2016, while the Dow 30 more than doubled during that span. But the value of Oberhelman's options rallied during his last year as CEO, climbing to $20.3 million after being under water by nearly $9 million at the start of 2016. The options' value got a $10.6 million booster shot after Trump's victory. Caterpillar shares rose 36 percent in 2016, making it one of the best performing stocks on the Dow. Trump has said he would use Caterpillar tractors to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Caterpillar and Oberhelman declined to comment. Not all CEOs have been winners, however. Coca-Cola Co CEO Muhtar Kent, who contributed $2,700 to Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival for president, saw the value of his options decline by $11.3 million to $143 million. Coca-Cola shares are off 3 percent since Trump was elected amid lingering concerns about consumers cutting their consumption of sugary drinks. A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.

The grain-yielding grass is such a hearty plant that it is grown on more land than any other crop in the world. After four straight seasons of record harvests, bins are bulging from Kansas to Western Australia and prices are near the lowest in a decade. But there are signs the glut may not last much longer, or at least that supplies may tighten enough to halt the four-year slump in wheat futures. Farmers are planting less because many are losing money. At the same time, global consumption is at an all-time high. And the risk of crop-damaging weather lingers over key exporting countries this year. “It’s difficult to be overly bullish,” said Benjamin Bodart, a director at adviser CRM AgriCommodities in Newmarket, England. “The world is still awash with wheat. You cannot deny it. But when you dig a bit further, the downside now is fairly limited.” While many money managers remain bearish — they’ve bet on lower prices for 17 months straight — wheat is expected to gain in 2017 for the first time in five years, according to a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts. Rabobank says there is a “real possibility” of a supply shock in the U.S. and Europe if farmers shift to more profitable crops, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. predicts a stockpile drop this year of 8.4 percent. It’s not difficult to see why the market slumped for so long. Wheat used in everything from bread to cakes and noodles thrives in all sorts of climates, and every few months there are crops being harvested somewhere in the world. Global production will reach an all-time high of 751.3 million metric tons once the current Southern Hemisphere harvest is complete, leaving stockpiles at 252.1 million tons, the most ever, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Lower Prices Prices tumbled 13 percent last year to $4.08 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, touching a 10-year low of $3.8675 on Aug. 31 and extending the longest stretch of annual losses since 1999. The grain was one of the biggest commodity losers of 2016 and is down by more than half from its high in 2012. Milling wheat in France dropped 3.2 percent to 168 euros a ton, capping a four-year slide of 32 percent. Russia, the world’s top exporter, said on Dec. 28 that its 2016 wheat harvest jumped 19 percent, more than analysts forecast. Farmers in Argentina are harvesting what will probably be their biggest crop since 2012, according to CRM AgriCommodities. And because wheat is sold in dollars on global markets, the currency’s strength is boosting the incentive for growers outside the U.S. to ship more, even with lower prices. “For prices to move substantially higher from here, we need to see some signs of supply being restricted, either by a weather event or by the fact that production levels are curtailed,” said Fiona Boal, director of commodity research at London-based Fulcrum Asset Management LLP, which oversees about $5.2 billion. Already the prolonged slump in prices has discouraged farmers. The London-based International Grains Council in November predicted a decline in global planting. That includes fewer acres for top consumer China and declines for major exporters, including the U.S., Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan. Century Low In the U.S., the No. 2 exporter, growers probably seeded the fewest acres of winter wheat in at least 104 years, according to the average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg before a Jan. 12 USDA report. Winter wheat, the most-common variety grown in the country, is sown in the fall, goes dormant during the coldest months of the year, and is harvested in the spring. Some farmers in Kansas, the largest U.S. producer of winter wheat, could lose money on every bushel, according to data from Kansas State University in Manhattan. The crop cost about $5.04 a bushel to grow in the state’s south-central areas, including land and labor expenses. That’s below the average national cash price for hard red wheat of $3.38 as of Jan. 6. Wheat Surplus A big reason for the wheat glut in recent years was mostly beneficial weather, which allowed crops to flourish and yields to improve. That may not last, Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodities analyst at JPMorgan in London, said in a Nov. 23 report. In December, the condition of dormant U.S. wheat crops declined, including in Kansas, Oklahoma and Colorado, the USDA reported on Jan. 3. Parts of those states have received less than half of normal precipitation since early October, according to U.S. Drought Monitor. Through March 31, drought is likely to persist in western Kansas, eastern Colorado and most of Oklahoma, according a seasonal outlook from National Weather Service. In parts of Ukraine, the fifth-largest exporter, the layer of snow that protects plants from freeze damage may be insufficient to shield some crops during a cold snap, researcher UkrAgroConsult said Jan. 5. The country has since been hit by snow blizzards and storms with temperatures of minus 25 degrees Celsius (minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit) in western regions, broker Veles-Agro said on Jan. 9. Wheat Stockpiles With the USDA predicting global wheat consumption rising 3.5 percent to a record 734.3 million tons in the 2016-17 season, JPMorgan says inventories will drop in 2018 to 228 million tons from an estimated 249 million this year. Prices in 2017 will reach $4.50 a bushel and advance to $4.81 in 2018, according to the median estimates of analysts in the Bloomberg survey. They are up 4 percent so far this year in Chicago at $4.24 1/4 a bushel, off to the best start since 2010. Rabobank predicts futures will rally in each quarter this year, ending at at an average of $4.60 in the fourth quarter. “Right now, we’ve fully digested all these big supplies, meaning big Russian crop, European crop, Australia, Canada, U.S.,” which means the slump in prices is mostly over, said Matt Ammermann, a commodity risk manager at brokerage INTL FCStone in Plymouth, Minnesota. “We are not going substantially lower.” Source: Bloomberg 2017-01-11 hellenicshippingnews tweet Share Previous: Why is India’s steel consumption rising?

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 3:30 PM, January 11, 2017 Updated: 4:40 PM, January 11, 2017 BOSTON - Donald Trump once described Jamie Dimon as "the worst banker in the United States," but the president-elect has helped make the boss of JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> $50 million richer. Dimon is the top beneficiary among the 30 chief executives who run companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index from a stock rally inspired by Trump's election, according to a Reuters analysis of their option grants. Trump's proposed policies for lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energized the U.S. stock market since the real estate magnate's Nov. 8 victory. The post-election rally even resurrected the value of an option award held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> CEO Lloyd Blankfein that was worthless on the eve of the election. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has seen his stock options surge in value by more than $50 million to $146 million since the Republican candidate's White House win. Trump criticized Dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. Nevertheless, he appointed Dimon to the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of high-profile business leaders he set up last month to advise him on economic growth and job creation. Dimon declined to comment on Trump's criticism or the rise in value of his holdings. JACKPOT Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trump’s election win. The figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015. Options that expired or vested in 2016 were excluded from the analysis. In a few cases, CEOs exercised some of those options during 2016, U.S. regulatory filings show. Visa Inc <V.N> CEO Charles Scharf did not need a Trump-led stock rally to hit the jackpot. About two weeks before the election, he exercised nearly 800,000 options for gross proceeds of almost $33 million, U.S. regulatory filings show. He resigned from Visa effective Dec. 1. For a look at how the post-election rally has affected Dow 30 stock options, click here (http://tmsnrt.rs/2iCbvvT) Trump campaigned on the slogan "Make America Great Again," vowing to bolster the prospects of the American working class by preventing jobs from moving abroad, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade pacts. In 2015, Trump called high salaries paid to CEOs a "joke" and a "disgrace" and said these were often approved by company boards stacked with CEOs' friends. PRO-BUSINESS AGENDA To be sure, Trump's election has helped investors big and small. Hopes of a pro-business agenda have driven the Dow 30 close to 20,000 - a level it has never breached - in a boon for workers' retirement plans. "With the recent Trump/Republican win, it appears that investors are getting more excited about potential growth and animal spirits are on the rise," top investment strategists at Morgan Stanley said this month in a wealth management report. "This is likely to lead to the final euphoric stage of this cyclical bull market which could be quite powerful in 2017’s first half." Big stock option gains for Goldman Sachs head Blankfein, American Express Co <AXP.N> CEO Kenneth Chenault and JP Morgan's Dimon may be a surprise, given that their companies have reduced or even eliminated option grants in recent years in favor of stock awards tied to hitting financial targets. Blankfein's 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. That was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Blankfein declined to comment. Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York, said the big gains for the leaders of American Express, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reflect how stock option compensation can magnify gains in a company’s share price. “When the stock goes up, with options, you get more leverage,” he said. MEDIOCRE PERFORMANCE Critics of stock options say the grants can produce large amounts of wealth for CEOs even with mediocre performance. One reason is that grants often are not linked to any financial performance metric, such as return on equity. And so as the United States nears the eighth year of a bull market, options can increase in value even if the CEOs are running companies whose share price has lagged broad benchmarks during their tenure. For example, shares of Caterpillar Inc <CAT.N> rose 54 percent during Douglas Oberhelman's tenure as CEO of the big equipment maker from mid-2010 to the end of 2016, while the Dow 30 more than doubled during that span. But the value of Oberhelman's options rallied during his last year as CEO, climbing to $20.3 million after being under water by nearly $9 million at the start of 2016. The options' value got a $10.6 million booster shot after Trump's victory. Caterpillar shares rose 36 percent in 2016, making it one of the best performing stocks on the Dow. Trump has said he would use Caterpillar tractors to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Caterpillar and Oberhelman declined to comment. Not all CEOs have been winners, however. Coca-Cola Co <KO.N> CEO Muhtar Kent, who contributed $2,700 to Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival for president, saw the value of his options decline by $11.3 million to $143 million. Coca-Cola shares are off 3 percent since Trump was elected amid lingering concerns about consumers cutting their consumption of sugary drinks. A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.

But the value of Oberhelman's options rallied during his last year as CEO, climbing to US$20.3 million after being under water by nearly US$9 million at the start of 2016. The options' value got a US$10.6 million booster shot after Trump's victory. Caterpillar shares rose 36 percent in 2016, making it one of the best performing stocks on the Dow. Trump has said he would use Caterpillar tractors to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Caterpillar and Oberhelman declined to comment. Not all CEOs have been winners, however. Coca-Cola Co CEO Muhtar Kent, who contributed US$2,700 to Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival for president, saw the value of his options decline by US$11.3 million to US$143 million. Coca-Cola shares are off 3 percent since Trump was elected amid lingering concerns about consumers cutting their consumption of sugary drinks. A Coca-Cola spokesman declined to comment.

REUTERS/Larry Downing/File PhotoMore By Tim McLaughlin and Ross Kerber BOSTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump once described Jamie Dimon as "the worst banker in the United States," but the president-elect has helped make the boss of JPMorgan Chase & Co $50 million richer. Dimon is the top beneficiary among the 30 chief executives who run companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index from a stock rally inspired by Trump's election, according to a Reuters analysis of their option grants. Trump's proposed policies for lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and more infrastructure spending have energized the U.S. stock market since the real estate magnate's Nov. 8 victory. The post-election rally even resurrected the value of an option award held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein that was worthless on the eve of the election. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has seen his stock options surge in value by more than $50 million to $146 million since the Republican candidate's White House win. Trump criticized Dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. Nevertheless, he appointed Dimon to the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a group of high-profile business leaders he set up last month to advise him on economic growth and job creation. Dimon declined to comment on Trump's criticism or the rise in value of his holdings. JACKPOT Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trump’s election win. The figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015. Options that expired or vested in 2016 were excluded from the analysis. In a few cases, CEOs exercised some of those options during 2016, U.S. regulatory filings show. Visa Inc CEO Charles Scharf did not need a Trump-led stock rally to hit the jackpot. About two weeks before the election, he exercised nearly 800,000 options for gross proceeds of almost $33 million, U.S. regulatory filings show. He resigned from Visa effective Dec. 1. For a look at how the post-election rally has affected Dow 30 stock options, click here (http://tmsnrt.rs/2iCbvvT) Trump campaigned on the slogan "Make America Great Again," vowing to bolster the prospects of the American working class by preventing jobs from moving abroad, restricting immigration and renegotiating trade pacts. In 2015, Trump called high salaries paid to CEOs a "joke" and a "disgrace" and said these were often approved by company boards stacked with CEOs' friends. PRO-BUSINESS AGENDA To be sure, Trump's election has helped investors big and small. Hopes of a pro-business agenda have driven the Dow 30 close to 20,000 - a level it has never breached - in a boon for workers' retirement plans. "With the recent Trump/Republican win, it appears that investors are getting more excited about potential growth and animal spirits are on the rise," top investment strategists at Morgan Stanley said this month in a wealth management report. "This is likely to lead to the final euphoric stage of this cyclical bull market which could be quite powerful in 2017’s first half." Big stock option gains for Goldman Sachs head Blankfein, American Express Co CEO Kenneth Chenault and JP Morgan's Dimon may be a surprise, given that their companies have reduced or even eliminated option grants in recent years in favour of stock awards tied to hitting financial targets. Blankfein's 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. That was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Blankfein declined to comment. Alan Johnson, managing director of pay consulting firm Johnson Associates in New York, said the big gains for the leaders of American Express, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reflect how stock option compensation can magnify gains in a company’s share price. “When the stock goes up, with options, you get more leverage,” he said. MEDIOCRE PERFORMANCE Read More Critics of stock options say the grants can produce large amounts of wealth for CEOs even with mediocre performance. One reason is that grants often are not linked to any financial performance metric, such as return on equity. And so as the United States nears the eighth year of a bull market, options can increase in value even if the CEOs are running companies whose share price has lagged broad benchmarks during their tenure. For example, shares of Caterpillar Inc rose 54 percent during Douglas Oberhelman's tenure as CEO of the big equipment maker from mid-2010 to the end of 2016, while the Dow 30 more than doubled during that span.

JPMorgan said it will appeal the finding, which awarded Johnny Burris $64,400 in back wages and $100,000 for reputational damage, pain and suffering. The finding by an investigator for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration was released on Tuesday. OSHA, which is part of the Labor Department, said there was “reasonable cause” to conclude that JPMorgan’s decision to terminate Burris resulted in part from employee behavior protected under the anti-retaliation provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. An appeal would be considered by an administrative law judge. “Mr. Burris previously raised these same claims to a Finra panel, with the same basic evidence, and the claims were denied,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said in an e-mailed statement. She was referring to a 2014 ruling by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s industry-funded brokerage regulator, that he wasn’t wrongfully dismissed. “We look forward to presenting our case in the next step of this process and putting this to rest.” Burris disputes the validity of the Finra ruling. The arbitrators made their decision based on a client complaint that OSHA later found to have been written by a JPMorgan manager, Burris said. OSHA found that the same manager turned two more oral complaints into written ones after Burris was terminated. Expunge Order Under the OSHA finding, JPMorgan would have to clear that complaint and expunge his industry employment record, known as a U5. It would also have to pay him reasonable attorneys’ fees. Burris expressed dissatisfaction with the OSHA decision. “They ruled in my favor but tried to limit the damages to the bank,” he said. OSHA’s San Francisco office, which handled the case, didn’t respond to a request seeking comment on the finding. Burris isn’t the only former JPMorgan adviser to complain of retaliation. A trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 23 in Manhattan federal court in the case of Jennifer Sharkey, a former JPMorgan wealth manager who alleges that the bank fired her in violation of Sarbanes-Oxley whistle-blower protections after she recommended that it investigate whether a wealthy client was involved in illegal activity. Last September, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed an earlier dismissal of the case and sent it back to the lower court. Last June, a Finra arbitration panel found that JPMorgan had defamed three former New Jersey wealth managers by falsely amending their employment records. The bank was ordered by the arbitrators to expunge the advisers’ records. Adviser’s Complaints Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter.

Shortly afterward, he started voicing complaints internally about being pressured by managers to sell more of the bank’s products to his elderly clientele, even if there were better investment options for them. Burris also provided information about his concerns to the New York Times, which featured him in a March 2013 article. In the ensuing months, Burris’s managers frequently discussed how he was selling a low percentage of JPMorgan-managed products, according to OSHA’s written finding. Burris was fired by the bank in November 2012. A JPMorgan manager went outside firm procedure, turned an oral customer complaint into a written one and required Burris to list it on his employment record, “likely blacklisting him and causing him reputational harm,” according to the OSHA finding.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) Specialist Peter Mazza works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017. U.S. stocks moved broadly lower in early trading Thursday, giving back the market’s gains from the day before. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (7) Banks and other financial companies led U.S. stocks modestly lower Thursday, wiping out much of the market's gains from a day earlier. Phone companies, real estate, utilities and health care stocks eked out gains. Energy, technology and other stocks that posted big gains in the weeks after the November election lost ground. Hess slumped 4.8 percent and chipmaker Micron Technology fell 2.1 percent. Banks, which moved sharply higher through much of the postelection rally in November and December, were hurt by a drop in bond yields, which can push down interest rates on loans, squeezing banks' profits. "The market has been running pretty nicely this year, so this is just a little bit of a pullback, a little bit of a consolidation," said Troy Logan, managing director at Warren Financial Service. "Anything that has run well postelection has pulled back somewhat today." VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Dow Jones industrial average slid 63.28 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,891. The average had briefly been down more than 183 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 4.88 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,270.44. The Nasdaq composite snapped a seven-day winning streak that delivered five consecutive record highs. On Thursday, the index fell 16.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,547.49. The market's slide came as investors looked ahead to several weeks of companies reporting their latest quarterly results. That begins Friday, when several major banks are due to report earnings, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. The latest drop in bond yields weighed on bank stocks Thursday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 2.36 percent from 2.37 percent late Wednesday. Beyond that, some traders may have also been selling bank stocks to lock in the sector's recent gains ahead of Friday's earnings releases, Logan said. "Tomorrow is the big day for a lot of the big banks," he said. "They've run up pretty nicely postelection and through this year." PNC Financial Services Group lost $2.85, or 2.4 percent, to $117.93, while Zions Bancorporation fell 95 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $42.97. JPMorgan Chase shed 84 cents, or 1 percent, to $86.24. Companies issuing earnings forecasts also grabbed investors' attention Thursday. Hess slid 4.8 percent after the oil company said it will take a $3.8 billion charge in the fourth quarter. The stock fell $2.99 to $58.85. Other companies making news also lost ground. Mylan fell 1.4 percent on news that rival CVS slashed its price on a generic version of Adrenaclick, a lesser-known treatment similar to EpiPen, which can cost more than $600. The version that CVS will is selling costs about a sixth of the price of Mylan's EpiPen. The stock shed 51 cents to $36.77. Fiat Chrysler tumbled 10.3 percent after the U.S. government accused the automaker of violating vehicle emission laws. The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that Fiat Chrysler failed to disclose software in some of its vehicles with diesel engines that allows them to emit more pollution than allowed under the Clean Air Act. Shares in Fiat slid $1.14 to $9.95. Markets overseas were mixed. In Europe, Germany's DAX fell 1.1 percent, while France's CAC 40 slid 0.5 percent despite new data showing eurozone industrial production jumped 1.5 percent in November. Britain's FTSE 100 was flat. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 1.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.1 percent. South Korea's Kospi bucked the trend to rise 0.6 percent. Energy futures closed higher. Benchmark crude oil rose 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $53.01 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 91 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $56.01 a barrel in London. » Next page...

The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) is up about 17 percent since Nov. 8. However, it was down slightly on Thursday after Trump didn't provide details on his highly anticipated tax and regulatory reform policies during his Wednesday afternoon press conference. "If Trump can get these policies done, which we believe he can, lower taxes, lower regulation, some stimulus growth, some loan growth out there, these banks' earnings are going to go up materially," said Paul Miller, head of financial institutions research at FBR Capital Markets, on Thursday. Several big banks are set to report earnings on Friday morning, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. What investors are really going to be focusing on is guidance. "We've been hearing that there's been some robust pipelines for loan growth that they could take guidance up tomorrow. If that happens, I think these stocks are going to move higher. We're very bullish and think that this is a very great buying opportunity for all these names," Miller told CNBC's "Closing Bell." show chapters Gibson: Any dip in financials, I'm buying    Thursday, 12 Jan 2017 | 3:53 PM ET | 02:08 However, veteran trader Art Cashin pointed out that the bank CEOs won't be able to give too many details given that they don't know yet what Trump's tax policy might look like. "We're not expecting a lot of clarity because we're not getting it out of Washington," the floor director for UBS said in an interview with "Closing Bell." The sector's postelection rally comes after it spent several years in purgatory, facing "vitriolic hatred" after the financial crisis, Smead Capital Management CEO Bill Smead said. "They are probably a little overdone in the short run, but coming off the hatred they've had, it could be a long haul to the upside," he told "Closing Bell." He specifically likes Bank of America. Miller agrees, noting that if Trump's pro-business agenda takes hold, the bank will probably be the biggest beneficiary. Kourtney Gibson, president of Loop Capital Markets, is buying any dips in financials. "You get some interest rate hikes, you get Trump potentially rolling back some things with Dodd-Frank, I think the banks are incredibly well positioned," she told "Closing Bell."

Fred DeMarco, left, and Mario Picone, right, work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, today. ASSOCIATED PRESS Specialist Peter Mazza works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, today. ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print Banks and other financial companies led U.S. stocks modestly lower today, wiping out much of the market’s gains from a day earlier. Phone companies, real estate, utilities and health care stocks eked out gains. Energy, technology and other stocks that posted big gains in the weeks after the November election lost ground. Hess slumped 4.8 percent and chipmaker Micron Technology fell 2.1 percent. Banks, which moved sharply higher through much of the postelection rally in November and December, were hurt by a drop in bond yields, which can push down interest rates on loans, squeezing banks’ profits. “The market has been running pretty nicely this year, so this is just a little bit of a pullback, a little bit of a consolidation,” said Troy Logan, managing director at Warren Financial Service. “Anything that has run well postelection has pulled back somewhat today.” The Dow Jones industrial average slid 63.28 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,891. The average had briefly been down more than 183 points. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 4.88 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,270.44. The Nasdaq composite snapped a seven-day winning streak that delivered five consecutive record highs. Today, the index fell 16.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,547.49. The market’s slide came as investors looked ahead to several weeks of companies reporting their latest quarterly results. That begins Friday, when several major banks are due to report earnings, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. The latest drop in bond yields weighed on bank stocks today. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 2.36 percent from 2.37 percent late Wednesday. Beyond that, some traders may have also been selling bank stocks to lock in the sector’s recent gains ahead of Friday’s earnings releases, Logan said. “Tomorrow is the big day for a lot of the big banks,” he said. “They’ve run up pretty nicely postelection and through this year.” PNC Financial Services Group lost $2.85, or 2.4 percent, to $117.93, while Zions Bancorporation fell 95 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $42.97. JPMorgan Chase shed 84 cents, or 1 percent, to $86.24. Companies issuing earnings forecasts also grabbed investors’ attention today. Hess slid 4.8 percent after the oil company said it will take a $3.8 billion charge in the fourth quarter. The stock fell $2.99 to $58.85. Other companies making news also lost ground. Mylan fell 1.4 percent on news that rival CVS slashed its price on a generic version of Adrenaclick, a lesser-known treatment similar to EpiPen, which can cost more than $600. The version that CVS will is selling costs about a sixth of the price of Mylan’s EpiPen. The stock shed 51 cents to $36.77. Fiat Chrysler tumbled 10.3 percent after the U.S. government accused the automaker of violating vehicle emission laws. The Environmental Protection Agency said today that Fiat Chrysler failed to disclose software in some of its vehicles with diesel engines that allows them to emit more pollution than allowed under the Clean Air Act. Shares in Fiat slid $1.14 to $9.95. Markets overseas were mixed. In Europe, Germany’s DAX fell 1.1 percent, while France’s CAC 40 slid 0.5 percent despite new data showing eurozone industrial production jumped 1.5 percent in November. Britain’s FTSE 100 was flat. In Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 1.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipped 0.5 percent, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.1 percent. South Korea’s Kospi bucked the trend to rise 0.6 percent. Energy futures closed higher. Benchmark crude oil rose 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $53.01 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 91 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $56.01 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.61 a gallon and heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.68 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 16 cents, or 5 percent, to $3.39 per 1,000 cubic feet. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.63 yen from 115.43 on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0626 from $1.0576. The pound, which has been weakening recently amid concern that Britain might break off completely from the European Union’s single market, lost ground again to the dollar. The British currency slid to $1.2163 from $1.2208. The price of gold rose $3.20 to $1,199.80 an ounce. Silver was little changed at $16.83 an ounce. Copper rose 6 cents to $2.67 a pound.

CHINA TRADE: Customs data showed that Chinese exports sank 6.1 percent in December from a year earlier. In November, China's exports eked out a 0.1 percent expansion after shrinking for nine straight months. Imports rose 3.1 percent from a year earlier. WALL STREET: U.S. stock markets finished moderately lower. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 63.28 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,891. The average had briefly been down more than 183 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 4.88 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,270.44. The Nasdaq composite fell 16.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,547.49. OIL: Benchmark crude oil rose 10 cents at $53.11 per barrel in New York. The contract gained 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $53.01 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, gained 8 cents to $56.09 a barrel in London.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Levin Report How Mexico Could Exact the Ultimate Revenge on Donald Trump Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Levin Report How Mexico Could Exact the Ultimate Revenge on Donald Trump Mexican traders have a simple solution for their currency woes: destroy the thing Trump loves the most. by Bess LevinJanuary 12, 2017 4:10 pm Email Facebook Twitter By Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images. From companies afraid he’ll send their stock price into free fall if they don’t do what he says, to defense experts worried that his proclivity for extemporaneous tweeting is a national-security nightmare, Donald Trump’s obsession with the 140-character social-media platform (and the presumption that he won’t give it up once he takes office) scares a whole bunch of people. But what if someone, or a group of someones—say, traders in Mexico—had a simple solution to the problem that wouldn’t involve prying @realDonaldTrump from the soon-to-be president’s elfin hands? Per Bloomberg: There’s a strange idea circulating among Mexican currency traders. Well, more of a joke really. But there’s a certain logic to it. Instead of spending its precious reserves to defend the peso, Mexico should just buy Twitter Inc.—at a cost of about $12 billion—and immediately shut it down. The notion made the rounds this week after the central bank revealed it had already blown through $2 billion of reserves in a largely futile effort to shield the peso from a steady stream of anti-Mexico Tweets from Donald Trump. Now, no one thinks this is really going to happen. And it’s hard to imagine it’d be effective anyway. But that the idea was even raised in jest shows how just how frustrated Mexicans are that their economy and the value of their savings are at the mercy of the seemingly random musings coming in 140-character bursts from Trump’s Twitter account. It’s a “joke,” sure, but what if it didn’t have to be? Jamie Dimon knows the way to Donald Trump’s heart After a confusing few weeks wherein it appeared Trump badly wanted to hire Jamie Dimon as treasury secretary, and then Jamie Dimon snubbed him, and then Trump snubbed him back, the JPMorgan C.E.O. and president-elect appear to have repaired their relationship (which was possibly only on the rocks due to a meddlesome Carl Icahn). In December, Dimon said “President-Elect Trump is different from candidate Trump,” so all the people he threatened to deport during the campaign have nothing to worry about. Now, he’s gone further, comparing Trump’s Cabinet picks to the president-elect’s favorite four-time Super Bowl–winning champion. Per Bloomberg: “If you want to win the game, put Tom Brady on the field,” Dimon, 60, said in an interview Thursday on CBS This Morning. Trump’s “hired a lot of professional people, people that are experienced, successful, smart and patriotic,” he said. Dimon praised Steve Mnuchin, Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary, saying the former CEO of OneWest Bank Group LLC is “very qualified” and “wants to do the right thing.” “Rex Tillerson is a class act -- he’s smart, he’s patriotic,” Dimon said. “Almost every big company has dealings in Russia; that doesn’t mean he’s not a patriot.” Dimon, by the way, knows how helpful it can be to get a call from Tom Brady when the chips are down, even if the quarterback has no idea what you actually do for a living. What does Trump have against economists with doctorates? We already know Trump thinks numbers are for losers, so would it be so much of a stretch for him to excommunicate the nerds from his administration, too? Some masters of the dismal science think not. From CNBC’s Steve Liesman: In the hallways and panels of the American Economic Association annual conference in Chicago, there was much discussion both about the economics of the Trump administration (they did not get good reviews) and the economists. "Have you met anyone here working with them?" was a common question this reporter both received and asked. The answer was always no. So far, just one academic economist has been named to the administration. Peter Navarro, the University of California Irvine economics professor, will head a newly created White House National Trade Council. CNBC contributor Larry Kudlow, former Bear Stearns economist David Malpass and the Heritage Foundation's Stephen Moore have all worked closely with Trump to design his economic plans. Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president, whose career has been almost entirely on Wall Street, has been named director of the National Economic Council. None, however, would be considered by the AEA group as an academic economist, as in one with a Ph.D., employed currently at an institution of higher learning who publishes peer-reviewed research papers. Yay Morgan Stanley! James Gorman and Co. have done pretty, pretty, pretty well for themselves. Per the F.T.: Seven Morgan Stanley executives have netted about $17m selling their shares in the bank since Donald Trump’s election, capitalising on a jump in financial stocks driven by his victory. James Gorman, chairman and chief executive, has taken home $7.1m, president Colm Kelleher $3.3m and investment head Daniel Simkowitz $3.7m, company filings show. The transactions came during a historic rally for US banking stocks. The S&P 500 Banks index is up more than 24 per cent since November 9. Wells Fargo hopes to turn around its no-good, very bad five months In September, Wells Fargo admitted that 5,300 employees had created over 2 million sham accounts in customers’ names, without the permission of said customers. That’s not a great thing to have to admit! The scandal cost then C.E.O John Stumpf his job (and $41 million) and Wells Fargo its squeaky-clean reputation. But the bank is hoping shareholders will forgive it: Investors bailed on the stock when the story broke in September, pushing shares down as much as 16 percent as the bank's performance badly lagged its peers. However, Wells Fargo participated strongly in the late-2016 rally, and the stock has surged more than 23 percent since the low point of the fake account scandal. Shares have fallen 1.9 percent in 2017. That sets the stage, then, for the fourth-quarter earnings report scheduled for release Friday morning. Analysts expect the company to report a profit of $1 per share on revenue of $22.45 billion, according to FactSet. Though they are still fairly strong numbers, that would be a decline of more than 2.5 percent from the same period a year ago. On a similar note, the bank is trying to ingratiate itself to some of the employees it initially threw under the bus for the scandal, by raising their pay.

The U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday that Christopher Cummins worked with other foreign exchange dealers to manipulate exchange rates from about 2007 to 2013. A spokeswoman for Citigroup declined comment on the guilty plea. Cummins could not be reached for comment. Cummins is the second trader to admit guilt in the probe. The first was Jason Katz, a former trader at Barclays who later worked at BNP Paribas SA and who pleaded guilty on Jan. 4. On Tuesday, the Justice Department brought charges against three former traders at Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), and Barclays Plc (BARC.L) arising from a global probe into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates at major banks. The three were Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan, Rohan Ramchandani, formerly of Citigroup, and Christopher Ashton, formerly of Barclays. JPMorgan, Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and a Citigroup unit pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currency rates, agreeing at that time to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines. Those plea deals contributed to the more than $10 billion that some of the world's biggest banks have agreed to pay to resolve U.S. and European probes into the manipulation of foreign exchange rates.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid CHICAGO Peabody Energy Corp (BTUUQ.PK) said on Thursday that a group of banks, including affiliates of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPM.N), has pledged a combined $1.5 billion in loans to help the coal producer exit bankruptcy in the coming months. The cash will be used to cover claims by Peabody's secured lenders and provide "a strong foundation" for its capital structure when it emerges from the roughly $8 billion Chapter 11 bankruptcy it filed last April, according to court documents. Affiliates of Credit Suisse AG (CSGN.S) and Macquarie Group Ltd (MQG.AX) are also part of the group that has signed on to the new financing. Peabody, with 6.3 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves, joined other U.S. coal producers in bankruptcy last year when falling prices left it unable to service billions of dollars in debt taken on to finance expansion in Australia. The company expects to exit Chapter 11 in the second quarter of this year with a plan, supported by most of its creditors, to cut more than $5 billion of debt and raise new capital through a $750 million private placement and a $750 million rights offering. Peabody has not yet explained how it will guarantee about $1 billion in future mine cleanup costs previously covered by "self-bonding," a federal program that exempt large miners from setting aside cash or collateral to ensure mined land is returned to its natural setting, as required by law. The practice came under scrutiny following Chapter 11 filings by U.S. coal producers that held a total of $3.6 billion in self-bonds as of July, raising concerns that taxpayers could some day be stuck with the cost of cleaning up mined land.

Though short on details, Donald Trump’s press conference Wednesday afternoon socked drug stocks, and forced investors to consider whether their enthusiasm had driven equity prices up too far too fast.  Continue Reading Below Before clawing back steep losses of about 1%, early trading put both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 on track for their worst one-day declines since October. The blue-chip average remained short of its 20000 milestone, closing down 63 points , or 0.32% to 19891. The broader S&P 500 declined 4 points, or 0.21%, to 2270 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq broke a six-session win streak as it fell 16 points, or 0.29% to 5547. Despite the pullback, the S&P continued to cling to its biggest post-election rally since voters sent John F. Kennedy to the White House in 1960. At that time, the index jumped 8.8% in the time period between Election Day and Inauguration Day. This time around, the benchmark index has registered gains of more than 6% since the November 8 close, as investors remain hopeful about the promise of fiscal stimulus and relaxed Wall-Street regulations from the incoming Trump administration alongside improving economic fundamentals. While sentiment helps fuel market strength, economic fundamentals also heavily influence direction. For context, after President Barack Obama won the election during the Great Recession in 2008, the S&P declined 19.9%. The index declined 6.24% after George W. Bush’s win in 2001 after the tech bubble burst, and 19.34% following the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 during the Great Depression. The big question remains: Is there any fuel left in the market’s rally tank?    The short answer is yes, said Global Markets Advisory Group Senior Market Strategist Peter Kenny. But the near-term answer is much more nuanced due to a number of factors at play, including fourth-quarter earnings season, which begins Friday ahead of the opening bell. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT “Right now, it’s all going to be about earnings until Trump gets into the White House and we see what the first 100 days are like and what the fiscal priorities are,” Kenny said.  “Right now, it’s all going to be about earnings until Trump gets into the White House and we see what the first 100 days are like and what the fiscal priorities are." - Peter Kenny, Global Markets Advisory Group Three of America’s biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC), kick off bank earnings with their results Friday, followed by Morgan Stanley on Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (GS) Wednesday. Investment banking is forecasted to have seen high single-digit growth over the period, analysts at S&P Global’s CFRA said, while overall 4Q earnings per share results are forecast to rise 4.4% from a year ago. Forward-looking investors, though, likely won’t be satisfied with in-line or above-expected earnings results. Full-year guidance will also be key to validating the market’s momentous move higher.  “This is not an emotional or anticipatory trade anymore. We’re getting down to valuations, results -- metrics of measure that support trends,” Kenny said, suggesting that equity valuations are stretched at current levels with price-to-earnings ratios, which indicate how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of profit, for the Dow and S&P 500 sitting at 18.86 and 21.24, respectively. A high ratio indicates investors anticipate higher future growth.  “It’s really important to consider we’ve seen largely horizontal moves in price action the last several weeks. There’s a reason for that. Smart money wants to see actual results,” he said. Historically, stocks have trended higher from inauguration day to the end of the new president’s first 100 days in office, the Dow Jones Market Data Group figures show. Under JFK, not only did stocks rally from Election Day to inauguration day, they posted another 8.92% gain through his first 100 days.

At his first press conference as president-elect on Wednesday, Trump proved not only can he move markets with his tweets – recently blasting American car companies that had plans to build production facilities in Mexico – he can also crush market caps from the podium. In just two sentences, Trump sent health care stocks plunging and sent the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index dropping nearly 4%. The president-elect said the drug industry has been “disastrous,” and expressed a need to “create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they’re getting away with murder.” Market values of Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE), the two biggest U.S. pharmaceutical companies, plunged by 10.2 billion on the heels of those remarks. Despite targeted remarks from the president-elect aimed at specific companies or industries, Nuveen Asset Management Chief Equity Strategist Bob Doll, and others on the Street, predict continued economic expansion, higher interest rates, and further equity-market gains. As recent consumer and investor confidence surveys have suggested, Doll sees a continued shift in sentiment away from fear and safety trades, into a “glass half full” mindset. “We have a shot at some growth, we’ve seen it pick up in the back half of last year.

Look to consolidate your debts Ken Sweet, The Associated Press 1:00 p.m. ET Jan. 12, 2017 If you do consolidate your debts, the most important thing is to not run up your credit cards again. Then you'll be saddled with both the debt-consolidation loan and new balances on the cards. (Photo: George Doyle, Getty Images) NEW YORK — So maybe you shouldn't have purchased that 55-inch TV for your toddler or given a diamond-encrusted collar to your corgi for Christmas. Now you're saddled with thousands of dollars in credit-card debt from the holidays, collecting interest at 18 percent or more. Never fear, there are a few ways to pay off that credit card debt in less costly ways. ZERO INTEREST, WITH A CATCH Many credit card companies offer zero-interest balance transfers to new and existing customers after the holidays. That way you can pay off the debt without incurring any interest, typically with a grace period of 12 to 18 months. But if the balance isn't paid off in that period, the remaining amount is subject to high credit card interest again. Watch out for balance transfer fees, however. A typical credit card issuer will charge roughly 3 percent to transfer a balance. There are some credit cards that do promotional zero-fee balance transfers like Slate by JPMorgan Chase. TAKE OUT A PERSONAL LOAN Several online lenders now offer lower interest debt consolidation loans to eligible borrowers, like SoFi, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, Lending Club and Prosper. Most online lenders can offer loans as low as 7 percent. But since they are unsecured loans, borrowing from these companies can have interest rates similar to or higher than credit cards. The loans come with the advantage of consolidating your payments into one place, with one steady payment, and a three to five-year plan to pay that debt off. HOME EQUITY With the housing market mostly recovered from the crisis, banks are more likely to offer home equity lines of credit than ever before. The interest rate on a home equity line of credit can be as low as 3 percent. However they are effectively a second mortgage on your house and should only be used for large, unexpected expenses. DON'T REPEAT YOUR MISTAKES If you do consolidate your debts, the most important thing is to not run up your credit cards again. Then you'll be saddled with both the debt-consolidation loan and new balances on the cards.

Technology Tesaro Stock Rebounds Despite FDA Holdup On Anti-Nausea Med Tesaro's Varubi, which treats the after effects of chemo, could be approved midyear. (© Monkey Business/stock.adobe.com) ALLISON GATLIN 1/12/2017 Reprints Despite an FDA holdup, Tesaro's (TSRO) post-chemo, anti-nausea IV drug could garner approval by mid-2017, Leerink and Credit Suisse analysts said Thursday as Tesaro stock recovered from two days in the red. On the stock market today, Tesaro stock rose 0.74% to 146.98. But shares closed down an average 1% over the past two days after hitting a 148.84 buy point out of a consolidation on Monday. Shares are now trading 1.2% below that entry point. Tesaro stock fell amid a myriad biotech catalysts. On Monday, the 35th annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference kicked off in San Francisco. Early Wednesday, comments by President-elect Trump regarding drug pricing sent shares into a tailspin. After two days in the black, biotech stocks toppled 3.1% on Wednesday. But IBD's 420-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, down more than 2% earlier Thursday, ended the session up a fraction, trading at its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Things are looking up for Tesaro, despite the FDA's request for more information into its manufacturing process for IV drug Varubi. Varubi is the brand name for Tesaro's drug to treat delayed nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro led the biotech industry in terms of stock gains in 2016. Get the other top names in IBD's Industry Themes. Tesaro said it was forced to find a second manufacturer for Varubi after it identified potential deficiencies at the original manufacturer. The FDA is trying to determine comparability between the products manufactured at both sites. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young called the issue "relatively minor." She has an outperform rating and 151 price target on Tesaro stock, and expects the company to refile with the FDA within the next two months. Approval could come as soon as mid-2017, she said. "The FDA is not questioning the comparability but looking for more info about actual assay," she wrote in a research report. "Tesaro provided the in vitro release assay as requested, but apparently the FDA has further questions about the assay." Importantly, there are no safety and efficacy concerns associated with Varubi, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in his research report. Fernandez has an outperform rating on Tesaro stock. He also expects Tesaro to refile later in the first half of 2017. Assuming a speedy approval process, Fernandez maintains his estimates on Varubi sales at $343 million worldwide in 2026. He expects Varubi to gain 35% share in the U.S. and 25% share in Europe.

"The market has rewarded the stocks very well in the fourth quarter," said Ken Leon, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. "The question is, can they really catch up with the euphoria of having a Trump administration?" The fourth-quarter reporting season kicks off in earnest Friday with results from BlackRock, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs report early next week after Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The bank stocks are a key part of the U.S. market's rally to record highs. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) has shot up more than 24 percent since the election, while the broader financials sector is up 17 percent as the top performer in the S&P 500 over that time. As a result, expectations are generally elevated. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said in a Wednesday note that most of the large banks it covers should beat consensus earnings estimates. That's despite a history of fourth-quarter numbers disappointing, Goldberg said. "I don't think there's a lot of room for shortfall, assuming we don't get a surprise," said Devin Ryan, analyst at JMP Securities. "We're going to be focusing more on incremental comments from management that suggest the backdrop is changing." Investors may not hear as much optimism on potential political changes as they would like. While the bank stocks have rallied early this year to highs not seen since the 2008 financial crisis, not many expect the complete repeal of the post-crisis Dodd-Frank legislation as Trump has promised. "They're probably going to be slower than maybe the market has anticipated. We don't view financial regulation as a top priority for the new administration," said Shannon Stemm, financial services analyst at Edward Jones. In his first news conference since the election Wednesday, Trump did not discuss tax reform or deregulation. Wells Fargo will take its own place in the spotlight for its second earnings report since a phony bank accounts scandal came to light. Friday's report will mark the first full quarter with Tim Sloan as president and CEO, after the abrupt departure of John Stumpf as chairman and CEO just days before Wells Fargo's third-quarter report in October. "I think there are going to be a lot of questions asked," said Cathy Seifert, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. "We're going to have to hear from them how what they're doing to resolve that and further issues like that." — CNBC's Chris Hayes contributed to this report.

BRENNEN Published: Jan 12, 2017 Share This: Rate this article: Add To favourite We are spending too much time on smartphones and tablets texting one another instead of talking face to face. While the smart phone can be a positive tool for quick and convenient communication, too much texting is not healthy for building long-lasting healthy relationships, and it is not good for the brain. I have literally seen people going for walks, sitting by the beach and waiting at the bus stop, and all they are doing is looking at their smart phones texting or surfing the Internet. Some are even texting while they are stepping onto the bus. While we feel good receiving instant messages, there are times we must look up. You need to look at people around you. Take in the moments. Look at nature. What’s most embarrassing and perhaps insulting is when there is a family or community social gathering and the majority of people are looking at their tablets or smartphones instead of interacting with one another. Perhaps it is wise that when there is a family dinner or group gathering designed for social interaction, the organizers have a receptacle at the entrance in which everyone leaves his or her smartphone until the event is over. My wife and I were at a neighborhood eatery where there is a place for people to relax and socialize. Right away we observed that we were the only ones talking with each other and looking at each other. Every table had people who were all looking at their smartphones. They were not even talking to each other. It was a deafening silence and a pitiful sight to behold. “Is this socialization?” I said to myself. The other morning, I saw a man whose dog was walking him. Yes, that is true. He was not walking his dog. The dog was on the leash pulling him along as his head was turned downward with his eyes fixed on his smart phone and his fingers were continuously clicking away. It was a good thing there was no traffic on the street at that time. I wonder if we are losing the art of talking with each other. It concerns me that if we continue down this path, communication as we once knew it — that is, face to face — will be something of the past, and it will really be detrimental to our very existence. We will no longer know how to interpret body language, tone of voice or inflections. I am not against using a smartphone, iPad, or other modern device to help us be more efficient and to keep in contact with each other. During the past four years, Annick and I have actually watched our four grandchildren literally grow simply by free video communication on WhatsApp, Hangouts, Snapchat, Google, etc. When we finally met them face-to-face, they responded as though they have always been in our presence. Despite this positive experience, we have learned that nothing can replace the human touch and face-to-face sharing.   Another side to the story Interestingly, there is even a global trend toward less use of voicemail (leaving a message on the phone) even as a part of professional services. Neil Howe, in a July 2015 article, “Why millennials are texting more and talking less”, states: “As part of a firm-wide campaign to cut costs, JPMorgan Chase offered to eliminate voicemail for thousands of employees who don’t interact directly with clients. About 65 percent took the offer, resulting in over $3 million in annual savings. Executives say that the decision is overdue, pointing out that most workers — particularly those under 40 — have long relied on e-mail, text messaging, instant messaging or social media to reach others on the job and in their daily lives.” Howe continues to explain that several huge companies decided to follow suit. Coca-Cola made a similar move, only six percent of employees decided to keep it. Bank of America and Citigroup are considering following suit. In 2012, Vonage reported that the number of voicemail messages left on user accounts dropped eight percent from the year before, while the number of people who retrieved their messages fell 14 percent. In a Harvard Business Review essay urging companies to dump voicemail, author Michael Schlage doesn’t mince words: “A communications medium that was once essential has become as clunky and irrelevant as Microsoft MSFT-DOS and carbon paper.” While this might not be that negative and it is saving millions of dollars, it might be feeding into a trend that in the long run might be more non-productive because the human touch would have been lost. I do admit that millennials think differently than baby boomers and the rest of us. Howe states: “Millennials are shying away from calls and moving toward texting because many of them see the phone as overly intrusive, even presumptuous. Thus a less intrusive force of sharing is texting.” How cold are we going to get?   The weakness There are some concerns about the long-term use of smartphone texting. In the article “5 worrying ways texting affects your health, your relationships and your brain” by Gabrielle Moss, the writer shares this painful finding: “You’ve probably heard the bad news about ‘text neck’, a medical condition caused by the downward angle we hold our heads at while texting, emailing and otherwise using our smartphones. The pressure that bending our head down puts on our necks creates text neck’s side effects, which can include strained muscles, pinched nerves and herniated discs (yup, the same kind of herniated discs that often require surgery). Doctors even worry that, if nothing is done to correct it, text neck could eventually even lead to the neck’s natural curve being distorted.” What about relationships? There is no evidence that texting itself can damage relationships. Sometimes texting helps because it is quick and easy way to tell your partner that you will get home later than planned. Research indicates: “While texting affectionate thoughts was viewed as improving the relationship’s overall quality, relationships that prominently involved texting to apologize or make decisions were ranked as lower quality by women, while relationships that involved very frequent texting were ranked as lower quality by men. Study researcher Jonathan Sandberg noted that using text messages to hash out important relationship issues can strain a relationship’s emotional development and the bonding of the pair in it, because when you limit most of your conversations to texting, you miss out on the natural cues — body language, tone of voice, intonation, inflections, that really impact our views and interpretation. I have come to realize that there are lots of arguments because the one who sent the text forgets that the receiver did not see the body language or hear the voice intonations.   The brains of teenagers A 2010 Canadian study on the link between texting and adolescent brain development found that teens who used smartphones frequently performed worse on tests measuring memory and attention span than teens who used their phones less often. Epidemiologist Dr. Michael Abramson, a professor at Monash University and the lead researcher on the study, postulated that this might be because smartphone technology like predictive text, trains teens to work too quickly and make frequent mistakes. Dear reader, let’s spend more time talking face-to-face and less time texting. Let us be respectful while in the presence of friends, in relationships or in meetings by putting away the smartphones or tablets. Let’s talk, please.   • Barrington H.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Asian stock markets were mixed on Friday as disappointing Chinese trade data dented already bleak investor sentiment following U.S. President-elect's Donald Trump's news conference. The U.S. dollar rebounded. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.7 percent to 19,275.44 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.5 percent to 22,936.98. China's Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent to 3,122.87. But South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent to 2,076.08 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 1 percent to 5,711.30. Stocks in Singapore were higher but in Indonesia and the Philippines, markets were lower. ANALYST'S TAKE: "A correction may have been due following the exuberance of the market reaction to the election of Trump," said Alex Furber, a sales trader at CMC Markets.

The U.S. dollar rebounded. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.7 percent to 19,275.44 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.5 percent to 22,936.98. China's Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent to 3,122.87. But South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent to 2,076.08 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 1 percent to 5,711.30. Stocks in Singapore were higher but in Indonesia and the Philippines, markets were lower. ANALYST'S TAKE: "A correction may have been due following the exuberance of the market reaction to the election of Trump," said Alex Furber, a sales trader at CMC Markets.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 12, 2017 11:11am   Comments Share: SocGen has upgraded Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and UBS Group AG (USA) (NYSE: UBS) to Buy as it believes the “Trump Effect” will increase net interest income, lower corporate taxes and allow for the return of excess capital, benefiting the sector as a whole. Banking Under A Trump Administration “The increase in earnings will likely be significant for some banks, in our view, more than justifying the recent rally in share prices for US-centric banks,” analyst Andrew Lim wrote in a note. Lim says Trump’s proposed fiscal stimulus has steepened the U.S. yield curve. Lim noted that banks that benefit the most from higher net interest income are BofA, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM). Regarding the potential corporate tax reform, Lim said BofA, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan as best placed, with potential net earnings improvement of c.20 percent in store from 2018 onward. The analyst models a cut in the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. “We see Trump’s policies as supportive of FX trading going forward, amplified by ongoing macro-political volatility in Europe and emerging markets,” Lim continued. Share Buybacks Meanwhile, the analyst highlighted that Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) and BofA have the most excess capital and using it to buy back shares could boost EPS by 26 percent, 21 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The analyst calls Morgan Stanley and Bank of America as the biggest beneficiary of Trump’s policies. The analyst hiked Morgan Stanley’s price target to $60.0 from $22.5, while upping the target price of BofA to $31.5 from $17. Lim also increased his earnings estimates for the banks materially. In addition, Lim maintains his Buy rating on JPMorgan and increased price target significantly to $108 from $77 as he believes the market under-appreciates the company’s top-line growth, especially in its CIB division, which has high exposure to the fast-growing rates business. “Longer term, structural growth will be mainly in rates, credit trading, equity derivatives and FX thanks to supportive volatility. The stocks best placed to benefit from this are JPM, GS and UBS,” Lim highlighted. For UBS, the potential benefits are relatively lesser than US peers, but the Swiss bank should still enjoy net interest income boost due to an upward shift in the yield curve. The analyst estimates that UBS should have excess capital of CHF3.9 billion by end-2018. If used for buybacks, this could lead to 6 percent EPS accretion.

U.S. stocks moved broadly lower in early trading Thursday, giving back the marketâs gains from the day before. Associated Press   By YOUKYUNG LEE     SEOUL, South Korea -- Asian stock markets were mixed on Friday as disappointing Chinese trade data dented already bleak investor sentiment following U.S. President-elect's Donald Trump's news conference. The U.S. dollar rebounded. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.7 percent to 19,275.44 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.5 percent to 22,936.98. China's Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent to 3,122.87. But South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent to 2,076.08 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 1 percent to 5,711.30. Stocks in Singapore were higher but in Indonesia and the Philippines, markets were lower. ANALYST'S TAKE: "A correction may have been due following the exuberance of the market reaction to the election of Trump," said Alex Furber, a sales trader at CMC Markets. "Uncertainty lies ahead and market participants will want to see how the new administration takes shape." CHINA TRADE: Customs data showed that Chinese exports sank 6.1 percent in December from a year earlier. In November, China's exports eked out a 0.1 percent expansion after shrinking for nine straight months. Imports rose 3.1 percent from a year earlier. WALL STREET: U.S. stock markets finished moderately lower. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 63.28 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,891. The average had briefly been down more than 183 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 4.88 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,270.44. The Nasdaq composite fell 16.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,547.49. OIL: Benchmark crude oil rose 10 cents at $53.11 per barrel in New York. The contract gained 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $53.01 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, gained 8 cents to $56.09 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar strengthened to 115.07 yen from 114.86 yen while the euro declined to $1.0608 from $1.0611.

By Rex Nutting Published: Jan 11, 2017 6:04 p.m. ET Share For sixth straight year, Jim O’Sullivan wins MarketWatch Forecaster of the Year contest ©2016 Brad Trent Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics By RexNutting Columnist Why should anyone pay any attention to the experts? They failed to predict the financial crisis. They failed to predict Donald Trump. They get us into wars and into dumb trade deals. They tell us what to eat, what to think and how to live. They are smug, comfortable and never doubt their own wisdom, but they are often wrong. That’s the conventional wisdom, anyway, and there is an element of truth in it. The worlds of finance, economics and politics are littered with people who are as wrong as they are certain. And yet these people never seem to suffer for their failures. They are never held to account for the accuracy of their predictions. That’s part of the reason we started the Forecaster of the Month contest in 2003: To track the predictions that are made about the flow of economic statistics, and to honor those who get it right. And, contrary to the conventional wisdom that forecasting accuracy is just a matter of luck, we’ve found that some of the experts who forecast the economic statistics are better than others. Some experts really are experts. For instance, Jim O’Sullivan, the chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics, gets it right more often than not, at least when it comes to predicting such numbers as nonfarm payrolls, the consumer price index or gross domestic product. O’Sullivan is the winner of MarketWatch’s Forecaster of the Year contest for the sixth year in a row. 2016 Top Forecasters Firm 2016 Contest Points Jim O’Sullivan High Frequency Economics 292 Spencer Staples EconAlpha 278 Haseeb Ahmed Bluecrest Capital 253 Ryan Sweet Moody’s Analytics 188 Brian Jones Independent 178 Drew Matus & Sam Coffin UBS 178 Ian Shepherdson Pantheon Macro 165 Avery Shenfeld CIBC 161 Brittany Baumann & Robert Both TD Securities 143 Stephen Stanley Amherst Pierpont Securities 142 Stu Hoffman’s team PNC 137 Christophe Barraud Market Securities 123 James Sweeney’s team Credit Suisse 122 Michael Feroli JP Morgan Chase 119 Lewis Alexander’s team Nomura Securities 117 Let that sink in. Six straight years! If forecasting these numbers were just a matter of guessing, the probability of winning our contest six years in a row would be around 10 billion to 1. O’Sullivan also shared the Forecaster of the Year award in 2004, 2006 and 2008 when he worked at UBS under Maury Harris. That’s nine wins in 13 years. Spencer Staples, a forecaster who runs EconAlpha, is another expert who mostly gets it right. Staples is the last non-O’Sullivan to win the annual contest (in 2010), and he’s been the second-place finisher for the past three years. And there’s Haseeb Ahmed, a forecaster for Bluecrest Capital, who’s finished in third place each of the past three years, the only three years he’s participated. These three experts (and a dozen more) are the reason that MarketWatch’s so-called consensus forecast for U.S. economic data is superior to the forecast that the market pays attention to, which is produced by Bloomberg News. Bloomberg, you see, believes in the wisdom of crowds. Nobel Prizes have been won proving that nobody can beat the market over a long period of time, so it’s best to aggregate all the opinions. In other words, there’s wisdom in the crowd that no one person can match. The same thinking seems to apply to forecasting the economy, which is why Bloomberg surveys a large crowd of people, instead of just asking a few who are good at it. But there is no wisdom in that crowd, because some people are better at forecasting the economic data than others. MarketWatch’s consensus forecast only includes the people who’ve been consistently good, whereas Bloomberg surveys everyone it can, some of whom are good at forecasting and some of whom are just guessing. In 2016, the MarketWatch consensus forecast was more accurate than the Bloomberg forecast 64% of the time that they differed. In 2015, it was 61%. In 2014, it was 58%. That means that people who traded currencies, or stock or bond futures based on the MarketWatch consensus made a pile of money betting against people who relied on the Bloomberg consensus. In 2016, there were 11 forecasters who — by themselves — were more accurate than the Bloomberg consensus. O’Sullivan, Staples and Ahmed, of course. But also Stephen Stanley at Amherst Pierpont Securities, Avery Shenfeld at CIBC, Jan Hatzius’s team at Goldman Sachs, independent forecaster Brian Jones, Michael Feroli at JP Morgan Chase, Christophe Barraud of Market Securities, Michelle Girard’s team at NatWest Markets... And Sam Coffin of UBS, who won his second Forecaster of the Month contest in a row in December. The runners-up in the December contest were Stu Hoffman’s team at PNC, Spencer Staples of EconAlpha, Brian Jones, and Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. Despite their skill at forecasting what next week’s numbers will show, neither Coffin nor O’Sullivan have any illusions that they know with certainty what will happen to the economy in 2017. There are simply too many unknowns, beginning with Donald Trump himself. Even if we did know Trump’s mind, no one knows how Congress, the Fed, businesses, consumers, foreign leaders or markets would react as events unfold. Both forecasters think 2017 will be a bit stronger than 2016, but mostly because some of the headwinds to growth are shifting. They suspect that Trump’s policies might give the economy a boost, if only temporarily. December contest Reported Result San Coffin’s Forecast ISM 53.2% 52.5% Nonfarm payrolls 178,000 165,000 Trade deficit -$42.6 billion -$42.7 billion Retail sales 0.1% 0.4% Industrial production -0.4% -0.4% Consumer price index 0.2% 0.1% Housing starts 1.090 million 1.220 million Durable goods orders -4.6% -4.5% Consumer confidence index 113.7 111.0 New home sales 592,000 570,000 “We are highly skeptical that, seven-and-a-half years into the expansion, we are going to see the trend in growth suddenly move more than a point,” O’Sullivan wrote to clients. “Fiscal stimulus is unlikely to affect growth directly until at least mid-year... Nor do we expect regulatory relief to provide much lift. The main potential for an immediate boost to growth is for rising confidence to effectively become self-fulfilling.” Coffin has similar views: Consumer and business confidence have soared since Trump’s election, but any boost to the real economy is yet to come. Coffin expects consumers to spend a bit more, as indicated by the consumer confidence numbers and growing incomes, but he sees a possibility that “confidence has outrun reality.” O’Sullivan is worried that Trump will step on his own pro-growth message with trade restrictions or inflammatory tweets. We’d really like to know what will happen in 2017, but it’s impossible to have more than an educated opinion that leaves a lot in doubt. It’s not like that with forecasting the monthly indicators, because O’Sullivan, Coffin and the rest are actually predicting things that already happened — we just don’t know the details yet. Predicting the economic numbers may not have much social value compared with predicting a financial crisis or predicting the rise of Donald Trump. But it is something that the markets have assigned a lot of value to. If you really want a good idea of what the numbers will say next week, it pays to listen to O’Sullivan, Staples, Ahmed, Coffin and the rest who’ve proven their expertise. Trust the experts.

The U.S. dollar rebounded. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.7 percent to 19,275.44 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.5 percent to 22,936.98. China's Shanghai Composite Index added 0.1 percent to 3,122.87. But South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent to 2,076.08 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 1 percent to 5,711.30. Stocks in Singapore were higher but in Indonesia and the Philippines, markets were lower. ANALYST'S TAKE: "A correction may have been due following the exuberance of the market reaction to the election of Trump," said Alex Furber, a sales trader at CMC Markets. "Uncertainty lies ahead and market participants will want to see how the new administration takes shape." CHINA TRADE: Customs data showed that Chinese exports sank 6.1 percent in December from a year earlier. In November, China's exports eked out a 0.1 percent expansion after shrinking for nine straight months. Imports rose 3.1 percent from a year earlier. WALL STREET: U.S. stock markets finished moderately lower. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 63.28 points, or 0.3 percent, to 19,891. The average had briefly been down more than 183 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 4.88 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,270.44. The Nasdaq composite fell 16.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,547.49. OIL: Benchmark crude oil rose 10 cents at $53.11 per barrel in New York. The contract gained 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $53.01 a barrel on Thursday.

 Donald Trump just took the joy out of the drug industry's biggest investor conference Lydia Ramsey Jan. 12, 2017, 10:24 AM 12,439 facebook linkedin twitter email print Donald Trump. Spencer Platt/Getty Images SAN FRANCISCO — President-elect Donald Trump has officially killed the drug industry's buzz. At a press conference Wednesday, Trump said that drug companies were "getting away with murder," and suggested that the US government needed to negotiate drug pricing.  The comments came with drug executives and investors gathered in San Francisco, at one of the largest industry conferences of the year. Up until Trump took the lectern, the tone of the conference was optimistic. News of takeovers and partnerships early in the week had stocks rising. That's not happening anymore. The index dropped 3% on Wednesday and continues to fall Thursday. Google Finance The chill this cast among executives at the JPMorgan Healthcare conference was palpable Wednesday. Those, both with drugs on the market and that have drugs in development, said the concern is that Trump will scare investors away from the industry. If investors start to shy away from investing in risky new medicine, that could keep treatments from making it all the way through the drug development process, they said.  And the "murder" comment hit a nerve for those in an industry that's all about trying to find new ways to improve people's health. Some took to Twitter. We are trying to save lives, not extinguish them. And against very steep odds. Many easier ways to make a living. Like running dad's biz. — Michael Gilman (@michael_gilman) January 11, 2017 Ultimately, we want same thing as PEOTUS 1) supportive enviro 4 innovation 2) pt access & affordability of Rx 3) smart people w good US jobs — Brent Saunders (@brentlsaunders) January 11, 2017 The drug industry is saving lives not getting away with murder. Drug pricing abuses need to be fixed, but that's a shameless soundbite. — Brad Loncar (@bradloncar) January 11, 2017 Boiling down a complex topic into a sound bite Drug pricing has been a big topic at the conference this week, with executives from drugmakers to pharmacy benefits managers weighing in — and pointing the finger — over the issue.  And while Trump was able to contain his views on drug pricing to a few comments in a press conference, the reality is that drug pricing is a complex issue with a lot of players that all want a piece. It's something that companies have been discussing more frequently, pushing for transparency that could show just how much the list price might differ from the net price that companies receive after rebates. "Any Band-Aid that's focused on a single part of that process I don't believe will be helpful in the long run," Gene Kinney CEO of Prothena Biosciences, a company focusing on protein immunotherapy told Business Insider Wednesday. "What we need is a comprehensive solution. I don't feel like that dialogue is quite to the point where it needs to be yet." Whether Trump is going to take his commentary beyond the soundbites remains to be seen.  SEE ALSO: There's something missing from one of the largest healthcare investor meetings of the year DON'T MISS: The biggest healthcare investor conference starts this week — here are the 5 things we expect to get out of it NOW WATCH: These are the secretive 18-wheelers the US government uses to transport nukes on America's roads Loading video...

Bloomberg News reports that Richard Usher, formerly of JPMorgan Chase, Rohan Ramchandani, who used to work for Citigroup, and ex-Barclays trader Chris Ashton were indicted Tuesday, accused of conspiring to manipulate the foreign-exchange market. They are likely to be extradited unless they surrender voluntarily, a stark contrast to other European nations, including Germany. The men haven’t received a formal extradition request but should be certain that one is on its way, according to Roger Burlingame, a former white-collar department head at the U.S. prosecutor. The possibility of a protracted extradition fight won’t deter the Department of Justice, he said. "The hope that the DOJ would give up on the case ended with the indictment," said Burlingame, a London-based lawyer who advised Navinder Sarao, a British trader extradited to the U.S. last year.

See Offers Business Posted January 11 increase font size Pressed for cash: Many companies live on the edge without adequate reserves But having a healthy buffer for revenue disruptions is crucial to survival for the businesses on the margins. Associated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — When Rafael Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. “Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it’s not really your money till you pay your taxes,” says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. “At the end of the year it disappeared, and we started the new year completely strapped.” After paying his company's taxes, Weberous Web Design CEO Rafael Romis had to dip into his personal savings to restore cash reserves. Associated Press/Jae C. Hong Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous’ cash reserves. “Cash is king” is an axiom that business owners try to live by. If revenue isn’t coming in, and owners can’t get loans or investors, there’s no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they’d have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It’s especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers – particularly if the customer is a government. “They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy,” Solomon says. Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50 percent drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, when massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. The Hidden Boston website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared with 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small-business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he’s willing to take on smaller projects – ones that will bring in $8,500 compared with $10,000 for his company’s more typical jobs – to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took a $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company’s busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20 percent of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company’s cash position. “If everything went south, we’d probably have enough cash for two or three months,” he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They’ve given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They’ve also gotten better terms from lenders. Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that’s a sign of trouble to Basilo – they’re not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. “That’s how they think when they start their business. They’re very unprepared,” he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores’ down time, and when they need new equipment they rely on their franchisor’s ability to negotiate better prices. While they do have savings, they don’t want to tap them for cash flow. “We pretend that the savings don’t exist,” Dan Robinson says. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

She’ll work closely with both Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, arguably the two most powerful people in the president-elect’s orbit. According to people familiar with the relationship, Ivanka Trump reached out to Powell after the election and the pair quickly developed a rapport. Powell was impressed by the depth and seriousness of the incoming first-daughter’s questions and follow up on women-owned businesses and other economic issues. Story Continued Below Powell is also close to former Goldman president Gary Cohn, the incoming chair of the National Economic Council. Cohn came into Trump's circle through his relationship with Kushner. Keep an eye on the Cohn-Powell-Ivanka Trump-Kushner power circle. Ton of juice right there. HAPPY DEMS/WALL STREET TYPES — Powell’s decision to join the White House sparked a jolt of happiness among both Democrats and more establishment-minded Republicans worried both about Trump’s economic policies and their own lack of connections to the new administration. Now in addition to Cohn, there is another familiar voice for these people to turn to in the West Wing. Here’s what former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told me about Powell: “Dina is one of the most capable people I know. She is creative and committed. She did crucial work for me at the State Department where we were trying to be more effective in outreach to the Muslim world and to empower women. Because of her own background as a woman of Egyptian descent she was a cultural ambassador — absolutely an essential member of my team.” Read more.

However, I believe we need to ensure that the help we provide families is efficient and effective. It cannot, and should not, trap people in an intergenerational cycle of poverty. On mortgages: “With the Fed raising rates recently, mortgages are likely to get more expensive. Loans are now bifurcated: the well-off have their pick of loans and lenders while many others without solid credit or stable incomes are locked out — one of the reasons the economic recovery was slower than many would have liked. … We need to make sure HUD and FHA are fulfilling their missions to help people build up an asset, like a home.” ICYMI: DEMS UNITE BEHIND CORDRAY — Nearly every Dem on the House Financial Services Committee signed a letter supporting CFPB Director Richard Cordray, pushing back hard on GOP calls for Trump to fire him. Read it. SPEAKING OF THE CFPB — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “Former Rep. Randy Neugebauer, who while in office joked about becoming the next CFPB director, met with … Trump [Wednesday]. The Texas Republican declined to say whether they talked about making his wisecrack a reality. ‘We discussed ideas about how to ensure consumers have access to credit and innovative financial product choices,’ Neugebauer said. “While in Congress, Neugebauer made light of one day running the CFPB as he tried to pitch doing away with the bureau's director and installing a bipartisan commission. In a recent interview with POLITICO, Neugebauer said he was selling his Lubbock, Texas, home and planned to keep a house in Washington. He said it would make it easier to visit family.” Read more. MNUCHIN TO DIVEST — More from Zach: “Treasury secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin plans to divest interests in major financial institutions including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Blackstone within 90 days of his confirmation, according to an ethics agreement … The list includes positions in AT&T, Berkshire Hathaway, CIT Group, Comcast, General Electric, IBM, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Microsoft and Verizon. Mnuchin served on CIT's board. “In addition, Mnuchin plans to divest holdings in John Paulson's Paulson Advantage LP. Paulson has invested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shares, a bet that Congress eventually will reward shareholders by recapitalizing the mortgage giants and putting them back in business. Upon confirmation, Mnuchin said he would resign from positions at hedge fund Dune Capital Management and at several trusts.” Read more. MNUCHIN’S TAX HAVEN? — POLITICO’s Bernie Becker: “Mnuchin … managed a company that was located in Anguilla, an island that some consider a tax haven, according to a financial disclosure released today. Dune Capital Partners LLC, according to the disclosure, ‘is an Anguilla company treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes,’ with a primary office in New York. Anguilla, a British territory in the Caribbean, doesn't charge income taxes on either individuals or corporations.” Read more. Mnuchin’s full OGE form is here and the ethics agreement is here. LEFT REACTS — Via Allied Progress’s Karl Frisch: “According to these disclosures, Steven Mnuchin recently pocketed another $40 million from OneWest, the scandal-plagued foreclosure mill of a bank that he once ran and that has been accused of fraud and deceptive practices too many times to count.” FIRST LOOK: GROUPS PUSH AGAINST ONLINE GAMBLING BAN — Per release out Thursday: “A coalition of eight groups led by the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute on Thursday urged Vice President-Elect Mike Pence and U.S. Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions to reject calls to ban online gambling using a pre-Internet 1961 law. The issue was raised on Wednesday … by Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) during the Senate confirmation hearing for Sessions.” Letter. COULD TRUMP SPEED STIMULUS? — Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “As far as we can tell, most forecasters expect the impact of fiscal stimulus this year to be gradual … But the new President does not strike us as a patient man, and we think he will push hard for the fiscal easing to be structured so as to provide instant gratification, both for himself and the public. “That's very hard to achieve through changes in income tax rates, personal and corporate, but past experience shows how money can be put into peoples' hands very quickly. First, the Trump administration could copy the actions of George W. Bush, by sending all taxpayers a check in the mail … Alternatively, Mr. Trump could propose that Congress copies the Obama administration's time-limited cut in payroll taxes, which could be implemented by employers almost immediately.” SPEAKING OF STIMULUS — Reuters’ BreakingViews’ Richard Beales has a deep dive on the Ross-Navarro infrastructure plan here. TRUMP PRESSER REWIND — You can find plenty of coverage of the crazy Russia stuff elsewhere (read a great NYT reconstruction of the whole mess here). But one segment of Trump’s big press conference jumped out at MM. It was this: “There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. “And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. And you’d have millions more workers right now in the United States that are — 96 million really wanting a job and they can’t get. You know that story. The real number — that’s the real number.” As CNBC’s Steve Liesman notes here, that’s just not correct. That 96 million figure represents all Americans 16 and over not in the labor force. But the vast majority of these people are not looking for a job. They are retired people, sick people, stay-at-home moms and dads and students. The number who say they want a job and can’t get it is just 5.4 million. So Trump is off by 90 million. This is not just a an academic exercise. You can’t get economic policy right if you get the numbers totally wrong. GOOD THURSDAY MORNING — Email me on bwhite@politico.com and follow me on Twitter @morningmoneyben.

Follow @FinTechIdeas and checkout the livestream on CNBC.com for the latest out of the Festival in San Francisco. http://bit.ly/FinTechIdeas ** TRUMP WON’T SELL — POLITICO’s Josh Dawsey and Darren Samuelsohn: “Trump will not sell his business nor place his assets in a blind trust while serving as president, the president-elect and lawyers involved in the negotiations said Wednesday during his long-awaited news conference. Instead, Trump’s company will not enter into new foreign deals and will appoint an ethics adviser who must approve any new domestic deals in writing … “The lawyers also promised that Trump’s businesses and assets will be put into a trust for the duration of the presidency and added he will have ‘no involvement whatsoever’ in the businesses. Trump had terminated ‘all pending deals’ and would impose ‘severe new restrictions’ on new deals in the United States. As previously said, his two oldest adult sons will manage the company, with the help of a longtime executive of the Trump Organization.” OGE HEAD BLASTS THE ARRANGEMENT — POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein: “The top ethics policy official in the federal government is savaging … Trump's plan to address conflicts of interests involving his business holdings, calling the arrangement ‘meaningless from a conflicts of interest perspective.’ … Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub referred to a POLITICO report last month that Trump aides' were mulling a ‘half-blind’ trust to hold assets belonging to Trump or his advisers. “‘The idea of setting up a trust to run his operating businesses adds nothing to the equation,’ Shaub said in remarks at the Brookings Institution. ‘This is not a blind trust. It’s not even close. I think POLITICO called this a ‘half-blind’ trust, but it’s not even halfway blind. The only thing it has in common with a blind trust is the label: trust.’ ‘The plan does not comport with the tradition of our presidents over the last 40 years,’ Shaub added.” Read more. WELLS SENATE WOES — FT’s Ben McLannahan: “On Wednesday a group of Democrats on the Senate banking committee wrote a letter to Tim Sloan, the bank’s chairman and chief executive, asking him to explain whether the bank’s recent surge in income from overdraft charges had any connection to the furore over its fraudulent sales practices. Last autumn Wells paid a record $185m fine and shook up its senior management, having admitted that it allowed managers to create up to 2m accounts without customers’ permission. “The letter — signed by seven senators including Sherrod Brown from Ohio and Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts — was prompted by a Financial Times story last week, in which the FT noted that overdraft income at Wells rose 7.5 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, to $471m. That was more than five times the average 1.3 per cent increase at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, TD Bank and US Bank, which round out the big five fee-earners from overdrafts in absolute terms.” Read more. JPM DINGED ON WHISTLE-BLOWER — NYT’s Nathaniel Popper: “JPMorgan Chase inappropriately retaliated against a former employee who raised questions about the bank’s sales tactics and investment products, the Labor Department found. “The bank was ordered to pay back wages and damages to Johnny Burris, a former broker at one of its Arizona branches. A letter released on Tuesday by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a division of the department, said that JPMorgan had violated provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley law designed to protect whistle-blowers.” Read more. PETER THIEL IS … ODD — NYT’s Maureen Dowd: “‘Everyone says Trump is going to change everything way too much,’ says the famed venture capitalist, contrarian and member of the Trump transition team. ‘Well, maybe Trump is going to change everything way too little. That seems like the much more plausible risk to me.’ Mr. Thiel is comfortable being a walking oxymoron: He is driven to save the world from the apocalypse. Yet he helped boost the man regarded by many as a danger to the planet. “‘The election had an apocalyptic feel to it,’ says Mr. Thiel, wearing a gray Zegna suit and sipping white wine in a red leather booth at the Monkey Bar in Manhattan. ‘There was a way in which Trump was funny, so you could be apocalyptic and funny at the same time. It’s a strange combination, but it’s somehow very powerful psychologically.’” Read more. SAMSUNG GRILLED — WSJ’s Eun-Young Jeong and Jonathan Cheng: “The third-generation heir of South Korea’s Samsung conglomerate is being questioned Thursday in relation to suspected bribery, prosecutors said, drawing the country’s biggest and most powerful business group deeper into an unfolding political scandal that has led to the impeachment of the president. “The special prosecutors’ office also called on lawmakers to report Mr. Lee for allegedly lying under oath while testifying last month at a legislative hearing on the corruption scandal. Special prosecutors would then be able to investigate charges of perjury, according to Hong Jung-seok, another spokesman for the special prosecutors.” Read more. MANDATORY REFORM AT VW — Reuters’ David Shepardson: “Volkswagen AG, as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. regulators, on Wednesday agreed to sweeping reforms, new audits and oversight by an independent monitor for three years to resolve diesel emissions cheating investigations. “Under the settlement of charges it installed secret software in U.S. vehicles to allow them to emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution, the German automaker agreed to change the way it operates in the United States and other countries.” Read more. PESO PLUMMETS — Reuters reports: “The Mexican peso weakened to a historic low of 22.04 per dollar and the country's stock index fell on Wednesday, after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump warned U.S. auto companies would face a high tax for products made south of the border. “Speaking at a news conference in New York, Trump also reiterated that the United States would start building a southern border wall after he took office next week. He said Mexico would reimburse the cost either through a tax or a payment.” Read more. ICAHN AT ODDS WITH BIZ GROUPS — POLITICO’s Patrick Temple-West: “Carl Icahn is bringing his crusade for shareholders' rights to … Trump's administration. And that's setting up a clash with powerful business groups — and House Republicans — that Trump's regulators may struggle to resolve. Icahn, who was appointed last month to be Trump's special adviser for overhauling regulations, is an activist investor, who has bought stakes in companies from AIG to Xerox to force changes in management. “And he wants to loosen [SEC] rules that he says give corporate managers a grip on power over shareholders. That puts the billionaire deregulatory czar at odds with the Chamber of Commerce, which represents 3 million businesses, and the Business Roundtable, which represents 196 CEOs. Both groups oppose changes to SEC rules for shareholder rights” LENDERS PRESS THEIR CASE — Via POLITICO’s Colin Wilhelm: “The Marketplace Lending Association — which was founded last year by fintech lenders Lending Club, Prosper, and Funding Circle — has sent a letter to the presidential transition team and Congressional leadership asking for legislation to overturn the result of a recent court ruling that cast doubt on the legality of some of the personal loans made by the companies. “[W]e look forward to working with your Administration, Congress, and other stakeholders to provide greater certainty for all market participants by reaffirming longstanding legal precedent and market practice,” writes Nat Hoopes, executive director of the MLA, in a reference to a legal case concerning a debt collector that has had ripple effects on consumer loans offered by nonbanks” ** A message from Financial Services Roundtable: The Financial Services Roundtable (FSR) is leading the charge on FinTech policy and collaboration. This week in San Francisco, we’re bringing together CEOs from finance and technology to envision long-term, big ideas in artificial intelligence, the internet of things, big data, tomorrow’s workforce, financial inclusion, biometrics, cybersecurity and others that will impact the way consumers interact with their finances.

He previously worked at Reuters and Forbes. Follow @LionelRALaurent Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Jan 12, 2017 7:43 AM EST It's starting to look like banks are running out of coping mechanisms for Brexit. Vote in favor of leaving the EU 52% The U.K.'s vote to leave the EU was initially seen as the sum of all fears for global finance. Yet it has been a squib so damp in terms of real economic impact that it prompted the Bank of England's chief economist to compare his warnings to a gaffe-prone weatherman's. Donald Trump's election and a lift in bank shares have only served to drown out the scare stories. With British financiers now dropping their demand to keep an easy-access passport into the EU, it looks like bankers are some way down the road to accepting Brexit. It will become a new regulatory burden -- costing time and money -- rather than an industry crisis. Using the well-worn framework of the five stages of grief, here's how we got here. Denial In the wake of the vote, JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon questioned whether Brexit really needed to happen at all. "Maybe you can even reverse [it]," he told an Italian newspaper in July. Unsurprisingly, banks quickly overcame this stage. Anger Old competitive wounds were reopened after the vote. French President Francois Hollande warned the U.K. would lose its euro clearing business. France's finance lobby called for U.K. firms to lose their passporting rights. That prompted some U.K. ministers to play down the threat Brexit posed to the City of London -- but it wasn't so useful in inspiring mass indignation about the vote to leave. Bargaining The grand bargain proffered by lobbyists has so far been about protecting U.K. jobs and lucrative tax receipts in exchange for some kind of transitional deal or trade arrangement to preserve access to the single market. The numbers of jobs under threat have veered from a modest 1,000 HSBC Holdings Plc bankers going to Paris to a Biblical exodus of 100,000 people if clearing goes. Getting Over Brexit European bank shares have rebounded from the U.K. vote to leave Europe and outperformed the market Source: Bloomberg But their warnings have fallen on deaf ears, with financial markets rebounding since the vote and the U.K. economy remaining in fine fettle (just don't mention the pound). And there's been widespread scepticism that so many bankers would really want, or be able, to move to Paris and Frankfurt. Depression In a report on Thursday, lobby group TheCityUK dropped its demand to keep easy access to the single market through passporting. Instead, it talked up the value of equivalence, an untested and flawed legal status. While better than nothing, equivalence is still likely to raise political hackles given it will be decided by EU regulators and will probably require firms to jump through more hoops than they expect. It's a reasonable lobbying gambit, but it suggests bankers are losing hope for a flag-flying victory arrangement. Equivalence has always been a fall-back. Acceptance The contours of Brexit are still largely unknowable. But it's likely to require banks to keep doing what they're already under pressure from investors to do: Cut costs, improve profitability and find business models that work. A Cost, Not A Crisis Brexit will be another headache for investment-bank profitability rather than an existential shock Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Studies by Citigroup Inc. and Moody's suggest that the loss of passporting would be manageable -- though certainly negative -- for most big international banks. It would be a costly distraction for management and would likely lead to trapped capital, higher operating costs and erosion of already low returns on equity. For London's bankers, grieving over the result, lobbying can only do much. The best defense against Brexit turmoil is profit.
